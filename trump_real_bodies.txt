Exhibition of the weekRobert RauschenbergThe hungry genius of Rauschenberg embraced everything from the space race to Dante’s Inferno – often in the same work. His neo-dada art of assemblage, collage and montage is still very much alive in 21st-century art. At an anxious time in US history, the creative abundance of one of its greatest artists is a reminder of its democratic culture at its inclusive best. • Tate Modern, London, 1 December-2 April.Also showingPainters’ PaintersMartin Maloney, Dexter Dalwood and Bjarne Melgaard, Ryan Mosley and David Salle are among the stars of this provocative survey of contemporary painting.• Saatchi Gallery, London, 30 November-28 February.Andy WarholKing Death returns in a show from the admirable Artist Rooms collection that includes Warhol’s Self Portrait With Skull as well as some of his terrifying Electric Chairs.• The Whitworth, Manchester, until 16 April.Victor PasmorePasmore’s abstract art is compared with his figurative work in a close look at an important British modernist of the mid-20th century.• Djanogly Gallery, Nottingham, 26 November-19 February.Magnus PlessenErnst Friedrich’s shocking 1924 book of first world war photographs called War Against War has inspired Plessen’s incongruously beautiful new paintings.• White Cube Mason’s Yard, London, until 14 January.Masterpiece of the weekThe Townley Discobolus, second-century AD copy of Myron’s fifth-century BC original      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The Townley Discobolus. Photograph: Trustees of the British MuseumThis version of one of the most famous artistic masterpiece of ancient Greece was excavated in 1791 at the villa of the Roman emperor Hadrian. It was restored and sold to the British collector Charles Townley, but he was suspicious that it had been dishonestly restored. He was right: the head comes from a different statue and faces the wrong way, making this a masterpiece not so much of Greek art as of 18th-century neo-classicism.• British Museum, London.Image of the week      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Bouquet of Tulips by Jeff Koons. Photograph: Jeff Koons via NormontartproductionJeff Koons, the US pop artist known for his balloon dogs and other kitsch sculptures, has donated this monumental sculpture to Paris to commemorate the terror attacks of November 2015.
