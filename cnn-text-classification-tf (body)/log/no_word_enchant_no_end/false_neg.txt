trump the family plead for the white house to save him the drama is dominating the news networks a media storm what will trump nobody has a clue trump lacks military experience he has never served in the armed forces nor does he have any background in diplomacy what trump does by all is a short fuse a tendency to shoot first and ask questions later his predecessors would have played for appealed

accusations of and determined not to show it is easy to imagine trump making a hasty and disastrous call with a few translated into trump could not only lose the he could plunge the us inextricably

local are becoming more likely as the endgame in the fight against the caliphate battle is being fought out on two main fronts one is the siege of northern principal city trump has the conduct of the which involves the mainly and militias backed by us special forces commandos but he has not offered an alternative the same holds true of the attempt to seize the headquarters in in northern trump says that defeating terrorism is a top priority and he will the shit out of but including appears to know what this means in practice if the battle goes will he will he cities where millions of civilians is he prepared to deploy us ground what will he do as seems both sieges become bogged or begins daily executions of is also silent about significant military intervention in and and its parallel fight with the president wants two things from an end to us support for the and the extradition of a cleric exiled in the us who he blames for last failed coup with on the back foot and the

rupture with but a reset will come with a price in the first authoritarian will want a relaxation or scrapping of punitive sanctions imposed after annexed in to dismay in trump has suggested he may also seems likely to get his way in where forces have pushed his to the brink of victory in and elsewhere trump has made no serious objection to actions in even though the says they may constitute war crimes he seems content to have remain in or even to treat him as an the renewed use of chemical for new or a suddenly escalating humanitarian and refugee catastrophe could all trigger a new crisis that blows up in forcing him to move against the idea of zones and civilian safe havens still has backers if trump goes down this he could end up directly confronting allies cannot do much about insouciance but they will strongly oppose him if he tries to run down the as he has suggested pressure on easternmost members in the and in terms of political missile deployments and military exercises is reaching new heights and operations are increasingly reported in and elsewhere in the eastern remains a ticking any of these could ignite at any time in first governments want to present a united front but trump seems more interested in buying off by acquiescing in reclamation of former cold war spheres of influence disdain for the he loudly applauded vote to leave and critical

nationalist feeling in china is periodically whipped up by the communist party if trump blunders into this delicate or deliberately tries to push the the fallout could be terms of as a trap for an

nails it my wife and i have just returned from across for six weeks we looked for election signs all the way the only trump sign we saw was on the trump tower he once owned in we saw one a damp print in a front yard in the lefty area of the night of the second we saw one sanders same same area we did see two feel the bumper stickers on a car at an surf beach this was the only bumper sticker we began in across the and west to we through to st then through central up into then to across and to where i mailed my absentee ballot yet most significant was what we never the word republican nor the word anywhere on any sign or poster everywhere we saw posters and signs for candidates for the for state senators and and sheriffs all avoided listing their much attention has been focused on the timing of chief letter to congress saying his agency is investigating more emails potentially related to he chose to issue the letter just days before the hotly contested election but it is the scheduling that reveals the letter to be political released as it was on a afternoon that timing guaranteed no new information would be revealed at least until giving speculation and hyperbole a head start on the facts and it teed up the issue for the influential morning political that timing is a colleen burns when was running against for the democratic the popular narrative first female president versus first president excessive personality triggered a different about two maniacs running for president the fact that some of the original narrative has been lost that a week away from potentially seeing the first female president of the united states is a shame i follow politics but seeing the us elect a female president is an important and exciting sign of progress that seems to have been lost in the elections
a wealthy republican whom j trump selected on as the next secretary of has spent her career promoting a privatized vision of public education if she pursues that agenda in her new she is quite likely to face disappointment and frustration school reforms generally come in two vouchers and charter schools they differ in both structure and political orientation charter schools are public open to accountable in varying degrees to public and usually run by nonprofit organizations by allow students to attend any public or including those run by religious organizations and companies while charters enjoy support from most republicans and some vouchers have a narrower political those who tend to favor free markets to replace many government responsibilities working primarily in ms has been a strong advocate of and her charter work has often focused on making charter schools as private as possible the large majority of charters are run by in contrast with most states the family donated more than million to republican lawmakers earlier this year during a successful effort to oppose new oversight of charters that support made ms a natural choice for who proposed a billion federal voucher program on the campaign and has likened the public school system to a monopoly business that needs to be broken up but any effort to promote vouchers from will run up against the basic structures of education the united states spends over billion a year on public schools less than percent of that money comes from the federal and it is almost exclusively dedicated to specific populations of most notably students with disabilities and students in communities there are no existing federal funds that can easily be turned into vouchers large enough to pay for school tuition on the open market billion proposal would by very expensive it may be hard to fit into a budget passed by a republican congress that has pledged to enact large tax cuts for corporations and expand the military and eliminate the budget all at the same time yet billion nearly enough to finance vouchers which is why proposal assumes that states will kick in another billion states have that kind of money lying around the only plausible source is existing school funding but even if ms were to find a willing governor and state not that easy roughly half of all education funding comes from local property taxes raised by over local school districts they and their elected representatives will have a too this is where the intersection of geography and politics makes any national voucher plan much more difficult to enact the practicality of school choice is highly related to population density children need to be able to get from home to school and back again every day in a large metropolis with public there could be dozens of schools within reasonable travel distance of most families in a small town or rural there will be few or none and population as saw in the last is increasingly the dividing line of the politics a significant number of most ardent supporters live in sparsely populated areas where school choice is logistically unlikely at the same many of the municipalities where market reforms are theoretically much easier to put in voted overwhelmingly against the on election voters in liberal rejected a ballot measure by a margin that would have increased the number of charter schools in the despite strong evidence that the charters produce superior results for and minority schoolchildren in information technology offers a way around the population density problem virtual schools can be attended from anywhere with an connection colleges that have pocketed billions of dollars by offering courses are poised to make a comeback under the trump which is likely to roll back president efforts to regulate them but the federal government is a much larger financial contributor to colleges and universities than to and college students need an adult looking after them all day ms will probably be a boon to the relatively growing population of families that their children but most parents will still want their children in a school building during the taught by a not by a computer ms will also be hamstrung by the fact that her deregulated school choice philosophy has not been considered a resounding success in her home choice policies have led to a wild west of cutthroat competition and poor academic results while there is substantial academic literature on school vouchers and while debates continue between opposing camps of safe to say that vouchers have not produced the kind of large improvements in academic achievement that reformers originally promised

the decision to bar two elected lawmakers from taking up their seats marks the beginning of the end of hong once is the last refuge of the and today china has said that in hong patriotism is so vital that it trumps freedom of freedom of expression and freedom of which are all now completely preventing the two politicians from taking the government has opened the door to disqualify anyone from hong government if they are determined to not be loyal to sets a very dangerous precedent because china has now started to form a habit of ruling hong by decree rule of law has become nonexistent in hong and there is no telling how going to affect the confidence of foreign investors we have to plug the but nothing hong people can do and that explains all the resentment and frustration you now see in the the two activists who are targets of china wrath read according to the basic hong the power of interpretation is vested in but that sort of power should not be used lightly every policeman has the power to stop you in the street and haul you off to the station if acting but no one expects every policemen to do that lightly is abusing its loyalists in hong legislature will need to protect the integrity of the not allowed to say things like is not they worry these sentiments will spread to places like and western provinces with large populations of ethnic minorities and a history of chafing under yoke the government never promised two to or but that promise was made to hong that and the joint which sought to safeguard freedoms in the former is now completely shattered and has become irrelevant mandarins now behave exactly like the big brother in whatever and whenever they find something politically they will just change it and make it bend to their will the saga is merely an excuse to make sure hong will be reined in officials needed an issue and pounced at the first because in eyes hong has become uncontrollable and especially after the umbrella is a very frightening trend that shows will interpret hong laws any time it wants anytime they feel parts of the basic law are not up to their current standards of political they will change it and tell hong courts to move is not only a blow to our but also local courts as well what are our judges for if steps in whenever it talks about tomorrow it talks about and the day after it can talk about i have met some young people who have foreign passports who want to stay and fight for hong they have a safety net and can leave whenever they want very worried about the young who afford to leave and have no choice but to fight on against extremely difficult odds but we still need to because if we we will definitely never get what we

what is the worst thing about the the racist the the alleged the apparent refusal to accept democratic all these are bad enough but not the worst the worst thing about trump is that the man in the love to horrify ourselves with his and to see him as a monstrous the polar opposite of everything a society represents but he is nothing of the kind he is the distillation of all that we have been induced to desire and admire trump is so repulsive not because he offends our most basic but because he embodies personifies the traits promoted by the media and corporate worlds he affects to the worlds that created him he is the of power and image in a nation where extrinsic values are championed throughout public discourse his conspicuous and towering ego are in tune with the dominant narratives of our age the entire electoral process is stolen from the people before they even cast their the recipient of vast inherited wealth who markets himself as solely responsible for his good he is the man of our times the us apprentice show which he hosted tells the story of everything he is the little guy dragging himself up from the bottom through enterprise and skill none of this distinguishes him from the majority of the very whose entrepreneurial loyally projected by the clashes with their histories of huge government monopolies and his politics differ from those of the rest of the modern republican it is because he in some more liberal every for the republican trailblazers such as and is now a every virtue a vice encouraged by the corporate the republicans have been waging a assault on altruism and the decencies we owe to other people their gleeful stoving in of their cackling destruction of political safeguards and democratic their stomping on all that is generous and caring and cooperative in human have turned the party into a game of mortal scripted by trump invent the xenophobia and racism that infuse his did he invent his conspiracy theories about stolen elections and the criminality of his no they were there all along what is new and different about him is that he has streamlined these narratives into a virulent demagoguery but the opportunity has been building for all that was required was someone blunt and unscrupulous enough to take it the fourth us white can you single out trump for denying and deriding the key issues of our such as climate change almost all prominent republicans have been at it in across the four presidential not one question about climate change was asked even when politicians and journalists accept the it makes little difference if they avoid the subject like the fourth envisaged the united states constitution as representation tempered by competition between factions in the federalist written in he argued that large republics were better insulated from corruption than or as the greater number of citizens would make it difficult for unworthy candidates to with success the vicious arts by which elections are too often a large electorate would protect the system against oppressive interest groups politics on a grand scale would be more likely to select people of views and virtuous the us in common with many other nations now suffers the worst of both a large electorate dominated by a tiny faction instead of republics being as by secret wishes of an unjust and interested they are beholden to the wishes of an unjust and interested minority what could not have foreseen was the extent to which unconstrained campaign finance and a sophisticated lobbying industry would come to dominate an entire regardless of its warren is the us president we but have this time read every republican or who retains a trace element of there are three sitting in the breast pocket of corporate capital since the supreme court decided that there should be no effective limits on campaign to a lesser long candidates have been reduced to incapable of responding to those in need of incapable of regulating those in need of for fear of upsetting their in the us is so corrupted by money that it is no longer as democracy you can kick individual politicians out of but what do you do when the entire structure of politics is turn to the demagogue who rages into this political denouncing the forces he exemplifies the problem is as trump that the election will be stolen by ballot rigging it is that the entire electoral process is stolen from the people before they get anywhere near casting their votes when trump claims that the little guy is being screwed by the right the only problem is that he is the system twitter eleven women who have accused trump of sexual political constitution of the united states is as representation tempered by competition between factions the true constitution is plutocracy tempered by scandal in other all that impedes the absolute power of money is the occasional exposure of the excesses of the wealthy what distinguishes political career is until his scandals have done him no disgusts us where others use a dog he uses a klaxon we hate to hear his themes so clearly articulated but we know in our hearts that they suffuse the way the world is this story did not begin with it will not end with however badly he may lose the election he is a boorish and extremely dangerous man but those traits ensure that he is not an outsider but the perfect representation of his the caste that runs the global economy and governs our politics he is our stripped of its elections

the most assured media and peter whittle all got through the debate without difficulty there was no clear but equally nothing happened to challenge the view that will be most popular with members was but she sound much like a proper are two of the key news and the two in the disagreed over breaking point poster said she did not like i think it was but i like it i think it was insensitive and defended it the point behind that poster was absolutely correct we do need to get control of our borders and there is a deluge of people coming from the middle east and the idea of a common asylum policy certainly the right route to go down launching controversial breaking point poster during the referendum and whittle both sought to downplay the significance of the rise in hate crime after the vote asked about the if you look at the hate crime they did not go up substantially has been a slight rise but spoken to the police about this that happens after any national event this is nothing out of the ordinary the rise been that whittle said that hate crime had been going up anyway he the only point i would make is that in after the actually a huge amount of hate crime was more related to the terrorist attacks that were happening at the time all from me for for the comments says he would for some like killing children but it is policy to have a referendum on it if enough people call for says she is strongly opposed to one and always has and the case clinched it for says he would back the death penalty for people who kill and convicted for preying on children under the age of it the hustings is will post a summary entry was corrected on to more accurately reflect the views of the candidates says she would work with whoever says if he were he would probably vote for the libertarian candidate he does not like either trump or says one thing in is that he is not in says is with trump he thinks wrong whittle says is a there is an expansionist there but there is in the

is reasonable to check their ages said he recently went to his investigation was on he says many migrants there have sold their homes they spend or there are genuine he says he spoke to refugees but he thinks only three or four of them were genuinely fleeing for their says he has acres there his wife likes organic and they can grow their own food on their land says she would like him to stay

direct democracy into the says that is not the case she wrote the party manifesto you cannot make policy like he says that illustrates the problem she does not trust says the last time something like this was tried was when wrote its manifesto in he implies idea work says is the only party that has a blanket ban on anyone who has been a member of the joining just because you want to control immigration that does not make you a he says says she did not approve of the poster released during the campaign she tells the caller she has a beautiful voice says the media are partly to blame the media accuse of being racist and after the vote to genuine racists thought that people who voted to leave the were also racist the media needs to consider its he says whittle says the assembly has looked at this hate crime has been going up for some time he says and he says that the increase over the summer was linked to terrorist attacks taking place at the same says these people do not make that distinction says he is very sorry for what has happened to the female caller but he is not responsible is a great he says he says the government should repeal the communities says the hate crime figures did not go up after the referendum but both sides pushed the the a week says that poster was correct the does need to get control of its borders but he says nationals should not feel under

among the many asphyxiating gut punches delivered by his denigration of immigrants and pledge to deport them en stand out trump has now signaled that he will move to deport as many as three million immigrants after he takes and roll back executive action protecting more than undocumented immigrants brought to the united states as guesswork under way over the damage trump might from decimating what remains of the social safety net to trashing precarious efforts to curb global is chilling the promised attack on immigrants suggests we will see communities terrorized by what can only be fairly described as a police state received little attention is that trump would probably use tools developed by the bush and administrations to orchestrate mass deportations over the last the federal government has used local police and jails as a key tool to orchestrate mass deportations and precisely what trump plans to do on a more frightening scale than is secure now called the priority enforcement program it links an database comprising fingerprints entered by local law enforcement bodies to immigration and customs enforcement under secure communities made local arrests the key entry point to a deportation pipeline that removed million from the country another is authorized by bill but first implemented under which deputizes local police and jails to search out undocumented immigrants thanks to a strong immigrant rights curbed both to a limited in the case of secure heavily degree after overseeing mass deportations trump has clearly stated he will get rid of restrictions and embrace both programs with open the last two the political tied to wall street and indifferent to working has received a just share of blame for allowing trump to come to power when it comes to that blame is more well deserved than is widely understood for establishment leaders like bush and have attempted to placate rising on the right instead of confronting implementing immigration and border crackdowns instead of sating the hunger for the establishment has lent credence to their paranoiac fears over criminal immigrants rather than fighting their extreme policy the establishment built the right a monstrous deportation machinery that could now be used to utterly monstrous ends is how been used all what sounds so terrifying coming out of mouth today is not so different from what minus the brazen has articulated as policy in recent not families not children gang not a mom working hard to provide for her said in you meet the you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law if a be executive has failure to rein in national security policies hands trump a fully loaded to extend that analogy on has provided trump with fully loaded bullets and a army the immigration debate at the center of this election has at its core been utterly and his track record on immigration has been one that should have made trump proud he has orchestrated mass deportations the border patrol boasted more than agents in up from agents in and in there are miles of fencing along a heavily militarized border where human rights abuses are was a he was susceptible to pressure from an emboldened immigrants rights movement led by young people a movement that trump will be proud to include on his enemies list that movement won historic victories protecting the undocumented brought to this country as and another executive action protecting the parents of citizens the former could very well be overturned by trump the latter is held up in court thanks to an evenly divided supreme court thanks to electoral college win and republican will probably tilt right hard right once something that can do to help thwart trump and do penance for his own immigration sins in the after sending sharply and misleadingly conflicted told states and localities that sharing fingerprints with ice was essentially mandatory immigrant rights activists are campaigning for him to reverse course and make the program voluntary if does trump will have to explicitly make the program mandatory once again in order to implement mass deportations localities and states can sue in court to stop him administration has options to prevent a crisis of its own as the national day laborer organizing network put it in a memo sent to the white house on political bears responsibility for rise and should take action to limit the damage up to the who are now protesting about the coming trump presidency to make him do elections

despite fears that dementia rates were going to explode as the population grows older and and has more diabetes and high blood a large nationally representative survey has found the reverse dementia is actually on the wane and when people do get they get it at older and older ages previous studies found the same trend but involved much smaller and less diverse populations like the mostly white population of and residents of a few areas in england and wales the new study found that the dementia rate in and older fell by percent over to percent in from percent in that trend is significant and said a demographer at the university of who was not associated with the study in people received a diagnosis of dementia at an average age of in the average age was dementia rate is not said director of the national institute on aging can and that very good said john director of the division of behavioral and social research it he that a million and a half people aged and older who do not have dementia now would have had it if the rate in had been in director of scientific programs and outreach at the said the group had been encouraged by some of the previous research showing a decline but had also been little bit about drawing conclusions because the populations in the earlier studies were so homogeneous he said of the new is a nationally representative study wonderful an estimated four million to five million currently have dementia it remains the most expensive disease in a study funded by the national institute on aging estimated that in it cost up to billion a year to care for dementia surpassing heart disease and cancer the published by the journal internal included and older across all education and income who participate in the health and retirement which regularly surveys people and follows them as they age the national institute on aging funded the work but was not involved with the data analysis or interpretation to assess participants were among other to recall nouns immediately and after a to serially subtract seven from and to count backward from the test was based on extensive research indicating it was a good measure of memory and thinking skills participants also were asked about their education income and health in a the dementia decline might seem unexpected it occurred despite an increase in diabetes the diabetes prevalence among older surged to percent in from percent in it began to fall only very recently the study diabetes increased the risk of dementia by percent more older people today also have cardiovascular risk factors high levels of blood blood sugar and cholesterol which increase the risk of dementia but more are taking medications for those so perhaps better control of those risk factors played a role in the decline the findings about obesity were especially puzzling compared with people of normal overweight people and obese people had a percent lower risk of the study found underweight people had a risk times as great yet the obesity picture is muddled because other studies have found that obesity in middle age increases dementia risk in old age then there is the education question on older in had one more year of schooling than older in and years of education were associated with decreased dementia risk in this as in many others it is still not clear exactly why education would reduce the risk of dementia there is the cognitive reserve that education changes developing brains in a good making them more resistant to and that people with more education have brains that are better able to compensate for dementia damage but education also is linked to more wealth people with more education often live in environments that differ from those of people who have less and they tend to have better health over all they also are less likely to smoke as for black the dementia risk was but some possible reasons less less more cardiovascular risk factors did not fully explain the difference one possibility is that they received a poorer quality of so each year of it offered less protection from said the lead in the much of what is happening with dementia rates defies said a professor of medicine at the university of in who also works in the veterans affairs health care system there a professor of medicine at rush university medical center in urged caution in accepting the conclusion that dementia rates were declining if they in accepting the possible explanations although he had nothing but praise for the abilities of the he noted that such studies were extremely difficult to do deciding if a respondent is demented can easily be inadvertently he said very said but the decline is consistent with what seems to be a despite failure to find any effective way for individuals to protect themselves from the most common form of dementia estimates that compared with the rate in the early there has been a to percent decrease in dementia rates among older as for the that is hard to said even with the lower prevalence of there will be many more older people in the united states over the next few especially people age and who are at highest risk for that the total number of people with dementia should although not as much as had been estimated and there are forces acting against the continuation of the decline in dementia rates more people reaching age and above in the next few decades will have been obese in middle possibly increasing their risk of dementia in the trend toward more years of schooling seems to have leveled so the education effect might not be as much of a factor but researchers remain optimistic the study found noted the real he to see if we can generate evidence of what causes

the sporting excitement of the and games is now a distant and our attention has long since shifted back to the ups and downs of our own generally lives after such a lavish celebration of physical achievement it can be quite a but from a certain point of strange that the physical prowess of humanity should be cause for celebration at all by the standards of the rest of the animal performance is nothing to shout about is it not baffling that the athletic elite should receive such adulation when in the mental sphere that our species thinking neglects the enormous influence of the drive to move on the evolution of an influence that extends far deeper than the famous freeing of our hands and their opposable thumbs that occurred when our ancestors became bipeds the opposable thumb itself likely developed as an adaptation to safe movement in the trees tens of millions of years before our forebears hit the but more our psychology is still adapted for a life on the even in the least energetic among us understanding how may help us to live more joyful most psychological is surely the high a sense of and euphoria that can be engendered by endurance running these feelings used to be attributed to but we now know that chemicals called are largely responsible named after their resemblance to the active ingredient of are powerful that additionally cause the release of the dopamine in the is usually described as a whose evolutionary function is to give us an emotional hit when engaged in activities that are likely to improve our reproductive success the high makes perfect sense in this light our ancestors probably used a persistence hunting technique running after their prey for hours until it dropped from exhaustion as do some today a dopamine incentive was undoubtedly vital in maintaining the required for many of a high level of aerobic fitness is a necessary precondition of the high attempting a prolonged run without it causes a of lactic acid and the activation of our emergency emotional overrides long before the kick and we just feel grim there are gentler ways of using movement to get a dopamine recent years a range of techniques have been developed to find out exactly how emotional bribery works in animals cyclic uses electric currents delivered through electrodes inserted into the brain to measure changing dopamine concentrations over timescales the method of lets an experimenter tinker with an active dopamine by first infecting it with a genetically engineered virus that causes cells in its brain to become these cells can then be controlled with flashes of light in implanted optic both of these techniques were recently used by and colleagues at the university of to see how dopamine influences the of rats the rats in question were trained to carry out what was essentially a treasure a sequence of movements guided by visual and auditory which if followed correctly resulted in the delivery of food found that the dopamine concentration in the brain increased sharply every time a rat registered a cue and embarked on the next stage of the sequence if the dopamine concentration was artificially increased using optic the rats showed a greater propensity to begin the and learned the meaning of the cues more results tell us that role is more nuanced than was once thought rather than acting as a general it appears to be a specific motivator of encouraging an animal to work for what it wants but motion alone is not enough the correlation between dopamine release and the presentation of unexpected cues indicates that active exploration a pursuit with obvious adaptive value is the key stimulator of its upshot of all this is that you have to be a distance runner to experience the dopamine high walking will do as long as used to so full sensory engagement present moment awareness if you will is a must this will come as no surprise to engaged locomotion is what they do all the and many anthropologists have noted the emotional rewards they draw from their wanderings but in our world of cars and in which personal exploration on foot seems most of us seriously underestimate the pleasure that the simple act of movement might why not find the time to go for a wander every now and minus navigational technology and rigid destinations with soon discover that the ancient joy of motion is still very much ours for the
here are the main stories on article court plan to trigger by the end of march will not be derailed by a high court ruling that parliament must vote on the no has reaction on the continent to the high ruling on article has been with national governments and the commission regarding the decision as an internal alone has the power to trigger by notifying of the intention to leave the the high court has pound jumped on the news that negotiations over withdrawal from the union could be after the high court rejected government claims that it has the sole power to trigger article is the most important development in the story since the election of may as prime minister and easily the most encouraging day for those who backed remain since the referendum on posted vast amounts of commentary on this but here is what it means in six key the court ruling is much more definitive than anyone expected for green at the government is appealing to the supreme but informed commentators seem to think it more likely than not that the government will lose unless the government does win at the supreme parliament will get to legislate on invoking article and that means a proper passing through the commons and the with and peers getting the chance to amend it may has been refusing to give parliament a vote on the terms of once power shifts from the hands of the executive to the legislature the prime minister loses some control the key point about today is that and peers for the first got a strong chance of shaping the start of the the chances of being overturned are still very minimal it is just about possible to conceive how the could stay in the votes to insert a second referendum clause into the article and some economic catastrophe results in a sharp change in public opinion by but you would be unwise to bet on it most and peers who voted remain accept that the result of the referendum should be but the chances of being not have increased significantly there is a majority for a in parliament if there is a it will now have the chance to exercise there is now a real possibility that may will not be able to trigger article before the end of march the government says it still intends to meet this but the need to legislate could lead to a an early though by no means now does look more likely than it did this time all from me for today i had been intending to cover other but afraid this one took for the comments the votes of northern in the house of commons could prove critical if may and the government is forced to ask parliament to trigger article eight democratic unionist party are guaranteed to back in the commons given that they were the only major political force in the assembly to active back a leave vote in the position of the two ulster unionist tom and in south is interesting in leader mike called for a remain has now switched position and said its will back the government to allow for the referendum result to be implemented the party will argue this is because the entire electorate of the has spoken in the referendum and it is their duty to back up that outcome in the switch though may also be due to fears of being further outflanked by the especially given a number of recent defections from the to the democratic unionists in essence the is again moving to the right in order to slow down its decline vis a vis the three will definitely vote to block given that the party campaigned vigorously for remain and was involved in last failed legal action in the high court to declare null and void in northern will not vote in the commons because it boycotts the parliament although the party will come under fire accused of failing to add to the remain voices in the chamber that could scupper it is the votes of the unionist bloc that will prove far more critical if and when the referendum result is tested in the house of commons expect more demands from first minister foster for special treatment for northern farming subsidies for ulster agriculture for in order to bolster the numbers in a vote even one after a general election here is the on the court mp judicial these judges are politicians without accountability mp aided and abetted by seeking to tell electorate to sod a majority of voters now want to remain in the according to a the press association report but there was little sign that the

prime minister of japan is planning to sit down with j trump in new on in what would be the first meeting with a foreign leader since his election wants to find out how serious trump was during his campaign when he repeatedly criticized japan on trade issues and for not paying more of the cost of its own defense and since the establishment was expecting to win the wants to assure trump that he is willing and eager to work with him the prime minister is concerned about commitment to protecting japan the united states is most important and is legally obligated to defend it against attack there are around troops stationed in a powerful deterrent against the rising threat of north and an increasingly assertive china during the trump suggested he might withdraw troops not without resistance from members of officials at the state diplomats and military advisers the united alliance has been in place since the end of world war and has a lot of backing on both sides of the pacific ocean maybe there are signs that japan might be willing to pay or do but many experts contend troops are not only defending japan but the united own interests in the pentagon is budgeted to spend about billion to support troops and bases on and elsewhere around japan this year japan is set to spend billion to support the in addition to at least billion on related including compensation for the communities that host the bases and funds for relocating troops under its which was written by occupying forces after world war japan can keep an army for defensive purposes but has said he wants to revise the constitution and expand the military in his government requested the latest in a series of increases in military spending japan has committed to the nuclear nonproliferation and will probably remind trump of that on the campaign trump decried the cost of providing a nuclear umbrella to allies such as japan and south that do not have their own nuclear arms in trump told the new times that he was open to those countries building their own nuclear but on twitter this week he denied having said so has reaffirmed his commitment not to develop atomic weapons any move to do so would face severe public opposition in the only country that has suffered a nuclear attack he has been one of the biggest enthusiasts for the partnership or as it is known though japan was the last of a dozen pacific rim countries to join the sweeping trade pact trump repeatedly criticized the during the presidential campaign made politically painful concessions on agricultural imports to close the deal and get manufacturers access to export markets in the united states and elsewhere the trade partnership could bolster the limp economic growth rate in his country and serve as a counterweight to the superpower acknowledged after victory that the partnership was in a difficult but his government still plans to have parliament ratify the and he has not given up on selling it to trump may also seek to soften angry campaign in which he accused japan of crushing the united states on and manipulating its currency to gain an economic advantage trump says for free trade in but wants a for the united states what that for remains a mystery
so just when we thought that get any more it with a trump victory i told you last week that strange happenings were afoot in the what with the cubs winning the world series and all i hear that new yorkers are taking it pretty hard are people stocking up on canned greetings from the land of duck and not sure quite sunk in but foods and subterranean real estate are in demand and sounds like a hunting club so where shall we a little weary of the conversations get right to what do you think will happen trump will set up an administration the sun will rise in the east my dog will chase squirrels the world will go on glad to hear taking it well he stayed cautiously neutral in the but a very good boy i think you once made the point to me that there are no permanent victories or defeats in politics so perhaps a good place to start a conversation about the future been since i came to at the collective failure to understand that point it is patently true upon the most cursory inspection of recent history in democrats were popping champagne over the dawn of a permanent era of progressive politics now they see most of their dreams being unraveled and republicans celebrating today will sooner or later be miserable i made a things are looking better already both winners and losers who ignore this reality make silly unforced errors the losers err on the side of excessive like the classic threats to leave the country reader email has informed me way harder to leave the country than one might think we in all that much demand and the winners fail when they convince themselves that since victory is they can set an agenda that attracts no one from the other side looking at a president trump and a house and say we are in for a stretch of dumb things presidents generally get most of their big changes done in the first year or two president did that with health care his agenda was nothing compared to w who did everything from tax cuts to getting authorization for the invasion but was certainly a big lift it was also a central campaign promise i know you think it was a bad idea i think that strategy is enormously shortsighted i remember thinking when the democrats held the white house and both houses of congress in though they have it might be wise to give a little to bring some centrist republicans into some day the republicans might be in a position to reverse everything if they have zero political investment in and sure here we are my point is that of course a president should have a vision that matches his ideology why he got elected but i think it is impractical and imprudent to forgive me for another reference to is spinal turn it up to give on a few things where you have because someday going to need friends to protect the stuff you care about most the trump administration might learn from the outgoing horror at seeing some or all of repealed we part company here my perception of was of a democratic party willing to work on compromise legislation while the republicans just stalled there was no unified republican just a ton of people who wanted to be but kept changing their mind but the bottom line is that left behind the old congress now got guys who sleep in their offices and even talk to the other side at the house gym secretly a lot of them are actually but i take your point and another recommendation i would make to president make friends everyplace that was the magic golf with the same people every week since i have no prepared to look on the bright side for a while the republican hatred of is so great that even if had gotten elected it would have been really hard to get the necessary fixes through congress trump has promised and as of his interview something better that preserves the most popular parts of the program so see what he comes up with i know a big fan his agenda and agenda really do congress is set to have a big influence on the agenda over the next and and trump will figure out how to make their ideas jibe plan includes a health care replacement plan for it will actually do some of the things liberals really like getting more people covered i realize that very disappointing for progressives to see but not like it will be replaced by nothing this is one area where the product usually resemble the recipe i remember presidential candidate saying all health care negotiations could take place in on grab your crystal ball and give me a couple of other predictions seeing a big tax cut and huge spending on infrastructure repair followed by a stupendous rise in the national debt certainly true that neither party has been great at getting the deficit under control in my lifetime nobody calls his or her congressman and just do sit only one side adds to the deficit while simultaneously complaining too big but move on obviously cranky how any other how about the early the republican establishment seems to have as white house chief of staff but is going to be chief strategist which could mean anything to me is the kind of guy democrats should learn to live with they and going to be a republican white house but is a very bad dude who represents all the worst strands of racism and misogyny in the trump crowd who do you think will really have the it looks like both will be influential after watching the i find pair of appointments too surprising they signal that in as during his trump will seek to merge traditional republican politics with his unconventional

i read with interest your article republic of civil if president fails to the catholic church in the has been involved in moderating negotiations between the electoral the opposition and the political party the church withdrew because the talks failed to be many major opposition groups and civil society representatives were absent the catholic conference of episcopal bishops in stood with the people and urged politicians to renegotiate to ensure that presidential elections are held as soon as possible and that the current president does not stand for a third shuttle diplomacy has borne some fruit at the request of president earlier this month the catholic bishops consultations to enable talks with opposition and civil society groups the support over many years from the aid agency for church of civil and political has been vital fifty people have died standing up for their democratic rights and hundreds have faced human rights abuses our deepest hope is that the current unrest descend into civil our country has seen enough with six weeks left before president second and last mandate constitutionally expires on i write on behalf of rights and to call on the security council to focus its efforts on pushing for a credible and inclusive to defuse save lives and protect the gains made by the mission in the over the past years so the regional response mediated by the union special and backed by the southern development community and the international conference on the great lakes region at the great lakes summit in last month has failed to protect constitution or end the political crisis and waves of repression that have accompanied more than protesters were killed by security forces in a preliminary joint human rights office report found that protesters were shot not in their legs or arms but in their upper chests or head to orders may have been given over the past four opposition groups and protesters have been targeted across the country by security forces we condemn these acts those implicated must be held to and in the short term this must include sanctions to send a strong message to military and political than words are needed from the to prevent from descending into a street war between private army and the the security council must at this critical moment push for a process by which can cede power at the end of his mandate and a transitional government can be put in place until a new president is elected this is the only thing that could make a difference on the ground while responsibility for the current crisis rests with and members of his inner the security council has a moral obligation to prevent the deaths of hundreds more women and children the security visit to and its surrounding region this month is a opportunity to side with the people and support throughout there are national leaders military and economic power and amassing unseemly wealth while the vast majority of the people wallow in poverty dos and have between them been in power for years years each on in the where the dispossessed have just got rid of the the cannot get rid of their life who are also the supreme institutions of personally controlling the the the the civil service and the electoral commission the only recourse is taking up as the are threatening to do in the or taking a risky journey in search of a better life in as thousands of men women and children are doing every republic of the
the report on amber not actually reading the evidence held by south police on its operation at during the and the subsequent collapsed reflects the contempt and lack of respect that the government has had for the truth and justice campaign in her letter to the explaining her decision not to grant an independent public inquiry she am satisfied that policing today is now very different from how it was in i am of the view that in light of reforms and changes there would be very if lessons for the policing system today to be gleaned from reviewing the events and practices of but the actual detailed evidence accumulated by the campaign surely points to the contrary the acquittal of of the arrested by south police while defending their communities against racist shows that policing and police tactics have not changed at all there is surely now an even more urgent need for an inquiry into as well as policing in and strike
until as late as a joint diagnosis of autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was not permitted by the most influential psychiatric the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders the is an essential tool in psychiatry as it allows clinicians and researchers to use a standard framework for classifying mental disorders health insurance companies and drug regulation agencies also use the so its definition of what does or constitute a particular disorder can have consequences one of the reasons for the prohibition of a diagnosis of autism and was that the severity of autism placed it above in the diagnostic so the inattention that is normally present in autism did not seem to merit an additional diagnosis that was an odd state of as any clinician working in the field would be able to quote studies that point to anything from to of patients with autism also having more problematic still is the fact that patients with both sets of symptoms may respond poorly to standard treatments or have increased side effects the fifth edition of the opened the way for a more detailed look at this and just a year after the new guidelines were a consortium i am a part at the university in called published a paper which showed that autistic traits in participants could be predicted by complex interactions between and white matter volumes in the brain structures of the brains of participants in the study the which was found to be able to predict levels of autistic traits in is shown in red et ala more general finding from that work was that autistic traits were significantly raised in a curious result given that a diagnosis of clinical autism was an exclusion criterion for participation in the study raised levels of autistic traits in participants in the study reflect the fact that autism is a spectrum disorder distributed throughout the entire population research from last year shows that autistic traits are also much higher among scientists compared to the general population a paper i published at the of this month in the journal looking at scans from over participants in the project has moved on to examine in detail the brain structures involved in the overlap of and autism one structure in called the was able to predict the level of autistic traits in but similar to the earlier a complex interaction was shown to be at work with another the also influencing results both of these structures are located in a part of the called the that operates as a monitoring system for with the guiding the selection of goals and the updating the reward value depending on the outcome of an action with this kind of the plays a key role in and motivation the results showed that autistic traits were highest when there was a coupling of higher volume with lower volume the statistical tools used in the paper were devised and by a zoologist who has used similar models to study the transfer of information in flotillas of vultures as they their search space while scavenging for food the latest findings add to a growing body of evidence that suggests that problems in the reward circuits of the may lead to diminished motivation to attend to social such as a smile or a frown or a voice an earlier study in autistic children found a striking pattern of between areas of the temporal lobe and nodes of the reward pathway suggesting that autistic children may not find voices inherently interesting the first account of autism in the modern published by in noted that one patient not register any change of expression when spoken seminal paper contains many poignant descriptions of such as the case history of a who did not look at a face when spoken was rarely never played with children but instead moved among them a strange as one moves between the pieces of furniture in a a consistent thread in autism research has been the inconsistency of results some groups have shown a larger in autism while others have shown the opposite small sample sizes are partly to but another problem is that levels of in autism are often ignored this is a serious as the degree of present in autism can have a large impact on the results the latest publication in one goes some way to addressing these problems by drawing on a sample size of over participants and more importantly by looking at the subtle hinterland between the two disorders rather than separating them into binary units there are many debates about the usefulness of the since it first appeared in the first edition contained pages and diagnoses edition runs to over pages with almost leading to criticism from who was once the chairperson of a task that the handbook has led to the of of the population who may not have any serious mental health problems outside of this it cannot be denied that the has a large positive and on the way research is conducted but at least some of the changes to the fifth edition may lead to better clinical management of patients with both autism and from a research point of the fifth edition of the will certainly provide a better scientific framework for studying the overlap of these two disorders in more detail deficit hyperactivity

been three years since protesters gathered on the streets of to demand an end to a government they believed was no longer fit for demonstration triggered a chain of events that led to annexing and war in eastern thousands have been killed and million people as foreign policy interests shift to and the we have asked young how the past three years have been for and what they think the future i knew i had been ready for it all my i knew i had been ready for it all my life a solution to rotting more than million of us gathered in central square and together we felt strong enough to make a country where people would choose to joined the protests and spent day and night in the headquarters of the where it felt like the future of depended on whether our wooden shields would withstand the attacks of the government riot translated news into from the barricades and helped coordinate media efforts occasionally i would go home and sleep i opened my own to tell the story of what was happening i wanted to provide an alternative narrative for the one different from the press who branded us the and called us and three years i am left feeling that is treated as no more than a diplomatic pawn a country that has always been by both former soviet occupiers and modern global powers the western media also treats as an the that made relations with go sour but there are other stories to be like our citizens still having their rights oppressed and the daily information war we continue to fight with refuse to hate the people who want to separate from am originally from in eastern my mother is a native who speak and has never been to a city my father is a traditional and has vowed to be first in line to volunteer if an army if the rebels comes to town my town was speaking and i grew up feeling that and were two countries with a common and culture but after the war i am no longer able to understand the situation as is so much propaganda trying to pit one side against the but i refuse to hate the people who want to separate from the rest of the from the i understand not that they think is just that they believed their lives would be better in think one day we will be brothers and sisters again we most frequently misunderstood thing about relationship with is that one day we will be brothers and sisters city of witnessed a big tragedy on may when attacked a march i was on my way to a football match but i stopped by to see what going on i had a camera as i was running between the two stones and cocktails started to the corner of the main street in someone called me by name and i took a few steps towards him moments later a man was killed on the spot where i had been standing by the end of the the death toll had exceeded more than two years have passed and the official investigation cannot determine who was responsible for sparking the or why the authorities did nothing to stop it spreading journalists have tried to make sense of what as have independent but we still have official shows us that it is difficult for people recover from conflicts if there have been a large number of especially if those responsible have not been held to account but without how can we be and are seen as dictators who killed and are identical both bloody dictators who killed millions of and is a heavy user of these are two commonly held beliefs among who rely on sites for their i was a student we learned about the propaganda of and the soviet but such propaganda is now an everyday reality in my a native has recently retired from the merchant navy after years he used to listen to western rock music and travel the world now he believes and the terrible were great leaders who should have monuments erected in their i suggested was responsible for millions of he claimed that was a dictator has banned state on the basis of the disinformation and propaganda it promotes a move called a violation against freedom of speech but everything is available anyway my friend has just returned from the conflict in where he says no one only stuff from and the it feels likes is creating a fantasy narrative to destroy but for others a version of events they have come to believe as journalists often every situation can be seen as truth from one point of and a lie from the conflict has destroyed many families including soviet times it was popular to move from one republic to another so my uncles and aunts left to study in where they have lived for the past years the conflict has destroyed many including mine twitter family without personal mending ties with will not be easy war they came to visit every year they loved our country not now we stopped talking to them in after a few conversations where they would say things like can save you from we disagreed about and they came to regard their as the enemy my story is not and i know that one day we will have to forgive each other because without these personal any cooperation with will be very difficult we know is being a three cups of three but one is empty the third family a son or a has disappeared the eyes are full of pain this scene in was replicated outside the embassy in last month to draw attention to

they kill us and a new era in racial justice pp brown company kill us is a chronicle of black from brown in in the summer of through the police killings of sterling and in of this year the post reporter traces his own evolution from jaded metro reporter to documenter of the perils faced by young black men as they negotiate their place in a society that fears them and he poses the question of where the limits lie between a responsibility and a life lived daily in brown skin the book begins with account of the circumstances surrounding his along with that of a fellow in which instantly made him a national figure in his own right and the progression of his grim beat covering serial police shootings of black men across the united states he offers us a the stinging tear gas and militarized police response to the protests over the pathos and sense of futility surrounding the killing of the outrage over the shooting of in north and the riots that broke out after the death in custody of gray in the book ends with the student protests at the university of just miles from which resulted in the resignation of the college president following a historic protest by the star players on the football team the solemn march from death to from another death to another from racist outburst to protest forces the reader to live in the feedback loop of the black as each horrific milestone produces momentary outrage but seemingly little more along the we are introduced to a familiar cast of protest and as well as less nationally known activists like a key for the movement but maintains a distance from the emotional core of the now only occasionally does he give us glimpses into the personal toll of covering the deaths of people who look like him and his father and his college friends kill us offers a window onto the journalistic and the countervailing pressures to tell an important and awful story even while relationships with subjects deepen and the repetitive narrative of suffering grinds away at even the steeliest soul is unflinchingly honest about the journalistic temptation to seek false balance he describes grasping at a story of positive policing that turns out to be less than what it seemed he questions the tendency to put the dead on noting that portrait of the deceased is often used by the casual reader to decide if the tragic outcome that befell him or her could have happened to or if it was for someone innately criminal who behaved in a way we never and he recounts how his and other news organizations began to tally the grisly body count of deaths at the hands of police that the federal government had over decades of civic to calculate in doing asks why the burden of proving the inherent value of black lives is so frequently placed on the dead for those seeking a philosophical treatise on the of black death at the hands of or a recitation of the broader story of the civil rights struggle known as black lives kill us offers more questions than and little in the way of psychic comfort but perhaps the point the affliction of human misunderstanding and interracial fear that too often culminates in the death of a black man or woman at the hands of the police and that increasingly brings with it the looming threat of unrest and social upheaval has presented us with few answers and fewer concrete solutions is a skillful reporter and storyteller he takes the reader through the laborious task of reportage with a humanity and making this book more than just a catalog of tragedy he succinctly presents a story of human of mothers falling apart on streets stained with their teenage and somber as reporters file in and out of their homes or raging against the public show trials of their loved ones in the pages of newspapers and on cable when no trial of their killers will ever come to pass
j trump said on that he had no intention of pressing for an investigation into use of a private email server or the financial operations of her dropping the her pledge that became a rallying cry for his campaign for the white house who branded his rival and said she would go to jail if he were said in an interview with reporters and editors at the new times that he was no longer interested in pursuing in part because he wanted to heal the wounds of a divisive campaign want to hurt the i really trump said during the interview went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different and i am not looking to hurt them at all the campaign was his reversal on prosecuting was particularly striking given the outsize role the issue played during the presidential in which her use of a private email server as secretary of state became a prominent and one she has blamed for her loss to trump trump said he wanted to from the subject without he said that have people that do perhaps a reference to the or republicans who might continue to press for prosecutions in the email or foundation cases but the made clear that he would not seek to pursue an investigation himself nor make it a priority after he assumes office the decision angered some of his most fervent who immediately criticized his seeming change of heart blared the headline on a conservative news site that has strongly backed trump not something that i feel very strongly trump said at the unlike health care or immigration has been a very painful period of aides did not respond to a request for comment about remarks during their second trump turned to and i i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your because never been so many so much after turnaround on the conservative commentator one of his staunchest supporters during the suggested on twitter that trump was overstepping his role i thought we elected she wrote we make him the his job is to pick those not do their tom president of judicial a conservative advocacy group that has been a relentless critic of said on that it would be a mistake for trump to drop the threat of appointing a special counsel to look into her email use said that although the had already investigated the matter that inquiry was flawed his group has gained access to thousands of pages of state department emails through lawsuits and is pressing its case in court even after her defeat representative a republican who leads the house oversight and government reform said last week on fox news that his committee would continue to investigate the matter as well because got to get to the office said on he was unavailable for comment about statements although the email investigation is the agency still has an open inquiry into the foundation that inquiry began after the publication of a book by peter that asserted that some foreign entities had given money to the foundation in return for state department favors when was there the have denied the assertions the and justice department conduct their criminal investigations largely independently from the white so trump cannot tell agents to close their cases a president ordering the to stop a politically sensitive case would be a major scandal does seem like an extraordinary breach of protocol for him to get involved in that glen a a former federal prosecutor in new said of the know of no recent circumstances when the president ordered an attorney general not to pursue a criminal as trump were to order the b to close the foundation could choose to rebuff him directors are given terms to insulate them from political but the president still has the power to fire a as president bill did with s sessions in after a justice department investigation uncovered ethical abuses by sessions in an interview last week with trump said he had not yet decided whether to dismiss over his handling of the email saying the director have had very good reasons for doing what he as a practical remarks will probably have little impact the investigation into emails is already closed while the one into her foundation remains senior officials and career justice department officials have said there is little evidence justifying moving forward with a case when the case comes up for senior agents and prosecutors may decide to shut it but it will not be because of remarks while the decision is likely to frustrate investigators at the who are fiercely protective of their independence to follow the facts they some legal experts applauded decision to not pursue investigations into emails or her family foundation k a professor at the university of hastings college of the said he was inclined to support both moves by trump a decision to shut down an he not out of step with constitutional as the constitution gives the president the power to issue pardons for federal crimes

do you remember playing pretend when you were maybe you were a a dinosaur or a princess normal when and usually harmless most children know the difference between pretending to be a superhero and jumping off the roof thinking they can fly but adults often forget for we may stop pretending to be but a lot of us seem convinced that we can pretend to be investors dangerous pretend investors think that financial pornography is so the ticker tape scrolling across the television screen all day represents actionable information real investors know it might be like going to the but they would never make a decision because of it pretend investors think it makes perfect sense to change their investments based on what they hear in the a new so he like the federal so he criticized so buy bank real investors know that they make changes to their investments based on what happens in their own lives if their goals change or there is a fundamental change in their financial then they consider an alteration but they would never make a change based on someone yelling or on television pretend investors think they need to monitor their investments all the time the little supercomputer they carry around in their pockets makes it so easy real investors know that it takes a long time for a tree to and it will not help to dig it up to see if the roots are still there the same rule applies to investments and because watching things get big slowly is not very real investors tend not to talk about that tree all that much pretend investors talk about their investments a lot they say things long or short they use jargon that often does not make though it sounds kind of impressive if you listen too closely sometimes they cheer for things like increased consumer higher or in some war real investors understand the difference between the global economy and their personal economy and choose to focus on the latter pretend investors will worry endlessly about the news in some part of the world or the impact on their portfolio real investors focus on the things they can like saving a bit more next keeping their investment costs not paying fees unless necessary and managing their behavior by not buying high and selling again when prices are low pretend investors complain endlessly about volatility in the market and external actions that have impact on the big bets they have made on individual stocks real investors have enjoyed the benefits of a market that is up more than percent in the last years so ask yourself it finally time to stop pretending
seabirds are enticed into eating plastic debris because it smells like their according to study found that drifting plastic waste accumulates algae and gives off a smell very similar to the krill that many marine birds feed on the findings could explain why certain birds including albatrosses and which rely on their sense of smell for are particularly vulnerable to swallowing the lead author at the university of usually have a reason for the decisions they make if we want to truly understand why animals are eating plastic in the we have to think about how animals find rate of plastic pollution is steadily increasing with one study last year estimating that about eight million metric tons of plastic enough to cover every foot of coastline in the world is enters the oceans is known that birds and other marine including turtles and ingest plastic this can lead to damage to internal gut blockages or of chemicals from the plastics in the tissues previous studies have shown that some birds feed their young bits of waste presumably mistaking it for investigate what attracts birds to the scientists put beads made from the three most common types of plastic and polypropylene into the ocean at bay and bodega off the beads were sewn into mesh bags and tied to buoys to avoid any of them being eaten by weeks the beads were collected and the smell they gave off was at the institute for wine and food where scientists normal focus on the chemistry behind the and fragrance of plastic was found to give off a sulfur dimethyl sulfide linked to the algae which coated the floating plastic the same team had previously shown that is the chemical cue that triggers certain seabirds to forage for krill or as the scientists put it version of a dinner it is this cue that is being hijacked by the plastics in a second piece of using data from studies and the scientists showed that seabirds that track the scent of to find prey a group known as seabirds and which includes and are nearly six times more likely to eat plastic than other birds birds could be better protected in the scientists by creating plastics that do not accumulate algae as readily in the international marine officer at the royal society for the protection of research such as this is raising the alarm about plastics in our it is hard to realistically estimate the magnitude of the problem for seabirds at a global level seabirds are one of most threatened groups of birds in the but untangling the effects of multiple threats to seabirds is a one which underlines the importance of ongoing research such as this which helps determine vulnerability of different findings are published in the journal science
successive governments have reason to be proud of their achievements in the area of open data to remain there is a need to continue to invest and extend and develop marks the fourth open data institute annual summit at the in convening data innovators from around the world to share challenges and solutions at last minister called on the to be a critical friend for and bring the voice of data businesses and innovators to the cabinet year here are three areas where action by the government can help to support and promote a flourishing open data our data are used to thinking of areas like transport and energy requiring physical infrastructure from roads and rail networks to the national grid and power we understand that investment and management of these vital parts of an infrastructure are essential to the economic wellbeing and future prosperity of the is no less true of key data assets our data infrastructure is a core part of our national infrastructure from lists of legally constituted companies to the our data infrastructure needs to be in some cases built and in all cases made as widely available as the benefits to the economy and to reduce costs in delivery of public the data we rely on needs to be and as open as data infrastructure consists of data assets and the technology to share and use the that operate and maintain the processes by which they are and guides describing how to use and manage the data trustworthy data infrastructure is funded and managed so it can be used in ways that benefit infrastructure is simply there when we need it at the too much of our data infrastructure is inaccessible or only available if you can pay for access data innovators struggle to get hold of data and to work out how they can best use while individuals do not feel that they are in control of their we do have some excellent examples of infrastructure data from the likes of companies land ordnance survey and core parts of the data infrastructure that we need within the are or of a low quality the government must invest here just as it invests in our other traditional and promote data we are to make best use of we need a bridge between academic private and third and a thriving startup ecosystem where new ideas and approaches can have learned that properly targeted challenges could identify potential savings for government similar to prescribing an startup which used publicly available data to identify in prescriptions savings per year for the more translate that potential into procurable products and services that could deliver those data challenge series run at a larger funded by innovate openly contested and independently would stimulate the creation of new products and services it would also act as a forcing function to strengthen data infrastructure around key and raise awareness and capacity for those working to solve them the data needed to satisfy the challenges would have to be made available and bringing data innovation into government and bolstering the offer of the startups and who take in data order to take advantage of the data businesses and citizens need to understand how to make use of data in other they must become data literacy is needed through our whole educational system and society more generally policymakers are going to need to be informed by insights that can only be gleaned through understanding and data have to move the dial here it is an investment we cannot afford to shirk strengthening our data supporting and promoting innovation using that and investing in widespread data literacy will be the only way to succeed as a nation in the tech data
as the technology industry came to grips in the last week with the reality of a presidential election that did not go its many in silicon valley landed on the idea that widespread misinformation spread was a primary factor in the outcome on both and altered their advertising policies to explicitly prohibit sites that traffic in fake news from making money off lies very likely a worthwhile even if it comes too late the has loosened our collective grasp on the and efforts to fight that dismaying trend are obviously worth pursuing yet it would be a mistake to end this investigation at fake news in the dangers posed by fake news are just a symptom of a deeper truth now dawning on the with billions of people glued to and other popular social media has become an increasingly powerful cultural and political to the point that its effects are now beginning to alter the course of global events the election of j trump is perhaps the starkest illustration yet that across the social networks are helping to fundamentally rewire human society they have subsumed and gutted mainstream media they have undone traditional political advantages like and access to advertising and they are destabilizing and replacing institutions and established ways of doing including political transnational organizations and unspoken social prohibitions against blatant expressions of racism and xenophobia most because these services allow people to communicate with one another more they are helping to create surprisingly influential social organizations among groups these ad hoc social movements range widely in from white supremacists in the united states to in to in the middle east to the hacker collectives of eastern and but each in its own way is now wielding previously unthinkable resulting in sometimes destabilizing geopolitical spasms now have billions of people on the and most of them are not that happy with the status said the president of the a research firm that forecasts global risks think their local government is authoritarian they think on the wrong side of the establishment aggrieved by identity politics and a middle many factors accounted for economic anxiety in the industrial an inchoate desire for some kind of change in the national and some mix of latent xenophobia and sexism across the electorate but as even trump acknowledged in an interview with aired social media played a determining role in the race in the the concerns of supporters might have been and his candidacy would almost certainly have foundered after he was universally written off by just about every mainstream and he faced disadvantages in organization and access to traditional political expertise yet by putting out a message that resonated with people trump hacked through every established political order this new people are now empowered to express their grievances and to follow people they see as echoing their said it for social i see trump for people who like an predictable this is the scariest thing about not that it may be full of lies problem that could potentially be but that its scope gives it real power to change history in unpredictable ways but where we are time to start recognizing that social networks actually are becoming the forces that their boosters long promised they would be and to be rather than by the huge social changes they could uncork this should come as no surprise in a we are now living through a kind of version of the utopia that some in tech once envisioned would be unleashed by social media over much of the last we have seen progressive social movements powered by the web spring up across the world there was the green revolution in and the spring in the middle east and north in the united we saw the occupy wall street movement and the protests social networks also played a role in electoral politics first in the ultimately unsuccessful candidacy of dean in and then in the election of the first president in yet now those movements look like the prelude to a crackup in the global order in this organizing on played a major role in the push to get the country to leave the union in the a firebrand mayor who was vastly outspent by managed to marshal a huge army of supporters to help him win the presidency the state has used social networks to recruit from around the world to fight in and as well as to inspire terrorist attacks overseas and in the united both a socialist who ran for president as a and who was once reviled by most members of the party he now relied on movements to shatter the political status quo why is this all happening clay a professor at new university who has studied the effects of social suggested a few reasons one is the ubiquity of which has reached a truly epic scale last month the company reported that about billion people now log on to the service every month because social networks feed off the various permutations of interactions among they become strikingly more powerful as they grow with about a quarter of the population now on the possibilities are staggering the technology gets when the crazy social effects get said one of those social effects is what calls the of the a term coined by the researcher p to describe the range of subjects that the mainstream media deems publicly acceptable to discuss from about the early until the very recent it was usually considered unwise for politicians to court views deemed by most of society to be out of the things like overt calls to racial bias were of like the but the shifted that window was kept at bay because of pluralistic said person who was sitting in their basement yelling at the about immigrants or was willing to say white were more than other kinds of they know how many others shared their thanks to the now each person with views can
dear memories of old ale house upon reading that it had been closed temporarily over health code being dared to snarf down a big glob of the which cleared my sinuses in a matter of the shared bathroom for men and with stalls and urinals beside one servers carrying to glasses of ale at a time but one night stands out after a day of classes at new my roommate and i went to for our evening constitutional after quenching our we ready to return to our dorm as we walked down the street just a few steps from the a plainly dressed man was holding two other men against the wall of a building with a gun to their backs turning toward he asked that we go back to and tell the bartender to call that an officer needed assistance being new and slightly giddy from the we turned in synchronized form and walked back into the bar without a second thought we told the bartender there was a man outside holding a gun to the backs of two other men and asked if would he please call and report that an officer needed assistance the bartender picked up his rotary phone this was a while and dialed we left again as we walked past the plainclothes i we we strolled unevenly back to our dorm as sirens began to wail

are a lot more on my way home today i walked passed a patrol of armed and i was suddenly surprised by how normal that has become to me definitely become part of the scenery in and are part of a new at vocabulary along with national security alert levels in public places have been heightened and i think people and perhaps still a lot more wary about two months after the attacks a car and people threw themselves to the ground i had a hard time going out to concerts and big events for a and even i have to scout out the fire escape when i get there my friend was killed at the last year and i still get used to that he was a kind accepting of everyone and brimming with potential not a day where i think about that and feel sad and bereft attacks are being used to often spend nights near the republic square the and i was shocked to see how empty it months after the attacks i also surprise myself i go as i prevent myself to stop at the square for a moment and to feel did change my relationships with especially with some friends as i come from a town in the suburbs which has a lot of immigrants making up the with of origins debates about what happened and what is still happening are part of our daily life and some friends have the same opinions as me some people i thought i knew started to call for or to call refugees animals because they thought they were having really racist thoughts and talking to some very good friends of mine because what they said really hurt me my father being i got personally offended by been said by some people i think the attacks are being exploited by politicians to win the upcoming presidential elections they just scare people and hope to win like and now no difference between the parties as they just all target nationalism is is in an utter mess and has been for a long time the front national have made gains the country so in on the magnanimous fear since the and the left is too to do anything about it the fact that veteran leftist is putting himself forward once again for the next elections speaks volumes about the lack of progress made by socialism in the past few years here people are exasperate by the their handling of the travail protests was country is currently having an identity crisis politicians have been saying that is the home of secularism in the same breath as saying that is a catholic what they really seem to be getting at is want levels of nationalism being stoked by even the politicians is scary obsession with referencing the as the is as nauseating as it is historically inaccurate i really tell if resilience or simply hard to say been a real change the country has rocked and but its foundations are solid it feels more like what a or the crash of strong reactions at slowly dwindling out one year you deny something did but the scar is if not the is poised to the various cafs already people have resumed their normal lives looks the same it was before those appalling events it has may be seeing more cops and soldiers patrolling in the but not that striking if a change has taken it is happening at a deeper level and while true the emergency state has been there been any report of real though some may have flared up every so really tell if resilience or simply numbness and resignation as a matter of if the purpose of the attacks was to spread then it panned out people are both willing to resist and if something must it will and hardly anything you can do to prevent so the best course is to carry on as before and be oblivious of the danger which is the right path to tread has changed dramatically since the has changed dramatically since the attacks during there was this fear of mass gatherings and the possibility of an attack politically has changed politicians had been making a discourse out of what it means to be for years but since the every party and every politician has something to good and for bad the whole political debate gravitates around what defines the fundamentals of society and on what kind of social contract we all rely my biggest hope for is too stay united and not to get lost in adversity i wish that we can continue to live with different

imagine the world was facing upheaval on a scale not seen during modern a change that would imperil the great cities by the rising seas and snuff out species at at the fastest rate since the dinosaurs disappeared then imagine you were a had repeated chances to ask the next president of the united states about this and decided to not do apparent failure of the media during the presidential election has been multifaceted and fiercely debated but the absence of climate change as a leading topic in the election of trump is perhaps the single greatest rebuke to the idea that power should be held to account for the benefit of this and future failure was most apparent during the presidential where hours of television saw not one moderator question pitched to trump or on climate change it was left to ken he of the red sweater and brief to come closest with a question about coal consequences of unchecked climate which is essentially what trump proposes by denying the problem dwarfed every other issue including emails discussed during the debates and yet it raised it was the equivalent of getting an exclusive interview with and in and not asking them about the change was also missing in broader coverage of the especially on cable where scientific emergencies make good fodder for breathless journalism the public were periodically warned that the seas are eating away east coast and that no not just it really is warm this but climate change was treated as a side issue rather than being central to every energy and foreign policy question the country is grappling with a leading climate is the great issue of our time and we are skirting around it just baffled by to be many also skirt around climate change even if they are concerned about it nearly of say that climate change is at least somewhat important to them according to the program on climate although few people talk about the issue with family or friends are broadly in favor of developing clean sources of energy but a clear political divide about how to approach climate change polling by the pew research center shows half of supporters cared about climate change a great compared with of trump supporters maybe now that the reality of the next four years of president trump is sinking a more considered view of the problems faces will take hold maybe people will realize important that left it to the very last minute to cut greenhouse gas emissions and that failure to do this will probably risk their prosperity and national security maybe the spread of disease and the rising seas will be grasped as something to be urgently remedied before tropical advance further and south is inundated there is much detail to work both on the impacts of climate change and how policies will influence them the has promised to withdraw the us from the climate to scrap the clean power slash funding for renewable energy and somehow attempt to reboot the ailing coal industry how far he will go with this and indeed how invested he personally is in it beyond outlandish tweeted is still unclear exiting the accord will require a notice period but as the agreement is beyond its goal of avoiding dangerous global trump could simply drop any attempt to cut emissions and sit it out as other countries try to suppress their panic as to what to do now that the us a climate leader anymore trump wants to accelerate domestic coal and gas production to achieve energy but this goal is contradictory and barely feasible given the unfavorable economics facing coal and oil in particular the new president also wants to roll back the environmental protection agency while having water and clean air he has spoken admiringly of natural beauty but has surrounded himself with fossil fuel billionaires and lobbyists who want to split open public lands for their enrichment republicans largely support this stance but at the same time they want a public enraged by degraded national parks or another flint water for example untangling these contradictions and what they mean for the and the will arguably form the most important legacy left by a trump presidency up to the media to start helping do

since election the public rejection of trump and his politics has been vast as the reality of his impending presidency settles those of us who reject the agenda he promises to usher in are left with glaring course of we have to organize and could reverse progress on clean experts fear read it comes to climate trump wants to slash withdraw from the climate stop funding clean energy research and expand fossil fuel extraction on federal including doubling down on coal he is surrounding himself with fossil fuel industry like and who want to roll back the gains made under the administration but us election results change the science or the reality of climate change so how we need to work together to minimize the potential climate impacts of a trump is still in and there is still time to make progress for people and the planet he could begin by suspending the permits for the construction of the access pipeline and ordering a full environmental impact study with comprehensive tribal consultation stopping the pipeline is an unprecedented rallying point for indigenous people across the who are calling on the us government to observe its own treaties and the rights and sovereignty of native communities but it would also eliminate a transport option for oil from the which the world simply does not need oil markets already have plenty of the oil would greatly contribute to climate change when we know we need to be transitioning to a and the only people who would benefit work in the fossil fuel industry you can call on the president to act quickly by joining the millions who have signed a coming out to one of these solidarity events on if you can find the time or donating to or even joining the water protectors at standing we need to build more local democratic power for the climate movement states and even municipalities can have a lot of sway over the direction goes for a ballot initiative that won in on election sponsored by the oil and gas industry and funded by millions of its enacted a statewide policy that will drastically limit power to democratically regulate or ban in their towns concerned with protecting themselves and future generations from the worst effects of climate change must push back against these campaigning for and organizing around legislation and local lawmakers who will stand up to the oil and gas industry and we must actively oppose those who the aftermath of the local movement power in our communities is going to be critical start find meetings and get to know organizers and activists near you find reasons to interact face to face with allies check in with neighbors and ask how they are doing and how you can support them or make a donation to an organization you care about where democracy has been usurped by industry influence and we are going to have to be creative and courageous with our and bodies if administration makes good on its threats to boost destructive sectors like oil and the climate movement will need to peacefully but significantly escalate its resistance there will be no shortage of ways to get including nonviolent direct action and civil disobedience against infrastructure and the leasing programs of the department of take hope from remembering that the fight for climate justice is global the momentum gave us may drop but many other nations are still leading private sector giants from to to are building successful businesses around renewable energy cities across the us and all over the world are independently stepping up to become climate champions and the global climate movement will not stop fighting for our collective future protest empowered by and do our part to build a progressive movement that will be here to lead when fails to comes vital to acknowledge that election has millions of people justifiably feeling scared for their physical safety and future he and his surrogates spent months threatening people of and the among many others we must all begin by ourselves to protecting and caring for each especially by rallying behind the groups and communities targeted by are going to get through this through action and persistence we will win in the long term for people and the planet a scary time for all of but all the more reason to do this

a panel of three federal judges said on that the redrawing of state assembly districts to favor republicans was an unconstitutional partisan the first such ruling in three decades of pitched legal battles over the issue federal courts have struck down gerrymanders on racial but not on grounds that they unfairly give advantage to a political party the more common form of gerrymandering the case could now go directly to the supreme where its fate may rest with a single m who has expressed a willingness to strike down partisan gerrymanders but has yet to accept a rationale for it should the court affirm the it could upend the next round of state in for congressional and state elections most of which is likely to be conducted by legislatures that have swept into power in recent years is a huge said heather a law school professor and an expert on election law everyone has waited for the supreme court to do something on this front now one of the lower courts has the debate this were to be a nationwide would look quite she for the several scholars said the ruling was especially significant because it for the first a clear mathematical formula for measuring partisanship in a something that had been missing in previous assaults on gerrymandering the ruling by the united states district court for the western district of said that the remapping violated both the first amendment and the equal protection clause of the amendment because it aimed to deprive democratic voters of their right to be represented natural political geography plays some role in the apportionment the court simply does not explain adequately the sizable disparate of republican gains in the state assembly after the boundaries were redrawn the judges who ruled in favor of the ripple and were nominated to the bench by presidents and jimmy carter judge nominated by president w dissented the boundaries of both federal and state legislative districts are redrawn every years after the census to ensure that each district contains roughly the same number of a standard the supreme court set with its ruling in but both republican and democratic majorities in statehouses often remap districts to favor either by cramming opposition voters into a single district or by dividing them so they are the majority in fewer tactics called and courts have generally agreed that some partisan advantage in redistricting is in part because voters themselves are not spread equally across a state or district by party but the plaintiffs in the state democrats represented by the campaign legal had argued that the remapping was among the most sharply partisan in the nation their lawsuit said that in the elections for the republicans won percent of the vote but took percent of the seats a key question in as in past challenges to was whether that division was unacceptably a question that previous courts have stumbled over has come up with a standard to measure constitutionality how to distinguish between evil partisanship versus the natural advantage one party might have as a result of where voters happened to said the director of the election law project at state college of law in the court was swayed by a new and simple mathematical formula to measure the extent of partisan called the efficiency gap the formula divides the difference between the two votes beyond those needed by a winning and votes cast by a losing side by the total number of votes cast when both parties waste the same number of the result is zero an ideal solution but as a winning party wastes fewer and fewer votes than its its score rises a truly efficient gerrymander spreads a winning votes so evenly over districts that very few votes are wasted a review of four decades of state redistricting plans concluded that any party with an efficiency gap of percent or more was likely to keep its majority during the years before new districts were drawn in experts republicans scored an efficiency gap rating of percent to percent in the first election after the maps were redrawn in some experts said the efficiency gap gives gerrymandering opponents their most promising chance yet to persuade a majority of the supreme court to limit partisan redistricting does almost exactly what justice said he was looking for back in the a clear threshold for deciding what is said c the director of the elections research center at the university of under procedural cases like redistricting lawsuits that are heard by panels in district court are appealed directly to the supreme skipping the federal court of appeals but it remains unclear whether will file an appeal or accept the ruling and limit its impact to a single state were the supreme court to hear the the effect could be regardless of the decision republicans have more than doubled their control of state legislatures since and with gains from this election they now control both legislative chambers in a record states if which has a nominally

a little tired today because i just went six rounds with a extra firm control body an undergarment constructed with the same sort of expandable concrete used in airport runways possibly you heard us battling it out at i knew of course been told by friends that putting on one of their control garments would take every ounce of strength in that women have gotten these items on only to pass out on the floor and never make it to their event but party season in new and been cracking down on the whole midriff bulge thing this year i was at a book event last and a smartly dressed whom i estimated to be a size but who actually had a little was taken away by the fashion sobbing a little suck it i heard one of the officers tell her had two and she whimpered matter how much you starve everyone has a little belly at in one of the cops said i am no undergarment i have fabulous underwear for just about every occasion except space travel i had once experienced having bought a pair of their all the way firm control pantyhose that was rough a better name would have try it this way but first agree on a safe word pantyhose these things were so tight that struggling to get them on i tore the stockings i never even got to wear them unless i am is a violation of the bill of rights i had also seen fey in her final appearance on letterman last on which she wore a dress that betrayed not an ounce of the jiggle normally found on the human body she was buff then she stepped out of the dress and revealed a terrifying set of pantyhose over the an body suit the bodysuit makes me think of the overalls farmers used to wear that is probably where the design farmers with body disorder who were embarrassed by the way their bellies pooched out when they sat down on their harvesters excuse i have an from a male type laughing too hard the did you when were you last at a formal affair with a woman who went to the where was big reveal she told letterman this would be the last time she would be wearing the sort of dress that required this level of body armor which of course meant that up to that award television star and had found that it necessary you get what without that she would be taking orders at she would be nothing i happen to be one of those women who is pleased with her at least when i assume the posture of a marine honor guard and am sucking in my stomach certainly you ladies have all spent many pleasant evenings in that position i have a tiny midriff roll more like a actually and since i had just gotten a clingy gold cocktail dress for a fancy awards dinner and new yorkers are so i felt a possibly garment was necessary off i go to the lingerie saleswoman says would have thought you were a i i the oldest sales trick in the but i never get tired of hearing it the saleswoman finds four body suits but the one that grabs my attention is the extra firm control bodysuit in rose gold it even need a body in it to have an hourglass so hot that on the way to the fitting room two guys try to get its number it takes several minutes of struggling during which i gasp for breath and the oxygen mask drops from the but eventually i manage to get the on getting the bra top closed impossible customer service tip for in the areas where body armor is post a weight lifter outside the dressing ideally one who has not done time in eventually the who has obviously trained for this comes in with a winch cable and hooks the bra the effect is mesmerizing i look like a playboy an offensive objectification of a female unless the body is attached to your own head i buy the suit for a steal as far as i am concerned how i will get into it the night of the big awards dinner with no one at home to help i do not know but i will somehow manage my career could use a boost
trump has promised to build a wall along the border between the us and after his electoral triumph over many are wondering whether actually pull this or any of his other controversial along with many other minorities in the were railed against by trump during his campaign in the to the he vowed to rid the us of yet despite this adding to his record of xenophobic trump was elected the president of the united states mapping the trump countries and regions feeling the heat read real estate billionaire promised to scrap the north free trade agreement on grounds that it at the expense of us workers he has also threatened to tax the money sent home from the us by migrants to in for the aforementioned spoke to in the us and about the election of and how they think his presidency might affect their lives what they underestimate the consequences that damaging our economic ties can have on feel dismayed and deeply disappointed as bad as that the worst part is feeling powerless we have a say in an event that can have catastrophic consequences to our economy in the us we are seen as collateral damage even those opposing trump seem indifferent to the economic and human pain this situation can inflict on us i understand the economic pain that people in the rust belt are feeling successful trade agreements transfer some jobs from one country to another but are net job creators to all involved countries under the us gained jobs in the south at the expense of the rust belt north gained and the south has but this is the result of failed compensating measures within both countries boosted wealth across the subcontinent cutting ties with will also harm the us it surprises me that during the campaign no one pointed this out and perceive that trade is a game under the us gained jobs in the south at the expense of the rust belt it surprises me this was pointed as trump adopts a pragmatic the damage can be limited to a further decline in my purchasing power owing to the peso devaluation and a difficult business environment while expectations are better anchored if he feels obligated to deliver on the promises made to his voters and revokes things could be much worse our government has little leverage because underestimate the consequences that damaging our economic ties can have on them they are self absorbed and busy inflicting pain on one another of will probably send us into an even deeper power trump has over over our over our our perception of our freedom of over the way the world will see us is terrifying and he is not even the president we woke up to find the exchange rate at pesos for the dollar we went from per dollar on election to yesterday and today expected to reach by the end of the year we have been humiliated in front of the deportations of many who live and work in the united who send money home and who contribute tremendously in that way to our economy will probably send us into an even deeper recession his misogyny is worse than any machismo we have ever see we surprised how many love adore are more than willing to welcome in any who wishes to make their home for the next four bring your come live bring your help us out we are a welcoming country with amazing fantastic great cities with interesting museums and landmarks and restaurants and we hope they will seriously consider it that goes for people who want to escape the our collective the democracy was something to aspire to the spell has been broken in many ways in even the least educated among us believe this man to be a buffoon his ideas are uninspired and poorly that his misogyny is worse than any machismo we have ever seen we are surprised by how much and how many love adore are now wondering where to turn to for inspiration and what way of life and ideology will now inspire this we ask has created a dangerous stereotype of in the have a visa and i can travel throughout the us whenever i which is a lot but i am concerned of the increase of hate or that as a result of the stereotype i live in a place visited by a lot of tourists i worry that they will think that i am or that they think i am a drug dealer or a is not fair that a presidential candidate has blamed because of issues they have he has created a dangerous stereotype of in the us there are a lot of undocumented but a lot of us are living legally in the us many drugs go the us through the but what they forget is the us is the first drug consumer worldwide what they say is that they are in part responsible for the drug cartel violence in some we make jokes about it we now say that we are no longer the country with the stupidest president in the world silver lining is that perceives trump as a common politics in can find common ground to make front to his politics and maybe force the common efforts by different parties before the presidential election i really hope margarita will engage in alliances with other parties to win the will suffer irremediably if trump imposes tariffs on imports renegotiating for example or tax the remittances the fiscal situation in is already strained owing to low oil prices and corrupt politicians with vast regions of the country in hands of or crime trump adds chaos to the already dismal state of government with inept and corrupt politicians like president and the foreign trumps adds chaos to the already dismal state of government with inept and corrupt are going to inflation and currency devaluation will spike making expenses more

animals were hurt during the production of this film only reads a line toward the end of the closing credits of a good hook for an exploitation but it deserves a snappier movie than the one attached to this thriller is a tease that slogs its way through a morass of barely differentiated characters and visuals before reaching an unsatisfying conclusion the deliberately kept either to disguise its true nature or a lack of concerns a band of people in combat gear who are on the run attacking them is the villains are mostly shown in glimpses and at a distance are they wearing gas are they the sand people from the more distinct personae include whose leg is injured and is quickly smith who barks orders at everyone and takes notes in a mysterious a and a pair of hostages dressed like prisoners at callously refers to them as the group takes refuge in a tank and is soon stuck inside close quarters have made great fodder for suspense and allegory in films like set in a and but by the director of and has little on its mind beyond empty shock value
