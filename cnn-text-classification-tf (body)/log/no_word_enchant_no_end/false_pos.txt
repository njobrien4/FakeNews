trump was surprisingly gracious as he met president in the oval office on but make no he is already working to erase major parts of legacy from the history books trump will be able to change some of policies with a quick stroke of the pen others will be much more requiring justification to pass legal hurdles or from lawmakers on capitol hill or foreign leaders he can make a big difference at the outset of his but it will take him years and support from dubious congressional factions and allies overseas to get a lot of other things said former solicitor and deputy general counsel of the house of representatives and now a professor at the university of law school

by on future now rests in the hands of a man older than the supreme leader of celebrate in the streets of the coastal city of after election of former general as president the news come as much of a surprise in the end presidential posters with face were already being hung around east before the results had even been released but now its has finally elected a new a and former military was elected on making him the ending a political vacuum in the top post that had left now takes the reigns of a country heavily plagued by a massive refugee overload with refugees from various practically public constant threat of war from their southern and bomb attacks from terrorists interestingly this is the second time that has been announced the president to when he and the military government of east appointed itself in and anyone who dared disputed this was met with which did eventually occur even went on to fight a war of liberation against the army forces stationed in during which ended in failure and forced to flee his native land into exile in the man behind the poster is by his to be a strong leader with a military background who knows how to play the political field to achieve his goals on the other most i have spoken to about have offered plenty of negative feedback even from people who i assumed would throw their full support behind the old boy an overall slippery character who has been lucky enough to pick the right partners since his return to after his exile i have to the side of my personality that appreciates dark comedy chuckled at the picture of president sitting in the big chair of the presidential palace with just the slightest whisper of a cheeky smile on his face the last time held the the army under the authority of pictured at the presidential palace in being elected president of president of bombed him out in a attempt to illuminate a stubborn nationalist troublemaker yet years son of offered his personal congratulations to on his election victory just president also shares my dark which would explain his sly smirk while he sat in his prize seat despite all the he has returned to and claimed what he had always the presidency carries with him a considerable amount of political baggage from a long career full of civil war and side switching which has left many in questioning if this lord of war is the man worth appointing to end the political stalemate which some have suggested would be better off remaining politically frozen instead of appointing a man who has fought against the administration in during the late but now fully backs and in this is a totally understandable stance given the lack of honest candidates available in the fact remains that has been left completely disabled by the political deadlock which is pushing the country to the brink i personally agree with the progressive socialist party and leader who said on twitter prior to the vote that its time to elect any president to escape the presidential vacuum why elect i have a growing concern that behind closed doors some very egotistical and conniving millionaires are beginning to see the massive potential gas wealth just sitting off the coast but political class has been far too busy infighting among themselves to invest in steps towards harvesting and selling gas also have their eyes on this untapped wealth lying below the perhaps this could be why so many old adversaries of have decided to suddenly put an end to their refusal to back ally for who is smart enough to see this type of opportunity on the horizon and just about desperate enough to surrender his staunch opposition to candidacy in return for inclusion in any future plans given recent bad luck with his struggling business in i put it past him who is still eagerly perusing the trial and conviction of what he believes where who at news beside former prime minister after announced that he will back to become president assassinated his is now willing to throw his vote to candidate in order to secure the position for the second as prime minister certainly there are many more aspects to consider in what has been a leading up to yesterdays grand finale but i suspect that political godfathers are smart enough to realize they are sitting on a potential trillion dollar money maker is at risk of being high jacked if they continue pussyfooting around over never sectarian feuds what could during my last trip to i was shocked to see how even the average struggle with the lack of basic services the country is a mess and the only institution that is worth any praise is the army that has coped remarkably well under the strains of constant terror attacks from radical terrorists the rise of regional sectarianism and a huge lack of money equipment the proxy of dictator who fought a long bloody war against is now considered the candidate who confirms an political victory over its competitor for political influence in what has largely held the country back is the fact that has been stuck in a vicious game of between refusal to pick a side has left the country empty handed with no vision of a safe future has a desperately needed arms deal with a pathetic blaming the deal cancellation on a statement made by foreign minister happens to be who refused to accept a statement referring to as a terrorist group the produced statement patriarch president of also demanded all league members to condemn which both refused to do in previous attempts to remain has also refused to accept any or offers to provide free arms deliveries to the army in order not to upset the countries ties to the us or the gulf now that holds may have the guts to finally
views gold ii the network communications have been attacked relentlessly today all communications have been shut down for the network has global networks it can join for communications and all three have been taken down for most of the including all phone lines is it a coincidence that this happened just after the who but if you are worried about the action in the gold just read this gold was not selected arbitrarily by governments to be the monetary standard gold had developed for many centuries on the free market as the best as the commodity providing the most stable and desirable monetary medium by king world new gold and the illusion of monetary value have you ever been to the world magic kingdom in or maybe drunk beer out of a glass boot at or if not the type of person to spend your money on something so probably at least bought a loaf of bread in your the reason i am asking these questions will become clear in a second but first lets talk about the dollar to hear which legend just spoke with about gold and the coming mania in the and mining shares markets click here or on the image below as consumers we are used to pricing goods in dollars whichever currency you using the dollar as a benchmark is less than ideal because it has lost more than of its value over the last years in most of the rise in prices over the last century can be attributed to a loss in the purchasing power of the dollar economists take a and approach to measuring purchasing they use gold after the growth in fiat money has outpaced the growth in gold production as a result gold has protected investors in the long term against the loss of purchasing power caused by persistent money supply inflation rather than looking at higher gold prices as a gain in the precious metals they should be seen as a consequence of monetary inflation even though the gold price in us dollar terms is currently not in the vicinity of its all time the data are the price of gold in terms of the dollar has increased by a factor of since in the long term the gold price is rising against every paper currency the growth in the gold price is simply a side effect of monetary inflation but how has this monetary growth affected our purchasing most investors will know that the price of oil has grown considerably over the last however if we price oil in real the cost per barrel has remained surprisingly stable in the chart below we show on the one hand the ratio how many barrels of oil can be bought with one ounce of and on the other hand it shows the inverse of the oil price how many units of oil can be bought with one us one can see that while the price of oil in terms of gold tends to be relatively stable over time and golds purchasing power currently stands actually above the level of the us dollar has lost has more than of its purchasing power relative to oil over the same time period for the naive mind there is something miraculous in the issuance of fiat money a magic word spoken by the government creates out of nothing a thing which can be exchanged against any merchandise a man would like to get how pale is the art of and when compared with that of the governments treasury mises another instructive indicator is the price of bread measured in gold the chart below shows historically how much bread you could buy for one dollar vs how much bread you could buy with an ounce of gold golds purchasing power has remained while the amount of bread you could buy with one dollar has decreased drastically the contrast between the purchasing power of gold and paper money becomes especially obvious when looking at the prices of leisure attractions the entrance fee for the world magic kingdom in is used as a proxy for leisure attractions in the us told you we would return to at the time of its opening in the ticket price stood at per today the entrance fee amounts to per day that equates to an average annualized price increase of twice the official inflation rate if one looks at these ticket prices in gold it can be seen that a median of tickets could be purchased with an ounce of gold over time currently this figure stands at which is quite close to the average what is for the is for a regular feature of our chart collections is the beer purchasing power of gold while a liter of beer ma in at the in cost the equivalent of the average price in was the annual price inflation of beer since thus amounts to if one looks at the price of beer relative to the gold then one ounce of gold could buy liters of beer in historically the average is liters thus the beer purchasing power of gold is currently slightly above the average the peak was however reached in at liters per ounce we believe it is quite possible that this level will be reached again beer drinking gold hoarders should revel in this development conclusion the evidence above shows that fiat currencies have historically been woefully inadequate at maintaining their purchasing power gold by contrast has a track record of successfully preserving value and purchasing power over thousands of years in the course of human the market has naturally chosen gold as the superior form of money the slow and steady growth in its supply from mining global stock of gold is growing at approximately the same pace as the ensures stability and confidence these unique characteristics are making gold one of the best hedges against excessive money supply expansion and black swan events and if you have

he roamed the streets of for six raping women as they walked to work or headed home from parties in the dark to keep them from fighting he smashed their heads with rocks and wrapped his hands around their necks sometimes he threatened them with a gun police became unable to identify him even though they had his from the crimes desperate for a they checked a database of convicted but came up they searched for a partial match to see whether he had a relative in the database they got lucky the man had a brother in which led authorities to the assailant the is one of a handful of cases that authorities have quietly solved in recent years using a controversial technique that scours an offender database for a son or brother of an elusive crime suspect the state early success using familial searches to identify the serial killer led police chief beck to predict that the method would the way policing is done in the united civil liberty groups expressed saying the searches raised significant ethical and privacy concerns some questioned their legality since familial has made more modest progress than beck predicted but has also gained wider respect eight other states have followed formally embracing the technique as a tool and though many opponents still express approach has won over some previous skeptics who say they are impressed with the state strict policies limiting its use and the measured successes using the method helped detectives in the state identify two including the grim and five men wanted for sexual according to the attorney general office early last authorities arrested a county man accused of sneaking into children bedrooms and cutting holes in their pajamas before molesting them a few months a man was arrested on suspicion of raping and sodomizing a woman along a bike path a county judge in sentenced a man to life in prison for raping a coffee shop employee then barricading her inside a refrigerator lab officials look for a relative by scanning genetic profiles in the offender database and looking for samples that match with a along but not markers from testing method focuses on part of the passed down along the male identifying or full brother relationships as more genetic markers for people are entered into offender the technology will become more said geneticist a professor at university medical school and a leading authority on the technique that could help officials identify more distant relatives and track down criminals who are in the he said technology is demonstrable said pioneered the use of familial for crime solving more than a decade ago in one of the earliest detectives reopened the killing of a woman in wales and compared from the assailant to genetic profiles in database of known offenders in they got a partial match to a boy the teen was alive at the time of the but detectives used the clue to focus on his who eventually pleaded guilty to the murder despite that conviction and the technology took some time to catch on in the and was used only sporadically among its earliest uses was the arrest of the serial which came after officials subpoenaed a tissue sample from his daughter pap smear taken at a medical clinic times a familial test led to the arrest of l shown making a court appearance via video in the torture and serial murder case in by an impassioned debate on the technology was percolating at the capitol in gov jerry brown then the state attorney general began fielding letters and visits from urging him to consider using familial his were concerned approving the method might cause federal judges to shut down the whole database on constitutional grounds in brown enacted a comprehensive familial policy making the first state in the country to do so under the familial is only to be used as a when all other investigative angles have been exhausted so the state department of justice has run familial many of them repeat such as in the grim sleeper case an initial search turned up but state officials ran another scan in a partial match came back to a man added to the database after a arrest for firearm and drug offenses detectives zeroed in on the man franklin who lived close to where many of the bodies were dumped in south detectives believe franklin killed at least women over more than two decades he was sentenced to death in august nabbing franklin changed things for law school dean who once condemned using to find suspects by searching for relatives argued that the method invades privacy rights and is racially discriminatory because and are disproportionately represented in databases although she still worries about the racial she said her view shifted after seeing the effect on big such as and how infrequently the technology is used it helping us solve big seems like a worthwhile eight other states and have protocols for the use of familial and the technology has also been used informally by agencies elsewhere but the growing popularity of the technique has raised alarms for some privacy such as chief attorney for the forensic division of the office of the public defender mercer successfully lobbied for his state formal ban on familial searches is the only other jurisdiction to prohibit them outright searching for relatives through partial matches is he and raises concerns about the amendment prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure is a slippery he said critics also warn that partial matches can point authorities to innocent people in the technology led police in an city to wrongfully suspect a

posted on in this guest post for the unreal s gives his views about the us elections and via many people are asking me about my past predictions let me clarify that first i agree that i had predicted that will never become pm because he will find it difficult to get allies the entire country reads my articles and when they read this article of all of them became convinced that cannot lead a coalition so they voted massively in his favor to give him a majority on his own i had also predicted that trump will not just hell be thrashed and also that women are saving us from trump however he won i am still looking for the reasons but in the meantime just read my article trump no solution to civilization crisis facing the west where i sum up the misogyny and contempt for civic values and political correctness that has propelled trump into the white house and just look at the first line in this article to see how lost i still am lets come back to and his demonetization is known to hold grudges and can go to any length for them we all know how he holds grudges against first family and dropped their name from many schemes poor met the same fate first denied another term as soon as demonetized the currency notes which had signature thereby trying to obliterate his legacy i know for a fact that keeps several rupee notes with him this is not to hoard money but because his signature on the bank notes brings him fond memories and he wants to charm his grandchildren and great grandchildren by showing him notes with his signature imagine how grandkids would feel if grandpa gave them a note signed by him and said take go buy anything you want i have authorized it but does not want to even enjoy the small joys of life the entire country has to pay the price for vendetta but all is not lost here is my advice to and bury the come together and work for the future of after the us is without doubt more intolerant than and will be delighted to work with for the betterment of i remember that i had predicted that if is asked to will suffer a mass exodus of foreign portfolio investment tens of billions of dollars will flow maybe as much as billion this coincides with some other bad news like a further slowdown or exit from the but both and left and the market kept going up this shows the resilience of the economy imagine what and can together do of course the global markets have crashed after trump became president and so i was not completely wrong actually i knew that global markets would crash if trump became president but i never predicted it because the possibility of trump becoming president never occurred to me i would also like to give the some advice close down steel the are brave people anyone who tries to colonize them bleeds financially

late nineteenth writes near the end of her book the clause gave white voters political power from a black population that was itself barred from and after prison gerrymandering was doing exactly the same thing in numerous states across the country after desires for equality and civil rights in the south following the civil war led whites to criminalize communities in new ways and then sent record

staged a peaceful strike in the prison metal shop to protest wages as a witness later testified at a new state were low that working at tantamount to prisoners had formed committees and sent respectful letters to prison authorities asking them to address their concerns the requests were largely ignored despite promises that there would be no those who organized the protests were put in isolation or transferred to other prisons the callousness of the officials was especially unconscionable in light of the fact that the state had netted huge sums for sales of products made by the prisoners the slave labor system continues to this forcing inmates to begin hunger strikes and work stoppages to end prison end prison inmates join nationwide jail strike causing after three days of

they have to flee the being poor is an international war crime the you just lost it politico secretary of state for said he will appeal a court ruling that the country must grant a visa to a family wanting to apply for asylum in according to local broadcaster the court of first instance ruled the state must pay a penalty of for each day the visa is delayed the family of four is seeking an official visa to come to without traveling by sea they claim they will apply for asylum as soon as they are in the country secretary of state called the decision insane and said he will appeal people can only apply for asylum in a country if they are actually on its territory it will open the door to thousands of said if we allow people to come to with a visa to apply for the whole system will collapse and hell be called a racist for this be all like and i think an court could possibly disagree with this decision because of if unlimited millions of people are allowed to take boats into why should they not be allowed to on no idea why says thousands though this is several billion people that it opens the door to the has treated as valid asylum claims from every country in the middle east and west of not all of them are eventually but no one is ever deported they can just keep appealing the and even when the appeals fail and issued a deportation they are still allowed to loaf around on welfare because there is no mechanism to go find arrest and ship them out so anyone from any or country who can afford a plane ticket will be issued an visa which will effectively allow them to come live in on welfare forever it is obviously but it was insane for to invite these billions to take boats to and walk across everything that happens anymore is so this is insane is no longer a valid argument for anything the only accepted argument is this is racist there is no accepted counterargument so its time to spread your legs because this just got a lot more crowded note that that metaphor applies in a literal sense to your daughters
escaped the enterprise world and now works as a consultant for when was wrapping up his senior year of he hunted around for a job that would hire an undergrad on flexible hours he knew that the kinds of companies that tended to hire on those terms could often have creative but college about to pay for itself he found a small shop that needed an extra hand extremely there was only one other was prepared to enter a tiny shop with no real practices or because with only one you expect a lot of rules and bureaucracy was only one but he was able to create enough and downright mysterious bureaucratic policies and procedures for fifty developers reading the was closer to reading a but not a good novel where there was a clear point and narrative but something meandering and like a book just opinionated about style he also had opinions on the proper use of source control are absolutely vital for separating units of work explanation came after was stunned by the sheer number of there were hundreds of branches in the repository you have to be intimidated by this we can start you just do this small change in the main then ill show you how to release it dutifully checked out master made the and committed it he sent a pull request you used the wrong branch back out your and put it in the main one which branch is the main its not master it used to but we really use master anymore use master as it turned the main branch was usually whichever branch touched last there were five or six different branches that could be the main branch at any given time maybe it was very hard for to be certain made the changes in master but that was only the start of the nightmare those changes had to be merged into the correct branch for deployment this is pretty do you want me to walk you through asked said and so sat down next to and started explaining each step that needed to perform these explanations started with pressing his fingers against monitor and click fire up the not the this branch the instructional process was recorded as a smear of fingerprints on screen changes merged outward from the main branch main happened to be that instead of merging back towards a trunk of changes were made to the and then percolated according to own twisted logic you he gotta different and some of them depend on a different version of our framework lib this main version builds against version of the framework but your framework up to version like for years but this change only goes out to the so you need to merge from main to master then to then to perky peregrine need to resolve conflicts ground his teeth hard enough to make diamonds between and fought his way through the merge conflicts a few hours one line change was merged into a releasable but had no idea how that change would migrate to any other if it ever did next assignment was to make a change to the same and since it was a larger he made a feature branch off of perky peregrine do the changes then merge right back into perky peregrine after the work was done then he could propagate the changes back to the current main this resulted in an angry visit from are you trying to mess this demanded there is a system there are policies did you even read the development guide i gave feature branches are but they have to come off the main not one of the dependent had tried valiantly to read but failed i was just going to do the merge into perky peregrine and then delete the why does it merge back shrieked delete the branches merge backwards only outwards like a tree each feature branch is supposed to be an entirely new line of development have you even used source something snapped in the back of because for a terrifying that almost made sense had been puzzling over the bizarre state of their source control and those words from put understanding it within tantalizing reach if he asked a few more he might just see the method to this madness chose the wiser path he he he complied with and moved on to the next weeks after cutting through the shrubbery that was branching system the next feature was to make a change that only impacted users of the latest version of the base framework the current main branch was back on version so needed to start by making a branch from there then he had to bring it up to version then convert a few of the into a new then finish the upgrade to this was about two weeks of hair pulling frustration then he could make his changes he spent that week asking serious questions about the career path he was on finally he could merge his changes into the actual release but never back into any master branch this resulted in tens of thousands of merge conflicts the next few weeks were spent cutting through and by the end of that discovered the semester was nearly over he was about to graduate he went to the of the small and handed in his resignation been really impressed by your she said you could stay on after if you like her tone was perhaps even a little but there was a plea in her eyes vaguely recalled hearing that was a friend of the other saw a hint that knew what was doing to their software product maybe she thought could be her ally in fixing it or maybe was reading too much into it discretion was the better part of valor i just think the right fit for this he said they made the polite she promised him a recommendation they
by why did they vote for this if we understand why that choice was we will all get and not only in north but also all over the since the results of the latest presidential elections were i am longing for while the overwhelming cacophony of deafening noises is assaulting my and in fact all my senses suddenly everyone around me wants to to and to declare people who are surrounding as well as those who are far away from me are frantically watching the reading newspapers and browsing through countless political websites my friends and comrades all over the world are poking jokes at the us political or trembling in anticipation of something even apocalyptic many are just having fun even some thoughtful and educated individuals are behaving like obsessive football passing and spending countless hours on the in front of their television screens of course there are also many gigantic protests in countless cities against the the leader of the mightiest nation on earth there are some massive desperate and hopeless protests there are also personal resigned shrugs of shoulders and downcast glances overall there is a lot of noise everyone is speaking from the top of his or her lungs people are shouting over each other they want to be desperately while very few are listening very few also appear to be reflecting on what is being said by the on what is truly on what has happened despite millions of words and images assaulting our brains from all i know that something is definitely something and even something essential it is not just my analytical mind that comprehends it is also my intuition as a i want to smash those television sets in my i want to throw newspapers into the garbage and i want to go far from all my politicizing friends and comrades but what is it that is being omitted in the official and even in the alternative what is it that i want to longing to hear so much longing with such even with such am i desperate for some precise for exact for revealing am i yearning for one brilliant for a do i want to hear from someone why on earth did the people elect someone like like or is it all actually much more simple and do i expect those wise words to come from my own typed into my computer with my own how did it all really come to and what will happen what will happen to them the what will happen to the which despite everything used to be my home for many what will happen to which took so but which also gave me i kept above what will happen to the to the entire which is now my true and which is also their true home of the although perhaps they do not fully comprehend it yet i did not want to hear the i care less about the numbers i was not longing for and i felt absolutely no desire to there was only one longing left in to to to absorb the millions of voices of those who just recently went to the polls and stuck those pieces of paper into most likely changing the destiny of the world and since i knew i be able to absorb millions of i wanted to listen to at least a few hundred or even thousands of them if possible i wanted to hear the stories of those men and women from the from the deep from isolated farms and exhausted mining towns i wanted to put my glass of beer next to in some and just nod and whisper what so many storytellers before have done for and what they will be saying for many centuries to please tell me your story i want to hear their stories so i can collect arrange and pass them onto the world i want the people who voted for trump to speak to to to let me into their thoughts and emotions i want to understand what occurred through their stories i want to judge i am usually very very and very ideological this time i have no desire to be this is too too damn i owe that much that is the least i can do to return to fly there all the way from to rent a and drive from coast to for long and to finally listen to trying to understand who they what they and i am what i am because i am a passionate i was once told by one of the greatest people always know what goes on all we have to do is to listen to them and we have to lead them only when they ask when they order us to do so there is no doubt in my mind that now is the time to attentively listen to the to fill newspapers and websites with their words but almost no one seems to be doing that all we hear is why they voted as they did how they particular classes or states we read about numbers but we hear people we hear them formulating the words and that is what i am longing to shut to be and to listen and i want other intellectuals to shut up and to humbly listen not because i agree with what the have done not because i want trump to lead the country and the empire not because i suddenly fell in love with the small people it is simply because the people of the most powerful country on earth have because they made their choice and if we understand why that choice was we will all get and not only in north but also all over the i want to listen and to understand so the course of action can be so that we know where all this will lead because this is not the just the beginning of something

first there was then there was and now it common knowledge amongst fans that the new england patriots seek out innovative and creative ways to gain a competitive advantage often blurring the line between gamesmanship we all heard the rumors of helmet radio or fire alarms sounding late at night in visiting hotel or that manning himself refused to ever speak aloud in the locker room at but now it is alleged that over the past members of the special teams unit have placed thousands of elaborate prank calls to opposing players and coaches in hopes of disturbing them mentally and emotionally speaking a former special teams assistant named pro bowl kicker as the ringleader of the plan was to pose as family or even romantic according to our makes the majority of the calls and finds considerable pleasure in hoodwinking his opponents refers to himself as confessed the might be the best kicker in the but is the greatest on the planet his not arrived in bill told the special teams guys to find busywork while the offense and defense were watching game recalls the did even blink he started dialing that day and never looked back first we collected phone numbers of former patriots and before the bye we had every number in the took his craft seriously our source claims he hired a team of assistants to perform hours of research to craft the perfect call to suit each victim when a video surfaced of his wife brought his own wife in and jumped on the had his flirting with three or four times a week she was just as into the pranking as was she made up a character for bought a bunch of high and would act out scenes while she was on the phone with him loved that girl he was ready to put her in his this prank may have by serving as motivation for the jets beat the patriots in the playoffs one month later before the championship the shenanigans took a dark turn called colts head coach tony posing as a suicidal college student got our source remembers was a sweetheart they talked for hours and by the end of was broken down in tears i thought was wearing him down but as soon as they hung he busted out laughing and got started on the next call that one gave me the ploy failed despite the lack of warm and motivational demeanor helped his colts to defeat the patriots on the way to a super bowl victory more than just a conniving also became a master impersonator in he spent weeks honing a impression of coach studied his and even began mimicking the coach movements and style of dress while at home he then called ravens head coach john and slipped into character went balls out on that recounts the former assistant drank cans of red bull and threatened to set john house on with such a bold one would think would catch on but that was the case totally bought almost as if the threats came as no surprise to public records do indicate that police visited both homes on but it did not hinder the performance as squad thumped the pats in the wild card playoff game the next day this method however did not deceive another famous pair of brothers called giants quarterback manning prior to the patriots devastating super bowl this time posing as legendary manning was really smart about our source discloses was one of the first to catch on he strung discussing for a good minutes or so then started asking him personal questions with increasing specificity came prepared and nailed the stuff about favorite sandwich and the suspicious spot on his but crumbled when brought up a childhood story about a manning family reunion that ended in tragedy pretended to lose service and hung up the but he was sweating after locking up the stunning manning made sure to catch up with on the field shook brought him in and whispered dropped the turd in the that really pissed him just how many prank calls has made over the would say upwards of five that just during practice who knows how much pranking he did in his spare the source alleges that once convinced former head coach to buy into a pyramid and even tricked friend and former teammate into believing he was suffering from schizophrenia could write a book on this declared the assistant when asked if he thinks the kicker is still making these types of would bet my kidney that he still doing and i only have one kidney ca live without pranking he got dossiers on every player in the plus guys scouting for dirt on college players the guy has at least burner phones at all times i would doubt that he had a hand in wide josh checking into rehab just before they played the pats that reeks of it remains to be seen if will garner the same attention from mainstream news outlets as this team previous scandals perhaps the league will be reluctant to pick at the wounds so soon after an expensive and tiresome legal battle with tom but if further evidence presents itself or more witnesses come this story has the capacity to be the most shocking example of disregard for the spirit of the game there

by on of the new the plan for war in was disseminated by a small group of or almost all of them almost all of them by if you think that the new world order and its agents believe in conspiracy or if you think that they are actually scared of and are looking for world war think again listen to of business insider very carefully now challenges the west in virtually every arena with nuclear military invasions of and the intimidation of us allies and neutral states throughout his even attempt to present rigorous evidence for this bold and we know why as we have seen over and over the new world order and its agents do not believe in evidence at all they do not believe in rigorous testing or logical which is one of the main pillars of the going all the way back to the new world order and its agents believe in and just plain lies they have a history of doing just in world war in world war in in in and now in they still think that they can manipulate the masses at will cites lewis of arms control wonk seen the failure of democratic institutions in its not the open and free society that we had hoped for at the end of the cold and with that failure comes an insecurity on the part of leaders we all know this is nonsense by now if the west or at least believes in we have the wars in and because the vast majority of want them but a small group of people known as the decided to advance perpetual wars in the middle east for and if you think this is conspiracy take it from flaming of the new times he told way back in that that the plan for war in was disseminated by a small group of or almost all of them almost all of them intellectuals partial people who are mutual friends and cultivate one another and are convinced that political ideas are a major driving force of history they believe that the right political idea entails a fusion of morality and human rights and grit the philosophical underpinnings of the are the writings of and read those statements very carefully again just or decided to send which had about million people in to and we all know what happened then there are some people on the lunatic fringe who keep saying that the war was a but we can ignore those people because they do not know what they are talking about veterans today was so aggressive about invading that one republican lawmaker declared was like a parrot bringing up all the time it was getting on the presidents nerves after one such meeting in we are told that rolled his what a fixation about r of the a think noted that in may of we were hailed as great visionaries but when the war turned out to be a now we are both within the conservative movement and in the battle over postwar planning in any we know that was a disaster but does not want to talk about that because that would ruin his career or his ideological if people know that it was only about people who orchestrated the war in then obviously they will realize that we are not living in a democracy at least the kind of democracy that the regime itself is perpetuating and if wants to talk about why are we still in does he really think that the vast majority of again support that what is his assessment on does he really think that democracy can work without the moral law and political will never address these issues in a logical fashion he democracy provides countries like the us with a established path for power changing hands if you usually get your entertainment by reading nonsense and contradiction in the perhaps it is time for you to grab your munchies and read statement again and chew on it a bit can really tell us that has been really democratic even for the past seventy years or and why is silent about the rebels killing it has been reported that over killed by rebels since where is when you really need you even made an attempt to answer those issues perhaps this is why he is a slave to his own political passion and appetite perhaps this is why he has implicitly or indirectly given allegiance to the new world order

by on occidental observer the dismantling of the jungle refugee camp has been marked by huge scenes of disorder with at least one gang rape and much of the camp going up in flames but there has been uproar in too since the that most of the thousands of child refugees which the prime minister had agreed to were neither children nor refugees from the moment these strapping adult male migrants stepped off the bus in it was obvious that the people had been subjected to yet another massive immigration deception those who enabled and this child refugee scam are brazening it safe in the knowledge there will be no comebacks for them first they attempted to prevent any more embarrassing pictures by throwing blankets over the arrivals so they resembled state witnesses at a mafia trial then a screened walkway from the bus alighting point to the door of the reception was erected overnight for the same purpose dental tests to determine the real age of these youths were ruled out as an invasion of privacy and there is no question of having them so nothing can be done now here get over it but of it all works better if there is no from the public so the have resorted to the tried and tested method of stifling dissent anyone who sticks his head above the parapet to raise doubts is subjected to stern lectures about their moral shortcomings presenter chastised his fellow for their shameful while shadow home secretary abbot t attacked those who wanted to carry out dental tests to assess their age as racist pop singer lily became a media darling on behalf of the people of she made a tearful apology to the refugees for causing their plight let that sink in caused the plight of the refugees after voting for for ordinary who have seen their hospitals and welfare services strained to breaking a fresh influx of immigrants was not exactly what they had been looking forward to after has no legal or moral obligation to take these people they were supposed to be the responsibility of the first country they arrived at in the and why are they coming to racist its incredibly of them why not go to some or or this fresh burden will be placed squarely on the local authorities that receive the and they are going to have to dig deeply while the government is providing per annum for each young the total annual cost is around so tax increases or reduced services in other areas are predicted naturally little of this will fall on the prosperous boroughs filled with morally uplifted whites instead many migrants are being located in areas such as or poorer northern communities already thronging with such as the tipping point in the long battle to admit these bogus child refugees seems to have been a initiative in which more than religious leaders led by the former archbishop of lord and senior representatives from the and faiths signed a letter urging the prime minister to admit in a speech at a lord described the camp as a stain on the conscience but in this alleged support was not what it appeared to be it was largely by dozens of activists working through an called citizens that the casework and poured substantial resources into ensuring that the necessary amendments to the law would make it through parliament the jungle crisis has brought the community together in a unity of purpose rarely seen outside the occasion of various wars from the highest communal levels to the smallest youth it seems everyone has been in the cause of getting economic migrants into it is a campaign they have chosen to frame in entirely moral terms the loud insistence has been that not only is under a strict moral obligation to take these migrants but that there should be no upper limit to do otherwise would be to undermine our reputation as a humanitarian country that wishes to describe itself as their arguments have been formed around highly emotional anecdotes and images time and again we have been treated to stories of children struggling in the squalor at the jungle camp the iconic photographs of the lifeless body of boy washed up on a beach are frequently invoked you will notice that nowhere is there any consideration of the stress this is causing on existing especially those in the poorer areas where refugees are invariably housed nor is there any recognition of the profound unfairness this imposes on the native white community who will be required to support these strangers via the welfare health and housing services such a process is not only it makes a mockery of the basic idea that help from the welfare state is in return from previous tax contributions there is a largely unspoken reason for resentment over perceived inadequacy in admitting refugees before world war ii in admitted many tens of thousands of in the but it is an article of faith amongst many that could and should have admitted many more typical of this attitude was the speech of rabbi founder of the forum he says he lost over relatives in the holocaust and implied that wartime attitudes to refugees were to blame for this i feel obliged to ensure we make the same he said numerous references were made to the by which children from were smuggled into too has already debunked much of this greatly a veteran of that same is the figurehead for the refugee crusade year old lord dubs a veteran politician he has tirelessly campaigned for mass immigration all his life a former director of the refugee he somehow arrived in aged six in despite horrendous attitudes at the and was shown much charity since he has chosen to repay this kindness by devoting his life to opening borders to from around the globe according to refugees should have been processed at the first country they

via the telegraph by england health impact news wins her appeal but banned from telling the truth in court in march after being publicly humiliated and having her career torn to shreds by the general medical council pediatric and expert defense witness was found guilty of misleading her being dishonest and bringing the reputation of the medical profession into disrepute if the thought that that was the end of the then they were because less than eight months was back to appeal their and this she was not alone over three hundred scientists and lawyers write letter of protest after she had been discredited months scientists and lawyers rallied together in her and in an unprecedented move had written a letter of protest to the medical journal questioning the decision the reporting on the her supporters believe it is unprecedented to have so many distinguished scientists writing to the in support of a doctor signatories include prof peter the doctor who cut cot sir the pioneer of and prof an internationally renowned pathologist professionals were not the only ones demanding because since their the have been bombarded with petitions and letters from parents and supporters from all over the world one extremely powerful written by protecting innocent families we are writing in the defense of a pediatric who was struck off the medical register this week for practicing outside her area of ignoring the opinions of her and bringing the reputation of the medical profession into disrepute with her testimony and written opinions in a series of shaken baby cases she helped defend between and we know from personal experience that the prevailing model of shaken baby syndrome is a fact that is also supported by literature although shaking an infant can cause serious injury and the presence of the and retinal findings now associated with shaken baby syndrome does not prove which is the vital message brings to the debate we are dismayed that the council is sanctioning her for having the courage and intellectual honesty to express her own which are not popular but which are founded on solid scientific thinking and the best available evidence many of these diagnoses are based on the presence of findings retinal and that can be associated with a number of medical conditions and accidental trauma as well as inflicted injury it is a logical error to conclude that because abuse can cause the the presence of the findings proves abuse after writing several more equally powerful the authors continued by adding the declaration also scolds unfairly for her citations of the medical research in one she cited the early research of and colleagues shaken baby a and journal of neurosurgery to support her observation that shaking without impact has not been shown to generate sufficient forces to cause brain injury the panel wrote that had completely misinterpreted what had actually a conclusion that baffles us the paper was a landmark in the because it was the first attempt to test shaking theory and the results surprised even the who it was concluded that severe head injuries commonly diagnosed as shaking injuries require impact to occur and that shaking

the trump campaign is having a collective nervous breakdown after the letter about new emails failed to swing the election in his direction of the post tweeted a view from inside the trump my read of they know the path is very narrow they see the pub and but they scrambling map many of them describe the way to not as a direct shot but a series of upsets and bank of strong r showing depressed d turnout but list of hurdles goes on and on and highly organized early vote top hitting trail news also enthusing d voters what you seeing is a small group of aides who truly believe trump pitch can put new things in in spite of data the trump campaign is now that reality detached place where a few true believers are running the show this is why trump is going to spend the last week of his presidential campaign in blue states that he has no chance of winning trump still thinks that he can win and new might be the most laughable of three delusions because trump was routed in the republican primary and support from republicans like and walker has been lukewarm at best these are the final days that all losing campaigns go through when the nominee refuses to accept the likelihood of their defeat the letter move the needle for trump it give him a surge of national momentum or make the majority of voters rethink their support for the emails save so now he is going to waste his time campaigning in states that he will lose in search of a miracle as his poorly managed presidential bid stumbles to the finish line

by u plans to build relations and offer attention by gutting tenured shifting the teaching load to contingent redistributing salaries to and socking money into fancy facilities let me know how that works out by professor of economics and public university of and assistant department of university originally published at questions over the value of a university education are underscored by negative student experiences coaching is a but tool to improve student experiences and performance this column presents the results from an experiment comparing coaching with lower cost nudge interventions while coaching led to a significant increase in average course and text message interventions had no effect the benefits of coaching appear to derive from the nature of relationships and attention policymakers and academics share growing concerns about stagnating college completion rates and negative student experiences recent figures suggest that only of students who pursue a bachelors degree complete it within six years et and it is increasingly unclear whether students who attain degrees acquire meaningful new skills along the way and students enter college with those who do not study or have superficial attitudes about success performing particularly poorly et coaching to improve outcomes a promising tool for improving students college outcomes and experiences is coaching at both the high school and college an emerging recent literature demonstrates the benefits of helping students foster good study and skills through structured tutoring and coaching cook et find that cognitive therapy and tutoring generate large improvements in maths scores and high school graduation rates for troubled youth in while et show that and group activities lead to large increases in high school graduation and college among youth in a public housing project at the college scrivener and find that the accelerated study in associates program a bundle of and student success workshops in community colleges nearly doubled graduation rates and and baker show that telephone coaching by inside track professionals boosts college retention by across several institutions while support can have large effects on student it is often costly to implement and difficult to scale up to the student population at large noting this we set out to build on recent advances in and investigating whether technology and text and email messaging can be used to generate comparable benefits to coaching interventions but at lower costs among university students and several recent studies in find that appropriately timed interventions can have lasting effects on student outcomes and and relatively large improvements on academic performance have been documented from interventions that help students define their goals or purpose for learning et et teach the growth mindset idea that intelligence is malleable et and help students keep negative events in perspective by their values and in contrast to these other studies in education and economics attempt to maintain contact with students or their parents at a low cost by using technology to provide consistent reminders aimed at improving outcomes providing and phone call updates to parents about their students progress in school has been shown to boost both parental engagement and student performance and kraft and rogers mayer et while direct communication with college and university students has been used in attempts to increase financial aid renewal and page and improve academic outcomes and can alternatives to coaching be we examine whether benefits comparable to those obtained from coaching can be achieved at lower cost by either of two specific interventions and we examine a intervention designed to affirm students goals and purpose for attending and a text and email messaging campaign that provides weekly reminders of academic advice and motivation to students we work with a sample of more than undergraduate students who are enrolled in introductory economics courses at a large representative college in randomly assigning students to one of three treatment groups or a control group the treatment groups consist a exercise completed during the first two weeks of class in the the intervention plus text and email messaging throughout the full academic and the intervention plus coaching in which students are assigned to undergraduate students who act as coaches students in the control group are given a personality test measuring the big five personality traits figure our main results on course grades we find large positive effects from the coaching amounting to approximately a increase in average course we also find that coached students experience a increase in in we find no effects on academic outcomes from either the exercise or the text messaging even after investigating potentially heterogeneous treatment effects across several student including incoming high school and whether students live on residence figure main effects of interventions our results suggest that the benefits of personal coaching are not easily replicated by interventions using technology many successful coaching involve regular interaction facilitated either by mandatory meetings between coaches and students or proactive coaches regularly initiating contact and and baker cook et et our coaches initiated contact and built trust with students over in person and through text messaging through a series of the coaches could understand the problems students were facing and provide clear ending most conversations with students being able to take at least one specific action to help solve their current problems our text messaging campaign offered weekly academic resource and but did not initiate communication with individual students about specific issues help with writing or an upcoming the team often invited students to reply to messages and share their concerns but was unable to do this with the same efficacy as a nor were we able to establish the same rapport with students our inability to reach out to all students and softly guide the conversation likely prevented us from learning the important details of their specific problems although we provided answers and advice to the questions we we did not have as much information on the students backgrounds as our coaches and thus could not tailor our responses to each students specific circumstances our coaches were also able to build trust with students by
