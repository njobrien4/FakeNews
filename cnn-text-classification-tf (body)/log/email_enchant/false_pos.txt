asked to tell us what is happening the last time i asked him he told me that he say he was staring at a cps worker when he said this we have the impression that the kids are too afraid to say anything because all of our visitations are monitored by cps workers they listen to everything we all say about 5 visitations aurora was weeping the entire time she kept stopping to whisper to us that she want to tell us why because the cps workers were listening to her before we had to leave that she just curled up in a ball while i want to go their ability to report escape abuse is very much hindered also

neurologist told us to if he had another seizure tried to say the seizure was mild and no big but from what she described to me on the it did not sound like a mild seizure the lack of adequate response by workers had devastating consequences on his health on had a neurology where she says she learned that the reason for seizure the previous week was because the group home failed to give him his daily medication says that during the she was informing of his rights to talk to the judge or his and wrote down some information for him on a note reports that let have the and when he tried to record his mothers advice for his allegedly put her hand over the recorder and called for security social worker photo taken at the recent neurology appointment for boys depressed and abused want to

him i told him how everyone loved his poem that we are listening please pray for his siblings to be returned to their loving home where they before the children write and draw on a board during visits wrote on the board at the i wanna go back to my real provided by children continue to suffer in foster care continued to report to health impact news about how her children are suffering in state the kids have been so sick ever since they were taken the cps worker says that she is their advocate the one looking out for their needs not only is she not getting them the medical care that they she is lying to us about their health we are powerless over this we have to sit hands mouths forced to watch them suffer but not being able to alleviate it they need that is why god chose our family for hes equipped us to care for them they need us now at one aurora had a severe stomach ache and was crying at the next aurora was so she talk during the visit when the cps worker was answering my aurora was writing down the answers correcting her after i asked her why aurora said that aurora sick she then said that aurora on any medication to that aurora wrote the response taking to make me when i questioned about aurora not seeing a doctor after complaining about intense abdominal pain the week before at aurora wrote down that she had thrown up a few days prior to the visitation during one when changed her toddlers she was distressed when she discovered a rash on her daughters body from her chest to her feet even more was the fact that the social workers allegedly tried to dissuade from even changing her saying they would do it later families have reported that cps would label parents with abuse and neglect had the child been in the and why is not abuse and neglect when it happens in state what is r going on with cps and foster there are still many readers who read stories like this one there must be more to the and cps would not take children away from good parents without just cause while its nice to believe that cps only rescues truly abused and severely neglected children from awful this just the case over of cps cases nationwide are neglect cases due to simply based on the biased opinion of the caller or social worker that some basic necessities are being denied once children are moved into foster the states cps system can start receiving federal funds for foster social medical etc for all those who derive a living from this industry are we punishing poverty at the expense of future using children as a commodity to create job security for cps and family child kidnapping and a lucrative business funded by taxpayers called foster care have we allowed the state the dictate the standards for material possessions each member of a family must possess for liberty and the pursuit of the and their supporters agree that the removal of their children is not only a violation of their civil and constitutional rights but has caused unjustifiable trauma and abuse to their children and unnecessary stress and hardship to their family this is the type of cps abuse that many families across the country who contact us face every day until cps is exposed for what it truly is a and adoption business and until families across the world demand that those they elect no family is safe from the tyranny which cps agents can unleash on them should their family ever come into cps sights so many things are uncertain right now so much so much scary crazy stuff we cant understand how something so terrible can happen we understand how it can happen to so many families and continue without massive outcry but what we do is that god is a solid rock we know that we can trust him we know that our time here on earth will be spent allowing him to work through us our eternity will be in with our safe tucked away for his glory as we must obey rather than man the abuses in cps and foster care have been exposed even in the mainstream media in for more information
