zero hedge we have written frequently in recent weeks about a feud that erupted between and band back in after raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest between band the foundation and the state department here here and here the feud ultimately resulted in band being forced to draft a memo spelling in vivid the many entangled relationships between the foundation and the state department today dump included that memo which for the first the precise financial flows between the bands firm and the private business endeavors the memo starts with a brief background on which was created in shortly after resigned from his position as states economic envoy to northern a position to which he was appointed by secretary in consulting was founded by served as coo of consulting until when he stepped down and established consulting at that he also became the united states economic envoy to northern pursuant to the terms of his exit agreement with and consistent with the ethics agreement of his uncompensated special government employee appointment at the state retained and continued to provide services to three paying clients and and one pro client in late retained me as a consultant to consulting to help support the needs of these clients in may resigned his envoy position at the state department in and i founded strategies closed consulting and shifted its clients to throughout the past almost years since president left i have sought to leverage my including my partner role at to support and to raise funds for the foundation this memorandum strives to set forth how i have endeavored to support the foundation and president personally in a subsequent section of the memo entitled for the band spells all of the donations he solicited from for the foundation in there are roughly of donations listed with the largest contributors being the foundation and laureate international universities the donations from chemical are particularly notable for several reasons because of other emails revealed by and other we now know that chemical was granted special access to then secretary back in at the same time he was embroiled in ongoing litigation with another foundation over a failed that would have netted in cash as band notes in his month after being granted special access to secretary invited president and band out for a day of golf shortly after his meeting with secretary and golf outing with president decided to donate to the global initiative convenient timing for all involved in august of invited to play golf with president and me subsequently asked to become a sponsor at the which they did as well as making a donation to the foundation for president to attend a dinner in the story gets even more bizarre when band reveals in the following footnote that provided the chemical plane to fly president and his staff from new to and then to north for their golf outing we would assume this is a simple typo by band he just geographically this certainly raises a whole other set of questions for bill provided the plane to fly president and his staff to and from for our trip and north as a private the foundation had to pay the costs of in kind contribution saved the foundation in excess of according to the caller chemical paid million in and million in for a variety of of bill was an honorary chairman of as was set to be paid million for that position even though he ultimately only kept because of the scandals that erupted around the including their advisory relationship with global band also offers the following commentary on the million in he was able to secure for bill of as well as the million in future should he choose to continue with those independent of our and activities on behalf of the we have dedicated ourselves to helping the president secure and engage in activities including and advisory service engagements in that we have in effect served as managers and implementers to secure business and advisory service deals in support of the presidents we also have solicited and as services for the president and his family for personal vacation and the like neither nor i are separately compensated for these activities we do not receive a fee or percentage the more than million in activity we have personally helped to secure for president to date or the million in future should he choose to continue with those with respect to business deals for his advisory and i developed and brought to president multiple arrangements for him to accept or reject of his current we secured all of we have helped manage and maintain all of his business relationships since president business arrangements have yielded more than million for him with million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements a big part of those activities was a annual payment from laureate millions in speaking fees arranged by band here is a simpler recap from the nick this band in the latest is the stone of the foundation complex nick band i am not get fully compensated for all of the stuff i do for so you should let me do everyone wins nick you could so if band gets his clients to pop over money to a why is that nick but consider that band was selling his clients on idea that giving to foundation in a way to bolster their influence nick band built a platform for executives to bolster their bathe in and do some while nick extracted earnings for band depending on what you see in these himself paid until late nick i guess you can wave it all off as a but and some of other aides were clearly freaking out nick the emails show closest troubled or horrified by things that her surrogates have spent years waving off nick with we look forward to explanation of

why does everyone love it hard to say her unfavorable ratings have hit that makes her more popular than the bubonic plague bin corpse it not much to go on but the decided to run a piece by is so widely your response to seeing the name was probably huh unless you a gender studies student at an ivy in which case you know exactly who she is and love her is a novelist whose should all be is big in those circles the campaign is unbearably awkward and this panegyric by was an obvious attempt to channel some of that canned poetry and like most it fails badly there are howlers are millions who admire the tapestry of and are people when becomes the first woman to be president of the united will weep from it not quite a hymn to comrade nor is it getting there by any means except a tow truck and then there the phrasing oh the phrasing was guilty immediately when she stepped into the view of the public as the first lady of this is an awkward attempt to channel that but instead it reads like a manual badly translated from the the piece is full of lines that straddle the border between propagandistic and just bad writing was a lawyer full of was guilty of not being a traditional first lady she offended the old patriarchal then there the theme of the which is to just deny reality conservative writer labeled her a congenital liar when she was first and the label stuck because it was repeated over and it was a convenient label to harness misogyny if she was a then the hostility she engendered could not possibly be because she was a first lady who refused to be still and silent liar has during this election even though a respected source of information about has certified that she is more honest than most the perfect timing for that defense would have been not right after shouted at a rally that she had been in new on but do worry is more honest than most politicians a site supporting her said so other words have been repeated over and with no until they have begun to breathe and thrum with life especially emails the press coverage of emails has become an unclear morass where emails must mean something if only because of how often it is how about or or of regulations dealing with the handling of classified that got lots of context or people who love know that the it system at the state department is old and nothing like a smooth whirl was used to her and wanted to keep using it when she became secretary of people who love know that she love high tech blackberry love blackberry she is a lawyer full of dreams who fights for the children of migrant workers and loves their smooth whirl thrums with life says her blackberry is more honest than the has many dreams of thrumming blackberries whirling smoothly that offend the traditional stodgy patriarchal order it system conservative media saw an opportunity to blow the emails story out of soon almost by the rest of the is that how it works in because that not how it works in is no objective basis on which to equate to her they both they need oxygen to they better writers than people who love see the failings of the general where news entertains rather than informs they bristle when benign stories about her are covered with an ominous they bristle and they hug their blackberry and weep for they fear that the patriarchal stodgy it systems will prevent from being the thrumming first lady of north know that she is a bit too but they understand that she has to that she cannot afford you would think with all those six figure she could afford a little actions so falsely that she leaned into wrapped herself in a kind of caution that sometimes makes her appear stilted and wrapped in her her whirling blackberry in one she bristled at the retracting her quills and occasionally hissing in an informed fashion for the children of migrant workers who admired the tapestry of her past are millions of who do not have the expectation that a politician be perfect they are frustrated that is allowed no complexity get on the phone i think has got another hit

by health impact staff and say they are heartbroken they say their children are heartbroken also their children are remaining in state even though there are no abuse or neglect and even though the children are suffering and want to come home the children remain in public school and state despite judge harts previous ruling to allow the children to be see previous judge allows mother to her own children denies request to vaccinate children while in state custody judge hart ruled on that the children should continue to while in state custody for purposes of consistency to keep the children in the same school setting they were in before entering state custody since they will continue to be once they go and added that the children would be going home according to when cps defied judge harts ruling to allow the children to continue to the were certain that judge hart would have no option but to send the children home on and punish the social workers who defied his ruling see previous cps defies judges order to keeps children in public school but when they went to court on the said it was like judge hart was a completely different person than he had been during the adversary hearing in and rather than dealing with cps refusal to the the hearing focused only on presenting a lengthy list of services the must complete before they can get their children home and out of public school and state custody with some of his children during a cps supervised visit and maintain that their children should never have been taken into state custody in the first and that the list of cps services they must now complete are a not only a waste of but also a waste of since there never was any abuse or and cps allegedly never even substantiated any of their allegations although there were some supervision concerns since their old escape artist got into the front yard momentarily without their the say that their daughter getting into the yard alone was an accident could happen to any and once they learned of locks were immediately added to the garage doors to prevent any further escapes the are outraged that their lives have been turned upside their children abused and traumatized in state their reputation slandered in the and the main who called cps and started this entire ordeal is not even a credible according to the caller that called cps to begin ended up changing her story several times under oath was discovered to be a manufacturer who sells is a felon with a long criminal record that may have been on drugs when she made that cps report that started this nightmare children remain in custody as recalled that at the close of the adversary hearing on judge hart declared that he saw nothing to necessitate terminating parental and that his only concerns were some supervision issues that could be easily fixed even though there was no substantiated abuse or judge hart ruled that the children had to remain in saying his hands were tied because the family left in before bringing the children in for cps even though there was no court order preventing the family form leaving the and they allegedly did nothing illegal by doing so the explain that they left to protect their children from the overzealous cps worker who was harassing them at home and traumatizing the children the also contend and they have spoken with attorneys who agree that the children were illegally extradited from back to according to the cps has defied judges broken and committed perjury over and yet they suffer no consequences the who claim their only wrongdoing was making a mistake and not noticing when their followed continue to suffer at the hands of a corrupt system are the being made an example of because they left and exposed corruption within the family believes that judge harts ruling to keep the children in state care is retaliation because the they continue to expose the corruption of cps and the family court system studies have shown that children are worse off in foster homes than if they remained in a troubled and many argue that foster care itself is a form of child causing emotional trauma for children in despair for her i think my body could make this many tears their joy is gone their happy faces are sad now oh heavenly please lord please let anything happen to are they living with genuinely abused kids that are acting out towards my husband i are supposed to just sit hands tied not help were to hang tight knowing that abused kids possibly sicko adults are living amongst them in the heavily populated group for more information on grim foster care the foster care modern day slavery and child trafficking no consequence for cps defying it was shocking to the that cps could get away with defying the judges previous ruling about homeschooling their children according to cps said that they tried to find a curriculum but were unsuccessful they mentioned something about a schooling option to do at the foster homes but that each kid had to have a laptop in order to do it so it was not an option they say they also said that they spoke to homeschooling coalition that they offer anything that would allow cps to take the kids to for their schooling they said that they find a foster family willing to the children they said that the kids are doing really well in school they said that they having any behavioral issues they said

searched for a partial match to see whether he had a relative in the database they got lucky the man had a brother in which led authorities to the assailant the is one of a handful of cases that authorities have quietly solved in recent years using a controversial technique that scours an offender database for a son or brother of an elusive crime suspect the state early success using familial searches to identify the serial killer led police chief beck to predict that the method would the way policing is done in the united civil liberty groups expressed saying the searches raised significant ethical and privacy concerns some questioned their legality since familial has made more modest progress than beck predicted but has also gained wider respect eight other states have followed formally embracing the technique as a tool and though many opponents still express approach has won over some previous skeptics who say they are impressed with the state strict policies limiting its use and the measured successes using the method helped detectives in the state identify two including the grim and five men wanted for sexual according to the attorney general office early last authorities arrested a county man accused of sneaking into children bedrooms and cutting holes in their pajamas before molesting them a few months a man was arrested on suspicion of raping and sodomizing a woman along a bike path a county judge in sentenced a man to life in prison for raping a coffee shop employee then barricading her inside a refrigerator lab officials look for a

leading authority on the technique that could help officials identify more distant relatives and track down criminals who are in the he said technology is demonstrable said pioneered the use of familial for crime solving more than a decade ago in one of the earliest detectives reopened the killing of a woman in wales and compared from the assailant to genetic profiles in database of known offenders in they got a partial match to a boy the teen was alive at the time of the but detectives used the clue to focus on his who eventually pleaded guilty to the murder despite that conviction and the technology took some time to catch on in the and was used only sporadically among its earliest uses was the arrest of the serial which came after officials subpoenaed a tissue sample from his daughter pap smear taken at a medical clinic times a familial test led to the arrest of l shown making a court appearance via video in the torture and serial murder case in by an impassioned debate on the technology was percolating at the capitol in gov jerry brown then the state attorney general began fielding letters and visits from urging him to consider using familial his were concerned approving the method might cause federal judges to shut down the whole database on constitutional grounds in brown enacted a comprehensive familial policy making the first state in the country to do so under the familial is only to be used as a when all other investigative angles have been exhausted so the state department of justice has run familial many of them repeat such as in the grim sleeper case an initial search turned up but state officials ran another scan in a partial match came back to a man added to the database after a arrest for firearm and drug offenses detectives zeroed in on the man franklin who lived close to where many of the bodies were dumped in south detectives believe franklin killed at least women over more than two decades he was sentenced to death in august

but the growing popularity of the technique has raised alarms for some privacy such as chief attorney for the forensic division of the office of the public defender mercer successfully lobbied for his state formal ban on familial searches is the only other jurisdiction to prohibit them outright searching for relatives through partial matches is he and raises concerns about the amendment prohibition

views comments guest posts by my friend roger is a staunch democrat supporter he is in his seventies and has always voted democrat him and i have had countless discussions over the many years that we have known each other his paternal roots are and he sees himself to be on the left side of but of him and i have not been able to see on the race to the issue he is with the view that has inherited a financial and military disaster and did the best he and that he should not be blamed for his failure to perform as many did after his elaborate and successful yes we can slogan he supported and other domestic reform and this is perhaps where roger and i stop to agree and start to disagree including look at the appalling record of the republican party and try to paint a tainted image of it the party that is affectionately called the grand old party or the by its own staunch supporters certainly has enough such records to put it up there with charges of global mayhem and genocide the has given birth to people like the and of who can forget is another character that comes to one that no thinking man could trust with a a federal senator who commands authority that no one seems to be able to either understand the mandate or challenge at the end of the infamous line republican well at least thus enter trump and what a character he need one say god forbid if this article may be read like a defense of the the is run by the rich and the and as described by w bush by the haves and have more it is the party of dick who saw in an opportunity to generate contracts for if tens of hundreds of thousands of had to die for him to achieve his he would not and did not blink this is the party that condones and feeds it is the party that has huge control over the media it is the party that runs the world like it is a business enterprise and whether the rest of the world likes it or until the current global status quo no political party in the world affects the rest of the world like the ruling party in the united states whilst elections in other countries are domestic affairs that affect domestic politics of the country elections have implications that are not only domestically but have a much further global reach that encompasses every corner of the world as a i am much more concerned about the wider global implications of politics than the domestic ones this is not to say that i am indifferent about and the people as a matter of not only do i have close friends who live in but also close family members and i have grave concerns for all mankind in every corner of the by my interest in politics remains focused on foreign policy and to this i am only able to relate to the choice between the major two parties from the perspective of their foreign policies as insists to be the world police and the a stature many are refusing to accept that they have already it must accept what comes with it and concede that the rest of the world is hoping that the people will choose the better candidate as the new or should i say the one who is less harmful to the world in between and who fits the this is the question enough has been recently said about
