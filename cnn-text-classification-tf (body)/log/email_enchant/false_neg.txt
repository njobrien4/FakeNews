an email i received from a reader some time ago has begun to haunt me the sister was dying of cancer she asked would i respond to the word in the context of a cancer my correspondent did not gloss over the miseries of her terminal state she outlined a series of horrific tests that led doctors to withhold food she described infections and the caused by edema but then she testified to her uncanny ability brighten any with her smiles had i received this query while i was undergoing my first it would have triggered irritation bordering on apoplexy why should a cancer patient be expected to lift her own spirits or anyone it hard enough dealing with such dire circumstances without having to become a booster for oneself and for one scholar of cancer decries tyranny of that gets too many patients making us feel guilty about expressing understandable anguish during the intervening i have interacted with friends as they confronted an irreversible condition and have witnessed a kind of grace that i found inspiring while coping with these people contested it and sometimes the medical protocols upon which they had to rely yet when bodily functions shut few of them dug in and battled a condition pronounced terminal their sense of seemed to be founded on acceptance of their impending mortality what might have contributed to their patent and patient and given my own impatience with circumstances beyond my could i possibly tap such catholic and protestant authorities agree on the mysterious nature of which they see as a free and undeserved or gratuitous not a reward a disposition that works to perfect the grace cannot be known or acquired through beliefs or deeds in the the word for appears in the benediction the lord be gracious to though the word for is used more frequently to denote an unmerited gift for believers who seek this benefit from as for nonbelievers who seek it grace remains a highly elusive but highly desirable especially in troubled times people with cancer explore all the activities that people without cancer use to make themselves receptive to a sense of beneficence or loving religious private breathing and body verse or mantra making or looking at listening to or making walking in communing with and alcohol or marijuana those engaged daily in one or more of these practices testify to their efficacy a zillion books offer instructions some of but the trick must consist in finding own eccentric way my correspondent had glimpsed grace in her smiles also found it in an obituary that a beth had composed for herself while she was dying of and she included a link to it the eerie opening died prefaces a description of ms life and then her conclusion that the end grace and love not it reminded me of the first i had read after a recurrence of the author and editor lotter posted an essay in which she recalled the high points of her education and career because she wanted to be about having a full rather than about having to she closed with thanks for her family and ended with happy to have been might the introspection and retrospection of writing serve as one source of grace that transforms it from a gift received to a gift after my friend pep died of metastatic colon his in the local paper brought tears to my eyes it was as if i heard his voice from beyond the grave the act of composition must have composed providing an opportunity to reflect on his to express appreciation of his family and and to make peace with the posthumous presence he would become in common the word means ease of a style that charms those who observe it a scholar of many pep would have known that it derives from the which mean pleasing or and that it gave rise to the and the by virtue of his gracious pep bestowed a gift of grace on his family and friends i cannot imagine attaining a durable state of grace throughout the ordeals that will surely arrive in the future i consider practicing a series of brief grace notes the musical notation of these short notes is printed in smaller type to indicate an ornament and with a slur mark linking them to the note they a fleeting sound before a longer lasting duration that immediately follows to they look like a tiny bounce or skip forward there must be as many ways to play grace notes as there are people in the world what might they i in this i give thanks for the time that remains to resist animosity and i want to devote it to becoming proficient at all sorts of grace notes before the chords of closure resound into silence
in his early years as a m was once asked about the most effective way to fight organized crime at the had made a name for himself as a united states attorney by indicting more than 100 mafia figures raised a novel strategy we ought to declare a moratorium on the prosecution of organized crime for five to 10 he told victor s for a new times magazine article in 1970 let them become so rich that they will give up their predatory instincts and be much more concerned about getting their children into law medical school and so and have lost their he never did declare that moratorium his years of doing battle with crime in all forms were just beginning now 97 and still working five days a was the district attorney for from 1975 until he retired at age 90 in during which time crime in new was completely and the city with it there were 648 murders in the year he took office when he there were 58 it was the kind of transformation no one at the time could have imagined robberies and property crimes similarly fell sharply parks and whole neighborhoods were reinvented people who were dedicated to killing one another found other ways to settle their disputes on a recent lunch hour in his office at the firm was at a loss to explain just how it had all happened theory was prompt and certain prosecution and he said you commit a the chances of you being arrested were pretty good and be prosecuted promptly i believe in long sentences crime came down all but it came down much more in than any other place in the city or state we went from being the no 1 borough for murders to no 4 i never claimed credit for the drop in because i thought if crime goes back up they can blame me so i never stuck my neck his office in midtown where he has worked since faintly echoed the clutter of his former with stacks of papers covering the desk and and no computer in sight the lunch was sandwiches and salads he recalled a night from his first months on the when he sat in a surveillance van on the lower east side of and watched dealers sell drugs as a uniformed patrolman stood idly by were getting away with he said the police department really looking at any murders north of 96th street that was where it was walled off a severed head was found on avenue in the nobody was investigating to see who it was or what happened it news it the numbers from his tenure are staggering a oversaw by his count 3 5 million and he won nine elections and served under five he hired assistant district m john f r more than 80 of his prosecutors went on to be judges better or said he brought cases against international drug money the murderer of john the chambers and the son who swindled millions from he was in a cardigan with a gruff mouth and sometimes mismatched socks his prosecutors won hundreds of millions in settlements and judgments against including l the former chief executive of international whose luxuries included a shower they also wrongfully prosecuted five young and men for the rape and beating of a jogger in central park was remarkably said president of john jay college of criminal who was also a mayoral adviser and deputy commissioner of legal matters for the police department during parts of tenure had a reputation for making tough calls and putting his name and reputation on the in most elections he ran uncontested became the model for the first district attorney on played by who the real district attorney thought was pretty good was mad at said he came down to see and i had lunch with him and i told if you ever decide to let me know in advance the report was he was getting an episode i was he resigned without telling when in left he told reporters he did not know what he would do but he was not ready to hang it up got an email from my older brother who said this is a bad time to be looking for a he said morris was born in into a family that rose to great public influence through public service his grandfather henry was president ambassador to where he unsuccessfully urged the united states to intervene in the slaughter of his henry was treasury secretary under his friend president franklin d and persuaded the reluctant administration to intercede belatedly in the slaughter of the second of three grew up on the upper west side of and in upstate new among the and the used to cook for he volunteering a story he has told before have some pictures of me cooking hot dogs for the queen but the most exciting thing for me was when brought down to our farm in my my came into navy yard and i got a weekend pass and i came home i made them mint his father and the president planned to open a restaurant together if political career went said for some reason has never got any he said was going to be the and my father was going to be the chief chef they actually bought the for the young his public service career began with world war where he served on a destroyer that was sunk by torpedo then on another that spent almost two months under constant aerial attack those more than his relationship with the shaped his said who is writing a family biography of the the future district attorney spent much of the and coping with undiagnosed until president john f tapped him to be a united states attorney in 1961 in his midtown said only that his brushes with death in the war drove him to something useful with the rest of my as a united states built a reputation first for taking on the mafia and and later for not leaving the job when a republican m took office and wanted him gone instead he pursuing cases that involved campaign donors and telling reporters that if the president had asked him to stay he would have resigned immediately when he took over the district there were fewer than 300 many without desk and crime was beginning a historic climb he directed his resources toward violent which dominated the public mind he reorganized the department so the same prosecutor took on a case from arraignment to cutting the time for felony cases to 18 weeks from 32 weeks he started a career criminal program to go after the repeat offenders who commit a disproportionate share of and added the first sex crimes a unit for gun crimes and a branch office in then a hotbed of crime buzzwords that occur to me are ethics and said m president of the citizens crime commission and a former prosecutor under from day 1 you understood that there were and you cross them and independence he was willing to yield power he never overruled anything i if there were mistakes along the like the wrongful 1990 prosecution of five young men on charges of raping and brutalizing a jogger in central now had little interest in revisiting them a matter of policy i look he said i wish done though there were some things i should have done but i mean i think i did everything i just try to close that of the central park which were vacated after 12 years when a serial rapist followed by an eventual settlement of million to the five would say only that his office had erred but corrected the mistake when the new evidence emerged i feel he said i felt badly we had screwed up but there were confessions had complete confidence in he referring to the prosecutor who supervised the case out to be misplaced but we rectified ms who now writes crime novels and conducts training sessions with the district has defended the prosecution and investigation as sound culpa does not satisfy critics like l a defense lawyer who often went up against his including in the appeal of one of the central park five tenure almost precisely tracked the era of mass said was the dean and he could have used his moral authority to change that and he was silent he was an active contributor to mass said that on the he avoided seeking long sentences for offenders and that he instructed his staff not to prosecute people arrested on marijuana charges but he defended the strategy of prosecuting offenders like because killers or rapists tended to commit lesser crimes as well and as violent crime fell in the late with the end of the crack cocaine shifted the resources to securities and other often entering turf battles with federal prosecutors in his last five his office recovered more than billion from settlements and forfeitures though he was accused of losing focus on neighborhood he had pursued those difficult cases a kid on the street can stick up a but he put his money he all these people driving around in fancy and you had to show them that justice was for his successes earned him enemies and occasional threats was pretty fatalistic about he said worry about the professional because i figured they knew what they were doing and been through the system what i worried about was the said he got the most threatening letters when his office prosecuted the new giants wide receiver who in 2008 accidentally shot himself at a and later pleaded guilty to gun charges he the risk they were in his current has been lobbying to ease immigration laws and improve mental health care for military and helping the death penalty appeal in of who was convicted in 1988 on testimony from witnesses who later proved unreliable still reports to work god he said he gets on the treadmill most days and wears a heart monitor the stacks of paper in the office rise familiarly around his van has been with him since he became district attorney when his cellphone rang during the lunch the voice on the other end was loud enough to carry across the table his a former reporter for the new times and the author of and answering the call just calling to say i love the voice blared he told her appreciate as codas to a highly effectual public his current projects seem almost especially his push for looser immigration which is unlikely to succeed in a trump administration standpoint payback he referring to the good fortune his family has starting with his immigrant grandfather like what and i think what doing is important i may be kidding he admitted that none of his projects were going well and like everyone else in new he is trying to make sense of a changing one in whose changes he played a part the streets are but monstrosities have gone and the prices are out of with money flaunt it the way they do he continued just think the huge no communication between them and the street no sense of community you feel it i think he remembered his childhood at 35 west 81st sandwiched between the avenue elevated train and the eighth avenue streetcar pride ourselves on how modern we but we had better local transportation than we do he said fact that there was an el there kept the property values down but as a child it was an attraction you wake up at 2 in the morning and hear a train rumbling by and you felt secure in an odd it was as close as he came to pining for a bygone and as quickly as the sentiment rose it was gone again after more than half a century as a knows you lose some then gather yourself to fight another day because if you that would be the time to start worrying and unlike his he simply go into reruns not anyway

president legacy looked on not long to include a major push against deeply entrenched housing segregation in his administration rolled out a rule requiring local communities to assess their own patterns of racial and income segregation and make genuine plans to address them the move followed years of debate and came as segregated cities like and faced renewed bouts of racial unrest the federal advocates was finally trying to repair a promise of the 1968 fair housing act now that rule is likely to be undermined and possibly erased by a department of housing and urban development headed by on j trump officially offered the cabinet post to a neurosurgeon and a former presidential who grew up poor in but has no experience in housing policy while we know little about what would do at the he has played down the role of government in his own story you his mother taught according to his autobiography have only yourself to and he has specifically criticized the housing rule known as furthering fair the rule has been politically contentious its backers argue that it is essential to remedying the long history of government and discrimination that has resulted in segregated neighborhoods persisting to this day critics say that the rule amounts to government overreach into the decisions and demographic makeup of individual communities and a free housing market republicans in congress have tried to its implementation wrote last year that the new policy followed the history of failed and would redirect housing primarily into white communities that oppose it if he is confirmed by would have wide latitude to shape or slow the of the along with broader enforcement of the fair housing act the president of the national low income housing said interpretation of the rule as a social experiment a fundamental misunderstanding of obligations that have been around since the fair housing act passed that year included two one banning discrimination in the housing and the other requiring local communities to the goal of integration the latter language means that not enough to punish landlords or communities who intentionally deny minorities housing communities also have a responsibility to actively ensure open housing which exist today neither in public housing clusters on segregated south side nor in exclusive new city suburbs that use zoning laws to outlaw multifamily housing and jack past republican acknowledged that second implication of the law but for much of the time since the fair housing act was this mandate has been largely ignored by both local communities and itself the administration rules were an effort to address that oversight and some advocates have spent just as long fighting for it recently told fox news that cannot have a strong nation if we have weak inner is the very insight that motivated senator another republican to include a provision in the 1968 fair housing act requiring counties and states to further fair as a condition of receiving federal a lawyer with the law firm wrote in an email the administration rule nothing like the partisan caricatures that have sprung up around said of the poverty and race research action council many advocates wanted the rule to be much tougher than what emerged from several years of debate with local communities in the rule provides those communities with detailed data on factors like racial poverty school quality and housing voucher use to help them determine whether and minority families are isolated from good schools or segregated from opportunity the rule requires communities to use that information to draft plans to reduce segregation where it exists those that habitually defy the requirements risk lose funding from the agency the first round of communities scheduled to complete the process have been at work on assessments due over the coming year before a new administration hostile to the idea could begin writing another rule that would reverse this or it could simply halt implementation or congress could pass a law even as it remains on the books for all the years that went into shaping the a new administration could relatively easily set it aside that would also fundamentally change the conversation in about how segregated communities came to exist in their current incarnation and other critics call efforts to dismantle them but these places were created through policies that can themselves be labeled social redlining that denied blacks policies that concentrated public housing in minority government decisions to locate highways that isolated them further while many of these policies were first put into place decades communities remain shaped by them today the mandate was based on the idea that this history of active government intervention requires an active government too a theme of campaign was that structural forces hinder workers in the rust belt and beyond the decline of the lack of educational the opioid at would have ample opportunity to show whether he believes that structural forces undermine poor urban minorities historic troubled and if government should take an active role in pursuing a remedy
j trump sat down on with editors and columnists of the new times for an exclusive interview times reporters have annotated portions of the interview the full transcript is available here the personal interactions between president and trump have so far been but not clear that the moment will last has already indicated that he may weigh in against trump once the new administration takes especially if the new president attacks legacy achievements here is our story on the cordial meeting between trump and in the oval office trump is working to reset his mercurial relationship with the media as he looks toward assuming starting with this meeting at what he branded the new during his presidential campaign but he still nurses intense grievances toward news outlets in general and the times in particular here is more about relationships with the news media and the times trump is hinting that even though federal law does not require him to do anything specific to separate himself from his vast business he is inclined to submit to some sort of voluntary standard of ethics that would avoid conflicts of interest or their appearance but he leaves open the possibility that there may not be a way to accomplish it this story has more about business ties trump is correct that federal for the most exempts the president from conflict of interest meaning he is allowed to take actions that could benefit his financial holdings but in modern most presidents have voluntarily put their financial assets into blind trusts trump has said he does not intend to take such a instead will turn his companies over to his children read this story for more on potential conflicts of interest the wall street journal editorial among has suggested that the only solution to potential conflicts of interest is to sell off all of his and then have a blind trust reinvest the proceeds trump suggests that this is not practical crowds at rallies frequently targeted chanting her and referring to her as a criminal in trump himself encouraged a crowd in telling them starting to agree with as they chanted her in despite remarks the and the justice which have investigated email server and the conduct criminal inquiries largely independently of the white house a president attempting to intervene in those kinds of in any would be a major scandal here is our full story about reversal on prosecuting trump has been criticized for not specifically denouncing bigotry and groups that spread bigoted views his statements about such conduct tend to be including when he says disavow the that nonspecific language has been comforting to leaders of the a white nationalist including b who led a gathering at a federal building near the white house last weekend that included some audience members offering a salute trump here perhaps for the first that being president will perhaps help enrich his family he also concedes that the arrangement might fairly be called a conflict of interest back in when he was still a trump said definitively that torture was effective tell me it work torture he told an audience in south you half these believe it works so answer on offered a revealing insight into his willingness to shift or rethink a especially after talking with someone he respects gen n may well be secretary of and his rejection of torture clearly had an effect on the the reality is more complicated the number of factories and the number of who work in factories both have declined sharply in recent decades but the manufacturing output is at the highest level in history the production of like has been replaced by the largely automated production of like circuits in president signed a landmark law that prohibited the hiring of illegal provided new resources for enforcement along the border and offered legal status to several million illegal immigrants experts say the law did little to slow migration to the united but made crossing the border more difficult and dangerous premiums for many health plans under the affordable care act are increasing 20 percent to 40 percent or but increases of 100 percent are extremely rare deductibles for many plans are but not for a family plan in the maximum including the is comments about his fellow republicans had a sharp edge and an implicit they owe their congressional majority to and he expects to be treated accordingly whether this is and to what will be one of the pivotal stories of the new trump and crucial to figuring out how much or how little he can get done he needs congress to achieve many of the campaign promises he including the deep tax cut and large infrastructure spending not to mention and it is an open question how with his policies republicans will prove to be read these stories for background on relationships with republican leaders in and the stalwarts who are pondering the future of the conservative movement trump suggests here that he may name his as a special envoy to the middle charged with making peace between the and the buried in this answer is an assertion by trump that the federal law does not apply to him as but he also says he would want to avoid the appearance of conflict installing as a special envoy could have that essentially giving him an important task that would allow him to be involved in national security deliberations without hiring him outright this is a role that was often discussed as a potential landing spot for bill if had won the white house
if you think back to this presidential campaign and recall a lot of articles mentioning email troubles and j various you be wrong if it seems there were fewer articles about the economy and because there were the temptation to blame news organizations for this imbalance is but there is at least some reason to resist it critics have long assailed campaign coverage as focused too much on candidate campaign strategy and assessments of instead of on policies and ideas but this the candidates share the blame i compared the content of campaign ads with the content of news articles about two specific candidate traits or and the economy or jobs both the candidates and news organizations spent more time discussing the fitness for office lack of than they did the economy and the imbalance grew more lopsided as the election approached using analytic tools provided by crimson i categorized the campaign news coverage of 23 media outlets this consisted of four broadcast three cable news national public radio and on the two news and 12 newspapers i specifically searched for news about campaign and her email server or her campaign and and several controversies connected to campaign things like trump the khan family and the i also looked for news about the campaign appeals on the economy and jobs this list but it gives a sense of the between coverage of these controversies and the economy the controversies received more on than their views on the economy from until election 38 percent of the stories mentioned various and 35 percent mentioned email only 17 percent mentioned trump and jobs or the and only 10 percent cited campaign and the economy closer to the from 8 the numbers got even more lopsided this was an important date just after the release of the video and a few weeks before director b letter to congress from this 53 percent of the campaign articles mentioning either controversies or the economy discuss while only 6 percent mention her alongside jobs or the economy as for 31 percent mention his while 10 percent mention him related to jobs and the economy the imbalance in coverage of the character is as is the lack of coverage about the economy compared with the controversies moving one week past the video between 15 and election roughly half of the stories about scandals and the economy mentioned and only a quarter discussed trump and his imbroglios a mere 7 percent of the stories in these last three weeks mentioned and the economy percent mentioned trump and the these choices have consequences according to the reports of what they heard or read about between and were mainly references to her handling of emails during her time as secretary of state in mentions of trump changed week by tracking what was happening on the campaign trail but before anyone blames the news important to examine what the candidates themselves were talking about over the course of the campaign if media reports reflect candidate discourse then it is not merely the media choosing to report on scandals it might be at least as much the choosing to campaign on them that results in unending coverage of traits and characteristics to figure out if this was the i used data from on all the campaign ads aired between and election day i coded all of the appeals in each ad and weighted the appeals by how many times the ads ran on television made more ads than and she vastly running nearly three times as many ads as he did all over half a million ads were run in 2016 during this period the content of the ads is revealing both candidates spent most of their television advertising time attacking the other character in the losing ads did little else more than of the appeals in advertisements nearly half of were about characteristics or dispositions only 9 percent of appeals in her ads were about jobs or the economy by 34 percent of appeals focused on the taxes and trade since the start of presidential campaign television advertising in no campaign has made 76 percent of its television ad appeals about any single topic on traits typically garner about 22 percent of the appeals the economy typically generates about 28 percent of the appeals usually much more balance of this was an unusual election with two very unpopular so the flaws may have simply been too big a story for either them or the media to pass up whatever the the criterion of fitness for office dominated the messaging and made up a good share of the trump messaging as and the news media covered it

shortly everybody wanted to do this people are giving up tremendous careers in order to be subject to you folks and subject to a lot of other folks but giving up a lot i mean some are giving up tremendous businesses in order to sit for four or maybe eight or whatever the period of time is but i think going to see some tremendous tremendous talent coming in we have many people for every job i mean no matter what the job we have many incredible people i you can sort of just confirm that the quality of the people is very good choice for chief of trying very hard to get the best people not necessarily people that will be the most politically correct because that been working so we have really experts in the field some are known and some are not but known within their field as being the best very important to me you been given a great honor been very tough been 18 months of brutality in a true but we won it we won it pretty big the final numbers are coming out or i guess coming out

a stadium that held and most of many of you were there that held 20 , 000 have 15 , 000 people outside that get in so we came up with a good system we put up the big screens outside with a very good loudspeaker system and very few people left i would during the last two or three a day a lot because not easy when you have big crowds those not an easy way of doing three a day then i said the last two i want to do six and seven and not sure anybody has ever done that but we did six and we did seven and the last one ended at 1 in the morning in and we had 31 , 000 17 , 000 or 18 , 000 inside and the rest outside this massive place in grand i guess and it was an incredible thing and i left do we lose i think we can lose and the reason i did it was set up only a little while before because we

of late afternoon and i go to it on the schedule so i finished up in new and at 10 i went to we got there at 12 we started speaking around and we had 31 , 000 people and i i there are things happening but we saw it everywhere so we felt very good we had great numbers and we thought going to win we thought we were going to win we thought we were going to win north we did pretty easily we thought strongly we were going to win the problem is nobody had won it and it was as you the great state that always got away every republican thought they were going to win for 38 years and they just win it and i thought we were going to win it and we won we won you relatively we won it by a number of points we won by 180 , 000 was that the more than 180 , 000 and votes are still coming in from the which we are getting about 85 percent of so we won that by a lot of votes you we had a great victory we had a great victory i think it would have been easier because i see every once in awhile somebody the popular the popular vote would have been a lot but a whole different campaign i would have been in i would have been in and new and we have gone anywhere else which i mean rather do the popular vote from the standpoint think do actually as well or better a whole different campaign if a like match play versus stroke play a whole different game but i think the popular vote would have been easier in a true sense because go to a few places i think the genius of the electoral college i was never a fan of the electoral college until now until now until now i guess now i like it for two reasons what it does do is it gets you out to see states that never see otherwise very interesting like i went to four times i went to 2 for because everybody was saying you can get to 269 but there is no path to 270 we learned that was false because we ended up with got to got to get in but there is no path to you have to get the one in so we kept going back to and we did get the one in we kept going to and we went to a lot of states that you spend a lot of time in and it does get you we actually went to about 22 whereas if going for popular probably go to or it could be three you leave new stay in new and stay in so a certain genius about it and i like it either way but sort of interesting but we had an amazing period of time i got to know the we have a great a great and the enthusiasm was really incredible the times had a poll which was interesting because i was always up in that poll they had something that i a technique in it was called enthusiasm they added an enthusiasm factor and my people had great and people have enthusiasm and in the end she get the vote and we ended up close to 15 as you know we started off at we ended up with almost 15 and more a lot of people show because the community liked me they liked what i was saying so they necessarily vote for but they show which was a big problem that she had i ended up doing very well with which was which i never understood why i was doing because go to the rallies and have so many women holding up for but i kept reading polls saying that not doing well with women i think whoever is doing it here would say that we did very well with especially certain women dean executive editor of the new as you describe you did do something really remarkable you energized a lot of people in the country who really wanted change in but along with that and this is going to create a tricky thing for you you also energized presumably a smaller number of people who were evidenced at the convention in this weekend who have a very i just saw that today love to hear you talk about how going to manage that group of people who actually may not be the larger group but who have an expectation for you and are angry about the country and its along racial lines my first question do you feel like you said things that energized them in and how are you going to manage i think dean first of i want to energize the group not looking to energize them i want to energize the and i disavow the group i know if reporting or whatever i know where they were four years and where they were for and and all of the other people that so i just i had nothing to compare it to but not a group i want to and if they are energized i want to look into it and find out why what we do want to do is we want to bring the country because the country is very and one thing i did big league very and going to work very hard to bring the country together i somebody that really has gotten along with people over the years it was my i went to a big event about two years ago just after i started thinking about politics and walking in and some people were cheering and some people were and she you have never booed for never had a person boo and all of a sudden people are booing me she never happened before politics you all of a sudden they think going to be running for and a say so something that i had never experienced before and i people are and she never booed before but now they boo you it was a group and another group was going the opposite i want to bring the country together very important to me in a very divided country in many ways divided so going to do that thing that executive editors get to do which is to invite reporters to jump in and ask questions political thank dean like to thank you for being here this talked about not prosecuting we were hoping you could talk about exactly what that means does that mean just the or the emails and the and how you came to that decision there was a report that somebody said that not enthused about it i want to move i want to move back and i want to hurt the i really she went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways and i am not looking to hurt them at all the campaign was vicious they say it was the most vicious primary and the most vicious campaign i added it was definitely the most i assume you sold a lot of newspapers i would imagine i would imagine just telling not looking to hurt them i think been through a lot gone through a lot really looking i think we have to get the focus of the country into looking forward if i could we had a good conversation you and and it was off the but there was nothing just wanted to make sure the idea of looking forward was one of the themes that you were saying that we need to now get past the deputy managing so definitively taking that off the the but the question was asked about the emails and the but just not something that i feel very strongly about i feel very strongly about health care i feel very strongly about an immigration bill that i think even the people in this room can be happy you been talking about immigration bills for 50 years and ever happened i feel very strongly about an immigration bill fair and just and a lot of other things there are a lot of things i feel strongly about not looking to look back and go through this this was a very painful period this was a very painful election with all of the email things and all of the foundation things and all of the everything that they went through and the whole country went through this was a very painful period of time i read recently where it it they used to say it was against whoever and none of us were there to see it and there a lot of recordings of but the fact is that there were some pretty vicious they say this this was the most they say it was definitely the most vicious primary and i think very important to look forward senior editor for do you think it would disappoint your supporters who seemed very animated by the idea of accountability in the what would you say to i think they will be disappointed i think i will explain that we have in many ways save our country because our really in big trouble we have a lot of trouble a lot of problems and one of the big i talk divisiveness i think that a lot of people will appreciate not doing it for that reason doing it because time to go in a different direction there was a lot of and i think that the people that supported me with such where they will show up at 1 in the morning to hear a speech it was actually election they showed up so that was essentially election day i think understand very completely l opinion can i ask a one of the issues that you actually were very careful not to speak about during the and spoken about is one very near and dear to my the whole issue of climate the how approach it you own some of the most beautiful links golf courses in the world cross i read your article some will be even better because actually like is a little bit off so be perfect he say that he just says that the ones that are near the water will be but will be in great shape but really important to and i think to a lot of our to know where going to go with this i think anyone objects you doing forms of energy but are you going to take out of the lead of confronting climate looking at it very tom tell you what i have an open mind to it going to look very carefully one issue interesting because there are few things where more division than climate change you tend to hear but there are people on the other side of that issue who even we do hear it i was on with this so i got an earful of it is one of them but a lot of smart people disagree with you i have a very open mind and going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and going to look at it very carefully but i have an open mind since living on an i want to thank you for having an open mind we saw what these storms are now seen it personally straight up but you have an open mind on i do have an open mind and had storms not like this you know the hottest day ever was in 98 you you can make lots of cases for different views i have a totally open mind my uncle was for 35 years a professor at he was a great scientist he was a great guy and he was a long time he had feelings this was a long time ago he had feelings on this subject a very complex subject not sure anybody is ever going to really know i know we they say they have science on one side but then they also have those horrible emails that were sent between the scientists where was in or wherever five years terrible where they got you so you see that and you this all about i absolutely have an open mind i will tell you clean air is vitally important clean crystal clean water is vitally important safety is vitally important and you you mentioned a lot of the courses i have some very successful golf courses received so many environmental awards for the way you know done a tremendous amount of work where received tremendous numbers sometimes say actually an environmentalist and people will smile in some cases and other people that know me understand true open mind editorial page when you say an open you mean just not sure whether human activity causes climate do you think human activity is or i think right now i think there is some connectivity there is something it depends on how much it also depends on how much going to cost our companies you have to our companies are noncompetitive right now really largely noncompetitive about four weeks i started adding a certain little sentence into a lot of my that lost 70 , 000 factories since w bush 70 , 000 when i first looked at the i must be a typo it be you have you think you have 70 , 000 factories and it a right lost 70 , 000 factories not a competitive nation with other nations anymore we have to make ourselves competitive not competitive for a lot of reasons becoming more and more of the reason because a lot of these countries that we do business they make deals with our or and then they adhere to the you know that and much less expensive for their companies to produce products so going to be studying that very and i think i have a very big voice in it and i think my voice is listened especially by people that believe in it and let you know hate to see royal underwater the north that could a good bureau i just wanted to follow up on the question you were asked about not pursuing any investigations into did you mean both the email investigation and the foundation investigation you will not pursue either one of you know have people that do things but my inclination would for whatever power i have on the is to say go forward this has been looked at for so long ad go forward and you you could also make the case that some good work was done in the foundation and they could have made etc etc i think i think time for people to say go and solve some of the problems that we which are massive problems you i do think that gone through a lot i think losing is going through a lot it was a it was a very tough evening for her i think losing is going through a lot for whatever my attitude is strongly we have to go we have so many different problems to i think we have to delve back in the past i also think that would be a very well i think it would be very you know talking about bringing and then they go into all sorts of i think it would be very divisive for the country i i think speaking not as a journalist very healthy and then going to go d white house mike shear i cover the white covering your administration see ya there just one quick clarification on the climate do you intend as you pull out of the climate going to take a look at it shear and if the reaction from foreign leaders is to slap tariffs on goods to offset the carbon that the united states had pledged to is that with and then the second question is on your sort of mixing of your global business interests and the presidency even just in the two weeks been instances where met with your business partners sure talked about the impact of the wind farms on your golf course experts who are lawyers and ethics say that all of that is totally so i guess the question for you what do you see as the appropriate structure for keeping those two things and are there any lines that you think you want to cross once in the white first of on countries i think that countries will not do that to us i think if run by a person that understands leadership and negotiation in no position to do that to no matter what i do in no position to do that to and that but going to take a look at it a very serious look i want to also see how much this is you the cost to and be talking to you folks in the future about having to do with what just took place as far as you potential conflict of i mean i know that from the the law is totally on my the president have a conflict of interest been reported very widely despite i want there to be a conflict of interest anyway and the the president and i understand why the president have a conflict of interest now because everything a president does in some ways is like a conflict of but i built a very great company and a big company and all over the world people are starting to when they look at all these different like in and other number a job like that builds great relationships with the people of so all good but i have to the partners come very successful people they come they it be possible to have a my children are working on that job so i can say to want to have a i can take a picture i i think wonderful to take a picture fine with a picture but if it were up to some i would ever see my daughter again that would be like you never seeing your son again that be good that be good but ever see my daughter that means have to make deputy you know i i yeah i do that either i that work i do i would never see i guess the only son be allowed to at least for a little would be because 10 so there has to be a very interesting case you could sell your company with all due you could sell your company and then well and then you could see them all the time a very hard thing to you know because i have real estate i have real estate all over the which now people are understanding when i filed my forms with the federal people really a big a big it really is all over the world a great company with great assets i think you selling real estate like selling stock selling real estate is much in a much different world say and i mean this and i said it on the other my company is so unimportant to me relative to what i need i need and by the very i have a very small percentage of my money in very very small percentage of my money in in banks have said like to loan you like to give you any amount of been there had it both been been especially as you get is much better just a because an important question i care about my company i if a partner comes in from or if a partner comes in from where we did a beautiful big building that just and they want to take a picture and come into my and my kids come in i originally made the deal with these i mean what am i going to not going to talk to not going to take you have you on a human you take pictures but i just want to say that i am given the right to do something so important in terms of so many of the issues we in terms of health in terms of so many different things i care about my company it matter my kids run it say i have a conflict because we just opened a beautiful hotel on so every time somebody stays at that if they stay because i guess you could say a conflict of interest a conflict of but not going to have anything to do with the and they may very well i mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was the brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before i help but i care i said on i care because it matter the only thing that matters to me is running our country political can i press you a little further on what structures you would put in place to keep the presidency and the company separate and to avoid things for were reported in the times in the past 24 hours about meeting with leaders of about wind farms about meeting with leaders of about wind farms that might interfere with the views of your golf course and how to what can you talk about that by the was i involved with the wind farms not that i know of i i have a problem with wind but you brought it up in the which i know i might have with leaders of many with i see i might have brought it up but not having to do with just i the wind is a very deceiving thing first of we make the windmills in the united states made in and japan made out of massive amounts of which goes into the whether in our country or it goes into the atmosphere the windmills kill birds and the windmills need massive subsidies in other subsidizing wind mills all over this country i for the most part they work i think they work at all without and that bothers and they kill all the birds you go to a you know in they have what is the golden and if you shoot a golden they go to jail for five years and yet they kill them they actually have to get permits that only allowed to kill 30 or something in one year the windmills are devastating to the bird with that being a place for them but they do need subsidy if i talk negatively been saying the same thing for years about you the wind industry i want to subsidize it some environmentalists agree with me very much because of all of the things i just including the and some but hard to explain i care about anything having to do with anything having to do with anything other than the country but the just to be the question how do you formalize the separation of these things so that there is not a question of whether or not you as president are trying to influence like wind i want to influence because not not that important to me hard to explain but the according to the see i figured something where you put something in this massive trust and also nothing is written in other in i can be president of the united states and run my business 100 sign checks on my which i am phasing out of very you i sign the type i like to sign checks so i know what is going on as opposed to pressing a computer and thousands of checks are automatically sent it it tells me going on a little bit and it tells contractors that watching but i am phasing that out and handing that to trump and don trump and trump for the most and some of my so happening right now but in theory i could run my business and then run the country perfectly and never been a case like this where if you look at other people of they have this kind of asset and this kind of frankly just a different thing but there is no i assumed that have to set up some type of trust or whatever and you know and i was actually a little bit surprised to see it so in theory i have to do anything but i would like to do something i would like to try and formalize because i care about my business is going to run very nice we own this incredible place in we own many incredible including i guess you heard one guy that does when i say you know what that right do a little but going to run we have good going to run really well so i have to do but i want to do something if i can if there is something can you promise us when you decide exactly what that come tell the new times about i will started it already one of our great by the way i can see that started it already i greatly reduced the and the business greatly reduced meetings with meetings with different people you also started by said over the last two once i decided i wanted to i want to build anything like for we built the post be happy to ahead of schedule and under budget substantially ahead of schedule almost two years ago of schedule but ahead of under and a terrific place the hotel on just so you general electric has a big wind turbine factory in south just so you know well good but most of are made in most of are you and the are making most of them they may assemble if you i think find that delivered there and they do most of the assembly white house sorry i entered but i did want to ask you about you should introduce yourself one of the white house correspondents i apologize for my delayed flight i wanted to ask you about personnel they say personnel is policy i quite hear personnel personnel you hired to be the chief strategist for you in the white house he is a hero of the been described by some as racist and i wonder what message you think you have sent by elevating him to that position and what you would say to those who feel like that indicates something about the kind of country you prefer and the government run known a long time if i thought he was a or or any of the things that we you the terms we can i even think about hiring him first of the one that makes the not or anybody else and will tell you that 100 percent and if he said something to me in terms of his or that i thought were inappropriate or number one i do and number he would have to be gone but i know many people that know and in actually getting some very good press from a lot of the people that know and people that are on the left but went to he was you he was very he was a naval i think you i think very hard on him i think having a hard time with it because not him not him known him for a long time a very smart guy i think he was with on top of everything else what do you make of the website he the different cover i mean like the new times covers things i i could say that is because they covered an story i i am take whatever you say i am always but not cross the new times covers a lot of stories that you rough stories and you they have covered some of these but the new times covers a lot of these things also just a essentially a newspaper i know the a decent a very smart guy done a good job he been with me that long you know he really came in after the primaries i had already won the primaries and if i thought that his views were in that i would immediately let him go and tell you why in many respects i think his views are actually on the other side of what a lot of people might think but you are with all due that and and many folks who disagree with the coverage of and the slant that brings to the news view him that well first of is just a publication you they cover stories like you cover stories they are certainly a much more conservative to put it than the new times but really is a news organization become quite and got readers and it does cover subjects that are on the but it covers subjects on the left also i mean a pretty a pretty big thing and he helped build it into a pretty successful news organization tell you i know him very well i will say and i will say if i thought that if i thought that he was doing or had any ideas that were different than the ideas that you would i would ask him very politely to leave but in the i think been treated very unfairly very interesting a lot of people are coming to his defense right now we have never experienced a single episode of any of those accusations been the total opposite been a great and just not there and what the is saying is 100 percent true and by the if you see something or get something where you feel that and you have some info i would love to hear it you can call can call i would love to hear the only one who call me is opinion she treats me too rough i know what happened to she was so opinion for years she was so good as we all say about not your just your turn opinion i have a slightly but somewhat i guess about the future of the republican party you started out here talking about winning in so many states where no republican has won in especially rust belt states and i think many people think that one of the reasons you won was that you deliberately campaigned as a different kind of republican you had different things to say on foreign even your daughter child care plan was sort of distinctive and now in a situation where governing and staffing up an administration with a republican party whose and may differ with me a little on but always see on those views although right now loving me right now they are right now loves loves amazing how winning can change things liked chuck for a long time raised a lot of money for chuck and given him a lot of money over the years i think i was the first person that ever contributed to chuck i had a a little in a little apartment building in in bay where i worked with my father and chuck came in and i gave i i know if willing to admit but i believe it was his first campaign but chuck a good guy i think get along very well i guess my question how much do you expect to be able to both run an administration and negotiate with a congress as a different kind of republican and do you worry that wake up three years from now and go back to campaigning in the rust belt and people will he governed more like than like trump i worry about that i need to do this i was telling i need to do this doing this to do a good what i want to and i think that what happened in the rust they call it the rust belt for a reason if you go through you look back 20 they used to call it the rust belt you pass factory after factory after factory empty and rusting rust is the good worse than falling down i sacrifice that to me more important is taking care of the people that really have proven to to love as opposed to the political people and frankly if the political people take care of these not going to win and going to end up with maybe a total different kind of government than what looking at right now these people are really angry and angry i call them the forgotten men and women and i use that in i say the forgotten people they were totally forgotten and going to bring jobs back going to bring jobs big league spoken to so many companies i plan on moving your not going to be able to move your company and sell us your product you think going to just sell it across what will be a strong you know at least going to have a border but just plan on it and tell i and hear announcements over the next couple of but i believe talked numerous comp in conversations with top people numerous companies that or potentially leaving our country with thousands of jobs are you that those companies will keep their factories but the jobs will be replaced by they and make the robots too a big make the robots too right now we make the robots we make anything but going i robotics is becoming very big and going to do that going to have more factories we lose 70 , 000 factories just do it going to start making things i was honored i got a call from bill great we had a great i got a call from cook at and i you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when i get apple to build a big plant in the united or many big plants in the united where instead of going to and going to and going to the places that you go making your product right he understand i think create the incentives for and i think going to do it going for a very large tax cut for which be happy but going for big tax we have to get rid of regulations are making it impossible whether liberal or i mean i could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous gotten to be a and companies they even start they choking i tell one thing i would giving a big tax cut and giving big regulation and seen all of the small business owners over the united and all of the big business met so many people they are more excited about the regulation cut than about the tax cut and i never said because the tax going to be substantial you know we have companies leaving our country because the taxes are too high but leaving also because of the regulations and i would of the and i would not have thought regulation substantial regulation are more important and more enthusiastically than even the big tax cuts i wanted to ask there was a conference this past weekend in of people who pledged their allegiance to you are really into this i think we answered that one right off the bat are you going to condemn of course i of course i did he already did are you going to do it right i maybe you here sure would you like me to do it do it here of course i condemn i disavow and condemn go with that like to move to and then go back because a lot of the investment you are talking a lot of the jobs you are talking about is infrastructure going to be the core of your first few not the but an important factor going for a lot of between between between health care going to talk repeal and replace health care is you know people are paying a 100 percent increase and not even getting the deductibles are so you have deductibles so paying all of this money and they even get health care so very important so there are a lot of things but is going to be a part of it part of i even think a big part of it going to be a big number but i think i am doing things that are more important than but infrastructure is still a part of and talking about a very infrastructure bill and not a very republican thing i even know frankly it worked for franklin it work for because unfortunately they spend the money last time on infrastructure they spent it on a lot of other things you nobody can find out where that last you from a few years ago where that money went and going to make sure it is spent on infrastructure and roads and highways i have a a big one of the biggest and he orders these incredible the i mention the name but a certain truck company that makes they call them the of trucks you the most expensive trucks and he calls me up about two months ago and he going to buy the cheapest trucks i can and i and you and this is the biggest guy he trucks are coming going from new to and all busted up the highways are in such bad hitting hitting he not buying these trucks going to buy the cheapest stuff and the strongest tires i can the exact expression he cheapest trucks and the strongest hitting so many bad you i tell been doing this how 45 years he built it over 45 years i you ever seen it like he roads have never been like an interesting what what curious what and said when you going to launch a infrastructure are they reluctant to spend honestly right now trillion i was the figure because they would be in the wing of the republican party that would but not going to be able to do that and balance the see if i get it done right now in love with me four weeks ago they in love with me forget if i read the new and you have to put this on the record it can be if you you might not want you say but you do i do read it unfortunately i would have lived about 20 years longer if i quote right there if love to reread it i know but when you look at the all the i was going to lose the i was going to take the house with and the senate had no chance it was going to be the biggest humiliation in the history of politics in this country and instead i won the and i mean easily you look at those i had states where i won by 30 and 40 points i won the presidency i helped numerous senators in fact the only senators that get elected were two one up in new who refused to say that she was going to vote for who by the way would love a job in the administration and i thank on the record this is where different than a politician i know what to i just believe sort of interesting love to have a job in the i thank she refused to vote for me and a senator in who frankly he endorsed me then he and he went down like a lead balloon and then they called me before the race and said they wanted me to endorse him and do a big thing and i thank good you see what happens i off the i hope you lose off the record he he was up by 10 points you know who talking about others if you look at he was down five points a few days before the he called for i gave him and i think i was up like over 30 points in i was leading by a massive 28 points i gave him help and he ended up winning by four points or something i brought a number of them brought over the finish line we brought you that was a good one we brought him over the line in winning was big something that i came so right now in very good but i came here thinking be awed and overwhelmed by this but i feel like you are getting very comfortable with it i feel comfortable i feel comfortable i am awed by the as anybody would but i i feel so comfortable and you know it would to a great achievement if i could come back here in a year or two years and say and have a lot of the folks here done a great and i mean just a conservative not talking conservative i mean done a good job to follow up on after you met with president he described you to folks as that you seemed overwhelmed by what he told you so i wonder if you are overwhelmed by the magnitude of the job that about to inherit and if you can tell us anything more about that conversation with the president and the apparently subsequent conversations that had on the phone since then and then maybe talk a little bit about foreign something we touched on and whether or not you believe in the kind of world order a world order led by in terms of having this country underwrite the security and the free markets of the which have been in place for decades sure i had a great meeting with president i never met him before i really liked him a lot the meeting was supposed to be 10 15 minutes because there were a lot of people waiting for both of us and it ended up being you were there i guess an close and it was a great chemistry i think if he said i think he meant that in a bad way i think he meant that it is a very overwhelming job but not overwhelmed by it you can do things and fix i think he meant it that way he said very nice things after the meeting and i said very nice things about him i really enjoyed my meeting with him we have you we come from different sides of the but nevertheless something that i know if like him i probably thought that maybe i but i i did like him i really enjoyed him a lot spoken to him since the meeting what did you say to just a basic conversation i think looking to do absolutely the right thing for the country in terms of transition and i telling we had a that went for an hour and a half that could have gone for three or four hours it was a great it was just a very good meeting sort of like this meeting he told me what he thought what the biggest problems of the country which i think i should i mind if he reveals them but i was actually surprised a little bit but he told me the he told me things that he considered but he did tell me what he thought were the biggest in particular one problem that he thought was a big problem for the which rather have you ask him but i really found the meeting to be very good and i hope we can have a good i it mean going to agree on but i hope that we will have a great relationship i really liked him a lot and a little bit surprised telling you that i really liked him a lot go foreign sure sure what do you see as role in the do you believe that the role such a big question the role that we played for 50 years as kind of the global paying more for things because they were in our ultimate one hears from i is really shrinking that role i think we should be a nation builder i think tried that i happen to think that going into was perhaps i mean you could say maybe we could have settled the civil i think going into was one of the great mistakes in the history of our country i think getting out of it i think we got out of it then lots of bad things including the formation of we could have gotten out of it differently i think going in was a terrible mistake we have to solve that problem because we are going to just keep fighting forever i have a different view on than everybody else not everybody but then a lot of people i had to listen to give me a break i had to listen to graham talk you attacking and you and like now attacking attacking attacking and what are we getting and what are we and i

of it be nice to actually report what they it be nice if we actually got along with it be nice if we went after which by the aside from being very and have been even allowed to and the people will stand up and give me a massive hand you know they thought it was bad that i was getting along with or that i believe strongly if we can get along with a positive thing it is a great thing that we can get along with not only but that we get along with other countries managing on would you you said you have a very strong idea about what to do with the can you describe that for i can only say we have

surprised he never found it to be he always give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and i do better with that than i do with and i was very impressed by that answer i was because known as being like the toughest guy and when he said not saying it changed my mind we have people that are chopping off heads and drowning people in steel cages and not allowed to but tell you i was impressed by that answer it certainly does not not going to make the kind of a difference that maybe a lot of people think if so important to the i would go for it i would be guided by that but general found it to be very less much less important than i thought he would say i thought he would say you know known as mad dog mad dog for a reason i thought say lose he actually give me some cigarettes and some and do with going to go to our mark for the last question very powerful man mark thank and a really short but after all the talk about libel and libel are you committed to the first amendment to the i

j trump said on that he had no intention of pressing for an investigation into use of a private email server or the financial operations of her dropping the her pledge that became a rallying cry for his campaign for the white house who branded his rival and said she would go to jail if he were said in an interview with reporters and editors at the new times that he was no longer interested in pursuing in part because he wanted to heal the wounds of a divisive campaign want to hurt the i really trump said during the interview went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different and i am not looking to hurt them at all the campaign was his reversal on prosecuting was particularly striking given the outsize role the issue played during the presidential in which her use of a private email server as secretary of state became a prominent and one she has blamed for her loss to trump trump said he wanted to from the subject without he said that have people that do perhaps a reference to the or republicans who might continue to press for prosecutions in the email or foundation cases but the made clear that he would not seek to pursue an investigation himself nor make it a priority after he assumes office the decision angered some of his most fervent who immediately criticized his seeming change of heart blared the headline on a conservative news site that has strongly backed trump not something that i feel very strongly trump said at the unlike health care or immigration has been a very painful period of aides did not respond to a request for comment about remarks during their second trump turned to and i i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your because never been so many so much after turnaround on the conservative commentator one of his staunchest supporters during the suggested on twitter that trump was overstepping his role i thought we elected she wrote we make him the his job is to pick those not do their tom president of judicial a conservative advocacy group that has been a relentless critic of said on that it would be a mistake for trump to drop the threat of appointing a special counsel to look into her email use said that although the had already investigated the matter that inquiry was flawed his group has gained access to thousands of pages of state department emails through lawsuits and is pressing its case in court even after her defeat representative a republican who leads the house oversight and government reform said last week on fox news that his committee would continue to investigate the matter as well because got to get to the office said on he was unavailable for comment about statements although the email investigation is the agency still has an open inquiry into the foundation that inquiry began after the 2015 publication of a book by peter that asserted that some foreign entities had given money to the foundation in return for state department favors when was there the have denied the assertions the and justice department conduct their criminal investigations largely independently from the white so trump cannot tell agents to close their cases a president ordering the to stop a politically sensitive case would be a major scandal does seem like an extraordinary breach of protocol for him to get involved in that glen a a former federal prosecutor in new said of the know of no recent circumstances when the president ordered an attorney general not to pursue a criminal as trump were to order the b to close the foundation could choose to rebuff him directors are given terms to insulate them from political but the president still has the power to fire a as president bill did with s sessions in 1993 after a justice department investigation uncovered ethical abuses by sessions in an interview last week with trump said he had not yet decided whether to dismiss over his handling of the email saying the director have had very good reasons for doing what he as a practical remarks will probably have little impact the investigation into emails is already closed while the one into her foundation remains senior officials and career justice department officials have said there is little evidence justifying moving forward with a case when the case comes up for senior agents and prosecutors may decide to shut it but it will not be because of remarks while the decision is likely to frustrate investigators at the who are fiercely protective of their independence to follow the facts they some legal experts applauded decision to not pursue investigations into emails or her family foundation k a professor at the university of hastings college of the said he was inclined to support both moves by trump a decision to shut down an he not out of step with constitutional as the constitution gives the president the power to issue pardons for federal crimes
thank you for being guide to thriving in the age of l pp from trump to to marine one thing that unites the unhappy west is a profound sense of mystification across and north people have an acute feeling that their world is accelerating away from them but they quite understand why there is no narrative hence the attraction of leaders who it like it and identify convenient like immigrants or the union but what most people really crave is an honest explanation as with patients on a the first step is to understand what is going wrong then you can decide on the medication into this darkened room steps tom while other journalists dream of being investigative reporters or news l is a whose goal is to be a from to and he is extremely good at it a talent for explanation has garnered him a column at the new times and a string of books on huge subjects like and climate change snooty critics might grumble about his folksy but it is hard to think of any other journalist who has explained as many complicated subjects to so many people now he has written his most ambitious book part personal part manifesto you for being has two overt aims wants to explain why the world is the way it is why so many things seem to be spinning out of especially for the white middle class he grew up in and then he wants to reassure us that it is basically going to be in general the explanation is more convincing than the reassurance but as a guide for perplexed this book is very hard to beat argues that man is actually a fairly adaptable creature the problem is that our capacity to adapt is being outpaced by a built from three ever faster the market and climate change that sounds like a predictable but digs cleverly into each one for on technology he argues convincingly that which saw the arrival of the android and was the year when software in the words of the he introduces us to vital obscure like and he points out that if law the power of microchips would double about every two had applied to the capabilities of not computer then the modern descendant of the 1971 beetle would travel at 300 , 000 miles per cost 4 cents and use one tank of gasoline in a lifetime the chapters on climate change and the market are stuffed with similar nuggets but also shows how all three forces complicating and speeding up one another in climate change is wrecking crops even as technology is helping more children so a population of 19 million will reach 72 million hungry people by 2050 on trading technology and markets create so a operating out of his flat by can make the index fall 9 percent in a and will keep getting faster there are already at least 10 billion things connected to the but that is still less than 1 percent of the possible total as ever more gadgets and bodies join of man has sped up his own response times it now takes us only 10 15 years to get used to the sort of technological changes that we used to absorb in a couple of but what good is that when technology becomes obsolete every five to seven the supernova is making a joke of both patent law and education companies and individuals are all struggling to keep up it can be bewildering even for the winners like himself in he was queuing up to phone his stories from telephone now he can email a column from deep in that appears almost instantaneously on the times website and provokes a rapid reaction from china in two and a half years researching this he had to interview all the main technologists at least because things changed so quickly like everybody he has no time to the title comes from an offhand comment to a friend whose tardiness allowed a few welcome minutes of contemplation for the most you for being is a master class in explaining it canters along at a pace that is quick enough to permit learning without getting bogged down inevitably he sometimes gets the balance either allowing his informants to ramble or skating over a thorny for having admitted that productivity numbers have not forward in the same way that technology he asks in to trust they will the folksiness will still irk some the starting point for the book is a chat with a parking with another attendant from waiting near the end but criticizing for humanizing and boiling down big topics is like complaining that used sex to sell it is what he does well there is also a value in bringing things together in putting foreign policy beside climate change and be fooled by the catchy slogans not into and so as usual with it is all backed up by pages of serious reporting from around the world this complaint is that the explaining is too convincing lying on the listening to him in his guise as tom you ever more the reasons the world is spinning so fast it is not all along the way we discover that the created more teller jobs at banks it allowed banks to increase the number of there are inspiring stories of communities rising to the and a memorable paean to the virtues of chickens from bill gates empower keep children healthy and but respite from these there is there is not going to be and attempts to stop it all will do more damage than good this makes it harder to reassure us that it is all going to be fine produces a list of 18 things that the government should from setting up a health system to passing deals and building infrastructure if the politicians in accomplished even a quarter of his the united states would be better at coping with change but is too honest a reporter to argue that will happen soon asked why some biological systems the environmentalist are all highly adaptive and all the rest is it is hard to put in the highly adaptive category main cause for optimism is based on a trip back to st the suburb where he grew up this is perhaps the most memorable part of the book a piece of sustained reportage that ranks alongside to masterly first book about the middle east he points out that the same communal virtues that made work when he was young have survived and are still useful but the passages that lingered with this reader were the ones about the good old days that have disappeared when baseball used to be a sport that everybody could afford to when local boys like the young could caddy at the united states when everybody in town went to public schools so you finish this book thinking everything is going to be for the unhappy west that can dance in a there is no easy pill to and most of the ones being proffered by the extremists are poison but after your session with you have a much better idea of the forces that are upending your how they work together and what companies and governments can do to prosper you do have a coherent narrative an cohesive explanation for why the world is the way it without miracle cures or scapegoats and that is why everybody should hope this book does very well indeed
maybe i have been surprised that trump could be elected but i was i live in and work in two of the most liberal places in the country but even i seeing many signs of support for him how did that blindness social media is my portal into the rest of the world my periscope into the communities next to my into how the rest of the world thinks and feels and it completely failed me in that failure makes sense spent nearly 10 years coaching and and twitter on what kinds of news and photos i want to and they all behaved accordingly each time i liked an or clicked on a or hid the algorithms that curate my streams took notice and showed me only what they thought i wanted to see that meant i realize that most of my family who live in rural were voicing their support for trump and i see any of the that were in heavy circulation before the election i never saw a trump hat or a sign or a shirt in my and the only election day i saw were of people declaring their support for to be not blaming the algorithms for what i assume to be their role in augmenting my they did exactly what i told them to blocking out misogynist and hiding anyone who support black lives all with such deftness that i had no idea that a candidate who ran a campaign on exactly those values had gained enough popularity to win the election but considering that more than 40 percent of our population consumes news on finding alternative perspectives have been that hard i knew about theory on filter or the idea that personalization distorts the type of information we and even i still chose to let algorithms shape how i perceive the world everything i could want to see is available at my and yet i look in mark chief executive of addressed a room of developers about the importance of his social network he has the power to bring people together who might otherwise never have the chance to meet has enabled all of us to access and share more ideas and information than ever he said gone from a world of isolated communities to one global and we are all better off for but not what has happened idealism is belied by his desire to duck responsibility for mediating the content of his site on the political divide has only been entrenched further the dress only for our entire we are two one that sees blue and black and the other that sees white and gold the once offered outlets we could use to understand one another but they are rapidly disappearing most social media like and is curated by software built to manage the high influx of information flowing into but there have still been a few islands of digital a of where culture thrived untouched they included vine closure was announced in and and even which were homes for marginalized theories and lifestyles the vine was the first place i got a glimpse of cultures beyond my including those of the middle east i was able to see how some women there wanted us to see aware a young woman living in who goes by the name used vine to show clips of herself living her life her version of normalcy at the goofing off at home in her most viral she stares into the her face covered in a save for her perfectly outlined eyes called me she snaps the emphasis on the last word becomes the punch line as she whips off one to reveal a second underneath i was thrilled to realize that women living there could have a sense of humor similar to my own vine was born as an and intended to be a social community but vine links could be shared independent of the and people did so with meaning that vines appeared around the defying the sorting mechanism of streams and feeds they could land on your screen via text direct email vine was a riff on one originally posted by a young black named who was miffed that someone thought she needed makeup to be pretty you can draw a straight line from brown women in to black women in a marvel unto a window into the way the flattens space and time a vivid example of its fulfilling its promise to bridge divides at it had more than 200 million monthly users who watched videos billions of and it excelled at showing these sorts of black kids in new lived and looked a lot like white kids in the very they shared a similar humor and taste in which gave me hope that they would share a sense of humanity as and yet which owns vine and is struggling to turn a profit while keeping its main service appealing to could seemingly no longer afford to keep the video feature reportedly costs millions a month to afloat following news about decision to close the there were rumors that outside companies made inquiries about purchasing remains but most likely too late to salvage the community there in its earlier offered its own version of cultural exchange the had an incredible series on that gave users direct windows into different worlds people submitted short video diaries about life in their which the company compiled into a single viewable by anyone using the i remember feeling delighted watching people in and showing off their routines and customs but the company is now prioritizing which feature more mainstream events like the super bowl and music festivals the effect is still but less intimate seems to be betting that people are more interested in the familiar the future of the platform whose endless warren of rabbit holes about gender critical feminist thought and identity politics is unlike any other on the is the most uncertain its parent succumbed to financial struggles and has announced plans to be acquired by raising questions about the future of its properties what seeing with and vine reflects a larger shift in the economy by and is not lucrative at a scale that satisfies and as a most companies are changing direction toward other revenue streams one of the more significant shifts is the move into social messaging semiprivate messaging applications group text threads and applications like is owned by and slack have grown in popularity as people move away from public arenas for a shift caused in part by spikes in unchecked harassment on major social networks new features are introduced it to make messaging with your friends more the latest version of the software includes the ability to make messages with confetti now offers the ability to tag people in as you might tag them in a photograph these changes have probably been spurred by messaging applications which used similar features to attract and retain customers a company that built an addictive messaging with 220 million monthly users had one of the biggest initial public offerings billion earlier this these new messaging features work to bind private groups tighter by making it more fun to talk to one another than to engage with the world at large what happens when we would rather look i have found something of an answer in a short story called great by about search for signs of alien life the story is narrated by a parrot in home to one of the largest radio telescopes in the world desire to make a connection is so strong that created an ear capable of hearing across the the creature begins i and my fellow parrots are right here why they interested in listening to our the paradox is not to be we are more interested in locating alien species than understanding the humanity among the species we already live with the story ends on a somber note activity has brought my kind to the brink of the narrator explains do it maliciously they just paying lesson hits hard in this new political and cultural moment social media seemed to promise a way to better connect with instead it seems to have made it easier to tune out the people we agree with but if we pay attention to one we might as well not live on the same planet at all
in then a financial reporter at the new published the book the art of being the talked to sources with an view of j who concluded that the net worth was million to rather than the billion to billion trump had variously claimed who had courted by taking him for rides in his and private sued for libel in new jersey in 2006 trump called a on the show continuing to curry favor with him privately warner was also named in the suit and hired top lawyers who put trump through an unsparing deposition asked about his trump was caught lying or exaggerating 30 times thought get a friendly and we would roll says who is now the executive editor of view the case went through four judges and was dismissed in 2009 suit against is one of seven forays trump and his companies have made as libel plaintiffs he won only when a defendant failed to appear but the standard measure defending his reputation and achieving victory in court how trump says he thinks about his investment spent a couple of bucks on legal and they spent a whole lot he told the post in march about the hefty sum he spent on the case against did it to make his life which happy trump was warner books spent less than he and paid nothing but that make central idea any less that libel law can be a tool of revenge disconcerting for a maybe not as rich as he plaintiff to treat the legal system as a weapon to be deployed against critics once installed in the white trump will have a wider array of tools at his and his record suggests more than his he will try to use the press and also control and subdue it as a trump blustered vaguely that he wanted to up our libel i asked his hope by email what he meant by but she answer the question others i not within the direct powers to change the rules for libel suits but our legal safeguards for writers and publishers foolproof in the last few trump has been joined by at least two billionaires who are determined to exploit cracks in the wall of defense around the press the members of this club are innovators they have sued or funded suits to defend reputations or protect privacy but an underlying aim appears to be to punish critics like or even destroy entire media outlets this kind of manipulation of the law is unfolding at a keen moment of weakness for the which has already been buffeted by falling revenue and mounting public disaffection only 40 percent of the public the lowest rate since at least the trusts the media report the news accurately and according to a survey conducted in 2015 this mistrust has been growing for a long but it was stoked by trump during the campaign he called the reporters who covered him and whipped up yelling and booing crowds there is no consensus among his supporters that the press should hold those in power accountable a recent pew survey found that only half of trump backers agreed that it was important in a strong democracy that organizations are free to criticize political media outlets have won many cases by persuading a judge to dismiss them but since they have succeeded in only 39 percent of the libel and privacy suits that have gone to a dip from 52 percent in the previous according to the media law resource center the median damage award has increased fivefold since the to million the figure includes three big verdicts over the last eight against rolling stone and the news observer in these include libel and too early to say that the sky is falling on the press but darkening the high bar for winning a libel case in the united states was set in when the supreme court decided new

the ad turned out to include minor factual errors said its depiction of how the police responded to civil rights protests made him look bad under the rules at the a libel plaintiff was entitled to victory if he could show that the content that harmed his reputation was false the jury agreed with on that point and awarded him in damages equivalent of about million with similar cases the times pulled its reporters out of but when the newspaper appealed to the supreme the justices threw out the verdict and set a far stiffer standard for proving libel the court wrote that a public figure has to prove that a false and damaging statement about him was published with translated as or reckless disregard for the by the the number of libel suits and if suits did go to they frequently ended in defeat for the plaintiff in two examples from that gen sued and the defense sued time magazine neither man won damages those as well as losses in other a major deterrent for plaintiffs and their says

his he railed against the new times on twitter for its and highly inaccurate coverage of the trump thrives on media but also clear that as the press sinks in the any tough coverage of him will come to seem less credible the media also serves as an receptacle for blame asked on why immigrants and have expressed fear of his trump reckon with any of his own statements he think built up by the whatever

prevent people from using the and the discovery to silence or retaliate against their 28 states and the district of have enacted laws the acronym stands for lawsuit against public that trump could appoint judges who would find a way around the usual press protections more he could ask his justice department to prosecute journalists who report leaks from his administration justice department investigated but charge also possible that the press will be a meeker watchdog because of subtler changes that are harder to track as the head of the executive the president exerts a great deal of control over access to information federal agencies have power to shape the state of the they also describe it for us by producing reams of facts and which in turn shape our assessment of our elected leaders trump could hire people who cancel funding for government reports or research that serve his or who suppress findings the administration like the new president will be a man who constantly accuses the media of getting things wrong but routinely misrepresents and twists facts himself single goal will be to burnish their predicts of the trump administration there are of new efforts to

i love telling people from maybe my defense mechanism for when people accuse me of being a coastal out of touch with real i like fulfilling all the stereotypes i love cheese and cheese of course i love our sports teams out of a vague sense of and my accent hard comes out in full force after ah beers mostly i love my who has called home for 88 years her parents immigrated to from and she started public school without knowing a word of she forgot most of the her parents taught her years but taught me the words to the that we would sometimes hear when my family would go to a night fish fry up until i still believed my moral baseline bent toward empathy the i thought i where i lived for 21 was filled with complex but fundamentally decent people who recognized that everyone is deserving of respect and could disagree without being disagreeable the state did elect walker as governor in and the legislature gutted setting off huge protests in the capitol but i think that state would vote for j turning its 10 electoral votes to a republican for the first time since 1984 come we even voted for as much as trump won the election in lost it her which prided itself on employing all the data wizards and ground game gurus money can did not do nearly enough to lock down the upper particularly and and instead treated those states as a given is the mayor of capital in cerulean county he supported senator sanders in the democratic and said he talked at least once a week with a field organizer from the sanders campaign during the primary but once locked up the it was radio silence from the campaign i first held elected office in the early virtually every presidential been either by the candidate or by a he told me not saying this to say important but the point not only she in the but i never got a a anything after the president by made two campaign stops in during the 2012 including a huge rally with on the before election day frustration with the campaign was apparent understand the strategy never seen an explanation for other than assuming that they wanted not just a but a smashing victory the kind that trump he said voter turnout in 2016 was the lowest been in 20 years roughly 40 , 000 fewer democrats voted in county this year than did in 2012 the drop in turnout in county might be partially attributed to a voter identification law in the state in a federal judge found that roughly 300 , 000 registered voters in lacked the necessary photo id card to vote under the new and a of those voters were low income election watchers have said the voter id law alone could not have flipped the state in favor did not visit once after the democratic national convention in neither did president or sanders made multiple trips to the state on behalf of but that was not enough to gin up enthusiasm like most of the my friends and family in were shocked that trump won the and the election my mom says still in my dad has progressed comfortably to anger my has been coping with the election result with characteristic wit listening to trump speeches about i was convinced to she emailed me i hate throughout the general the surrogates appeared reassured to the point of hubris that they would be able to convert moderate republican voters in suburbs every democrat we lose in western we will pick up two moderate republicans in the suburbs in and you can repeat that in and and new senator chuck said in this line of thinking was not just but disastrously so in won 59 of 72 counties this 59 counties voted for trump republicans successfully built on the map that helped to elect walker to the mansion while the campaign was looking to run up the score in states like and a triumvirate of republicans also helped elect both actively and passively there is who worked his way up from republican politics in to head the republican national and to serve as chief of staff then there is house speaker d who now has a historic opportunity to pass his agenda through congress recovered from his own failed presidential will now oversee the republican governors association is a longtime radio host in who became a voice on the right for the movement after 23 years on the he will retire from his radio show this year along with being a vocal opponent of the trump he has taken on a new role as chief apologizer for media he expressed frustration with his he had gradually grown immune to any inconvenient fact presented to them while he read news from the politico and national review throughout the his audience seemed to glean most of its news from fox talk radio and their feeds on his radio program last played a sound bite of s current head of the national security suggesting the government had made a to sway the election in favor asked his we all agree that this is a big deal and we ought to do something about he opened the phone and the first call was from who believe it i believe any of sighed break through he said is way harder to knock that stuff down than you would he says he is but not to see conservative media falling in line and supporting cabinet picks is the monster he said of the worst elements of the conservative media have now been empowered every one of them has got a strut now has a pipeline to the white house i think about spent half of 2016 arguing that conservatism was fundamentally incompatible with what trump was offering his party conservatism has been i in being aggressive but and very and also proving that you can do things and be rewarded by the he said trump has certainly been aggressive if not very and he has proved that you can run an campaign and still win even in the the i know like to argue about politics in and certainly not at the thanksgiving table we are creatures of we like to make ourselves or others we loathe confrontation but this year seems to bring with it a moral imperative to have uncomfortable conversations about the very real stakes of this election this year we may need to break the worry less about being nice and talk more about what it means to be decent

pharmaceuticals international is a onetime wall street darling that has become a punching bag for how pharmaceutical firms drove up drug prices and engaged in questionable sales in the process losing 90 percent of its market value the first case to emerge from multiple federal and state investigations of its portrays it as a not a perpetrator the justice department charged a former with taking about million in kickbacks from the chief executive of a specialty while hiding his true intentions from corporate management had a relationship with and in 2014 paid million on an option to buy but it dropped the association last year shut down in the criminal complaint depicts surreptitious payments and a cavalier highlighted by an email from davenport to tanner evoking how the two men would be like butch and the kid and into the sunset off the cliff as in the the case appears to be a straightforward tale of but there may be more to proving the charges than meets the perhaps portending a more difficult prosecution for the justice department was really the or was it a willing participant that wanted to build up so it could increase sales of its lawyer issued a statement asserting that his client did his job greatly benefiting and regularly communicated to his superiors what he was lawyer took a similar claiming that also benefited which is why and its highly sophisticated and active management team sought to buy job was to develop what was called the alternative fulfillment in which sought to have prescriptions filled with the drugs through specialty pharmacies like rather than with cheaper generics in that tanner was and helped the company increase its sales but executives also wanted to develop other outlets for its which tanner is accused of resisting the criminal complaint portrays tanner as a classic unfaithful servant who made a key outlet for drugs while working out a secret agreement with davenport to get a cut of his profits he is accused of pushing to enter into an option agreement to acquire the mail order pharmacy while denying to his superiors that he had any financial interest in tanner received about million of payments to money funneled through corporate bank accounts to a shell company controlled by tanner if they were trying to hide those the two defendants certainly did a poor job by using an account over which tanner had signature which would be easy to and keeping the money in the united states rather than shifting it to an offshore account at one the justice department could bring a case against an employee for breaching a fiduciary duty to the employer as mail or wire fraud for violating the right of honest services statute but the supreme decision in skilling v united states in 2010 restricted this type of fraud to cases involving payment of a bribe or kickback to the not just unethical conduct that deceived an employer figuring out whether the million constituted a kickback to tanner is the prerequisite to proving that he committed honest services fraud a federal statute cited in the skilling case defines a kickback as a benefit given improperly obtain or reward favorable treatment in connection a transaction whether the dealings with were will be the crux of the case against the defendants the criminal complaint goes to great lengths to describe how tanner kept senior executives in the dark about his role at and the benefits he would receive he also made sure that played a crucial role in the alternative fulfillment program by never pursuing relationships with other potential pharmacy partners buying turned out to be problematic for when the company had to issue an accounting restatement after finding that it had incorrectly recorded million in sales to the pharmacy and after questions were raised about whether it properly disclosed the relationship with in its filings with the securities and exchange shut down the unit but that does not necessarily mean that the relationship was or that the million tanner received constituted an illegal kickback was aware of how the mail order pharmacy and the role it played in growing pharmaceutical a key to wall embrace of the company that took the stock to more than per share in 2015 the new times described an view that benefited significantly from its ties to the allowing it to increase sales of ailing products and obscure more significant problems with the unlike the typical kickback scheme in which a supplier pays an official to award a contract that should not have been the defendants can argue that the development of was a benefit to and the option to buy it was arranged by experienced executives who paid no more than what they thought the mail order pharmacy was worth at the time a decision in 2016 by the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit in in united states v may offer a path for tanner to argue that not revealing his interest in the deal does not constitute fraud in that the conviction of a bank officer who negotiated a sale of the interest in a development while secretly taking an ownership interest in the property was overturned the appeals court found negotiating and certainly the sophisticated businessmen in this do not expect complete candor about negotiating as distinct from facts and promises of future stake in the deal may not have tainted the transaction even if he breached a fiduciary duty to by not disclosing any arrangement he had with davenport unlike the typical he can argue that his share of the deal was a means to bring both sides together in a mutually beneficial arrangement was not so much a victim of a bad deal as a willing participant that received the benefit that it sought by gaining control of an important conduit to sell its drugs and avoid losing sales to generics that argument would not put a seal of approval on what tanner and arranging to make almost million off a deal without first disclosing it to your employer is likely to be considered a breach of duty if sued him but whether the federal fraud statutes should be used to police a dispute about a private employment relationship is a different especially when the defendants face a potential sentence of up to 20 years in prison if convicted of the fraud charge

material for is and yet commitment to it has been even by his exacting standards to understand that i spoke with the with members of the cast and the production team and with others who know the novel well trying to grasp just what kind of an act of faith this film is know if but there is such a thing as trying to get it said to in the new voice familiar from the cameos in his movies how do you do the right way to live has to do with selflessness i believe that but how does one act that i think you practice it consciously it has to be something that develops in you maybe through a lot of he had invited me to his east side townhouse at 9 having spent a full day editing in midtown the living is decorated with a vintage movie posters for jean grand and photographs of his wife and daughter he is compact and with tremendous life in his eyes and a youthful ardor that seems to have its source in reverence for his elders like the polish filmmaker who had signed a storyboard that unhooked from the wall to show me we took and he began to talk as the hours the already seemed to diminish around until it resembled a screening or a a place where questions of how to live are posed through stories and images goes back to what father was telling me the last time i saw a couple of years he said doing something that is morally that is a great sin many people will never come back from that but the way would be to get up and try again maybe not but you get yourself into a situation where you can make another choice and the situation is he can choose to save the lives of others by renouncing his the act he considers most reprehensible of all no less than informal new trilogy is rooted in his childhood as a boy in little he wanted to be a missionary his parents were not in part because their parents had felt the heavy hand in but for him the church a malign force in so many stories was a portal to the world beyond family and neighborhood trusted the because it made what they what they he

asthma that kept him out of sports and off the streets he drew movie including a few years for a life of set it right in the he told the crucifixion taking place on the west side piers and the involved can you see he had a seat for adult especially his dealings with a spendthrift uncle who seemed to take money from his father freely and with impunity to pay the loan shark it was a pattern he knew from the scripture passages read in church keeper my he chortling with recognition it goes beyond your brother are we responsible for other what is our when somebody does something that is so do you really have to do it because a or or you made vows of what is the right thing to do for the other and for all of this carried through i would see it acted out one way in and i would hear it

illumination through carnal knowledge read the novel in the after it was given to him by and the two stars of by the time he set to making a movie it was the and the novel was again seen as a challenge to conservative then at full volume stated aims for the picture were straightforward he wanted to give the gospel story a contemporary the way great artists like had done and he wanted to fulfill his childhood vision and take the biblical epic to a different place but the project soon turned complicated beyond belief after committing to the picture in paramount pictures began to have

persecution of often to the point of martyrdom is real and continuing since the sept 11 the word has taken on awful new connotations is inadvertently topical like the the picture interrogates the very idea of by proposing that there are instances when martyrdom the believer holding fast to to the bitter end is not holy or even right it makes in the way of art the arguments made in defense of that

suffering and he hears a voice he takes to be it was to be trampled on by men that i was born into this novel poses a very profound theological peter c a catholic theologian at who was born in told me question is are we allowed to do an essentially evil act to obtain a good if it is done to save then the answer is no but the novel is so complex because he does it for his for the good end of saving his flock he will go to hell but he will go to hell for their tramples on the because his intention is right to save the lives of others the act seems right and because it entails the sacrifice of his exalted sense of it seems a a loss of self for sake the novel work through theological questions so scholastically it enfolds them within other whether missionary activity is ipso facto a form of and whether the content of a religious faith is lost in translation when it is promulgated in a new language in a new land should the church adapt to particular or should it maintain an approach distinctively its in that is a question of since the council of when the by clashed over whether new should be held to law the history of has turned on questions of the brilliance of is that it shows how these questions increase and multiply the young seem to favor adopting peasant taking the sacraments directly to the people and calling their hut a magistrate a figure akin to grand inquisitor tells that cannot take root in the that is japan when finally meets concurs the they are breakaway the apostate priest they worship the of not the son of god those dying upside down in the they die for he tells they died for you for all is itself a complex act of a featuring a point of that could not have been written by anyone but a the is an expression of a point developed in a new book by the artist it is an image of god devised by the shogunate for the purpose of but over the course of the it becomes an authentic image of under the converts abuse it they renounce their faith but that mean they stop believing they keep in mysterious ways own body of work is a strong argument for in that he instinctively finds religious patterns and images in dispirited society his is an act of cultural adaptation would call it to the third here an catholic adapts a novel about catholics for a movie arguably most distinctive art form and yet suggests that of the usual kind is impossible it makes vivid the idea that the act called apostasy can be a shrewd adaptation of religious faith to a hostile and that faith maintained in spite of a outward acts of apostasy is faith nonetheless the question the novel comes down is you a this posed by to the peasant is one that must answer for himself before he approaches the and long after he tramples on it it is a question that cannot be answered for the believer by the or a or society the novel is not about a struggle with a hostile culture when the magistrate says as denies no unconsciously the priest raised his voice as he spoke struggle was with in my own before it opens in new and in will be screened in for several hundred and for at the no stretch to suppose that pope a will find a way to be there assuredly will be and

it was a warm morning in and on a farm just north of bell 46 runners gathered at the starting preparing to run one of the yet most of races called the big backyard the race required contestants to run a course that spanned 4 167 over trails etched out of the every hour if you finished faster than an you got five or 10 minutes to rest or eat or go to the bathroom before the next round if it took you longer than an you were out the race would keep hour after blessed until there was only one runner left the reason the big backyard had chosen 4 167 miles for his course is that if you ran 24 loops in 24 have gone exactly 100 miles the reason named it big backyard ultra was big was the name of his and the farm on which the race was run in his virtually all the runners had experience had won a in just the month with a time of 23 hours 16 minutes 31 seconds had placed third in a race in last one man told me he would soon be running from to another said he was using this race as preparation for a coming race i had come to watch an whom world had once described as at the age of has been running long races adventure treks and since his late he is not a very fast nor a very stylish but he has a skill much more important for the kind of race he an unusual ability to fight through pain and fatigue he told me recently that the moment he craves is the moment when every fiber of his being screams need that moment when i is how he put it when he first started did it as a form of penance was feeling badly about myself and wanted to punish he said as he realized he was good at running long and even more extreme events became a way to test his limits to some build his celebrity five years running took on another role in his it helped keep him sane runs long distances not only because he loves it but because it is one thing he can do that nobody can take away from him to put it another running has saved his life the first time i ever spoke to he was calling me from a telephone in a prison in this was in the spring of three years after the financial crisis in the wake of that millions of people lost their homes during the they had taken on mortgages they ultimately afford who had gotten caught up in the housing was in prison for mortgage fraud at the i was writing columns in the business section of the new a number of which focused on the unwillingness of the justice department to hold accountable the top executives of the companies that had led the country over the like of countrywide and yet here was this smallest of small who had lost two houses during the sentenced to 21 months in jail for supposedly committing bank fraud the more i looked into the sketchier the whole situation seemed it had begun after an internal revenue service agent watched a produced by about an expedition had a grueling run across the the agent started wondering how had time to earn a living with all the time he spent running he opened an investigation it included dumpster dives outside apartment that found nothing wrong with his taxes but an undercover female assigned to befriend got him to brag about taking a couple of while she secretly had a tape recorder rolling liar loan is the term for loans in which people overstate their incomes to qualify for mortgages they probably have millions of people took out liar loans during the housing just as did thousands of brokers encouraged them to do just as broker did and as it turns the evidence against was so thin that the jury found him innocent of providing false information to the bank even as it was convicting him of bank fraud go figure the point i made in the column is that something wrong with a system that sends to prison and lets go free it often happen this but something good came out of my it helped get a book contract two months the titled was published the first quarter of it tells the harrowing story of as a young addict who resist either booze or who drives away people who love and who has a number of close calls during cocaine buys and after a he runs to purge his guilt first marathon takes place the morning after a cocaine binge when he finally starts taking sobriety after the birth of his first running marathons becomes his focus in in mistakenly enrolls in a not seeing the he thinks it is a there comes a point in the race when realizes that he actually craves the pain told me to go he writes the welcome the use the transcend the he somehow finishes the and his career as a runner is born for the next constantly tries to find ever more difficult challenges he runs in around the globe he runs the race that many consider the toughest in the world the first time he runs he comes in eighth he follows that with two and two finishes with heat that can go as high as 130 degrees and cold as low as 30 it is his favorite race in with cameras in runs across the with two other runners two years participates in a second running across with a renowned in his own right race results in a between the two he has sponsors he makes motivational speeches and he dabbles in real estate buying and selling a dozen homes before the bubble bursts after of it all falls apart there any other runners in explains in but there was a small gravel track a little at a began running on it others began to join mostly men who were out of shape and for whom he became an exercise coach as well it long before running became his prison therapy he got the nickname running man from his fellow inmates but he also needed a goal something not just to occupy him but to motivate him so he decided to run 135 the same length as and to do it on the same day in that was being held on the west coast of course he had to prepare at one point the prison was in and he get outdoors to do the he had planned that day so he ran the equivalent of 15 miles in place in his cell and although it took him two days because he had to go back to his cell at night he pulled it running 81 miles the first day and 54 the next officials too happy about recalled a former prison inmate who befriended and confirmed account of prison life tried to bust it up by saying he was violating the rules by not wearing a said calmly walked over to where his put it and then continued running he has a lot of declined to comment on account of his running pursuits in even remember descriptions of that run the way other inmates sidled up to him to quietly root him his dealing with prison rules during the the sheer satisfaction and even joy he took from running 540 laps on a rutty track in a west prison are the highlight of the book ends with getting out of falling in love with a woman named whom he and preparing to run what big backyard ultra is hardly but not chopped either what makes it so difficult is partly that it has no definite end it might go 20 or it might go 40 in races of 75 or 100 runners can afford to have a bad during which they will down food and and try to regather themselves in this a bad stretch means out of the race because you finish the loop in the allotted hour who has organized a handful of other long races besides this particularly enjoyed the psychological dimension to big backyard ultra it gets down to a handful of it becomes a mental he said as he stroked his long gray beard and puffed on a cigarette want to show pain if you show the others will try to put you and hatcher had driven from an the day before the race i met them in a hotel where explained how being in prison had affected his life vote i own a he said when i tried to rent a car to come i was turned he sometimes gets spooked when someone knocks on the door although gives him he has lost his paying sponsors he and hatcher have sometimes been turned down when tried to rent a place and he makes monthly payments to bank of for the the court says he owes in restitution by the time i arrived at a little before the 7 and hatcher had set up a table filled with food fig liquid chocolate almond and supplies and among other tents were scattered around the lawn as the runners approached the starting line they stood behind an timing clock and began running when rang a cowbell i could actually hear cows in the background there were some people here who knew what had happened to five years but most they knew him as a runner one they all respected an older durable and mentally he race plays to his once had a reputation for in the documentary the he is shown berating his fellow runners when they want to quit the run but people told he was the friendliest and most helpful of runners weeks had helped prepare a young runner named who was hoping to break the record for the fastest run across even while was at big backyard crew checked in daily to update him and ask advice times during the first handful of loops were between 52 and 55 minutes he wore earphones and listened to the novel as he ran he was never but never last either between he would down some gulp some say a few words to other runners and take encouragement from his who was serving as his crew by the ninth the field was down to 18 hatcher speculated that the unseasonably warm day was taking a toll on the including thrill is he said to as he tried to replenish the calories he was losing then he went to the starting line for the 10th loop by 7 the next morning by which time 100 miles had been run there were only four runners including and the younger two were running sometimes finishing laps in less than 50 minutes and looking as though they could go on forever was hurting and seeing how easily they were running helping matters got my he said with a wry smile he been struggling for a while i keep hoping something is going to on the 27th came in at 48 and who himself was starting to struggle followed at 52 was nowhere to be seen hatcher saw him in the woods with a minute and a half to go he crossed the finish line 30 seconds before the 28th lap was to start he turned to and not sure but i think he got hatcher said he had run 112 5 miles in 27 hours won the race when dropped out one lap after he and hatcher had returned to he sent me an email was not a great race for he wrote felt lethargic from the start i know why there is no real way to pinpoint exactly why i feel better or worse during any given event part of the to keep going even when not performing at my one thing i had pressed him on was why he enjoyed a sport that seemed so far beyond what most humans would be willing to endure had a hard time explaining beyond the idea that he liked to push through pain in the he tried again run solely to he wrote run to explore other places and also to explore myself running is a mechanism that lets me focus on one task forward movement like removing all the clutter in the closet in order to see the actual closet space running organizes there and helps me get rid of things i

over the past president v of has received two starkly different messages about hacking into computer networks from the current and future presidents of the united you and not even sure it was you the white house confirmed in a statement on that eight days before the presidential the united states the government directly regarding malicious that was state it sent the message over a rarely used a connecting the nuclear risk reduction centers in both which they had agreed three years ago could also be employed to deal with major the warning only the latest after verbal cautions by president his defense secretary and the director of national intelligence was reported by the post the warnings to against further hacking into polling or registration or any further effort to affect the outcome of the are being hailed by the administration as a success in deterrence after they a year and a half of hacking activity seemed to or and there is no evidence that voting or counting of ballots was disrupted on election day but more than a few experts in deterring take a more skeptical view they say the had already achieved their main to demonstrate how they could disrupt the electoral process with the leak of hacked including from the democratic national committee and campaign john d suffered nothing worse than a they note no no counter no embarrassing revelations engineered by the united states and he now has the satisfaction of dealing with j who during the campaign praised promised to build a more productive relationship with and maintained there was no evidence that the were behind the hacking anything wrong happens they like blame the trump said in an 10 debate with know if the doing the hacking maybe there is no trump contended that the allegations of activity were intended to for advocating a new relationship with he frequently repeated similar sentiments in the last weeks of the suggesting the hacking was a fabrication the leaks of emails worked largely to his embarrassing democratic leaders like representative of who was forced to resign as the chairwoman of the democratic national committee larger strategic message is that the united states and need to cooperate on a range of issues but for now the situation underscores the uncertainty around the world about the direction of foreign policy and gives the opportunity to exploit differences between the current president and his successor until trump is inaugurated on 20 it is also raising the question of whether the white house pushed back hard enough when intelligence agencies concluded on 7 that officials could have authorized these a a computer expert at the center for strategic and international studies in dismissed the claim that it had deterred hacking seems a little bold to claim this is a success for since the deterred from doing he said hacking work was mostly complete the issue now is whether they will be deterred in the and the guessing is they will not strong private warnings enough to constitute in the appear to have paid less of a price for their hacking around the election than north did for its attack on pictures entertainment in 2014 that attack melted down about 70 percent of computers and servers at its wreaking considerable and embarrassed many executives it was in response to the release of a that imagined a plot to kill the north leader after the the united states issued more sanctions against north and encouraged china to limit the all of which runs through switching centers many experts had expected the white house to follow a similar path with the white house concluded that the and the unstated suggestion that the united states had the power to reach inside networks and see the origin of might suffice it is not clear if the administration plans any other actions against before departure from but that seems less and less likely the 31 warning did not deal with the hacking of the democratic national committee or which r clapper the director of national had previously said was conducted with the knowledge of the leadership it referred only to the concerns about hacking around the election process and the fear it was originating from though it stopped short of saying it was a attack

was out of town at a conference on information technology in 2015 when he was struck with terrible abdominal pain he tried to go to an urgent care center and called several local doctors no one could see him so he headed to the nearest emergency room on the he called his insurance company to make sure the visit would be covered once he got to the palms of hospital emergency a doctor gave him some medication and and let him go a month feeling better and back at home in baton received an bill from the doctor who treated him for really makes me and kind of breaks my he said when people go to the emergency they are often stunned to discover that doctors who treated them are not employed by the hospital and bill their insurance company separately these doctors negotiate separate deals with insurance companies for payment if the doctor and the insurance company never strike a the visit is billed at much higher rates while the insurance company sometimes pays the higher unlucky patients like can be caught in the crossfire they receive care and have no idea what it will end up costing them new research published in the new england journal of medicine on found that more than one in five patients visiting the emergency room may face the same financial shock the study looked at billing data from one large national insurer and found that 22 percent of the patients who went to a hospital covered by their plan still received a bill from a doctor who was not in the insurance network the average such bill cost more than though there was a wide the highest was for more than this is not the first time researchers have examined surprise medical but the broadest analysis to date of the problem nationwide the study found wide variation across the country over the likelihood that someone would get a surprise medical bill in for the rates of surprise billing were 89 compared with where it was near zero once patients get to the emergency they have little choice over who treats them put it in very blunt this is the health equivalent of a said an assistant professor of health policy and economics at and a of the paper cooper argues that the problem could be solved by which could make the visit a package that includes both the doctor and hospital consumer and scholars like see the surprise bill as unfair nearly impossible for patients to uncover the contract arrangements of individual physicians once they walk into an emergency room or are brought by ambulance by and not aware that playing that type of financial said chuck the programs director at consumers an advocacy group that has been urging states and congress to help solve the problem follow the and they go to the and then just like a several states have passed legislation aimed at tackling the including new and where a law recently went into effect but the state laws affect only a fraction of insurance customers insurance offered by large like is regulated under federal law and most of the laws work by setting up a dispute resolution system for which means they need to know they can go to state authorities to fight a big bill congressman a democrat from introduced legislation last year to tackle the practice but he said he experienced healthy dose of from his colleagues on the ways and means committee had heard complaints of surprise bills from and it turns out that the new study found that is a hot spot for the practice said he would introduce the legislation again next year think that got to be a way to get consumers out of this he said president included proposals to limit emergency room bills in his budget and recent regulations have made it more difficult for doctors to collect certain though those rules are being fought in court by physicians the acting administrator for the centers for and services has said that surprise bills are a policy priority for him the data in the study come from one large commercial but the researchers agreed not to name it in exchange for access cooper said there was only a little difference in the share of surprise bills in places where the insurance company had a lot of compared with those where it did less business emergency room doctors criticized the findings and were quick to blame the insurers the college of emergency the medical society that represents the said patients are much less likely to face large unexpected bills than the study citing an analysis the group did in of patients who were or asked to make up the difference between what the insurer pays and what the doctor bills balance bills are less than a couple of hundred on said the president she said that most doctors want to be included in networks but that they are not being offered reasonable fees is insurance company bad said whose group this week put out a parody video that accuses the insurers of paying too little for their work insurance companies like to blame the arguing that while they can reach a deal with the there are many doctors who refuse to be part of the network they offer under a plan and the insurers argue hospitals have a responsibility to make sure the outside doctors they use to staff their emergency rooms sign contracts with the same health plans they do would go a long way to reduce and prevent consumers from receiving a big surprise balance a spokeswoman for health insurance a trade said in an email the new authors agree when received his he tried appealing the charge to his insurance company understand that you went to a preferred provider facility and did not have a choice of the emergency room physician who treated his insurer wrote back but denied the claim then he went to the private practice that had sent him the bill it was willing to negotiate knocked off half the he said is great would you rather get punched four times or two i guess two times is

periodically you know this by now creating strong passwords and never using the same password across sites is one of the simplest things you can do to protect yourself from digital invasion not everyone agrees about frequent password changes most say you should use really strong passwords and no more than one password per then use the password managers but making up new combinations all the time is irritating and tempting people to reuse them or make them too simple that is one reason some experts object to frequent password changes far better to create really strong ones for every login and new passwords can pose security because hard to remember complex so you are tempted to write them down that can lead to a lot of passwords to keep track of recommends password which help store many with one master password he said he uses but knows plenty of people who use and and he have a strong reason to recommend one over another as far as making passwords up be precious about it use a

or the valet asks the question eyes not quite meeting those of the contemplative man standing before him frank ocean has been staying at this secluded hotel here for a while long enough that when the valet spies him coming down the front he knows the routine on this the the model x with the rear doors the dash looks like the helm of a with a center console map display bigger than an once on the ocean never consults been more than a year since had a steady home most of his beloved cars are in storage he moves from city to hotel to hotel in a couple of be in new looking for an apartment a day after turn 29 four years he released a supremely confident deconstruction of contemporary and announced that his first love had been with a man in the subsequent he was nominated for six performed at the ceremony and toured the world and he was gone not quite a full but something like it what had appeared to be the beginning of a stunning ascent instead curled into a question mark this past ocean and with a bounty a visual album streaming followed by another digital complemented by a glossy boys distributed at shops in four cities but apart from a lighthearted note and a couple of photos posted on his ocean speak publicly having emerged from the ether with ocean returned to it his mystery intact not that you would be able to sense the swirl of curiosity that surrounds him by his demeanor during conversations over two days last month edited excerpts are below he was preternaturally consistently reflexively and wryly funny this has been the case for years it made him something of an when he emerged as part of the odd future and an still when he catapulted into top a group of people not much given to pensive remove over the past three his absence from the pop troposphere a void interrupted only by the occasional post or paparazzi shot has felt like a position statement against celebrity while simultaneously guaranteeing that by fervent would grow even wider his exile began in earnest in 2013 he was living in a apartment high over sunset and with a panoramic view of south but the city was choking people had stolen money from there were sorts of things going on in the and he grew concerned about the management of his affairs started to weigh on me that i was responsible for the moves that had made me but i reaping the share of the and that was problematic for me in the midst of all of this feeling of he added my there was a lot of places i thought i could turn that i felt like i turn to so he hopping a plane to a city where he barely knew with only a duffel bag full of clothes and a backpack carrying the precious hard drives holding all of his music a fine line between a sane escape and running away did you feel you were on one side or the other of i never thought about it like that i always thought about it if your house is on you need to get out of the house did you feel that certain things in your career also gone the way you would have certain moments were drawbacks for sure now i look at things but at the yeah audiences in excess of five million people national i was always reluctant to do those things except in cases where they had this nostalgic significance to me like performing at the being tapped to perform at the me saying yes to those things had a lot to do with how those things made me feel before i was actually in the business and just wanting to be rubbing shoulders with those people and being seen at those places i still was reluctant and sort of skeptical of those things because i questioned whether or not i was prepared i feel like the public knock on you is that you want to be or you want to be in some kind of retreat from the spotlight sometimes fascinated with how famous my work could be while not so famous of the fact that daft punk can wear robot helmets and be one of the most famous bands in the while also understanding that will never be my situation too late hard to articulate how i think about myself as a public figure gotten used to being frank ocean a lot of people stopped me on the street when i put music out in a literally would yell out of an where the has dating been difficult for you in this period of increased i think normal would be the whatever that word which is usually nothing in a very different place than i was four or five years ago with all that stuff different in my relationship with which means everything shame or you crisis have you been in love since since not the lasting kind control is often at the forefront of mind when he was on his concerts would be recorded each and he would watch the type up notes and email them to his team to prepare for a morning meeting when and were being he carried the hard drives with his music in his and the rather the plane goes down in flames and the drives go down with me than somebody put out a weird posthumous when he answers he takes meaningful mulling over before answering in expansive stories paired with precise bursts of logic after bouncing around hotels in he moved into a furnished apartment that he eventually stripped bare of all but the just wanted to be able to walk around and not run into an end table or some useless piece of he rode electric bikes around the made new friends is not as difficult as celebrities make it went on dates he recorded in a handful of including abbey where he asked for the to be removing furniture and bringing in flower arrangements piece by the music that would become and was coming though up until it had been slow going begun recording at electric lady in new but after he took a pause away from the the rhythm of writing was gone had block for almost a he said during that he would go to the at the monitors and come up with or nothing that i that dry spell broke only after he reconnected with a childhood friend from new who was going through difficult times that he me feel as though i should talk about the way i grew up he decided that he wanted and to be more autobiographical than his earlier releases wrote in two he said end product always that depiction of the real struggle that so he turned and telling stories about his family and romantic relationships some like on care for he cares for good some like on grown up on the same was written about someone who i was actually in a relationship who an unrequited he said was it was just we really relate we really on the same in like on he manipulated his voice to sound to better capture the time he was evoking many of the new songs have two or three competing narratives different points of view participating in the same story was my version of collage or he said we experience memory not linear not telling the stories to we know the just seeing it in flashes on you used a lot of different voices sometimes i felt like you hearing enough versions of me within a there was a lot of hyperactive thinking even though the pace of the not the pace of ideas being thrown out is are they always multiple points of or are they multiple franks interrupting each other to be the same thing to me because my point of view from one emotional state to another is a different point of view sometimes i want to talk on a song and be because i am angry then always a part of me that remembers that this record lives past my being and so do i really want to be angry about is that feeling going to have were you working toward a fixed idea on these or was it mutating and evolving as you when i was making the there was 50 versions of i have a little and he heard one of the and gotta put that one the and i was not the because it give me peace yet you were reaching for something just just melodies i know what combination of those objects is gonna make me feel how i need to feel but i know precisely the feeling that needs to happen at the same time he was chasing a he was trying to regain control of his business relationships he replaced his team new new new publicist and he began negotiations to free himself from his contract with def the label that had signed him in 2009 and effectively shelved him until his debut caused a stir in 2011 chess is how he described the process of buying himself out of his contract and purchasing back all of his master recordings using his own he said as a condition of the he def jam took on distribution of his next which is available only as a streaming video album on apple music less than two days came a big released independently by ocean music paid to host the premiere of but ocean said there was no ongoing relationship with this was an album wholly his own that took center debuted atop the billboard album chart with the opening week of the behind only drake and when releasing and he took his know that once out so not really tripping on how long he described his mood after the release of as rather than going on a promotional playing radio festivals and making the usual he spent about a month just around you solved some rather intractable business issues you the cast of professionals who work on your career were those your main with this record in i wanted to feel like i won before the record came and i and so it took a lot pressure off of me about how the record even would perform after the fact once the goal is everything else is lagniappe not essential for me to have a big debut not essential for me to have big radio records what about the data the the i know exactly what the numbers are i need to know i need to know how many records how many album equivalents from which territories are playing my music more than because it helps me in conversations about where gonna be playing or where i might open a retail like a store or something do you feel like the numbers are commensurate with what you thought they would or should we doubled first week always gonna be could have done a little bit i guess a satisfaction that comes with looking at numbers like and no of master of equity on my record and there have been too in ocean won two and he has been nominated but come he will not win because he chose not to submit his music for consideration institution certainly has nostalgic he said just seem to be representing very well for people who come from where i come and hold down what i hold he noted that since he was just a few black artists have won album of the including quincy and ray though ocean said the reached out to his he never spoke with them directly before making his decision think the infrastructure of the awarding system and the nomination system and screening system is he said rather this be my moment for the than sit there in the this willingness to remove himself from a situation not designed for him to thrive in is perhaps greatest gift his backbone is firm though he still publishes emotional decrees on from time to time his note on the death of prince was he largely avoids social media his twitter is gone usually a handful of trusted friends or family members make him aware of things he might need or want to know was his agent who told him about recent speech on his he is as much as artist what he does may be less important than what he chooses not to do and moving what he may choose not to do is release an album without a visual or even release something album length at all not in a record i have to operate in an album he said can operate in or he might devote less time to music believe that one of the best in the world at what i and all ever wanted to he said more interesting for me to figure out how to be superior in areas where where a a few weeks he was flying back from with his mother after a white house state where he had been one of president guests ocean told her how been poking around the visual arts degree offerings at the new thinking about what it would take to begin to learn and refine a new craft you have time to do she told him and he laughing now after a long the is parked behind an anonymous recording where about to go work on new music trying to flex up on my he said it was personal service announcement to to just be like look at your you have the luxury of now finished back in control has always been my life and no one he how always been since the day i came in
description of business partners as his in an interview published by on drew an angry response from who took offense at the racial connotation of the word the dispute between the and who plays for the cavaliers and is one of the most visible also left forward in the uncomfortable position of having to answer questions about a sudden feud involving one of his bosses and one of his good friends the interview was a q and a in which talked about the state of the the criticism of his management of the and his relationship with but took exception with description of the group of friends who travel and work with him as his and maverick his close friend and business both took offense at use of the word carter told he was bothered because of the idea that said it because and his friends are and he can use that said he had lost respect for as a result of the comments see the success that we but then there is always someone that lets you know how far we still have to go as told reporters in believe that would have used that term if he was doing business with someone else and working with another team or if he was working with anybody in sports that was owning a team that and had a group of guys around them that agree with what they did i think he would have called them a posse but it just shows how far we have to go but it stop us from doing what we need to do as a carter and two other high school rich and randy founded management company a decade ago the agency handles marketing and representation duties for and other players the company has been successful since its positioning as one of the top of his generation in the responding to a question about decision to leave the and whether he could imagine magic leaving pat and the or leaving and the turned his response back around to was playing with the they went to and he wanted to spend the told do overnights teams just so now a reference to the heat to text and do i do in this and who has are on the you are with this you hold up the whole team because you and your mom and your posse want to spend an extra night in did not respond to remarks he left practice without speaking to members of the news media and did not respond to an email while posse is defined as a group of friends or a professor of and studies at said he could understand why took offense the cultural definition of the word has shifted toward defining drug cartels in cultural the group of that surround a celebrity talking about is a rhetorical and one of the things interesting about rhetoric is sort of the study of who can say what to whom and under what conditions or can say what whom and under what said word in and of itself is never neutral it never means the same in all and when the word is used as by instead of in a private its connotation said you have an official or executive that uses that language that makes its way into mainstream it has a different he added shifts depending on with it left a close friend of to answer questions about the subject agreed that he considered a loaded and he said that he would not want his group of friends or family to be referred that way but declined to ascribe any assumptions or intent to i think he meant it any kind of said really know i think he did i would hope that he just says things and he says the first thing that comes to mind and then probably is in his office right now regretting it i know when it comes to you just never know going to be coming out it depends on listening people take it the right way or people take it the wrong way you just never know when it comes to just understand him talking about right in i understand

from the the central enigma was j trump how did this celebrity tycoon with no political experience get so who were the supporting him and when i started my unusual assignment of covering the presidential campaign from the perspective of a foreign correspondent for an news organization one of the first things i did was to invite questions from international readers the bulk of them revolved around whose unorthodox romp through the republican primaries propelled him to the nomination and ultimately to the presidency going back through my journey across there were many clues to rising although not all were easy to read i drank with trump supporters in bars and casinos i approached them at rodeos i chatted with them at gun clubs and diners and roaring political rallies the broad topography of trump country in many easy to trace it is a place of anger and gripped by a feverish sentiment people wanted change and a chance to raise a throbbing finger to the forces they blame for their lot in life yet other factors were at in this unruly factors that sometimes made it hard to see talk social media bubbles and a simmering culture war separating thriving coastal areas and the wounded interior of the country it always clear which elements were powering the as the movement called and which were being buoyed along one of my first stops was a decimated coal town in west it had a sports which offered beer for on and a biker bar it was patrons sometimes squealed tires inside until the room filled with smoke both were filled with trump little surprise since he had promised to reopen coal mines shuttered by the environmental regulations and cheap natural gas in i also saw how message about change was overshadowing other issues that many analysts thought would have disqualified him from winning over the social conservatives who have long been a core republican constituency in conversations after church on many glossed over the three marriages and boasts of his battle with sexually transmitted disease like trump told stern in it was hard to but perhaps that was the that a mysterious alchemy was at work in this one in which outrageous might offer a route to success around that apple released its seventh iteration of the that glossy black totem of progress inscribed on the back of every are the words in assembled in as if is a separate country and how many in trump country saw it that instead of being part of the they were living in a land that sent jobs overseas one thing that like many and other had long seen as distinguishing the united states was its restless optimism and innate traded on pessimism his great embodied a vision that aimed to restore pride in the military and but also scapegoated minorities and at most of the faces in the crowd were white people flew confederate flags they spoke impatiently about prejudice toward was openly a factory owner in told me that children in which has the largest percentage of had stayed home from school in droves on sept 11 because they had secretly received advanced warnings of the attacks the atmosphere at trump rallies was permissive if someone said something offensive or there was little fear of being hushed or contradicted yet in another confounding a significant minority of trump supporters were minorities themselves i met people who defied neat a black woman in her who worked at a record label in a driver in las a doorman in at a rally in the final week in a rust belt state that would prove central to i saw how the candidate connected with crowd when he it was if he held an invisible tuning fork held to his listening for the smallest murmur of which he would seize upon and amplify it reminded me of powerful preachers and populist politicians seen during my years based in what was hard to know was how far the electric energy inside this hall was radiating maybe these were just the loyalists polls suggested that trump was behind in many places critical to electoral college victory political including dismissed the notion that trump could win mainly by consolidating the support of white voters like the hunt for the lost tribes of the was how a consultant who had worked for the 2012 republican mitt put it early on you paddle your canoe far enough up the and bang your drum hard they will come to the riverbank but just not but when i mentioned the polls showing trump lagging to his they snorted derisively everyone they knew was voting trump children some were former democrats others were people who voted for decades the they were either asking the wrong questions or were being manipulated by the news media the polls themselves were part of the system these people were trying to overthrow at the i discounted the conspiratorial talk as a product of the echo chamber that became so powerful in this election but in broad the trump supporters were right in key their votes were by pollsters the winning margin in many like was and the failure of democrats to mobilize turnout was also a major factor the driver who took me from a trump rally to the was a case in he was an a registered and he did not intend to vote of them look any good to he said benefited also from the antipathy so many people felt toward his this was another theme in the questions that poured in from international why did so many seem to hate her so the answer had many fatigue from her decades in public unfinished business from her time in power in the distaste for how she had handled his sexual outrage over her use of a private email server while secretary of state and her taking in huge sums for speeches to wall street unfiltered sexism and simply did not represent change at a moment when a large portion of the electorate hungered for it in while i was visiting my one of his friends offered an explanation like getting socks for again he said bloody socks nobody wants a present like in the found the of white voters they heard his and voted as a bloc like never before stunning victory echoes jolting changes in and other countries where a new brand of politics is resurgent the question of whether it stemmed from a specific constellation of or represented a more fundamental may now be answered under the trump presidency

so just when we thought that 2016 get any more it with a trump victory i told you last week that strange happenings were afoot in the what with the cubs winning the world series and all i hear that new yorkers are taking it pretty hard are people stocking up on canned greetings from the land of duck and not sure quite sunk in but foods and subterranean real estate are in demand and sounds like a hunting club so where shall we a little weary of the conversations get right to what do you think will happen trump will set up an administration the sun will rise in the east my dog will chase squirrels the world will go on glad to hear taking it well he stayed cautiously neutral in the but a very good boy i think you once made the point to me that there are no permanent victories or defeats in politics so perhaps a good place to start a conversation about the future been since i came to at the collective failure to understand that point it is patently true upon the most cursory inspection of recent history in democrats were popping champagne over the dawn of a permanent era of progressive politics now they see most of their dreams being unraveled and republicans celebrating today will sooner or later be miserable i made a things are looking better already both winners and losers who ignore this reality make silly unforced errors the losers err on the side of excessive like the classic threats to leave the country reader email has informed me way harder to leave the country than one might think we in all that much demand and the winners fail when they convince themselves that since victory is they can set an agenda that attracts no one from the other side looking at a president trump and a house and say we are in for a stretch of dumb things presidents generally get most of their big changes done in the first year or two president did that with health care his agenda was nothing compared to w who did everything from tax cuts to getting authorization for the invasion but was certainly a big lift it was also a central campaign promise i know you think it was a bad idea i think that strategy is enormously shortsighted i remember thinking when the democrats held the white house and both houses of congress in though they have it might be wise to give a little to bring some centrist republicans into some day the republicans might be in a position to reverse everything if they have zero political investment in and sure here we are my point is that of course a president should have a vision that matches his ideology why he got elected but i think it is impractical and imprudent to forgive me for another reference to is spinal turn it up to 11 give on a few things where you have because someday going to need friends to protect the stuff you care about most the trump administration might learn from the outgoing horror at seeing some or all of repealed we part company here my perception of was of a democratic party willing to work on compromise legislation while the republicans just stalled there was no unified republican just a ton of people who wanted to be but kept changing their mind but the bottom line is that left behind the old congress now got guys who sleep in their offices and even talk to the other side at the house gym secretly a lot of them are actually but i take your point and another recommendation i would make to president make friends everyplace that was the magic golf with the same people every week since i have no prepared to look on the bright side for a while the republican hatred of is so great that even if had gotten elected it would have been really hard to get the necessary fixes through congress trump has promised and as of his interview something better that preserves the most popular parts of the program so see what he comes up with i know a big fan his agenda and agenda really do congress is set to have a big influence on the agenda over the next and and trump will figure out how to make their ideas jibe plan includes a health care replacement plan for it will actually do some of the things liberals really like getting more people covered i realize that very disappointing for progressives to see but not like it will be replaced by nothing this is one area where the product usually resemble the recipe i remember presidential candidate saying all health care negotiations could take place in on grab your crystal ball and give me a couple of other predictions seeing a big tax cut and huge spending on infrastructure repair followed by a stupendous rise in the national debt certainly true that neither party has been great at getting the deficit under control in my lifetime nobody calls his or her congressman and just do sit only one side adds to the deficit while simultaneously complaining too big but move on obviously cranky how any other how about the early the republican establishment seems to have as white house chief of staff but is going to be chief strategist which could mean anything to me is the kind of guy democrats should learn to live with they and going to be a republican white house but is a very bad dude who represents all the worst strands of racism and misogyny in the trump crowd who do you think will really have the it looks like both will be influential after watching the i find pair of appointments too surprising they signal that in as during his trump will seek to merge traditional republican politics with his unconventional brand of populism and what about it seems now the wall may be a and the deportees will be only criminals has been trying to deport undocumented immigrants who break the law for years see where the big switch is i think given what heard so far in that trump said that securing the southern border will probably involve a mixture of wall and and that he plans to limit deportations to illegal immigrants who have committed crimes those steps would not require the kind of massive deportation force that some predicted and feared been thinking a lot about the source of strength rural areas and declining small cities you always told me that one of our problems is that have stopped moving to where the jobs apparently right and prefer to stay be angry and elect trump president one interpretation another is that people simply have the skills for the promising jobs that would require a especially since we stopped teaching vocational and technical skills so they stay put i find this the more compelling view i always prefer the explanation that just boil down a move i have three so i confess to using that approach sometimes as to how all this affected my colleague nick published a wonderful book earlier this year called without it shows the collapse of employment among men over the past 50 years this got much worse in the wake of the great recession and the disappointing most of which yielded no income growth for the entire bottom 80 percent of the income distribution in other the economic recovery was only really salient for the richest fifth of the population important which i plan to reiterate regularly when trump begins his economic program by reducing taxes for the rich and regulations on the banks the problem just material especially given the expansion of welfare benefits the loss of dignity that comes from not creating value through honest work for neither party has addressed this dignity crisis for men without a college education an obvious connection here with the explosion of suicide and opiate abuse in rural i think all pretty clear today that a cry of rage from white and trump was pretty good on the end but beyond a huge infrastructure repair plan which was actually clearer on i heard a whole lot of solutions when trump talked about kicking out illegal immigrants and canceling experts scoffed at the unworkability and undesirability of the specific proposals but i talked to tons of people supporting trump who basically know if that stuff will work but finally a guy who at least is saying try something to bring back someone who cared about them the bottom line was change versus no change almost always the way voters decide presidential elections and i am sorry to say that was the candidate all she promised was more of the administration plus that infrastructure repair it made sense in many ways the country has recovered from a stupendous economic collapse under but if not a happy going to convince you by showing you graphs on the unemployment rate i know this election is really hard for progressives to but a way to understand at least in part a few years ago i was having lunch with who is president of the center for progress and liberal think tank presidents are secretly i asked her to given me a simplest explanation for why some people who never prospered over the past few years nonetheless loved president so much she gives them i thought that was very and i think a big part of going on today as well with trump i like your as far as the emotions goes as to ability to follow through see how it works out especially if the new first move to support the common man is deregulating the banks i just laughed out loud about that one but the holidays are and everybody deserves a little bit of a break from 24 7 politics why god invented football obviously we share the same basic theology be taking a conversational too but while being thankful on be counting our talks as one of my blessings me happy thanksgiving
j election victory was powered in part by forceful opposition to what he described as an economic and political system rigged against the people for the benefit of shadowy forces in the news the banks and the government trump and his allies often describe that system with one globalism it is a word that conjures many none of them shuttered unchecked immigration and a distant cabal believers controls the economy and the media analysts who track extremist groups in the united states have expressed alarm at the use of the word by the they say it carries multiple meanings from benign to sinister and often serves as a for and conspiracy theorists is a principle driver for the fears that animate the radical right in the united said the editor of a published by the southern poverty law center is the globalism is often used as a synonym for the system of global economic interconnection that has been critiqued for decades by liberal groups like labor environmental organizations and opponents of the international monetary fund and the world bank but for the far the term encapsulates a conspiratorial based on xenophobia and according to mark a researcher at the league a host on the media site rebel explicitly rejected its use as a synonym for in a video she posted in she said the word meant rule by autocrats such as president former president w bush and the united nations who value false flag of and immigration from the third almost always sneer down their nose at disdain national laugh at religion and generally despise the west while holding a creepy affection for the third she added want open cheap labor and to benefit their business and political and are all too willing to shaft the little people to achieve the website run by k newly appointed chief white house frequently attacked globalism and during tenure there but no one may have done more to popularize the idea of a globalist conspiracy than a radio host who commands an audience of millions through his media empire he has been called most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary by the southern poverty law center among his the sandy hook school massacre in was a hoax and the sept 11 terror attacks were an inside job posted his own definition of globalism to in 2014 in his trademark he described it as a digital control engineered by shadowy corporate and political elites he called it total form of the who has enthusiastically supported hailed the republican as a historical figure who appeared on his show last has in turn heaped praise upon reputation is trump said will not let you down you will be very i hope and i think be speaking a so what is trump talking about when he talks about his hope provided a definition in an email before the election last groups in the united states began to refer to globalism at the end of the cold when it replaced communism as an idea that was an danger to the said they have also referred to it as the new world and soon they saw its tentacles everywhere the shape of that conspiracy had distinctly in part because many of foes had historically seen communism as inextricably linked to said members of the far right became fixated on prominent like the businessman and philanthropist those conspiratorial beliefs were bolstered when former president bush celebrated the end of the cold war in a 1991 speech by saying it was the dawn of a world his use of the phrase was taken as proof by many that a globalist conspiracy really was afoot was very easy for especially because he was the one who said to take that ball and run with said that point the phrase became the short hand for that kind of globalism conspiracy the multiple meanings have made it a powerful political and and his frequent references to globalism have drawn in a wide and varied audience is a very efficient net to unite disparate parts of the from the mainstream to the said the director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at state professor called globalism defining folklore and narrative for the racist but said it had also a convenient to explain the various declines that the united states is perceived to be globalism was an important theme in the final weeks of for when he told a rally in in that his opponent for the had sat at the heart of a conspiracy with international bankers plot the destruction of the league criticized the speech for classic conspiratorial talk has continued after the election trump referred to a plot against him again last when he complained on twitter that protests were the work of the news media and paid protesters a trump ally and host on fox business later accused of many on the far right have celebrated election victory as a momentous blow against the globalist conspiracy last claimed on that trump had called him personally to thank him and his audience for their support and to offer to appear on his show again soon ms the trump did not reply to an email seeking comment late night then pivoted to what he thought was most the coming destruction of globalists that hijacked the primarily the news media and international business people soon they would be destroyed once and for he suggested is battling back to restore humanity and to break the he said not gonna be any dtente we know and just here to let you know
another engrossing day of test cricket ends with holding the upper hand thanks to a sublime unbeaten 138 from sent in late on as a makeshift opener the elegant left hander will return to the crease on

saw something in before the selectors did making runs on tired pitches in a tour it was clear he would play for seniors when marsh and burns were preferred it made me cringe was more of an option due to ashes and his exp of but still should have made his debut before in the last match even though my sympathies were with for not making his debut 87th 273 4 found his with this new ball under lights his first delivery to just passes the outside as does the and the all kissing a good length and spitting towards first can be satisfied with his or can as emails i recall the last to make a fifty on debut was dropped after making 200 best of lemon sport words from one who knows is getting his weirdness and we love it 2016 rips through with a beauty hits the cuts and sneaks between bat and pad to

drinks break a couple start full outside off but the third is on hip and he swivels a pulled four he look full of at the crease though and a quicker one swooshes past him before one wobbles off the seam beyond his outside edge still there like he has been since this time last has taken to the and delighted he it remarkable how little there is over stance as the nine commentary team insist on describing it i guess he is if he hit the ball a bit harder than grammar pedants could almost call him a dangling modifier in my i can recall snorts of derision when assorted visitors in the started facing the incoming bowler with the bat already to this day i cannot recall an more united than that day hurled a yorker to bowl tony at the in the 2nd innings of the 1st test of the ashes a tsunami of acclaimed the delivery that proved 1st innings defiant century was a the whole of maybe the had spent the following day decrying someone bowl that git a as the tall held his bat off the ground bat stays poised and vigilant in the direction of the midday sun and no not even a brouhaha in my day marks me as a but it is not exactly so but almost 85th 266 3 slows things down with a maxwell that was hardly a surprise you 84th 266 3 there was any fear might be rattled by that near miss dispelled by back to back cover driven fours to open the 84th over a pulled four wide of makes it a of to bring up the 50 on debut and push into the lead looks to the manor born top knock peter of bats during day two of the third test match between and south at oval images 83rd 249 3 new ball talking loudly for south and and are milking ones and twos from hold might have bitten off more than he could chew with one quick single too many a direct hit has him diving full length with the third umpire forced to check replays of whether the bouncing bat was in the air when the zing bails lit up not sighs of relief for the been waiting twenty years to say this about an but there 's a bit of about peter something of the about this knock from 81st 245 3 to share the new ball and so unlucky not to claim nipping one back off the catching the inside edge but it drops before the long sleeve jumpers on the fielding team indicate as the sun sets the temperature drops pretty quickly in the of the south now has his longest test innings in terms of balls faced now up to 2016 81st 243 3 is handed the new pink ball at the earliest running in from the cathedral end as the sun sets over the sending the sky an fantasy game on much doing from that first look at the new a tiny amount of swing back into the left but the only just hitting that perception of swing almost does for who plays inside the line of the last giving something to smile ruefully about 80th 243 3 hail appeal with the first delivery of over to the goes deep in his crease looking to play a cut shot but is beaten for pace to one that bounced a bit more than most he hits but the question is whether it hit his pad first the review reveals it did hit his pad but was bouncing well over worth a and a decent warning to about how his deep guard makes him an candidate sees out the rest of the but gone into his shell a bit since dinner hardly surprising considering been on the field every delivery for two days in a row south will be restored the review at the end of the over 79th 241 3 joining the a laugh bowling chaff party have but on a track as true as this against two set batsmen performing the role of a bowling machine 78th 239 3 dancing all around his crease against looking to the ball into run scoring areas after finding the field for four he finally manages to rotate the strike test cricket is fantastic love the visual but more so the change in conditions that you have to deal with 2016 77th 239 3 to tip and run against trailing by just 20 says should own up to his actions the man who threw his own mum under a bus when he tested positive 2016 76th 234 3 continuing a tight line and length to second maiden from him in a row commentary has gone to the subject of appeal which is easy to perceive as pushing the patience of the and everyone involved hearing lament the skipper not taking responsibility for his actions must have brought a few wry smiles around the country maybe should say his mum packed the mints in his kit bag and he think there was anything wrong with sucking them on 75th 234 3 into the attack now with his from over the wicket he starts with a rank wide long hop and some junk that should have generated a forcing him to change his approach around the from where he immediately looks dangerous one turns and strikes on the pads and another finds a thick edge that races along the ground past at slip 74th 230 3 is clearly trying to buy 10 cheap overs and throw his full bore at the new ball as darkness descends but this brief passage after dinner has been all so puts the breaks on finally with a maiden 73rd 230 3 partnership from just 68 deliveries as this pair continue their postprandial game of tip and run if technique and runs help him he has the patronage of a certain to prop him up the has perfect being of and st cc descent one can only imagine he likes pie too 72nd 223 3 bowling his over the wicket wrist spin to partner a similar over ensues with in particular showing a confident use of his feet that will stand him in good stead for the shah challenge to come later in the summer a couple of those nudges reach the boundary this over courtesy of some dreadful fielding some south still with their heads in the buffet and the feed is as good as it gets on the so i can hardly blame them cat on for a bowl been waiting for this all series has a fan somewhere 71st 213 3 to open the bowling for this final session of the day as south look to rattle through to the new ball in 10 overs time the over proceeds as a series of loopy left arm droppers nudged around the beautiful oval for a few singles be 32 overs bowled in the meaning likely to overrun the scheduled close of play but not by much can we ditch the channel 9 have just shown the trailer for the new you the one of that lizard sprinting away from an army of snakes straight from a room 101 evening a change of narrator for you to see you through the sunset session i have the good fortune of turning up with in the ascendancy in a test match for the first time since the ashes tour of 1989 has mixed elegance with patience to bat serenely through two sessions after his unexpected move to opener at the crease peter who has looked accomplished after a nervy first over the upright technique and guard deep in his crease is sure to provoke plenty of you have something to contribute you can reach me on twitter or email in case this story passed you town may rename cricket oval after trump read more while enjoying your dinner or i know this naming convention is a hotly debated issue on social please cast your eye over this from bull in this the spin a long way to play all across and his all call him is from in northern when was a his father left home when was a his mother and brother were killed by the and when was a he decided to come to and claim asylum in england he was placed in foster care and given a place at polytechnic soon after he turned up at though he speak much he made it clear that he was nuts about cricket and started playing for their years now has five including a c in and is still turning out for the club he is also being threatened with deportation recently lost his application to remain in the and is now on his final appeal to stay in the country he calls home at cc are petitioning the government on his behalf they say he embraced all of cricket engaging in the social and fund raising sides as well as playing the game and that is a friendly hard working lad who has quite simply become part of our you can read more about case here if persuaded by his please do sign his dynamite this the story of an incredibly kid who faces 2016 a fine session for the rattling off an even 100 runs across the two registering his fifth test century along the way it could have been if not for a that left the captain smith short of his ground when on 59 after 137 on with either side of lunch it has been a defining hand from the thrown up to the top of the list after warner was precluded from opening the innings last night he was mature enough to survive last and enough to prosper today the strokes were but so too was the hard work to see off the south trio of quality when deserving of it smith will be his call for a single to point by initially before being sent back ugly but the captain was equally brilliant in the stand it laid the foundation for the runs that desperately wanted to avoid leaving too much work to their inexperienced order with that has looked better with each minute he has spent out there since 14 not out at the long break the hosts are 50 short of a valuable first innings lead right enough from me will take the baton as day becomes night in thanks for your enjoyed it as always see you tomorrow has been the star of the second day of the third test in reaching his century shortly before the dinner break images 70th 209 3 is defending and leaving in keeping with the best traditions of the over until on his a ball happy enough to push through midwicket strong three scored sees off the final couple of collecting one to midwicket in the process and my will be dinner take a moment and wrap up the session 69th 205 3 has been given a big go in this middle session but is still searching for a maiden test scalp with only minutes to the long break is satisfied in before getting a loopy one on the tucking it away for one driving turns the strike over as meaning be up the business end for the final over of the which will be delivered by the cricket prof cut shots for 9 of his 10 runs so 2016 68th 203 3 back on for a couple before dinner too straight to stroking a single into the then a bit a cutting a couple behind gully his best shot yet he does likewise to end the and this time it goes the full journey his first boundary in test cricket feel into double figures as well 200 up as well 67th 196 3 gets another go untroubled after bringing up a century moments takes one to point gets three behind point that he tries to cut close to his body he looks a bit nervous out but perfectly understandable a big job ahead and this is what he has been picked for first to score test century since 3rd test v that 's 381 overs and 14 balls 2016 66th 191 3 four slips in place for philander i am sure very happy to be given another chance at the right hander on debut forced to play and facing up deep in his crease a tough initial interrogation for the but he comes across as a savvy enough operator to understand that a good late leave to end the over suggests some confidence a maiden will be recorded in the book now trail by with a quarter hour to come before dinner a 2016 65th 191 3 is using his feet to get to the pitch of beautifully timed and to the rope to 98 then 99 with another this time to the cheer is bigger again for who takes one his first run in test cricket now back on strike and the field up makes no mistake in cutting to a a glorious way to get and he loves it 197 balls with ten boundaries the others numbers in the equation he needed to step up with the vast inexperience across top and then again when warner was prevented from opening last night done both beautifully be some scrutiny over the run out with but time for that later for all about what a superb century great moment for the almost forgotten concept of 2016

the space suit is only a few layers of plastic and metallic material a very thin plastic shield covering your a few your visor between your body and the other side of that plastic visor is instant an amazing outside in the cosmos life in space is very interesting in some ways similar to earth busy and you have a schedule you have to follow but one overriding thing that is unlike anything on and that is weightlessness two crewed space stations now orbiting earth read is like this force it just envelops everything everything floats the instant that the rocket engines shut down on your space you were born on you had a year or two to learn how to and really three or five years to learn how to walk and run but when an the second the engines shut you have to learn how to float there is a steep learning most astronauts are learning for several weeks and often a month or two before you get as good as you a fun process you move with your hands and you carry things with your which is the opposite of how we were designed on earth it was really for lack of a better to learn how to do food in space is actually pretty good much better than what i cook by myself also fruit oranges they look pretty bad because kind of but they smell amazing the space station is this sterile very plastic and metal and every never any ever messy always like a very sterile so great to have smells from day i was floating through and i heard a bird chirping and i the heck is and i stopped and i went back the psychologist had sent an file with sounds from and he was listening to birds chirp while he exercised we had a rain sound sent up and i spent about a month going to bed at night with my headset just listening to rain as i fell asleep twitter moon over the south china photographed from the international space station terry weekend we took all the laptops in the station probably 20 or 30 laptops and we put rain on through and all weekend it rained it was really cool at first but by night we were like enough so we went around and turned the rain is a big part of life in space because and when weightless your muscles and bones atrophy so they have this exercise protocol of running on a you put on a shoulder and bungees that pull you down the treadmill is on the wall you have to learn how to run in this weird but over time i got to a point where i could run very which was really cool a bike which is interesting because no handlebars and no just some pedals you just kind of float there and and watch your show after 200 days of more than half of a i came back to earth and had lost of my bone density i was amazed to the space station had shown that humans can live and work in space for a long period of time at least 200 days and come back to earth in great shape while i was in passed away from star trek we were doing these space three space walks in a and my friend from emailed me and gotta do something for so i ran down to the i did the i took a and i tweeted the background there is which just happens to be his home down terry a fighter pilot we had a rather be lucky than good and this was an example of that it was just completely it was not i just happened to take this picture with home town in the background it was a wonderful piece of fate my first space i launched at four in the morning both my launches were at four in the morning if ever going to a great time to go shoot for four in the the views are great about 15 minutes later we were going over the north in the daylight and i saw this blue atmosphere and i never seen that shade of blue never expected seeing a that i had never seen before but that was my first impression of earth in the never seen that shade of blue twitter seen from the international space station terry pictures of sunrises and sunsets never got but the camera does not capture them well enough i want to learn how to paint so that i can paint what i we were in a rocket blew up the same one that launches crew so they delayed our replacement crew while they did an investigation we know how long we were going to be up there but my mentality in going to enjoy and then have the rest of my life to be on earth and that just knowing that there would be an end to and to try to enjoy it while i you launch with a rocket filled with millions of pounds of rocket the word really apply even just being in space if a meteorite hits your spaceship and puts a big hole in all the air will go out you live with the danger of that happening in the space station there are three kinds of air leak or ammonia and we had the ammonia alarm go off for the first time it had never happened in the history of the space station our most serious alarm because ammonia is a very deadly chemical they told us in you can smell worry about because going to how bad it is that alarm went off we spent several hours hiding on the side with the hatch closed because the use only the side does thinking that the space station was possibly dead had there really been an ammonia leak it would have ended while we were there it turned out a few hours later that it was a false alarm but that was probably one of my most scary moments the most amazing for was the lightning on earth one of my things to do in space was just to float i would go into the which is this module that i had the privilege of installing in 2010 on a space shuttle flight i would open up all the window shades if we were passing over or because there are all these amazing thunderstorms in the pacific too i would put on this song called storms of put that on the speakers and i would let go of the handles and just watching these storms kind of hard to recreate those moments sleeping in space is amazing we had a sleeping bag and we had a little like a phone booth i would get in my sleeping bag and zip it up i sleep with my arms some people sleep with their arms sticking up i would pull the sleeping bag over my and then i would not myself to the wall or put on the bungee i would just float in my little cabin and every morning i would be turned around in a because the air flow would spin me around like that meteorite recovered from farm in western read were a few times in space where i of earth i would dream of or or weather weather was something that i really missed a lot every once in a while it was really cool to dream of just something messy because the station was so sterile or some cold rain anything that was not sterile the space station was a wonderful place to live on a great never anything wrong but sometimes you want something wrong what makes us human space on on via on on on on on this content
a wonderful and discussion of an immensely complex and issue some final forcing the hand of policy makers and developing responses to poverty are vital to elephant conflict cannot be but we can try to control how humans network of parks and wild lands is needed to allow elephants to roam out demand and the legal market in china is going to be but the government appears to be for the future is not but it is probably limited to small pockets of land an entirely i will but my this excellent panel give us measured hope for the future 22 2016 many countries afraid it will not possible we often forget central and west where elephants are in many areas doomed if we cannot stop the current elephant poaching your grandchildren will probably be able to see wild elephants only in a handful of in the eastern and southern tiny islands of elephants surrounded by oceans of people 22 2016 but unless we all redouble our efforts to combat build community support for reduce reduce trafficking through market and dramatically reduce demand for the number of places with significant numbers of wild functioning as they will be very much smaller than now but there is real 22 2016 think so because high value tourism areas will be maintained they might be like and in in getting to them you and your kids will drive through or fly over farms and livestock grazing lands because people have eradicated the know what the word in is for pest animals with no value vermin current policy is in effect making wildlife vermin from the perspective of rural communities 22 2016 i think that with increasing momentum to listen to the elephant specialists talking about the just local abundant populations in one or two we can get ivory under control and poaching significantly lessened and i strongly believe that if we do n't want simply islands of elephants but migrating we have to plan this now and in the next 5 10 years while we have something to work with this applies in where the elephant specialist group just met last week for all of those people who have or are going to have grandchildren the question is back to you are you with we need you to make your desire known to politicians and help us fund the work until the governments and corporations step up their funding and stewardship for elephants and their habitat elephants are whose elephant family focuses on elephants paints a frightening picture of the future 22 2016 the past 100 years of elephant populations have been wiped out without this iconic animal could be facing extinction within 3 which is why this species is listed as endangered they now number as few as 40 , 000 across 13 countries in with probably occurring in habitat loss of and fragmentation of populations are causing and then the results of that such as train strikes are killing as well as hunting for ivory though not all elephants have tusks and females do n't have retaliatory killing for such as by electrocution traps hooked up to the mains or setting out poison bait such as poisoned pineapples are killing what these superb wild giants have been reduced to crop especially in places where people have settled and have no history of living or knowing how to live with stiles also thinks things are looking bleak 22 2016 destruction and fragmentation is the obvious answer it 's remarkable how well they 've done in and when you think of the population pressures it looks like poaching for ivory is on the increase in and carvers are still churning out the and read how various states are planning what can be done says 22 2016 we have hope by protecting and keeping habitat areas connected and working with both rural communities and experts alike to understand more where elephants need to move and what they need to eat we can lessen the interaction between people and elephants and help people safely we can work with governments and companies to rationally plan where land change will occur but we need to resource that research and those experts so they are ready with the so there is but we need to act now as we attempt to get control globally on the battle against ivory and illegal poaching in we are learning tremendous lessons to be applied in to protect space and empower people to allow our largest land mammal still have room to roam our biggest project at the moment with other is our corridors campaign on asks why we use funds from tourism to support local communities so they turn to just not enough to go says 22 2016 there are working examples of involving local communities in the way you it 's simply a drop in the ocean there are million and millions of poor people and just a fraction of them is actually with tourism and you need just a few poachers and a couple of traffickers or brokers to create havoc a huge human toll behind the ivory trade and poor exploited people are a big part of it 22 2016 the same situation in even with the number of poor people who actually benefit from it whose lives are uplifted by its effects is a very small number whatever the solution it has to be more though out and must benefit the poor community in money also fails to reach the communities says hedges 22 2016 the reason is that entrenched big businesses that are not set up to provide significant benefits to the local people in and around the areas corruption is sometimes a problem too governments need to do more to and otherwise help local initiatives and to require more equitable benefit sharing by the big operations you are correct to say that in can generate see the paper i referenced weaver g c complementary benefits of tourism and hunting to communal conservancies in says there is an important role for development aid to play to fill these gaps 22 2016 think community needs are greater than the support they are especially in many but the rural poor in all countries where elephants range are too often left on their own in the places where wildlife still exists are in places where the most people live they may not even know when there is a government compensation scheme that can help them so i do n't think elephant populations always need to for through trophy hunting or tourism income but i think that better access to development or government aid or even an farming and access to markets can boost the morale and empowerment of communities those communities also do not want to be a target for criminal gangs preying on the unemployed to poach strong communities are a very important part of this and support so they can use techniques or understand elephant routes help prevent interaction stiles says this is already underway in 22 2016 is a critical question and in right now there is a group doing exactly planning protected corridors to be left open to connect protected areas and private conservancies all range states should conduct such including corridors and hedges agrees 22 2016 elephants do need large areas of habitat and even in we are now seeing habitat fragmentation and loss become a significant problem for elephant conservation in of habitat loss has long been one of the biggest threats to which are now largely confined to protected many of which are too small for long term viability and have huge problems on their borders maintaining connectivity or restoring it if already lost is essential as notes there are some encouraging examples from countries such as and but much more needs to be done in many more places for those feeling far away and here are some concrete actions you can take today 22 2016 agree with lobbying governments these should be considered world heritage animals and as global citizens we can help strengthen that argument and get more resources put towards forest and wildlife departments stronger departments aid better resource and not only help provide stability but can stand up for protection of habitat for the good of communities and wildlife preventing environmental damage of silting of polluted water which communities later i also endorse that people worldwide support the conservation that can help direct research and aid to experts and communities for bringing about local solutions say most panelists although there are some caveats 22 2016 think the quote is the mother of applies here some of the most innovative community schemes have come about when trophy hunting was not an and then other aid schemes and other government departments participated in community not just wildlife stiles says it could work for some species but not elephants 22 2016 not convinced that trophy hunting is essential to conserving at least elephant maybe other species it 's a complicated from elephant action league 22 2016 hunting is often the of government that do not want to protect wildlife and provide local communities with real economic hedges agrees complicated but also perhaps an issue by both advocates and relative to its potential impact 22 2016 i would personally never shoot an animal for its trophy there have been some successful examples of trophy hunting for some species generating revenues for and encouraging attitudes among local people trophy hunting has the potential to provide those benefits in difficult places where there are few other options for trophy hunting can therefore help keep significant areas of land under wildlife land that might otherwise not be so used but in some places trophy hunting operations have predator introduced or bred trophies all of which are bad for biodiversity conservation it 's complicated it is also hard to see that trophy hunting is likely to ever play a significant role in elephant conservation the amount of money generated by trophy hunting is also small relative to the funding needs for conservation in and so in some ways the heated debates are a distraction from the bigger issues hunter life after global outrage into funding for conservation in conservation letters 296 301 has asked via email how we go about fighting the illegal trade when it is so stiles 22 2016 the demand where consumers law enforcement in pretty much every country has proven ineffective if high demand prevails if shops are closed traders and consumers move to websites and members only social media demand must be but this is a long of elephant family points 22 2016 the words of a wildlife enforcement illegal investigation and enforcement is still woefully inadequate in the countries that matter states and there 's a need to this is a crime problem and the response needs to be police led customs have demonstrated they have mandate and therefore little will to investigate the hundreds of ivory seizures made to date many techniques still are n't being such as controlled forensic analysis of crime scenes for links to and lack of proactive responses sources within the trade have indicated that serious offenders are only afraid of imprisonment if actually yet such a deterrent barely hedges of 22 2016 is correct to stress the challenges inherent in demand reduction and there needs to be a much greater focus on effecting change not just raising we have seen to little of the former in demand reduction campaigns to date but demand for wildlife products including ivory and rhino horn has been reduced in the past in a number of so we know it can be done elephants are wild animals and so conflict is hard to according to the panel consultant stiles says we can only control how humans respond 22 2016 those who suffer the depredations of the only thing that has been demonstrated to prevent retaliation is if the people gain tangible benefits very few places have mechanisms in place for that have to involve says wildlife 22 2016 between humans and wildlife cannot be avoided however solutions have to come from the people living with wildlife innovative ideas of how to live harmoniously ca n't take a top down they have to build economic says hedges in a comment too long to post so link to it here he also suggests further investigating insurance and other ways to manage or understand the impact on humans 22 2016 addition to trying to ensure local people derive direct financial benefits from the presence of wildlife such as elephants whenever a key part of mitigating conflict or conflict more generally is to adopt a sound approach to testing and promoting effective reduction methods there are methods that can help reduce some circumstances at out there but they need to be deployed more effectively approaches such as insurance need to be further tested and developed too most including hedges from agree that the mean it when they say they will phase out their legal ivory 22 2016 i think the government is serious about shutting down the domestic market in ivory in china that commitment was announced at the highest level in a joint communique from president xi and president in 2015 earlier this year the authorities said publicly that they would announce the timetable for implementing the so we can expect to see that announcement points out that there has been little movement since they made their announcement a year ago 22 2016 this is govt has n't announced a even though hong which is 2020 can we be sure that china is serious about even after we now that officials from high office are involved in the of points out the difficulty in enforcing laws in a country as vast as china 22 2016 the ending of the domestic legal trade in whiles it will undoubtedly help we should also be aware that it is a recurring pattern in china that good laws can be passed but that enforcement failure can lead to unexpected results china often resists legislation for as long as then acts when the diplomatic costs become too high but that is not the same as effective enforcement china is a very big reach is less effective than many outsiders and enforcement may not be a priority if you look at the overall movements in the relatively recent surge in demand from for both ivory and rhino i suspect that the bulk of both are being smuggled into china it 's a change of route rather than a drop in who works with the elephant specialist believes some news might be imminent 22 2016 heard they will announce the plan in it will involve a phased allowing ivory traders and factories to dispose of their as hong has done before our panel convenes at here is some reading material that could provoke

there a plan b for the next step in saving them is even harder read of on the need to engage readers in a respectful the guardian is publishing its elephant reporting in read more we know that elephant populations are collapsing at a frightening rate and that the driving forces behind this collapse are a global appetite for ivory just as conflict for space and resources earlier this the governments agreed to recommend the closure of domestic ivory markets this is a serious step towards the eventual complete shutting down of the ivory but now new questions are do governments go about shutting down the legal ivory an illegal ivory market could be even harder how do we strengthen forces against the black human populations move into elephant conflict is a real and growing problem that may even come to dwarf the ivory trade can we avoid these what works in terms of supporting local what works in terms of preserving elephant this is a global but with different challenges for

bloodbath of an a friend emailed me watching someone get another said over the phone and this in an email from a veteran of the third draft dodger is now commander in to the full flowering of the era of which began with that now glide down the escalator at trump where trump commenced his candidacy with these historic when sends its not sending their best sending people that have lots of and bringing those problems with us bringing drugs bringing crime rapists and i are good ever a monument is erected to the trump then surely these words shades of will be carved into the marble along with coming out of her bucks a and would bring back a hell of a lot worse than in true demagogic trump bypassed the head and spoke directly to the to the biles and bubbling acids of raw emotion he said things that many temperate hardly dared to admit we carried in ourselves were hardly aware of just how deeply we resented our own how angry our interior lives with all this stuff bottled years and years of internalized from a culture that kept insisting on tolerance many discovered just what a drag political correctness was all these and to be free of freed from this code that was jamming us that was relief akin to a primal scream from the start rallies had the air of the tent that same hot thrum of militant exorcism and not fool a friend wrote stand anything but cold honesty right now this is not a winning the which would be bad enough this is white supremacy tempted to say really not that bad stances are things get said in the heat of a and we could take heart in the newly conciliatory trump on display for several days after the election then came the news that the erstwhile chairman of the trump campaign who bears a striking resemblance to the town drunk on the old was named counselor and chief for the incoming trump administration the mainstream press still feels compelled to explain the term but we know we we we white aka honky dig too deeply into the family along with glistening of apocalyptic and a style sense that falls somewhere between for and eye for the straight prior to his gig on the trump spent four years as chairman of which he proudly declared to be

the have to remember that actually all on one a character is his as and what a twisted fate indeed that ever seeking to reconcile and accommodate an pastor in once his presidency is will no longer have to be the least threatening black man in has had to deal with an opposition that very much regarded him as not on the team there was the for starters the conspiracy theories the terrorist founder of teenage crack dealer hanging out on the corner this damage done to is said during one of the republican which is a laugh if wanted to trash the all he had to do on taking office in 2009 was sit on his hands and let the hot mess of the bush economy continue its meltdown to the issue is bigger than any particular president after his on one the is that we all go forward with a presumption of good faith in our fellow because that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant and functioning goes to the heart of the matter the system of constitutional government is founded on deliberate fragmentation of the of and and that we all learned in high school civics for government to be effective for government to meet the needs of the people the us constitutional order requires a healthy measure of good faith cooperation among the players this good faith began to fray in the early as leaders in newt and tom delay chief among declared war on all efforts even from those in their own party to govern from a stance of bipartisan cooperation in world of moral were enemy of normal and his allies were fighting no less than a with and as he declared in a speech to the heritage war has to be fought with a scale and a duration and a savagery that is only true of civil so began the constitutional hardball and tactics that have characterized the past of politics you may recall the government shutdowns of 1995 and 1995 96 over budget and the 1998 impeachment of bill for lying about a in more recent there was the famous dinner at a steakhouse on the evening of 20 2009 the day of inauguration at which congressional leaders with by then a highly paid k street vowed to sabotage presidency by opposing every item on the new economic agenda at a time when 700 , 000 jobs a month were disappearing including those items previously supported or even proposed by the all rooting for said of trump when they met recently in the oval office if he senate republican leader later summed up the stance when he publicly single most important thing we want to achieve is for president to be a burying was the and if bringing him down required shredding the constitutional then to hell with the past 220 years of constitutional order the once reserved for only the most major policy became routinely deployed even for matters by withholding funding or refusing to consider appointments to government the senate effectively nullified laws that had been duly enacted in accordance with the constitution at a time when the federal courts had a record number of scores of judicial seats went the current vacancy on the supreme court is merely the most example government shutdowns and crises once unthinkable became so endemic that for the first time in its more than standard downgraded the credit rating of the citing the phenomenon of even lawmakers have continued to use the threat of government default as a bargaining a nuclear option if carried would have catastrophic effects on the world the founding fathers wanted they have replaced the articles of confederation with the constitution but been great for the republican which has mastered a crude but so far effective campaign as the on a platform decrying government as dysfunctional and then once in power pull out all the stops to make sure government is dysfunctional and ineffective maybe this is why congress has lower approval ratings than head lice and and why has the perpetually serene look of a man who sleeps well at night those low approval ratings mean his side is winning that all this has happened at the expense of the constitutional and of the spirit of comity and good faith so necessary for the functioning of that seems not to trouble or his colleagues in the call these people is a joke they seek to

our economic fear and anger with a rawness that even try to match in no surprise that she lost the and primaries and very nearly the nomination to a candidate who tapped into the same populist angst that would give trump no fewer than 290 electoral college votes though one wonders whether all those good working folks who voted for trump realized they were endorsing a huge tax cut for the and a candidate whose election left k street as giddy as a girl asked to the prom by the handsomest boy in wish i thought things would seem even slightly less terrifying in a day or some escapist literature i find detailed accounts of the first world war and disastrous arctic expeditions very readable at times like system we this system that grinds huge numbers of people into it seems so vast and monolithic most of the an unstoppable machine steered by mysterious forces trump seemed to offer a rare chance to throw a wrench into the and many took it that a much bleaker side to his victory xenophobic owes much to certain feelings and impulses that have been steadily nurtured over the years by the republican party if you have doubts about read up on the history of the notorious old demons we thought pushed to the it turns out been right here among us all biding their waiting for their hour to come around again the heartache and for more than a clear and present a tribal identity looked not to be everything fond little daydream optimistic comes to stunned policy always a moving target on the campaign is looking even more slippery in the days since the election the that sturdiest beam in the trump might be downgraded to a mere in certain areas signature features of the formerly horrible are actually and should remain and that massive deportation maybe not so massive after all this sort of backstroking belies been obvious all trump has never had much in the way of policy goals besides serving the greater good of will be the guiding principle of the trump presidency in this respect much more like a monarch than the duly elected public servant of a representative as monarchs he will keep his heirs close to the center of don and that budding cardinal of

explosive situation for the managing a vast consortium of transnational businesses while being privy to the most sensitive along with easy access to the most powerful man in the world how will it all play badly look to for a taste of the awful potential to the tragedies and history those coils of ego and empire and wealth sex and sex and that often end with bodies all over the place the best thing trump could do for his children would be to put his assets in a genuine blind and send the kids away far away from to do their own thing limit visits to holidays and bounce the grandkids on his not breathe a word about business or affairs of not how monarchies roll that trump would put his children in such a legally tenuous position gives us a clear idea as if we needed it from a man who used to rely on the infamous for legal counsel of his appreciation for the rule of law here again we can expect the monarchical model people rarely grow in humility once they reach the white house to the extent trump attempts to spin and mutilate the rule of his most immediate potential check will be a congress firmly in republican led by the same wrecking crew already shown such faint regard for the

he must be disappointed by that typo in the first line of the email that was my first thought when the following landed in my might sound shocking and but i feel shocked or threatened this was just another day on the where people disproportionately people of color and queer people are intimidated and threatened what writer describes as a ceaseless flickering hum of emotional women abandoned to their abusers read around the same time i assume the same signed me up to a which meant i received thousands of unsolicited email newsletter within a few hours thankfully filters learn but it took a 20 minutes of flagging messages to clean up my a mild irritation meanwhile on someone else was sending me pornographic and asking whether penis size matters for a i blocked as sure i will have to block many others in the future in a tedious game of would love to say that this is but not in go as far as to say that this feels entirely just your regular rape threats and dreary dick for one of my is dealing with racial slurs or having her profile photo edited to have for a male people telling him to commit suicide or saying they want his kids to die if we complain about these either overreacting or feeding the trolls but if we speak letting them get away with it by this we fall back on swatting the antagonists away like flies perhaps as a coping telling ourselves that normal most of the the flies are few and far between but you only have to look at the relentless campaigns of hate against public figures like actor and comedian diver tom or games developer to see what happens when the flies form a swarm it becomes exhausting and incredibly difficult for the individual or the police to make on what constitutes a credible in the media you are familiar with how things work but for an average person these types of interactions could be said author of this is why we have nice how did we get and what should we do about many are aggrieved white men who feel like they given the fantasy life they were author of bullies have always found ways to antagonize but digital tools have given them new powers fifty years ago if you wanted to wind up a you could write anonymous messages and leave them on his or her could tease that but there would be no archive and it be amplified it could potentially be upsetting but it be indexed in said the ability of search to index abuse or what she calls that changes the ethical stakes your history follows you meaning those targeted struggle to move on and have a fresh and have been part of the since its inception a side effect of anonymity and unfettered free both critical pillars of the web once restricted to niche forums and with their own codes of ubiquitous social media has brought it into the used to be so few people occupying those spaces and the people who were were a lot more than what you see said means more and more just teenagers in their basements a lot of them are otherwise very well adjusted normal adult men with wives and children and said author of of them fall into the camp of very aggrieved middle aged white men who feel like they given the fantasy life they were owed they tend to take it out on people who are successful or present in a way that makes them feel not to say that white men get harassed but that harassment is more frequently directed at members of historically underrepresented populations whose voices have not always been privileged people who have always had their voices taken seriously tend to be the said arguing that it comes from a sense of trump that same sense of disenfranchisement that propelled trump to the white house with a campaign that normalized says absurdly offensive degrading things about women and people of color and specific groups whether whatever he says these terrible things and that normalizes hate speech in mainstream discourse so normal to open up or any news and see says tenor of discourse that trump and his associates have been engaging in has emboldened some people to say are in charge now and we can say whatever we adds a student at school of communication and comments about sexually harassing women are a reflection of the normalization of violence against threats and rape threats are a form of domination that has been used against women for all of time it ties into seeing women as not fully human and having their value contingent on whether or not they are worthy of said in an effort to draw attention to the ends up amplifying it publications might be trying to troll but some are just calling attention to it but inadvertently or not it ends up more problematic said opens up the vexing question of whether or not to feed the trolls wary of that framing as it comes with a undercurrent the message is you give them attention you get said suggests keeping a record of posts in case a situation escalates and then reporting the perpetrator where possible individuals should make up their minds about whether they mute or following safety guides like this one or this offers an alternative way to handle such by creating a to an explicit against these behaviors as opposed to repeating she said about taking more control of that so that the antagonist is no longer the center of the suggests the rest of the community can help here solidarity is asking how you can help is important basically trying to take a stand and say is not same behaviors that can marginalize and denigrate and traumatize can really bring a group making them feel good and paltry effort was to take a of the email and share it on twitter with a pithy comment mocking the sender it was not an act of fear or a cry for but an act of i am not intimidated by you and i am not alone the post triggered messages of support and wonderful jokes from friends and acquaintances that reminded me of all of the lovely people on the like choice very we might say that still in the early stages of settlement and that we will all start to become more civilized and others might rally to create better tools for tackling the abuse and real threats towards law a but not a fix the disproportionate harassment of people of color and queer people reflects underlying culturally embodied issues these are problems that exist being brought to attention in new and imaginative problems have nothing to do with the so the idea that we could have an solution is said need to deal with and mitigate systemic racism and sexism how do you get rid of rape the fact that women tell themselves stories to justify the horrible treatment they receive speaks to the depth of the cultural issues that underpin the free speech us and silicon valley in particular has a very specific libertarian view of free typified by john declaration of independence of which cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings to clamp down on harassment are frequently described as infringing on free especially in the us just people expressing their opinions no matter how sexist or unpalatable and so society appeals to the right to protect the words of certainly true that censorship is damaging to but the damage is taking place in the opposite direction you cede the floor to the most bigoted contributors that tends to marginalize and silence members of the group they are said leads to a reduction in the number of voices contributing to all in the name of free speech a more robust understanding of free speech is about trying to cultivate and protect the greatest amount of speech from the most diverse groups of people about having more people not fewer people as eloquently puts silences and that infringes free speech far more significantly than telling some asshole to shut his on on via on on on on on this content
i just found out that i am four weeks cannot carry on with this pregnancy for numerous reasons and i want to have an abortion though it is an option for me in the united in it is not really an option because the to have it done is simply out of the question hoping you can advise me and are able to help i am absolutely read through her email once again and hovered her finger over the send button the message was addressed half a world away to women on a dutch group that mails abortion drugs to pregnant women who live in countries where abortion is outlawed lives in where abortion is restricted but legal making it one of the places where women on web refuses to mail the drugs thought she would try her luck she had lost her job to and in its place she had found only work her rent had gone up she was borrowing money for was no question that she afford to have a child the question was whether she could even afford an had an inkling that what she was asking for help performing her own abortion might not be fully legal but she was out of answers she hit send then she began to case the for other ways she could cause her own this scene feels out of place in that may be because there was a time in this history when thousands of and abortions prompted calls for the procedure to be legal after the us supreme court established a right to a legal in the 1973 decision roe v abortions were supposed to become a thing of the almost as soon as the court legalized opponents of abortion rights began to whittle them away congress began prohibiting poor women from using to cover abortions in 1976 the largest expansion in allowed insurers to continue to pick and choose the circumstances under which they would cover abortion and allowed states to ban the coverage altogether the two decisions have ensured that millions of women who have sought an abortion have had to pay for it out of pocket and a sweeping wave of laws has closed clinics in many cresting with an awesome force over the last five such a hostile it is no wonder that abortions are still a if largely hidden phenomenon one that even rights groups are only just beginning to grasp one study of abortion patients found that had tried at some point in their induce their own abortions without professional medical assistance another estimated that potentially of women have tried to or at least 100 , 000 kind of kept under the so it needs to be talked is no concrete data on how many women in the us have tried to but there is some evidence although it is inconclusive to suggest that attempts are on the rise from 2008 to as the economy worsened and a wave of new restrictions choked abortion access around the queries about abortion almost according to an economist who analyzes this crisis of reproductive rights now walks trump as trump has promised to restrict abortion even further he has vowed to nominate justices to the supreme court who might overturn roe v wade because the court is loath to reverse has survived such threats before but trump has explicitly promised to nominate justices who might put roe in their in his first major interview after winning trump described truthfully what might happen to some women if roe v wade were overturned perhaps have to have to go to another he said he was asked trump see what we have to wait and see what happens history has already shown us what happens when women in the us access abortion so has the present day in 2015 women on the dutch received more than 600 emails from us women looking for a way to end their own pregnancies group does not send abortion drugs to the because the us does not outright ban women on web agreed to share scores of these emails with the providing an unprecedented window into the lives of women who feel they have no other option but to end their pregnancies the hundreds who wrote to women on web was she contacted the guardian shortly after she found out about her unwanted pregnancy and shared every step of her which eventually took her across an international border she provided including of her travel documents her name has been changed for her she sure if she faced a potential legal risk and in is in a legal gray and many enterprising prosecutors have charged women who carried out their own abortions with crimes felt compelled to feel like such a negative stigma to she said kind of kept under the so it needs to be talked people needed to she that abortion restrictions had real victims not really helping anyone not really protecting anyone just causing women who are in these situations who feel desperate to take desperate letters to women on web form a uniform chorus of desperation and and and appear in dozens of signaling the nature of how these women became stranded he is threatening saying i can never am afraid of what he is capable a variety of an abortion must look like a has to look like a have parenthood wants my bf and i live in our afford an simply cannot afford an teenager in a state where minors need parental consent for an abortion said her parents were forcing her to have her woman in wrote to say that she had gone to her only abortion the shamed me into going back not a citizen and its a little scary i feel very am beside read another email one month before she wrote her she was raped she received her coverage through the insurance plan for military personnel and their families policy is to cover abortion in cases of rape as long as a doctor has a faith that the rape according to a spokesman but this woman wrote that refused to pay for her abortion on the basis that she never reported the end this she would cost me of my monthly she have seen a doctor i have had a covers that i can give birth to my baby for i am out of the letters read u please cry and pray every night that the lord take this child from me will keep searching for is striking about reading these emails one after another after another is the diversity of experiences that lead all these women down the same path there are homeless women and women and married women and single women living in cities and women separated from the nearest abortion provider by an two wrote in from the big island of where the last a planned parenthood in closed in people think about women seeking they have this stereotypical vision of a single woman on said head of the reproductive freedom fund her group provides financial assistance for abortions also people who have two jobs six hundred dollars is a lot of fucking money for a lot of the people who call us not a but many those barriers are just too high even with our on web wrote back to a few hours after she sent her message the reply on web cannot provide the service in any country with safe abortion the email listed a few abortion funds could call for financial assistance then it recommended another you live close to you can also travel to to buy a drug that can induce a miscarriage early in a sounded like a gamble felt a jolt of fear if what if i do it what if i fuck up my organs she pushed these thoughts aside at least it was an learned that her insurance would not cover her abortion and left messages with two abortion funds she also found a world of websites describing ways to induce abortions with herbs or vitamins following advice from the sources that looked the most she began taking cinnamon capsules and several thousand milligrams of vitamin c per not unheard of for women to turn to herbal reproductive rights advocates said considered an thing to do this is just how handled it for said the director of counseling at choices medical an abortion clinic in queens her patients occasionally use an herbal brew to try to induce a miscarriage the resounds with such recipes you probably in is hundreds of people doing it hundreds of different said the president of health a reproductive rights research group way always there supposed to be hundreds of different abortion was supposed to have all but disappeared after the supreme court established the right to an abortion throughout the country in the to roe v in the late and early abortion was restricted to a handful of major cities and the women with the means to travel there roughly 100 , 000 women crossed state lines for a legal abortion in new in a single the number of women going to illegal providers or trying to was up to 12 times that some up to 200 women would die of complications from illegal or abortions and compared with the number of women who survived horrific that figure appears small in 1968 a single county hospital treated 701 women suffering from septic not if a woman really does feel that she needs to terminate her she may be willing to try just about just a few years after the country seemed to vanquish the abortion in the centers for disease control announced that only three women had died the previous year from abortion complications a stunning reduction in deaths when activists accused the centers of the according to the book inside the put up a bounty for proof of any abortion death the centers had failed to report paid out zero one official recalled others

suppose i saw a dozen said doe agreed to speak only under a pseudonym he works as an abortion provider in and has kept his identity hidden from the he treated women who had gone to abortion providers and a woman who had shot herself in the stomach turpentine became a kind of harrowing motif one woman used a syringe to inject it into her abdomen the tide only ceased in when two abortion clinics opened a few months apart in nearby bossier city and roe v wade was seven years making it legal is not doe said not if a woman really does feel that she needs to terminate her she may be willing to try just about were not isolated experiences in became one of the first women to die from an illicit abortion after roe v wade had previously had one legal paid for using but in congress passed the which banned the use of federal funds to pay for abortion and which many advocates still consider the biggest barrier to abortion access today the next time became she sought out an unlicensed midwife

tiny amounts of aromatherapy oil to try to induce an abortion a teenager injected herself with a local anesthetic and attempted to cut out her fetus a teenager placed a pillow over her abdomen and shot herself in the side earlier this a woman in was charged with aggravated assault for trying to give herself an abortion with a coat hanger she was found out after profuse bleeding sent her to the

be phenomenal if people could receive this medication in the mail with all the and the right safety said the executive director of the national network of abortion funds she the is allowing untold numbers of to find and use the drug without medical supervision among the 700 , 000 searches on identified in some 160 , 000 were searches for a way to obtain the abortion pill through back channels is there a chance those searches could increase under a trump said is something that one could reasonably predict in an environment where abortion becomes even or even more inaccessible than it has been we will do anything in our power to get people the information and the care that they even her group posts instructions for on its website not all advocates feel good about disseminating this information but they consider it better than the answered one of the of her advocacy career a young woman was on the saying her friend had given her a home remedy her friend claimed to have used this method to end four separate even though each time it sent her to the we helped this woman go to a before she could do something said friend had told her to drink turpentine with a crisis pregnancy an ultrasound confirmed that home remedies worked she was still pregnant the distress must have shown on her because the technician offered a flurry of reassurances they see a lot of single moms who do it on their own they have a store that sells baby clothes at a markdown they help with discounts on daycare fumed a baby is more than just buying clothes and she her she was already reviewing her plan she had heard back from only one abortion which had turned her down for assistance because she had a job and for a quarter of what a us abortion clinic would she had purchased a flight to city the flight left the next day she would stay with a friend abortion pills would cost about at a pharmacy if she could find a pharmacy that carried the drug and would sell it to a young she would take the drugs at her house gonna say on my so i hate that this is ruining the i feel so she sounding perfectly kind of like when drowning if you just flap just going to drown but if you focus on what the goal on what you need to stay how going to had relied on this kind of subterfuge for the past several weeks friends had noticed she was distracted her boss had noticed she was nauseous whole time that been and that known been all thought she said almost cried like five times but you have to push that aside and act like she i was zoned out for a just not feeling more difficult challenge was hiding her pregnancy from her boyfriend she knew he would want to start a family at she was taking so much medication to keep from vomiting in front of him that she no longer had enough to sustain her through the work feel but you do anything about she said just kind of have to put my feeling outside of it you need to focus what do you need to do in order to move kind of like when drowning if you just flap just going to drown but if you focus on what the goal on what you need to stay how going to was the sixth pharmacy went to in that sold her the the first a mix of big national chains and mom and pop claimed they carry it she felt at least one pharmacist was lying to her she returned to the first store to if not where could she buy little while she paid for a blue carton about the size of her hand it said an exciting holding the box it was said just like a feeling she was still too nauseous to take the pills while she was in so she would have to take them in the united states it was a panicky bringing pills back through customs but there was a larger fear biggest concern what happens if someone finds what happens if something goes had said a few days earlier happens if my body completely rid in most abortion she a medication abortion was induced with two one drug to terminate the and to expel the pregnancy she would only be taking the the she knew what symptoms would tell her something had gone wrong but still just so many questions i would so much rather have a health professional help me in this and kind of guide me through it versus some things meant for and this is definitely one of is impossible to know what happened to all the other women who reached out to women on web but a study of women who were rejected because they were past the gestational limit found that most of them carried their pregnancies to the said that many women who struggle to pay for an abortion eventually get creative not long she spoke to a mother who was weighing whether to raid her diaper fund to pay for her abortion it was unlikely her parents would lend her money for an she but they would probably help her buy more are no more creative problem and i mean than women with no she said saying that with the utmost because there are people who will think of all this as shady and not seen people and being in coming up with ways to a skill she fears more women might need in the future trip had cost a fraction of the money she needed to raise for an abortion in a us clinic something her mind was still trying to grasp whole time i was i believe it was she were speaking a few days after she returned from an ultrasound had just confirmed that she was no longer and her voice was sunny am so to be she until she was no longer how much stress she had placed on herself she felt like she could she said like she could step back on the path of her life and figure out where she had been when she had taken the pills on a she took the first dose she set a timer on her phone then she took the second dose the pills worked just like they were supposed to she but not too much she felt the pregnancy pass she felt then it was abortion in on on via on on on on on this content

sell their stock consumers will have to wait up to 40 years for bestselling designs to emerge from the new copyright we know which orders to stop since there is no list of which designs qualify for

a few years yahoo chief executive mayer hit the headlines concerning a confidential memo sent to employees the message seemed to go against everything we know about how a economy operates from now everyone must be present and accounted for at the office working from home is memo was carefully worded in the language of collegiality and staff development but employees understood its real if we see we trust surprising that yahoo staff were annoyed known for years that employees are much more productive if able to harness the freedoms that mobile technology can afford being chained to an office can be in many occupations employees feel hard done by and fight back as and rather we see the spread of business commentators believed that yahoo was an exception in this swimming against the tide of management wisdom in this rich information other stories started to emerge that seemed to indicate a sea change investigative reporters at the new times in 2015 revealed the shocking techniques used by amazon to manage its office workers you thought its warehouse workers were harassed wait until you join absolutely everything is even the time it takes to answer an email fear and intimidation soon became rife in the transforming annual performance review into a daily as one stressed employee was still to come employees at the telegraph recently discovered heat and motion sensors that tracked whether they were at their desks there was no warning employees simply found the devices on morning they eventually had to the brand name to identify what they were a memo was issued at lunchtime by senior management stating that the new policy was make sure we are making best use of our space in the of this sits very well with the official narrative hierarchies are meant to be dead and buried authoritarian have no place in industries that need workers to use their share be creative and excel at flat company structures and autonomy are the future back in the business guru tom peters even heralded the end of to do if you have a difficult boss read what why does it feel like there are more bosses now than ever telling us what to often adopting a needlessly authoritarian answer the question we need to remember where the idea of management comes from managers help things big need administrators but the modern manager was actually invented in the early us steel industry and with a specific rationale one of the first management deplored how much control average employees had over their jobs he trust and if there was a dispute always have the upper hand so something had to recommended that all knowledge about a job be transferred to a new breed of managers who watch staff like often with a stopwatch in their hand he drove the point home to the extent that workers began to complain that it was hindering their not helping them management was actually getting in the was more than 100 years ago when employers were perhaps less enlightened so what about why are we seeing the same reappear in many including the it universities and there are a number of forces in often told that workers are happier if hired on a flexible be it as contractors or this may suit some but research shows that poorer pay and conditions often increase discontent and feel hard done by and fight back as and rather we see the spread of bosses precisely in those industries we would expect to see fewer hired to keep a lid on the seething dissatisfaction caused by and second driver is inequality the greater the division between those at the top and the bottom of any then the more monitoring and supervision see because rising perceptions of injustice make conflict and more the societal for no coincidence that the increasing wealth gap has seen more surveillance and policing the same principle applies to work just look at the figures in 1998 the average pay was 47 times greater than the average worker in 2013 the ratio was in the real pay increased by between 1978 and 2014 workers only got over the same period under these tend to become increasingly even if such measures interfere with people doing their jobs third reason for all these managers is the huge importance placed today on metrics shareholders demand them senior bureaucrats swear by them pulling their weight and who the only problem is that marginal product what you add to an profit margin as an individual is notoriously difficult to measure productivity usually comes from a collective effort and how on earth do you quantify the more emotional and social dimension of many jobs the face of such employers either go over the top with every big data tool such as or simply give up and resort to like yahoo research has discovered a sort of sociological law when it comes to hierarchies and bosses they can easily take on a life of their own and automatically proliferate companies end up needing more supervisors to check on the supervisors this is how become inundated with and sooner or later all these managers need to justify their normally by creating extra work somewhere else in the why managers should show a softer side read problem is not really with managers per usually under the lash as much as anyone else the steep and hierarchies that have mushroomed all over society in the last 15 especially in the employment sector that gap between a technocratic elite at the top and everyone else has never seemed so vast this fosters distrust dissent and inevitably of the knowledge society once promised we could have our cake extreme form of and eat it too it turned out to be a ruse now workers have the worst of both worlds definitely on their own in terms of economic insecurity but not left alone far from there a yes radically reduce the gulf between

and our match defeats to end year as world read more the year end lifts the trophy above his head he finishes the year as the best player in the too good even for the wondrous i suspect be meet again in the final of the open in for both off for a well earned rest all from me thanks for your emails over the past week world number one tom for the guardian sorry for the slight delay in the last the inside the arena decided to cut out just as hit his final return long serving for the is greeted by a huge roar of encouragement as he walks to the baseline you sense that finished though rarely been his style to leave without a fight but 15 0 when sends a shabby backhand long an ace down the middle from makes it 30 0 the cheers become that bit more urgent nets a backhand to make it before netting a forehand to make it never is thoughts drift back to the final in 2013 but earns his first championship a volley forcing to dab a strange lob well past the baseline the roar is deafening what would give for a first serve here before they can get down to the umpire has to tell everyone to turn the lights off their phones eventually swings an ace down the middle but a let so they go again cracks a forehand into the right corner and charges forward to stay alive with a smash another monstrous serve from earns him a second championship though he nets a first serve his first serve is weak dominates a short rally and wins it with a wonderful but then he drags a forehand wide has a third championship point sends a first serve long the tension is unbearable the second serve is there to be so hits it unfortunately for brilliantly for his forehand flies wide and has won the world tour finals for the first time in his career and finishes the year as the world wins tom for the guardian second 4 5 is serving to stay in the final completely a forehand to make it then nets a backhand return to make it 30 0 misses a backhand to make it but a backhand clips the top of the net and lands on his side 40 15 lashes a forehand away to hold will serve for the title been going for 92 minutes what must be going through returns with a backhand tom for the guardian second 3 5 will be desperate not to lose momentum completely here know better how difficult it is to stop if he gives him any encouragement and not looking too clever when he sends a forehand at the end of a punishing rally leads 0 15 manages to move into a 30 15 serving well then pushes a backhand inches much to the relief of a wheezing having to work so hard here 40 15 thinks won the game with an ace challenges strides off towards his convinced it was in it was miles out that was curious from who nonetheless manages to hold when knocks a backhand long will serve to stay in the final second 3 4 suddenly looks like a different charging into a 30 0 lead probably suspected this might happen soon leads 40 0 as whistles a forehand long despite reaching a smash the holds to winning the drop shot war with who is likely to come under intense pressure now second 2 4 you think that both of these players really just want to get back to the dressing room to watch planet earth getting through the match in an uncharacteristically quick time so wonders wall not so pulls a forehand wide to make it challenging unsuccessfully he makes up for it with a beauty down the though the game goes to when double faults then a deep return from earns him his first break point of the which feels faintly absurd given who he is this over yet sends a forehand long and ever the has one break back the clenches his fist second 1 4 these are choppy waters for as he nets a forehand for before dumping one long to make it 0 30 approaches the net comes up with a stupendous backhand pass from left to right to earn three break points good tennis is in serious trouble now he saves the first point but not the second a backhand goes long and second 1 3 having stopped the is likely to attack with renewed intent here and he leads 0 15 when arrows a backhand wide when nets a and 30 15 after a swinging serve out wide from somehow crashes a forehand volley into the to the amazement of everyone even who can hardly believe his luck the boost needs to hold to 15 with an ace out wide what a miss that was from the journalist sitting next to me is beside himself second 1 2 challenges when a forehand is called but come to his aid leads 0 15 makes up for it with a precise backhand winner for and quickly moves into a 30 15 lead he surely has to hold here he netting a forehand at 40 15 this one is far from over serves tom for the guardian second 0 2 a few fans are waving flags in the crowd really needs their support now he trails by a set and a break and the majority of the crowd is with got the bit between his teeth but can he keep this can he consolidate that precious moving into a 40 0 lead with barely any trouble suggests that he can and he holds to 15 thanks to a granite serve second 0 1 looking a little lifts a backhand wide to make it 15 30 receives cries of encouragement from the crowd and then he earns two break overpowering the advancing with a drilled backhand this is a potentially huge moment take the missing a backhand return off a deep first serve saves the second with a stunning serve out wide to force deuce finds a fine angle with a forehand to earn a third wasting a challenge on a ball that clipped the line a deep slice from draws a forehand error from though quite sort out his feet in time gives up a fourth opportunity with an errant though he miss it by but it was by and breaks when nets a serving for the unlucky to lose the first getting away with a net cord at the net and all that matters is immediately under pressure looks bewildered after knocking a forehand wide for though then comes one of those endless baseline rallies these two in it has to end at some of and this one does with lifting a slice wide for 30 15 tries to stay but his level has dipped and he sends another backhand wide to hand two set points if it had been getting there but here we are has two set points he only needs one nets a tame forehand and leads this takes the first set tom for the guardian first 3 5 look like in the mood for any funny business at the start of this remembering how to smash and making it 15 0 a tight backhand into the net makes it another one that drifts past the baseline makes it chops a backhand slice and uses up a challenge for no good reason but the game goes to deuce as splatters a forehand long not always looked entirely steady out but probably just putting on an act then a dismal backhand into the net that hands a break point suggests otherwise you sense really needs to take this chance he has to be clinical he is clinical they trade cautious slices for a but who ups the ante with a vicious forehand into the left corner that can only slice into the net breaks and serve for the first set first 3 4 wary of the dangers of allowing his focus to begins this game slapping a forehand into the right corner for a 15 0 then serving firmly to lead 30 0 another cracking serve makes it 40 0 holds to picking off at the net with a glorious backhand down the line this is turning into a very good match first 3 3 sends a heavy forehand long to lose the first point of this but then he clumps one down the line to win one against the serve for the first time the game goes to edging another baseline rally the volume in the arena rises and earns the first break point of the forcing to net an insipid forehand convert though is rock solid on the baseline and blinks netting a forehand earns another a low slice drawing another error from who nets a forehand nets a though deuce for a which is partly down to absolutely butchering a gimme of a smash something falls on to the possibly from his racket difficult to make out what it was whatever raises his level to hold do not be surprised if he breaks in the next game first 2 3 engages in a baseline rally with never the wisest of but wins it with a cannily disguised forehand for 15 0 responds with a rasping backhand down the and gobbles up a smash at the net for moves into a 40 15 lead after two weak and holds to 30 thanks to a serve out wide returns with a backhand tom for the guardian first 2 2 looking bright and clips a forehand into the left corner and skips forward to volley before serving well to make it 30 0 decides to attack a second serve but puts too much behind a rasping the game going to 40 0 holds to love with a confident smash needs to return better first 1 2 make many first serves in his first service game and he win this match if that trend continues he makes a decent start forcing to block a backhand return long for 15 0 another solid serve makes it 30 0 and he hits a backhand well to make it 40 0 but pulls it back to lobbing then makes it 40 30 when a backhand that was heading wide hits the top of the net and lands in holds to though watched the guardian 's highlights reel good on for winning even though they did n't let him 2016 first 1 1 a delay before the start of this the umpire telling an idiot in the crowd to switch off the light on their phone why do these people bother buying a it happens in every match though an ace takes him to 30 0 and he races through the next two points to hold to love fine serving from the world first 0 1 won the toss and the final begins him with serving he starts with a double fault a careful rally both men exuding tension it ends with knocking a backhand long given that confidence pings an ace down the challenging to no avail he follows that up with another double the game going to nerves getting the better of who steadies himself by moving to 40 30 holds to 30 all in black almost back to his early season all says john should go the distance with just having a tad more left in the tank than it the last words the 97 lions heard as they left the dressing room for the 2nd test well the same goes for these serves tom for the guardian knocking up by the i lied there are a few empty seats here presumably be filled soon enough and here comes the world greeted by a deafening roar got his game

for someone who made his career writing about and founding media is surprisingly downbeat about what they can the trump election has shown that we are ascribing too much value to what media can he says a week after victory has its it has to continue to do its even more important today but the view that it will somehow change the world and change or give people the right just too much to not

one day during his last year at primary drew a picture of a street in the city where he still lives the scene he drew had no people in but its representation of everything else suggested a talent beyond his happened to see the and said he wanted to put it up in the entrance hall that was an for someone who think they were any because been told they any every was asked to write his name on the an instruction that threw up a choice he had difficulties with and he knew his class teacher could be cruel i asked for i knew what he would he even spell his own what rubbish is so i did it teacher called to the front of the class went gave it to he held it up in front of the and then he tore it up he spelled his name wrong never be happened 45 years ago in recent has been treated for stress caused at least partly by that and how long it lived not just in his but in his understanding of the world and his place in it the story says a lot about the inhumanity that was once rife in the education but it also shines light on what like spending a lot of your life being not just but routinely insulted telling you no good every day worms its way inside your says you know all so this conflict going has known that he has syndrome to put it another that he is autistic ten minutes will tell you that condition comes down to a of to do with social communication and or what some people call of although the fact that is a prolific artist suggests in his that last criterion might be many diagnoses of autism have also included a range of sensory among them aversions to certain smells and as well as a deep dislike of sudden noise in these seem to blur into a complex kind of he understands music as something he can and experiences the yellow as a profoundly unpleasant like sometimes talks about his condition in front of an and there is one question that always comes up he sits in his room all he does he does complicated he talk to anyone else how do i make him you made his world one show it to you let him grow up thinking that the way thinking and what doing are was formally diagnosed at the age of at an clinic run as an offshoot of autism research after he was referred there by his the initial spark had been a meeting with the founder and in case anyone was of who had spoken with at the literature had begun to what sat under a lot of his at the the biography that accompanied his work as an artist included the words from may 2012 until he worked as the research immediately a specialist gave him his formal a process that involved an interview and something akin to a questionnaire got the letter saying i scored 18 out of 18 autistic and i had meet in a crowded near st cathedral in where he wryly comments on the mixture of clattering cups and muzak a lot of autistic this would probably be and casts his mind back over the 35 years he has been thinking about and researching autism he started working with six autistic children in a special unit in north in 1982 fifteen years he set up the research two years after in he opened a clinic dedicated to diagnosing autistic adults my son received a diagnosis aged three he had fixations with particular music or places traits i in was a growing awareness that autism just about he tells me was receiving more and more emails an but never fitted in might he have an adult go to a child and adolescent so where were they meant to if they went to a learning disability and they had an above be turned away so these people were like a lost generation that was a phrase i used a national autistic society estimates that there are currently around 700 , 000 people living with autism in the more than one in every 100 of the population some of these people have learning disabilities some are what the medical vocabulary terms or unable to speak others are a that includes those with the condition named after the paediatrician who in the worked with a group of children he famously termed syndrome is distinguished by the fact that people who have it display no language delay as toddlers or small children died in long before the term entered popular usage it has since been dropped from the relevant diagnostic but is still used in the is among this latter group that you will find many of the of autistic people currently thought to have been diagnosed as adults no national figures for adult autism diagnoses are but anecdotal evidence suggests numbers are tells me that four years 100 cases in were referred to his in the first four months of 2016 it received 400 of the terms used to describe autism do justice to the complicated traits bound up with it all its variants are covered by the term autism spectrum or people who dispute that autism is any kind of prefer the term autism spectrum condition the word was first used in this context by the pioneering researcher who died in 2014 she meant at the i was a spectrum within those who come to clinical attention where gone since is that this spectrum runs right through out into the general own interest in autism began when my son received a diagnosis of at the age of three back some things seemed the social distance between him and his his fixations with particular music the or his pointed dislike of some foods or sounds still curse whoever invented the public toilet his amazing facility with technology these things are simply part of the fabric of our shared life i echoes of myself in some of these traits the and of plenty of other more than his 10 years have brought me an understanding of the complexities of human both among those diagnosed as the and the everyday world has yet to catch up only of adults diagnosed with autism in the are in paid employment in 2014 team found that of the patients in their clinic had either felt suicidal or planned to kill and that a third had attempted to do so my this is nothing to do with autism or he says are secondary problems you came into the world with and the way the world or to you has led to a second which is depression and week after talking to i take the train to the town of to meet peter who got his autism diagnosis only 10 months ago he is an funny and says he loves perhaps a little too much get this deep urge a to talk to people when described it to the said like a bucket of water and full and then all of it comes and it twitter peter get too much for and they get too much for 20 it becomes clear that street has the most astonishing life story of anyone i have ever interviewed his he became pregnant with him when she was raped in his native the two of them were taken in by a man much older than who employed her as his and then married her and adopted street to give the arrangement a veneer of normality he grew he with no extended family and very few friends get too much for and they get too much for me a lot of the i overpower people when i was a when i made a i would go and sit on their waiting for them a really early and i cope with being late anywhere i used to go and sit on the maybe seven in the morning and people obviously like daily he often revolved around an outside and his back which he would use for solo games of football and marbles that was in some sense it have been wonderful for some but it was for he also made endless trips to the where he acquired a forensic knowledge of he mentions the musclebound actor who played can take certain things in really odd he says i take in what most people take in every he found it almost impossible to tune in to the teachers were shit with he says knew how to abuse they were good at it they were bullies they used to stand me in the in the and hit me over the head with the board to knock some sense into me always blamed my epilepsy on he started having grand seizures when he was it is now estimated that around a third of autistic people also experience though the relationship between the two is something that has yet to left school unable to read or write he passed through a series of jobs a a shop some of which came to an end because he found it difficult to process complex before settling into work as a gardener and gravedigger along the he married his with whom he has three grownup children like being with he says very very introverted in a a after breaking his neck while trying to climb into a transit van that was pulling street began three years in recovery while he was in he met a fellow patient who was an and started to work with him on his through adult he discovered a talent for we he hands me an anthology of his published in that begins with a poem titled not being a perfect glimpse into the autistic experience of not fitting the late street began to teach poetry in schools and day in the early he became a at the in which led to a series of assignments in he went to to write about the war that was then engulfing the with often said that they have no emotion or he says have too much too much empathy it broke my three experiences preyed on a meeting with an abandoned in a refugee an occasion when he gave his water ration to an emaciated woman with a newborn and the experience of eating a sumptuous meal in the town of with or four kids at the looking in and i have the balls to get up and go and give them my his inability to put away these memories had become too much went to a therapist and she want you to go and see a friend of mine a specialist in diagnosing people with i go as you do and she gave me these really strange games they were like a jigsaw four pieces white they were so i thought i could do them and i he was handed five plastic figures and and told to make a story with them i do either i connect them together into one story she said i was highly but on the autism response was one of enormous relief cried it was wonderful wonderful because all my life suddenly made sense and none of it the the abuse none of it was my fault apart from my family and put it in the top five greatest things that have happened in my life incredibly got her diagnosis of syndrome she is perfectly comfortable with the term when she was 30 back she was a regular user of the social networking site that was a forerunner of and and one of her contacts had begun to write about the process of finding out he was autistic wrote about it quite all the reasons gone for what the procedure was seeing half a dozen different psychiatrists before he found one who would refer him for she tells me the more he wrote about the more i was this is is now 35 she also has mild cerebral which manifests itself in spasms in her knees and wrists she is a whose specialism is the and has a punishing training schedule she wears a vintage bowie has a picture of the town of tattooed on her right and is a prolific and waspish presence on twitter is currently awaiting a decision on the funding of her which is focused on the relationships between academic libraries and digital academic social networking services and governance in research at secondary boys pretend to fancy you it kills because you take it grew up in in the dales and now lives in throughout her says she had a deep sense of being somehow being clever and being a supposedly interesting but never able to maintain friendships and saying something among women and girls is only starting to be properly understood the male to female ratio of autistic people currently stands at around although says he and other autism specialists are currently in a in their the actual figure may eventually turn out to be very different a whole new topic researchers are latching on about whether females for whatever reason might be better at hiding their he something that is borne out by recollection of her time at not supposed to get on with parents better than them when you go round to their houses i really want to play with people i just looked really aloof i read the diary of frank when i was and i talked about the holocaust but i would try to copy other how they talked and acted watch that other people watched so have something to talk about and home and she laughs got a when everyone else got but i had no interest in the teenage etiquette and the nastiness that often comes with it proved too much are cruel they exclude each and pretend to be friends with each as a game and i get but i get insincerity and at secondary boys pretend to fancy because the most ludicrous idea they can think of it kills you because you take it seriously and they invite you to and then they show or round the corner laughing all of that twitter penny would try to copy other how they talked and has been married to her for 11 years he loves me the way i completely myself with how hard does she find it to read other sort of depends if actually i can probably feel it quicker than other people i can feel it too much but i usually tell if people are trying to get out of a if people are trying to leave you have to tell need to i tell whether people like me or which is of people have issues with i myself included they seem at peace with it even with people known for a long i know whether they like me or not unless had an explicit you actually like which turns people it comes to understanding how much does she think the world still needs to a lot because i think a lot of people still believe or think a really mild it just makes it a bit harder for her to make makes her a bit more a lot of the stressful painful when the sensory stuff is like being mentions people flicking their train or jangling their or whistling not i have really but can you stop doing but people have one last question is what some people call when she meets autistic people who does she feel they are part of the same and i think we have a as people who can to make sure that those people are looked after and not and they have inappropriate people speaking for or saying things got a mental age of how would they if they communicate with from what i can they are experiencing the same thing as me when seen a person have a it looks like my only more physical it she thinks for a minute looks like an unrestrained version of how i sometimes talks about what many autistic people call like pretend interest in soaps and about managing to blend even if that means submerging whole chunks of your personality in passing took its toll in his late he hit an emotional wall being true to yourself has an effect on he says been and that had failed i had a girlfriend at the and that was failing i had a bit of a and it took me a couple of years to get used to started out on a new path as an artist the work he does ranges across disciplines including sculpture and and regularly touches on his own story among his most affecting works is a piece called my school an fountain pen covered in spikes that perfectly evokes his struggles as a child you might have but the basics of the way you view the world are right for he was working on a project with a group of teenagers for a charity called the foyer federation woman in charge you ever considered he recalls she gave him a copy of mark novel the curious incident of the dog in the now almost a set text for people interested in the condition i went away and i read one page and i wells up now might have faults and but the basics of the way you view the world are right for you when everybody tells thinking you know not but if tells you you think faulty the root of the depression and the low so to read those things on a page was emotional it was i could see that someone understood and i maybe i am it would be another six years before he was formally most adults who receive a the formal recognition might make belated sense of their but it tends to make little difference to their daily existence according to the national autistic of adults say they get the help they need people might just about the more extreme but as penny puts probably not aware of the bulk of autistic people who are sitting coping with a lot of and the fact that dealing with all this noise and stress and uncertainty that they have among autistic adults speaks for itself even such mundane things as the ubiquity of piped or inadequate in public attest to the same basic a society averting its eyes from things that blight hundreds of thousands of lives and might easily be improved we of but the point needs to be greater understanding and then practical cites one big if autism comes down to an often profound difficulty navigating the only a tiny number of people currently receive the help they need to do that about how to go or how to go for a job or how to reply to your girlfriend to if we were a be paying for mentors it seem government called access to work means that does get help from a support worker called a calm and empathic woman who accompanies him to our interview is copied into all his and in the course of work as an artist and a researcher into disability and creativity at she regularly shadows him for a couple of hours a day among other her job is partly to assist him in the kind of reading between the lines that professional and social etiquette but that a lot of autistic people find difficult very she she is there to suggest that a particular request or instruction is put in a different or to remind people in authority that has his own ways of working might have a time span to do a piece of if your line manager is checking you each day to find out your progress you might not do anything for two you might be mulling it over in your in the workplace an opportunity not a drawback read talks a lot about the quintessentially autistic way in which he divines patterns in the often immersing himself in them music is a good example he has an called which he uses to sequences of electronic notes into an which he can then use if a spurt of anxiety means he needs to readjust he plays me a which i say reminds me of the kind of experimental music that came out of in the not a got really into tangerine dream in about 1976 the repeating sequences were heaven for says he also likes the electronic pioneers which rings loud bells my son is a and regularly in on particular segments of their songs and plays them over and over does that sound and his mind goes back to 1978 bought blue sky by there was a track on the other and it had a very strange beginning it was called fire on

my boss is bullying me and undermining my confidence but what can i do about boss like me not sure why and have given up trying to figure it but making my working life miserable she undermines me in front of the rest of the interrupts with irrelevant asides when trying to lead leaves me out of meetings i should be included and makes threats that i might lose my job or someone else more junior might lose theirs if i do some often irrelevant task i am desperate to leave but feel so undermined by her and passive aggressive that i feel useless and unemployable she likes to remind me that i am lucky to have a job i have worked here for 15 years but now feel trapped in a vicious circle what should i know why your boss like you and be fairly certain she either a and bullies are unhappy creatures who derive strange pleasure from humiliating particularly in front of an audience some bullies achieve their ascendancy through force of personality your boss does it by abusing her seniority in saying not asking you to understand let alone forgive saying something more the ultimate aim of bullies to intimidate their victims to such an extent that they begin to believe they somehow deserve to be that they are worthless beings and exactly happening to you you say you feel useless and and yet you must know none of those things in the 15 years worked in this place presumably before the arrival of this monster you will have been a contented person that at who you still are so you must fight very hard not to succumb if she senses you it will give her still further pleasure and even see it as in some way justifying her would hope that those in authority will soon the malign influence this person is having and will take steps to remove her but you wait for that you need to be consciously defiant defy your boss by looking at yourself in the mirror and promising yourself that you let her win then with all the old confidence that you can go out there and find yourself another say keep a detailed log of all and keep all relevant even notes my lawyer advised me this when i was in a similar situation it stop me from having to but i got a much better deal because i had proof of everything the only solution is to get out sad and but sometimes life is like that but you can look for other jobs up hill and down dale with no time pressure as an once you start looking you will probably find the stress flows away you will have control of the situation i was in this situation with a boss who continually described me as to cold to get along and i really in the feeling i was on the verge of a nervous i simply quit i have anything to go to but felt i had to for the sake of my health i had savings i could live on for six months big lifestyle a plan for work if i find something and an alternative plan for retraining in the longer term the day i walked out was one of the happiest of my life the relief was incredible and i felt much better about myself almost immediately in the end i got a job within a month only in hindsight that i just what a bad mental state got myself and i dread to think of the damage if i had stayed i know it is a and for some is financially but if there is any way at all you can do then get out join a union if you and wait until you are entitled to representation keep a including details of possible witnesses with the help of your submit a grievance detailing what you are complaining about and what you would like your employer to do about it my secondment is failing as being denied the it training i desperately have recently been promoted to team the second rung of the managerial ladder i had been working towards this for a year before i finally got my opportunity on secondment for two months and will get made permanent if it goes explained in my interview that although i have a basic knowledge of the computer i have the knowledge that the other team leader or the manager has since i have been promoted i have had to text or ring one of them each shift in order for help i explained that i wanted training and needed it to be able to do my but have been told going to be difficult to find the time now things are going wrong and i am unable to fix them there have been occasions where they answered the phone and been completely and been reprimanded for it on the next this continues i see the secondment being made from either as i want to take the job permanently if this is what is to suspect being just a little too polite and hesitant because you want to make a fuss or seem to be looking for excuses when things go you been nearly firm enough in your request for training this could lead to exactly the outcome you with your secondment failing to be made permanent and rather than your being held responsible you as you be relieved but that would be unfair and need to write a considered note to your copied to hr you have such a avoid sounding either plaintive or stick strictly to the facts say that you are grateful to both your manager and the other team leader for the time they spend helping you deal with system issues now that been doing the job for some time become even more apparent that you have to rely on such ad hoc help but need formal computer system training can they please arrange a for you as soon as because only then will you feel able to the role with which been will hopefully prompt the training you need at being on the record when your performance is eventually it should ensure not unfairly say cover your write a report to your manager requesting a minion on adding that training would be cheaper and bite the bullet and and network like crazy pick up the phone and talk to it experts on connecting your own staff people are usually happy to help as long you show that looking to develop your own knowledge rather than simply asking them to solve your problems for you aside from one can often find other it examples and user forums you can also ask the it people if they have any documentation often they have put considerable effort into which can often go largely unused this will not only help you to do your but help you you look for another you

the challenge of fake and misleading news has come to the fore in the wake of the us presidential election has bore the brunt of the criticism that it allowed misinformation to spread unfettered on its skewing perceptions and possibly the outcome of the election something mark vehemently did fake news and polarized politics get trump read pressure on and the social network has promised to do more to eliminate hoaxes like has blocked fake news sites from its ad network the latter should strangle websites that deliberately publish misleading content by cutting off their advertising despite these is unlikely to explore the many options available to it because it simply has very little motivation to do experts mark is being polite about absolutely no way that will start preventing people from sharing what they want to share the core idea of the said writer and professor clay who studies social business model relies on people sharing and engaging with content news and gossip regardless of veracity trade untrue stories that encapsulate things they believe about the world all the he said is in the business of letting people share stuff they are interested any of that sharing interferes with core user behavior share stuff because their mom might like it my mom likes the she likes trump so be pleased that the pope supports he in reference to a widely shared piece of that falsely claimed the head of the catholic church endorsed trump people feel duped we love bedtime stories we want someone telling us our cherished beliefs are academic and make sense for to apply traditional news publishing values such as verification to the network where a the frog can carry as much currency as a new times is only motivated to censor content when it makes users which is why it efficiently polices content it deems to contain violence and harassment but people want to avoid being who are told the pope supports their candidate feel said love bedtime stories we want someone telling us which of our cherished beliefs are highlights the absurdity of the task with a thought experiment for a adding a line to every story about saying no scientific evidence that came back from the acknowledges the dilemma of websites that purposefully create fake news to game the system for clicks and advertising revenue he places the onus on the source of the story the website creating the content rather than the place it is being is an example of mass millions of amateur publishers sharing content simply cannot behave like a professional he said yet if society have a place that polices true it will be a terrible loss for to spot fake tackle the problem who trust project thinks it has some of the answers launched in the coalition of more than 60 news media outlets the as well as academics and social has tried to restore the trusted role of the press in civic life the coalition aims to establish clear guidelines and trust metrics that could help both consumers and technology

content and social media clamor for our the and sally said when it have seen a decline in trust in the media over a period of decades and the polarization across what types of media are told the guardian very high trust of fox news among conservatives who say they trust the media in general liberals are more likely to trust the particularly and the new she citing the 2015 digital news news is part of the but also news poorly sourced and as well as advertising and propaganda we are trying to help people identify the twitter news is part of the but also news poorly sourced and as well as advertising and with news organizations across the us and as well as interviews with the the trust project compiled a priority list of possible trust indicators these include getting news organizations to meet a set of best practices including having an ethics diversity policy and revealing ownership structure and funding indicators include author biographies covering areas of expertise and citations and and labels to indicate whether a piece is opinion or whether a story contains original whether it includes diverse whether a way for members of the public to provide feedback to the newsroom and whether reporters are local to the news indicators should be useful to both members of the public and the algorithms that rank and distribute news including those developed by twitter and trust project has organized a at the end of to see if these indicators can be incorporated into newsroom and easily surfaced on distribution been talking to social media including twitter and to get them on and all expressed a lot of interest like to see how we can work together to implement and find ways to apply the would still have to incorporate these new signals

the new times and fake sites spreading staff mount secret push to tackle fake reports say read in his should treat fake news in the same way that email providers treat keep getting in email and yet we are able to stop it there have to be solutions to information inside platforms like suggests that is commercially motivated to keep fake news on the platform long as people are engaged and stay on the it works for as demonstrated by a people do care about the spread of false information on some of people said that should filter out fake news stories and the long the spread of misinformation could erode trust in the entire system wash their hands and want to said should we then believe any video stream or any brand that appears on the stern thinks that the fake news fiasco is a temporary though he says he welcomes the pressure being applied by the media trying to encourage it to be more thoughtful about the quality and influence of the content shared on its the problem is much bigger than

whole bunch of rules and regulations on top of that institution when the institution those rules and regulations he pointing to problems dealing with racism among its hosts allow individual homeowners

will obviously tell will come on in his stead 23 takes a heavy touch while around out on the left the busy nips off with the loose and is brought down by the errant for his trouble that should be a really like and before can count himself rather lucky 20 sterling makes off down the left and wins the first corner of the game takes then a pass is shuttled back down the field to whose cross is no good within the back at the feet of hart not but england are a work in progress after all slides in to challenge sterling tom for the guardian 17 has been right off the boil so far this but he looks back to his best right now he skates down the left and very nearly executes a sharp with sterling not but have been in a dangerous area had that little caper come off a expansive start by the players running scampering like joyous pups in a ad i wonder if is 15 finally put something together slides a pass down the right for who breaks into the area and pulls the ball back towards the penalty spot for has time to take a but having made space drags a woefully weak effort wide left of the target but that was england were opened up there with some ease 13 look a little rattled times huh looks to break with purpose down the but sticks to his task just for a the visitors were light at the back 11 and all of a confident passing becomes slightly ragged loses the ball in the middle of the park looks to slide rose clear down the but he was standing half a yard offside when he received the ball in the first place as is playing with bags of confidence right now a very different player from the one who struggled in his first year at is rewarded for that superlative pass with the chance to score from the spot he takes roofing his penalty into the top right had no chance england have hardly seen the but look at the fires his penalty to left tom for the guardian the keeper guesses correctly but the penalty is too high for him and england have the lead tom for the guardian celebrates with sterling and tom for the guardian 8 pinches possession down the and curls a gorgeous low pass into the the ball evades the desperate lunge of and clear in the he looks to round on the right the keeper brings him and is slightly lucky to avoid a card nacho covering in the middle saves his skin but a goes down after challenge images 6 continue to pass it round quite a lot cuts in from the left and looks for slides in to and a pretty robust challenge with his studs up he gets the ball and but he also those studs on shin a nasty but the contact was accidental looks like the will be gets a quiet from the referee the resulting free kick is a waste of time and energy 3 england really had a touch yet a lot of tippy at the back but breaking method in this patient tactic have strides down the right and floats a ball towards the far post for hart comes off his line to claim because for a second it looked like the ball would land on whereupon it would be into the net with some purpose and get the ball rolling has the and he knocks it back towards 20 seconds of at the then launches it long too long hart gathers a slightly muted atmosphere at a result of only bringing 500 fans with them the teams are england are playing in their classic white shirts with powder blue while sport their furious red an aesthetic delight anthems are hands will be given a good old shake be off in a love but reminds me of the nice man at the funeral who helps you pick out the the glorious tingle of you just taste and why he made an excessive amount of changes from the game looking for stability if a player coming into the good to have some consistency around it gives them the best chance of succeeding also still building how we want to so that continuity is important is a player we think a lot and his time will but tonight i wanted to give a run technical ability with the ball is a leader in how we want to and set the tone in that we have a young team who are keen to and are keen to show what they can do with the ball we have all the but the arrives at looking for stability images meanwhile the starting of city makes it despite struggling with a toe injury goalkeeper once of gets his first start in a couple of years ahead of united octopus and up the veteran replaces the selection of is a lovely little and one told here by our very own it completes an astonishing period for the

scored for against aged 35 years 275 days that saw him break which had stood since was only second goal for his having gone almost six years without a between his first cap in 2010 and his return in

nothing much to other than read the match fa chairman written a piece for i you should have stayed for another there was plenty of time but here now so it while the result is always tonight might also be an opportunity for one or two players to stake a claim at international no one knows the young talent better than after a year to remember at development team still over an hour until plenty of time to nip back out for another quick swallow go on finish this and still be here when you get back we began our senior action for the year with a game in last march and that thrilling 3 2 victory against the reigning world champions was cause for plenty of justified will continue to seek to measure ourselves against the leading as we also did here a year ago this month when we came out 2 0 winners over on an emotional those results optimism for 2016 and we will always look back on the past 12 months with a sense of what might have was there in as a fan like was disappointed with how the tournament given our qualification record and the talent we undoubtedly is definitely a case of looking forward now and we will sit down after this fixture to consider our options with regard to the england manager and with full gratitude to and his staff for their work friendlies might not get the juices flowing quite like a good old competitive but they have their time and place like whenever england meet for example these two rarely pull up trees when it means something eased england out of the 1950 world cup in uneventful england did for in the in 1980 and but you have written home on

england to their defeat by continental opposition two years england got their revenge in spectacular dean one of the scorers in a 7 1 win at tom missed a penalty at in 1955 but final hero bill scored twice and england won 4 1 anyway jimmy was on the in 1960 as england won 4 2 against a team containing the original and for goodness sake scored four on his own against a side built around the in 1987

sometimes i think i have never seen anything as strong as that mean that i like and admire everything about her not here to argue about who she just to note what she did i watched her plow through opposition and attacks the like of which no other candidate has ever faced and still win the popular vote to defeat her it took an unholy cabal far beyond what faced when he was the campaign of swimming with the tide of disgust about the bush administration as the new times the time all the ballots are she seems likely to be ahead by more than votes and more than 1 5 percentage points she will have won by a wider percentage margin than not only gore in 2000 but also in 1968 and john f in twitter concession know can flip that and see that trump was such a weak candidate it took decades of scheming and an extraordinary international roster of powerful players to lay the groundwork that made his election possible defeating in the electoral college took the 2013 gutting of the voting rights act by republican appointees to the supreme court it took vast republican voter suppression laws and tactics set in place over many years it took voter intimidation at many polling places it took the long republican campaign to blow up the boring bureaucratic irregularity of use of a private email server into a scandal that the media obediently picked up and reheated us yet to join ranks of countries with female leaders read took the director of the using that and his power to stage a misleading smear attack on 11 days before the election in flagrant violation of the custom of avoiding such intervention for 60 days before an election it took a compliant mainstream media running after his sabotage like a golden retriever chasing a tennis ball it took decades of conservative attacks on the served as deputy counsel to the senate whitewater that fishing expedition that began with an investigation in a messy real estate deal in before bill presidency and ended with a campaign to impeach him on charges related to completely unrelated sexual activities during his second took a nearly reality the that deified racism and narcissism as essential to success and power as the feminist media critic points trump said and did was framed in a way to flatter and more flatter his the colossal infomercial fictionalized the cheating businessman as an unqualified success and gave him a kind of brand recognition no other candidate had it took the full support of fox whose roger was so committed to him that after leaving the company following allegations of decades of sexual harassment of he joined the trump campaign it took the withdrawal of too many from even that of journalism into the partisan unreliability of sites and bubbles of social took the mainstream of failure to address climate change as the most important issue of our time it took decades of most media outlets letting the propaganda arm create the false framework of two equally valid opinions rather than reporting the overwhelming scientific consensus and tremendous danger of climate change to stop it also took using as a tool of evidently considering his grudge against the democratic nominee important enough to try to aid the campaign of a racist authoritarian now appears to have so close a relationship with that he often appears on the channel and news site rt he tweeted protests when president information was included in the panama papers hack and has been coy about where his leaked information on the democratic national committee came intelligence experts say it came from and made it clear that he favored win the day dropped his the new times ran a story reassuringly titled investigating sees no clear link to with its own underplayed revelation buried the officials have become increasingly based on the evidence they have that direct goal is not to support the election of as many democrats have but rather to disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine standing in the world more beef over loss is with liberal young and old read it took a shortsighted campaign of hatred on the an almost hysterical rage like nothing i have ever seen before about any public figure some uncritically picked up outright and spin to feed their hate and rejected anything that diluted the purity and focus of that including larger questions about the other candidate and the fate of the earth it was so extreme that in recent i was attacked for posting news stories on social media by furious people who took the position that to be overtly was to be covertly if the perfect is the enemy of the whose friend is the greater of two a lot of people seemed to think the primary ended the night trump was elected i saw that from climate and others who you might expect would have turned to face the clear and present danger of a trump presidency i for much about failure to address the pipeline adequately which was and but overshadowed by what we heard so little million dollars or so invested in the pipeline and the guarantee he would use presidential powers to push it and every pipeline like it through impossible to disconnect the irrational emotionality from and the misogyny continues since election been hearing too many men of the left go on and on about how was a weak candidate wondered about that word not only because it is so often associated with but because what calling her weakness was their refusal to support her as if sent a pink lifeboat and we sent it because we wanted a blue and now we are very upset that people are as my brilliant friend put it some point soon we need to discuss whether sanders would have been able to but helpful it just sounds like democrats should have cut into lead in the misogynist vote and the vote by running a white come to terms with the racism and the misogyny before analyzing the because otherwise just going to replicate it forever and if you think that the angry vote won sanders would have fared let me remind you that patriarchy and white supremacy are the cornerstones of the i know that if had been elected there would not be terrified and weeping people of color all over the small children too afraid to go to a shocking spike in hate students with smashed dreams marching in cities across the country i deplore some of past actions and alignments and disagreed with plenty of her 2016 positions i hoped to be fighting her for the next four years but i recognize the profound differences between her and trump on immigration and and her extraordinary tenacity and courage in facing

thousand how much time you could potentially waste on email over the course of your working according to a recent post article to put that number in roughly equivalent to spending five years on the writer we spend our days of how we spend our and we are spending our days largely on email the average office worker dips into their about 11 times an receives about 147 messages a and spends nearly of their total working week in their way to a better not read just because spending all this time on email mean enjoying it when i talk to people about their email the most common feelings they mention are and overwhelm certainly not enthusiasm research shows that the more frequently we check our the more stressed out we why do we spend so much time doing something that we particularly the fact is that even though we might not care for the content of every email we many of us are addicted to the act of checking email it activates a primal impulse in our brains to seek out rewards and in this regard not very different from in the the psychologist bf skinner invented a device called the conditioning now known as the skinner which he used to test theories on rats skinner wanted to see what effect different kinds of positive such as food and negative such as electric would have on the he experimented with putting the rats on a fixed schedule of reinforcement for if the rat pressed the lever inside the it would receive a food pellet if it continued pressing the every hundredth time the rat would receive another pellet skinner also experimented with a variable schedule in this scenario the rat know when the reward was coming it might have to press the lever 20 times to get a or it might have to press the lever 186 times to get a pellet the system was and the rat could never know exactly when the reward was the rats were significantly more motivated when they were on the variable schedule skinner found that even if he took away the rewards for the rats on the variable they would keep furiously pressing the lever for a very long time before giving up much in than the rats on the fixed schedule this starting to sound familiar for better or humans respond to positive rewards very similarly to rats and as a economist who studies the irrational actions of explained to email is a random rewards of work is making us miserable learn to live again read of the time when you the to check your email you get something disappointing or bothersome a communication from a frustrated client or a boss with an urgent request but every once in a while you press the lever and you get something exciting an email from a friend if really a cat video and those random rewards that we find so addictive they make us want to push the lever again and again and even when we have better things to it cuts both while you might get something you also might get something upsetting or and that feeling of queasy uncertainty is another aspect of strange many times have you confidently sent off a message only to find yourself just minutes over why you have not yet received a wondering if your request or your phrasing had been received as it was worried that you yourself should have written back said something asked for or asked for problem springs from a lack of social feedback normally when we communicate with someone in or even on the we are reading a thousand little social cues as we talk and deciding what to do next based on those cues it often happens that we will start to say something but based on feedback we get from the other think better of it and take another tack when we communicate through that social feedback loop is absent emails lack the facial physical and vocal tone that typically shape our interpretation of what someone is saying and allow us to adjust our delivery in order to get our true meaning results in what the psychologist calls a natural towards email argues that if the sender feels positive about an then the receiver usually feels neutral and if the sender feels neutral about the then the receiver typically feels negative about it in other as if every message you send gets automatically downgraded a few positivity notches by the time someone else receives all well and you might be but what am i supposed to do about solution to our email problem lies with getting more in touch with what makes us uniquely human overcoming the negativity and allaying some of its attendant requires us to upgrade our empathy and enthusiasm when it comes to digital communication to communicate more like feeling humans than impersonal robots exchanging recent study done by the people behind the boomerang email crunched the data from millions of email exchanges and found that messages that expressed emotion were most likely to get a response and among emails using positive words and subjective language earned the most replies in other messages that encouraged people and expressed a point of view were the most effective we want we want to communicate with people who are interesting and quality that separates us from animals and robots alike is the ability to set goals and pursue them with focus as we are uniquely equipped to train our attention on a given task and keep it there to not be distracted by random rewards or false urgency or of missing to focus instead on goals and meaningful rewards but right now we are choosing to succumb to addictive allure and to let it dictate our our and our lists at work rather than up the willpower that we know is necessary to turn our attention away from our data is clear about the drawbacks of living in email those who process their messages nibbling on notifications and multitasking throughout the are significantly less productive and less happy than those who process their email in choosing two or three discrete time blocks per day to focus on their email so that they can ignore it the rest of the it comes to exercising just a little goes a long way can you go an hour without peeking into your can you distinguish between truly urgent and can you say to some opportunities so that you can say to your bottom line if we want to get out of the

to the pit where he receives a guard of from the other teams and all among those to hug as are his family the entry to the pit lane is now so hope that nobody comes hurtling down there a lot of people

virtually a year to the day since declared that to the be a luxury it should be a right going to bring fast broadband to every home and business that wants for many trying to work in broadband such pledges are increasingly hollow many communities are taking matters into their own and some are hopeful they might be able to secure a solution that would mean they are no longer stuck in the digital dark government has previously claimed that of the country should have access to broadband by the end of but last month successor may highlighted the scale of the challenge when she complained that of people living in rural and so many small get a decent not just in remote locations take for example he is a web developer who is forced to go to and the library to upload his work because his broadband speed is so lives in in just a few hundred from the towers of canary wharf as he central yet thousands of residents are only getting around two megabits per second the average broadband according to is is due to be updated in the coming and broadband is defined as or more in urban it is often blocks of flats that are are many other digital black holes around the earlier this year website named the places with the slowest average with the list topped by the village of where the typical figure was just and the lowest speed measured was just live in in west according to the news and information site lies seventh from the bottom out of 650 constituencies for is the case with many places dealing with the everyday challenges of trying to work within an area with speeds supposedly often lower than those at mount everest base frustrations run urban it is often blocks of flats that are particularly afflicted because many of these buildings have a dedicated line from the ground floor to the nearest telephone exchange they are made of and can run long slowing the speed at which information travels in some communities fed up with waiting for to get to them are turning to the growing numbers of smaller companies and local ventures that offer potential solutions for those in supposedly include a local service provider based in that is owned by the diocese of and publishing company and uses parish church spires to deliver broadband to remote who was its chief executive until the beginning of this cable is a good technology for high transition speeds in urban but much more expensive per person in less populated regions you need to use other he reliable broadband is more important than for the majority of people for those getting by on under would be how are some of these people about live opposite canary which is almost central yet the area has one of the largest number of lines this means there are very few cabinets and so more expensive for to upgrade if lucky enough to live near the exchange you can get or but for thousands of us nearer got a pressure group and have been fighting for a better connection for four or five i became about five years ago i knew it would be an but i how much i can work from home when emailing or coding but i upload anything there are some nice and a good library in the area it feel like an inconvenience so much until you how much time wasting it affect the quality of my but i definitely have to put in longer hours to make up the got a pressure and been fighting for a better connection for four or five years and tried on around 7 , 400 homes in the area get broadband faster than and 4 , 000 hover around the local council made an election promise a few years ago to solve the and last summer the managing director of outlined what he was going to do to improve it in by march 2017 afraid i just believe what saying none of published plans addresses the issues of those most so the 4 , 000 figure change much in the foreseeable says a company called which in bringing optic broadband direct to buildings is being very currently have plans to connect single which has a lot so this will only be part of the adds that a fast unlimited supplier covering central tried to extend its service to his area a year but its planning application for a new mast was rejected by now feel at an utter loss we would love the council to work and relish to reapply but to date they have not responded to our questions about says that they need the fastest broadband be happy with between and live in the village of two miles outside the busy market town of rural but not with several industrial estates and local small businesses we only recently moved here before we used the website postcode check on the property in 2015 it indicated that broadband was in place and upgrade while the connecting website said it was very and the fact that when we viewed the house the vendor gave us a postcard had delivered saying broadband now in your gave us enough reassurance and we bought the house twitter simple email is torturous for who lives in nothing has happened the speed in the village is still run a consulting business from and uploading and downloading artwork is and simple email torturous if i log on to banking to transfer funds it may take three or four attempts watching television or services is almost impossible if we want to watch a sky movie we have to give the 24 notice so it can download i spoke to to get a quote for a connection the process almost drove me to tears it took me five months and a personal visit to the head office in to finally get contact with a community officer who could look into this for us after further we were told that to proceed have to pay between to for the village after receipt of this it would take up to a year to get think you have to be a rocket scientist to read between the lines with they want the business we found a private company based in its technology is offering a cheap solution in a matter of a few months thirty up and down unlimited monthly no connection fee been incredible like finding the holy grail for many of us the only issue is we need 60 households to sign up to make it work commercially for and of the so taking a while to convince everyone if it does it will make a real difference to a lot of families and between and run a flower farm in in the borders when the broadband is poor really poor our connection is on top of no consistency you think something is loading and gone again i just want to be able to do things that ordinary people can i put out an email to florists in saying what flowers we have in stock sometimes it takes until for the mailing list to upload i manage but it takes 10 times as long i work most evenings until late to catch office updates everything is if you do things people think a real but not i just want to be able to do things that ordinary people can do we thought be getting an upgrade last year but no very annoyed about this it got our hopes up apparently too far from the exchange for to upgrade are six houses in our hamlet and the same for all of us our hope is a small local company called which of technology that is used widely in rural and the way it works is that if you can see the you should get a been great a mast on a hill a few miles and moving it

how can i restart my career and avoid discrimination now i am using a became disabled nearly five years losing the use of my hands gradually over 12 with my general mobility becoming more impaired now transitioning into a wheelchair prior to this been employed for seven years in middle management with the same and was generally doing well in my career of 15 years i had never had any issues or performance concerns and was considered a high was made redundant 14 months after becoming but with a good package i accepted this and moved on i interview well and had a good i was offered a new job quite but when i declared my disability the role disappeared i decided after that to not declare my disabilities until i had my foot in the so to speak i did just declaring my disability on day one of a new job and was made 11 months later evidence of discrimination was gathered and i was offered a payout cue the next same same outcome now 13 months into job four and in the same position i know the signs and am before what i believe to be the inevitable know that the law is on my side regarding but taking a complaint route is distressing and and hate to go through it again i want to be in a position where i have to keep on can i get off this now that i am a wheelchair user at least i have the dilemma of whether or not to declare my disability i think my support needs are lightweight equipment dictation software and premises above i need a manager who will support but how can i assess that in the job interview do i need to do differently to not just get a job but keep i know how to get my career back on very glad you no longer have to make that difficult decision as to whether or not to declare your disability on first contact pretty sure in most preferable for it to be known from the but now at least that decision is made for am slightly surprised you mention any that exist specifically to support people in your situation identified several that would seem promising you of have approached them but found they led nowhere but if you i strongly recommend that you conduct an search and follow up on those sites that seem to suit you in matchmaking employees with employers who are actively seeking to take on disabled people what this of is that not in unspoken competition with so no question of discrimination coming into however unconscious as i have no direct knowledge of any of these afraid i advise you or make specific but do please look into them your letter struck by how little you have to say about your own particular strengths and experience i suspect that you entirely have become so preoccupied with what you need that neglected to make the case for what you can offer in your 20 work you must have acquired knowledge and specific skills that would be of particular value to potential employers these can prove more attractive to recruiters even if only a minority than more general say apply for a role at a disability charity or a disabled they are used to making adjustments and not be judged but understand if feel a little as a disabled it took me a long time to find an and a role where i felt comfortable and but out there ask lots of questions at interview about the provisions make the attitude they take should give you a good idea as to what be like as an employer apply for civil service jobs all government departments have a robust policy that starts at the application with the guaranteed interview principle for candidates who pass the agreed competency standard is driving me crazy the only fly in the ointment of my dream am blessed in that i have landed my dream job after costly and exhausting hundreds of hours of voluntary dozens of applications and and a lot of determination and i have a satisfying and challenging job in the charity sector that pays well and in which i feel problem is the commute on good days the drive is 1 hour 20 minutes each on bad days more than two hours and it is becoming exhausting public transport really an option due to remote find that my evenings are lost in a haze of and i fear know i am becoming unpleasant to be around i used to have hobbies creative but these are no longer viable weekends are invaluable but i am tired a lot of the there anything i can do to alleviate or do i suck it i want to appear ungrateful working from home really an option as i manage volunteers and need to have an office presence i have considered staying in an during the week but i would be sad not to see my family every yourself for four hours a and now much of it in the is not only exhausting but also potentially dangerous how about splitting your for spending and nights near your place of work and going home the other evenings at the cost of two evenings away you would reduce your double commute from five days to just the one with the weekend to imagine your sympathetic employer would be anxious to help so if you could also negotiate the occasional working from eliminate the double commute and have an uninterrupted three days at say i would find a cheapish for two nights a week many smaller places would be glad of the regular and after a short time you tend to become a friend and be treated better than more casual customers faced with a similar i moved i have walked or cycled to work for the past 35 years and been doing a job i enjoy and which stressful work to live to work a

than anyone to exploit the one thing this had to offer bounce in the two wickets have fallen in no and the lid has been kept on the pot for almost the whole day so maybe cook gets half the last has been a test of five which could have been deadly dull but one thing has kept it apart from the none of the tons has been a big one on a pitch like you win the match with a baby hundred only the daddy will do but very well played and watching him in person for the first time in a with a fond stoicism that shows you where the patience comes from thanks for reading and for sharing your lines by the great the last word goes to take your eyes off the banjo for read another the has one job and fails to do to give another catch 319 4 and stumps the last five minutes belong to the day belongs to 108th 318 3 a wicket for who has been exacting all day with his extra bounce is too much for who tickles it to at short leg and departs for 126 the end of a formidable innings and a shot in the arm for the match 107th 317 2 persists with his audition for the slightly eerie addition to the as an email arrives from name is bear with him currently sitting in an office in following an inevitable trying to manage my messages checking to see if still the i love his although growing up i had nothing but antipathy towards him as teachers used to laugh whenever they discovered my name and colleagues and spouses a keen poet always resented knowing that should my particularly woeful works ever get me my own name is already and have to change of know how you intend to edit this rambling message for if at all just to be in exchange with a thank i barely had to edit the message at all 106th 316 2 keeps the lid the thread continues with an email from lee smith lines from he but perhaps relevant to other events this week the song is 105th 313 2 the game has officially gone to sleep the is a email from moss in anticipating a fictional conversation between and ahead of the 2005 104th 311 2 backs up allowing only two singles the moment of truth in this test now looks like being the third when england have to do what are doing here rise above their weariness and bat with some serenity more on from drew link to but an absolutely moving song that resonates with 103rd 309 2 alarmed by that flurry of cook turns to who might have been banking on a longer rest after a fine spell he restores but even if fall apart they will have saved the and with the game 102nd 308 2 takes some punishment from both batsmen as drives him for a silky four and lofts him for a swishy six scored fast enough but they may be about to put that right 101st 297 2 broad keeps quiet until he tries a short which is round the corner for four not that far from who is standing back john joins the conversation about have anything clever to he begins be the judge of i do heartily recommend this about especially good for people who are down on themselves for having a great idea but followed through on a lovely touch 100th 292 2 stokes gets a and plays a nice little chip into the leg side for only a as like has some cover in the cow on from just the one so we assume from a he an aside to the audience in studied deeply in all the major but somehow optimism kept breaking sounds like he might almost have been involved a test match at some point it is a oh yes 99th 291 2 broad bowls to with the keeper standing up and a man in the deep at cow corner a and transformation into mike is complete 98th 291 2 stokes continues to try slipping in a low full toss which drives silkily but straight to at cover someone needs to make something contender from strangely relevant for uneventful days of test is from first we take clearly knew that was a the opening salvo not just of the but of the album your that changed the course of his career 97th 290 2 broad and stokes are bowling serving up swing as well as their familiar but the batsmen are equal to and plays a glorious flick through midwicket for next line comes in from wood who one earlier down under before his ache in the places where i used to of absolutely one of the great lines of all time 96th 285 2 at a flash of intent from who drives stokes for a handsome four and gets a couple of lifters for his trouble peter in takes the ode to pitches are going there in and we are very wary after the drubbing we got in we expect the pitch that england have been presented with lucky 95th 281 2 another testing over from who has been very good today in his 100th test has 2 from 17 and is determined to turn him into a former leader 94th 280 2 more good questions from stokes an edge from into the gap at second cook may be ringing the bowling changes but he about to set attacking fields and finally a single from a tuck to leg there are still 19 overs to go in can england nab a couple more 93rd 278 2 broad replaces as cook reaches for the spice rack yet again broad lets have a single so he can attack who remains scoreless but untroubled 92nd 277 2 well bowled stokes why is it that more than most can take a wicket by sheer force of treats him with a series of decisive leaves and beady the score has gone down a mysterious two got added a few overs ago and drinks has stokes brought england back into the or will see this as just the platform for the sixth hundred in the and what are your lines from yet another bowling change brings stokes back and he does the trick inducing a tired waft from and a catch for cook at first slip are 279 2 and england have a glimmer of hope 91st 279 1 plays another of those delicious swishes of lofting over like a dad on the beach who is suddenly weary of being kind to his kid 50 off the last ten overs 90th 269 1 almost persuades to to at leg in what might have been a landmark moment for rookies three to fine leg and motors on towards a really big one 89th 263 1 replaces and concedes a few singles i was going to take this as further proof that cook had had a personality but then noticed that he had gone off the field and left root in charge whoever is in england are a hungry person having opening every box in the variety pack and still not finding nourishment what next root 88th 260 1 tidy stuff from who has done well to go for only three an over but the new ball got the supposed to make things happen 87th 258 1 keeps quiet over on surrey point out that today would have been 39th birthday he was a delight to watch when the force was with him he is much but i hope and the rest of his family can see some of his spirit in this england packed with stylish 86th 258 1 another crazy dish from the funky broad goes off after one and comes on he is at that stage of a career where a good ball shout for against is followed by a dud for also may be tearing left of his hair out 85th 253 1 may well end up in the press because he keeps asking the right questions he finds enough lift to rap on the thigh too high for the but another little moral victory has 3 0 3 0 in this and 19 5 34 0 in quietly heroic 84th 252 1 the experiment ends after one pricey and broad is back hungry for a hundred of his caresses him to the midwicket boundary with a finesse that smells like and then he goes straight to his hundred by gliding the ball in exactly the opposite direction sheer class we now have five hundreds in the which is quite enough can we please have five quick another feathers broad wide of the only slip fielder for four a lovely way to reach a hundred that has been less dominant than but more secure 83rd 242 1 misses slips in a and drives outside but it swing or threaten off stump wakes has been strong the leader of the attack in have an early contender for the very best of lines from tower of song are my says suggests that none of the questions have any answer which feels very a beauty 82nd 241 1 celebrates with a classy late cut for four off who has been given the new ball ahead of broad the batsmen mind that at as proves by swishing a six onto the rope at for once in his is being too funky 81st 229 1 did well making work for that hundredth run and it was who bowled the three helmet balls only three balls that bothered reckons a new a fresh bowler an crowd and lets a couple go outside before pushing into the covers and reaching three figures at last this is the first test ever played in his home and the first watched in person by his who has brought a serene presence and a less than serene polo shirt well son a magnificent effort from a man who was hit on the helmet not not but three times celebrates after scoring his century 80th 228 1 a maiden from containing a review so bizarre that it qualify for our key event box for against cook presumably just using it because it was with moments left to the new ball cricketing references in wonders rob be some baseball allusions i will never forget that night i saw him at the hall i think it was the night of first election victory and i remember him ending with the line about of the best and the feels appropriate anyone else got a line or two from begins haycock no all the nope if test cricket was a game this match would be literally pointless right now if the wicket deteriorates like showing a few signs of we might be in for a cracking fifth day we might also be in for a but nice to have that comforting this is a true pitch maybe too true to be good it is not the only country where an england team has had an international this week an entertaining email arrives from rob lewis in turkey maybe you can sneak this in at a quiet tea would seem to pass that test narrowly edged out england on in the middle of forest in in a really do but the enthusiastic boss bey bounced into my lesson to announce that we were all going to do some in the forest ordered in some wickets and a ball from amazon as the only ones with any knowledge of the game at the guy and i were asked to pick teams and explain what to it was a sultry 25 we found a small patch of flat and something approximating cricket happened balls were chucked at bats were held and fielders slunk round looking for a chance to have a smoke the park guards arrived to send us packing at one point but the turks pronounced cricket to be a great game and the exercise will become a regular event keep up the great you rob an interesting point from the editor of think i just heard compare batting to says in an email sure about that if anyone is a throwback to that era of test who bats to his own utterly immune to what goes on around him he managed the big hundreds but the one compare with and others of that assuming bob not homer 79th 228 1 another as stokes gets playing down the wrong and then cook manages to stifle by deploying a field setting that will be familiar to anyone who ever played for the so takes tea on and england have won the skirmish of the last few minutes but the like the belongs to and the badly need a collapse when the new ball is taken 78th 227 1 gets tied down by and but survives well bowled mo who already has a hundred in this match 77th 227 1 who was expensive comes back but moves serenely on 76th 224 1 another classy cut from off this time again it reach the but the batsmen have found their bustle here comes stokes
avoid crisis talk after beating as media lament read more and star for to leave flailing in qualifying read more it coach and make it five straight wins and continue dwelling in their own downfall there was nothing about this match that should suggest they can do anything against next even if they are at entire squad energized and inspired by as he looked down from heaven delivered a performance that would make the legends of the extremely proud before this the last time played in had embarrassed them 7 1 at the world cup in 2014 they have a new has a lot to think about was really the best choice to where is the relentless pressure or the grit and desire we are so accustomed to seeing when we watch answers better come fast because a hungry is coming to town thanks for tuning in and see you next time 90 it win convincingly a masterful victory 89 a great ball wide to who finds but just about clear it from the box who touched the ball in a can only admire at his teammate and the way he leads the really is a sight to behold when he leads his nation finally gets the ball and dribbles towards the box but deflects wide 84 hits the post after a great comes out for a great performance from the man again enters the box but just about clears it this is truly by and ironically they could really benefit from another manager who instills a lot of grit and but busy managing 81 replaces city fans are going to be spoiled with the things he a great no only 19 79 close to making 4 0 as he breaks through the center and into the box but his second touch is too heavy and the ball goes out chanting and going to be a long flight back to 75 there are shades of the old with lovely football i actually remember the last time touched the ball or even made a significant contribution look to penetrate box but a stout defense takes it right back 69 gets fouled just outside the box but nothing materializes there are 20 minutes left and there is nothing about this match that says will get a let alone come back look composed and really loving their football maria looks exhausted and needs to be subbed 65 and are just having too much fun right now and like it as he fouls the man are losing the match and their heads on the process in complete other is currently beating 4 1 in first away win since 2004 i might explode after done warning you 59 this time miss and makes it game over as he capitalizes on a cross from the right hand side this is huge are losing currently out of the top match is gigantic 57 this game should be over once again finds who rounds the he needs to do is score and its over but saves it on the gets fouled by to a great attempt by but its saved by 53 fouls and once has to warn his players to calm down have taken on the knowing that is rattled finds but offside this is biggest being able to figure out how to encourage rapid movement inside the box 49 start the second the same way they ended the with relentless counterattacking who replaced draws a yellow card as stop him on the right hand side another this time a good ball but be met by anyone 45 and clearly cruise control for right now as are getting rocked by the counter all going badly for team sure will come in the second half straight away 45 what a great pass by who cuts through the defense and feeds who calmly puts it in corner wow 42 what a great cross by from the left hand and it just be met by who was too slow to react are finishing this half strongly with all the action in just find the back of the net john ha you know at times you would think that is the case but due to the fact that and push so high up when in possession i agree with you a special my playing tricks on me or are playing a via email 37 another for as gets fouled outside the box this is an almost perfect angle for la but he drives it against the wall if it carries on like it be long until we see on the takes it all the way into the box from the right hand but instead of delivering a low he shoots it himself and hits the post 33 as decide to stick to the same plan by sitting until opposition enter their half drives towards the box and shoots from just outside but it goes wide struggling to stay onside a problem when you play lone striker 29 that goal certainly shook who up to that were clearly the better team in terms of possession has now instructed his team to press higher up the field as plan a has disintegrated 25 what a goal by the man cuts in from the left hand side and drives towards the box and curls it past the keeper this boy is on 24 the first real chance by falls to with a great shot from outside of the box and it took a great save from to stop worked so well on the right hand side to find the man and he took a powerful shot that was well met by the keeper the best chance of the match 20 the crowd chant every time touches the ball but aside from that nothing much in terms of real chances an extremely nervy first 20 minutes from both sides thank you for the of no i live in a country where twitter is banned any chance line ups can be written instead of linked many 16 is playing extremely wide right with playing as the lone striker this is where the man can usually show signs of fading for as he is best suited to play directly behind the striker in an role still nothing in terms of a real chance 12 beginning to show some trickery but pass who basically falls to the ground to try and stop the dribbling dominating in possession looking to stay in the final third and actually looking to press slightly hoping to push back to their own box maria even touched the until the action has been on the right hand side 8 has instructed his team to not press until the opposition enter their then counter gets a yellow as he elbows who had embarrassed him with a nice ball above his head things calm down after that and push more better from men need to be careful with being over physical 4 begin the first few minutes with quick possession and taking on their defensive waiting to counter clear will spearhead the with playing right behind free to move from left to right gets fouled about 35 yards outside of the box and takes a which goes nowhere 1 and the squads walk out to the stadium and the atmosphere is electric as the anthem plays in the background by the wearing the no 4 in honor of the legendary who passed away last the anthems are playing and first followed by which is obviously met with thunderous think i have ever seen or so focused a moment of silence for next time you hear from me will be the stage is set and players are inside the tunnel ready to come out a beautiful albeit humid night in forget you can email me or send me a tweet one too many vs 2016 we are fifteen minutes away from some results from

stokes shows other side to his talents with century of graft and craft martin read more report from stokes and score tons as england pile on the runs against read more the day is and though england would have dearly loved to make a late breakthrough they will nevertheless be extremely satisfied by their work they may not have taken any but they have been sufficiently encouraged to feel that they will soon enough by tea tomorrow we should have a good idea of where this test is heading for adieu gives a quick interview on his way off the it was encouraging for tomorrow i think the slower ball spun a bit more than the rest of them got to try to be patient as well i slept well last so i too fussed being on 99 before i went into bat i feel that i was a bit lethargic and i had to get myself going i just batted to the occasion and the singles were there to take there were times when i wanted to have a hack but got to rein it in sometimes his maybe i got a bit defensive but i found him quite tough to face to be honest with you 23rd 63 0 bowls and one lovely delivery in the which spot and zips just past the edge of his bat very nice bowling and stumps 22nd 60 0 another another and england have only six deliveries left if to stop ending what has been for them a largely disappointing day feeling really quite positive all things considered 21st 59 0 does his first and his second ball is hit by to the long off evading not one but two diving fielders on its way for added dramatic effect 20th 54 0 and gets a single from the penultimate ball in a pleasingly symmetrical both batsmen have faced precisely 60 deliveries 19th 53 0 four overs to go and how england would like something to celebrate before stumps just seen this tweet from late last night who calls their eatery brilliant good to aim i restaurant to serve you thanks for visiting 2016 18th 51 0 first over yields a single off the though was looking pretty angry with himself when he failed to or indeed an eminently hittable wide one that maybe stayed a bit low 17th 50 0 decent bowling from setting up with a couple that carried straight on well wide of off and then making the third angle though the wicket seriously threatened the runs have stopped only one has been scored in the last three overs 16th 50 0 looking most though there been much competition and reach a largely 50 cook at silly point gets hit on the calf and decides pads might be in causing a short delay 15th 49 0 a bit of movement here for with the ball biting a chunk out of the pitch on its way through maiden 14th 49 0 gets good spin and no reward for it but is totally the ball finds a gap between bat and and it passes perhaps two inches wide of off and then rolls away for four byes on says it turned which goes to show the effect trump is already having on our culture are going to win bigly believe video 13th 44 0 first ball is a wide full toss that diverts to backward point for four of runs so far have come from as this wicket continues to bleed runs 12th 40 0 hello little to encourage england so far but for one delivery that climbed and went for four which as encouragement goes is very much at the discouraging end of the spectrum no such drama from his fourth over of the featuring as it does a couple of singles and a leg all pretty 11th 37 0 broad on be tempted to get into the game especially given the time of day and consequent dilemma gets some discernible presumably an excellent sign for particularly when stokes is able to bowl a decent over from two from and drinks will be with you until the close 10th 35 0 is showing plenty of apart from that one lunge in the previous over six defensive strokes mean six dot balls mean a maiden big on final months on writes offers 9th 33 0 stokes is limping off the field it looks like cramp reaches outside off stump to elegantly wave a poor delivery from broad through the covers for four then he times four more back past an even better and edges a third boundary low to third man anyone out england bowler reacts as and take a run 8th 21 0 this is good from whose line and length to have been excellent after five dot throws everything at a full delivery that beats him and spits past for four byes 7th 17 0 broad is into his work now and produces a sharp delivery that onto the thigh there is also a hint of reverse though been a long day so my eyes may be telling lies an excellent over from his best yet 6th 17 0 replaces who bowled a couple of innocuous overs he had by far the best series of his test career with the ball against in when he took 19 wickets at 23 negligible turn in his first over with defending solidly a maiden plays a shot 5th 17 0 cook has put a man on the drive for the first twang of funk in the field there should be plenty more as england try to prise out 20 wickets you always wickets on the broad goes around the wicket to the angle from which he has so much success in the last 18 months works a single behind square on the leg side to get off strike 4th 15 0 reaches to time a wide delivery from behind backward point for four england have been unusually inaccurate so far is that wanted highlights but the set the price too says blank screens surely be putting something on even if only repeat of she 3rd 10 0 drives broad pleasantly through extra cover for a couple a bit of bounce to encourage england but no real movement they will want to get it reversing as soon as assume this match is all over but do you know if any channels are giving the rest of us the chance to watch highlights at says see anything on channel 5 or i think so 2nd 8 0 injury has meant an unlikely return for 35 he gets off the mark by pinging a poor delivery from through square leg for four not a great start by england send them 501 is surely a says drew had a previous england opener made it would have been a hundred sorry for the 1st 4 0 if england get two wickets tonight they will sleep beautifully in his 100th opens to with three a gully and short leg his line is too straight to start and works the second ball fine for four falling away again and it shows he improves as the over progresses and almost sneaks a wide yorker under bat the last ball ends up in the hands of at short a couple of the slips appeal but broad and the umpire says john that we have three centurions in the but this is where large scores are not unknown there were no daddy hundreds stepfather maybe a score of ought to be a what do you call a 501 the end of the innings means time for the tea break england have had a good with and stokes making hundreds and and contributing as well there are only 21 overs remaining in the so can really charge in after tea tries to sweep and and gives him out primarily because he was the last but replays showed it straightened and would have hit leg stump players celebrates the wicket of batsman 159th england 537 9 broad broad turns just short of leg slip as this session continues to potter along has figures of two for 167 158th england 534 9 broad broad is dropped by a diving chance at leg slip at and then survives a referral after dropping his says reporting on the cricket and tell us whether you think trump will inspire may like did you only on terms with the 157th england 529 9 broad a cheap wicket with which to massage his figures instead swaggers down the track and lifts a classy boundary over this has been an excellent innings from one of the better in cricket history 156th england 522 9 broad broad had his face redefined by a bouncer in so not surprised attacks him with a couple of bouncers broad ignores and a maiden 155th england 522 9 broad pulls through midwicket for a shot that verges on disdainful beats him for his but only outside off it should be tea but because england are nine the session will be extended for half an hour or until broad misses a straight one 154th england 518 9 broad bowls the penultimate over of a somnolent afternoon with pulling a single off the last ball la la la 153rd england 517 9 broad the is the centurion broad innings ends when he is caught down the leg side he pushed wearily at an errant delivery from and got a thin edge that was well taken by the keeper 152nd england 517 8 stokes defends a few deliveries from and then winces a sharp single to at he is showing almost heroic given the match situation and his own with the says griffin you stop publishing facetious nonsense emailed in by and stick to the these emails is ever 151st england 516 8 stokes is struggling presumably with cramp if i was a take no risks until tea is 15 then mainline during the interval and swing like a beauty in the evening session i suspect he might give it away before tea though either he should be beyond criticism as he has been quite everyone who follows cricket have a whirring set of possible amazing scenarios going in their head that are ultimately so outlandish and unlikely they even air them to their nearest and says salmon the moment thinking stokes top score 258 more from top first class score 116 and broad top score 169 another 405 meaning the 1000 is do you think this will in say a near certainty 150th england 513 8 stokes is shattered now and has a hack at dragging it through square leg for a single england have plodded along in this session but i think okay what they want was to be bowled out for 480 and for to end the day on 150 for says have to learn to with banal before gradually moving into speculative ideas if going pretentious while distinguishing the whole with an original spin which is brief or quickly cut and did i say like to paste something 149th england 510 8 famously broke his bat during a hundred in 2003 now stokes has broken the ball he cracked it so hard back to that it made a big and a delay while the umpires choose a replacement the first delivery with the new ball hits stokes amidships and plops just in front of his stumps stokes staggers backwards and a weary attempted kick at the ball that was funnier than i made it sound new at this so bear with the 144th over was all about my email and not about the cricket i feel both glad that was provided and yet sad that coverage was impacted upon by said says hope we can find a way we dexter has commissioned a report into the impact of attempted on cricket 148th england 509 8 comes into the attack his first a reverse is edged just short of gully by the extent to which england make the ball reverse might decide this game maybe this will be jubilee albeit without the brandy the white shock and awe in as england have gone from a thrashing in to 500 says guy feel rather foolish having questioned whether stokes was a bit of a bully when he failed in last time but been outstanding this winter i keep forgetting only 25 a real potential core of this team for the next 5 or 6 when england never seemed that good at succession i may have to replace my with some what a is an astonishingly brilliant creation going to leave no spine in the next six or seven years 147th england 509 8 stokes winces a little after playing a forward defensive off be bowling in a couple of hours continues to bowl very wide of off hoping stokes will go fishing he 146th england 509 8 stokes really gone for apart from that one six down the and there are just a couple of singles from that over england are going fairly slowly but i think a they are using up some of the good overs before this pitch hopefully i appreciate the anecdotes and says 144th over has no information about the cricket preceding commentary was the flip side good information shape up try bud new to this so bear with me 145th england 507 8 who has had four catches dropped in this returns in place of the subdued stokes ignores some wider deliveries and trump is the balance out the giggling sirens at front door he needs to call up his friends perspective and england cricketing history of the says lee smith should dampen his 144th england 506 8 am not watching any live coverage of stokes alas as i have a new computer and all my i mean cricket links are says a bit like missing out on watching joy division on reports because you insisted that tony was too much of a prick to be worth your 143rd england 504 8 stokes works for a single to bring up the 500 england have gone from 5 0 to 500 in sessions the 10th time they have reached 500 in their highest score was the 652 7 in in the match of foxy foxy foster and foxy then gets his first boundary with a nice flick through midwicket off 142nd england 495 8 a maiden from to you predicted all this 141st england 495 8 an odd thing to say about an innings of 8 not out from 31 but has played perfectly so with no risk whatsoever in his playing for stokes
there are only 30 remaining doctors in and they have been describing an unimaginable some of which i have seen firsthand they have to perform amputations on children on the floor of their rudimentary emergency rooms without anesthesia or proper sterilization they are running short on blood intravenous antibiotics and pain maps that show how the net closed on eastern read doctors have been struggling to provide for a traumatized population of 300 , 000 while their hospitals are bombed daily and their medical supplies and medications are have been working nonstop for the past three

physicians for human rights has recorded 382 attacks on medical of which 344 were carried out by the regime and they were also responsible for the deaths of 703 of the 757 medical personnel killed in the war so far most of doctors have the medical reported that was the worst month for attacks on since the beginning of the conflict there were 43 attacks on health facilities in the month more than one a day by this number of attacks occurred over six months in with 47 attacks from to few months two of my colleagues and i made the dangerous trip from to in order to volunteer in a medical mission with the medical society we worked in a hospital that was built 20 meters underground because it was targeted a dozen times in the past four lived and slept in the while hearing the sounds of explosions nearby the hospital was operated by a generator and connected to the world through satellite and a was so surreal for a critical care specialist from to witness nurses and doctors in an underground hospital in a besieged middle eastern city was the largest trauma hospital in performing 4 , 000 surgeries every year in its intensive care i treated innocent victims of the and i still remember vividly who was pulled from under the rubble of his destroyed house after a barrel bomb thrown by a regime helicopter exploded while he was sustained a spinal cord injury and lung contusion doctors struggled to manage his case with very limited resources we were unable to evacuate him to turkey for surgery because the only road leading from the city was bombed every day by regime forces trying to encircle the city a few days gave up he suffered cardiac arrest and was pronounced is only one of thousands of innocent civilians who could have been saved in any other conflict or disaster area with simple means his and those of tens of thousands of occurred because they lacked access to proper medical care it constitutes a war we the situation became more dire because of the ensuing siege the only female obstetrician in the city told me that she has been using sewing threads to suture her patients after because of a shortage of surgical has been delivering mostly children with very low birth weight as pregnant women have no access to meat or vitamins food and baby formula are becoming so and for the first time in its modern is witnessing children with severe tears about the pictures of the injured children of is not enough hugging your children is not enough the expected human response when seeing someone in distress is to exert our utmost effort to relieve their distress children are not dolls to cry over and then move are as are our political if we act when we watch videos of children crying in agony because war criminals are bombing them or snipers shooting at them tweeting and about although necessary to spread the does not absolve us from doing what matters most which is saving their lives and building a better future for person can do several things right now to help children like the boy from besieged whose photo showing his and face after being rescued following an captured the attention and millions of other children affected by the conflict in now and call your political leaders and president demanding that your country exert its moral leadership to stop the genocide and save now in the we should not wait for the next president to take office by that it will be too late we should place ending the genocide at the top of the national would mean specific plans for stopping the genocide and bringing not merely applying what is happening in is affecting all of wherever we live the refugee the rise of sentiment and terrorism are all consequences of the crisis in our national leaders should muster the political will to end with faith and civic groups in your city to form a broader coalition that can force our political leaders to act this is the and this how democracy works if we said we should mean and we should have political leaders responsible if they failed the genocide up in medical societies and meetings invite speakers to your hospitals to address the attacks on medical neutrality and the medical community should not tolerate a new normal where 150 years of conventions and international humanitarian norms are thrown under the bus and undermined every day the medical community can play a major role in forcing political leaders to listen to the pleas of nurses struggling to save lives while being bombed by the most advanced war in medical missions to help refugees there are many including global that provide medical relief to refugees in neighboring countries and in join a experience when you extend a hand of healing to a desperate refugee living in a tent thinking that the world has forgotten

a month ago i tried to write a column proposing mean nicknames for on the basis that it would be funny to turn the tables on him for the cruel diminutives he applied to pull it off there is a darkness about trump that negates that sort of a folly so an incompetence so profound that no insult could plumb its has run one of the lousiest presidential campaigns ever in saying so i am not referring to his business practices or his vulgar remarks about women i mean this in a purely technical this man fractured his own party his convention was a fiasco he had no ground game to speak of the list of celebrities and pundits and surrogates taking his side on the campaign trail was extremely short he needlessly offended countless groups of disabled mothers of crying the bush and among others he even lost for now he is going to be president of the united states the woman we were constantly assured was the candidate of all time has lost to the least qualified candidate of all time everyone who was anyone rallied around and it make any difference the man too incompetent to insult is now going to sit in the oval whence he will hand down his verdicts on the grandees and sages of the old there is a bright side to a trump victory after there was a reason that tens of millions of good people voted for him and maybe he will live up to their high regard for him he has pledged to the of and maybe he will sincerely tackle that task he has promised to renegotiate and maybe will finally come to pass maybe win so much for us he once predicted in a campaign that get sick of not deceive ourselves we going to win anything what happened on is a both for liberalism and for the world as president trump goes about settling scores with his former picking fights with other and unleashing his special deportation police on this group and we will all soon have cause to regret his ascension to the presidential throne what we need to focus on now is the obvious what the hell went what species of guided our democratic leaders as they went about losing what they told us was the most important election of our at the top she has an impressive she worked hard on the campaign trail but she was exactly the wrong candidate for this populist moment an insider when the country was screaming for an outsider a technocrat who offered when the country wanted to take a sledgehammer to the machine twitter victory speech in was the democratic candidate because it was her turn and because a victory would have moved every democrat in up a notch whether or not she would win was always a secondary something that was taken for granted had winning been the number one several more suitable candidates were ready to go there was with his powerful plainspoken and there was an inspiring and largely figure each of them would probably have beaten but neither of them would really have served the interests of the party so democratic leaders made their candidate even though they knew about her closeness to the her fondness for and her unique vulnerability on the trade issue each of which trump exploited to the fullest they chose even though they knew about her private email server they chose her even though some of those who studied the foundation suspected it was a sketchy try to put over such a nominee while screaming that the republican is a monster is to court disbelief if trump is a as liberals often democrats should have put in their strongest player to stop not a party hack chosen because it was her turn choosing her indicated either that democrats mean what they said about that their opportunism took precedence over the or maybe supporters among the media help either it always struck me as strange that such an unpopular candidate enjoyed such robust and unanimous endorsements from the editorial and opinion pages of the but it was the quality of the enthusiasm that really harmed her with the same arguments repeated over and two or three times a with nuance and contrary views all the act of opening the newspaper started to feel like tuning in to a cold war propaganda station what it consisted was virtually without flaws she was a peerless leader clad in saintly a a caring benefactor of women and a warrior for social scandals real the economy was doing well was already people supporting if they it was only because they were botched humans racism was the only conceivable reason for lining up with the republican candidate how did the crusade the fourth estate came together in an unprecedented professional consensus they chose insulting the other side over trying to understand what motivated them they transformed opinion writing into a vehicle for high moral boasting what could possibly have gone wrong with such an put this question in slightly more general terms and you are confronting the single great mystery of 2016 the class just spent the year rallying around a professional really all that and either insulting or silencing everyone who accept their assessment and then they lost maybe time to consider whether something about shrill shouted from a position of high social that turns people even larger problem is that there is a kind of chronic complacency that has been rotting liberalism for a hubris that tells democrats they need do nothing they need deliver nothing really to anyone except their friends on the jet and those nice people at the rest of us are treated as though we have nowhere else to go and no role to play except to vote enthusiastically on the grounds that these democrats are the thing between us and the end of the world it is a liberalism of the it has failed the middle and now it has failed on its own terms of enough with these comfortable democrats and their cozy system enough with and its

it for this and the campaign our new team is up early for a polling day us election voters head to polls as trump and aim to make history live read more has a chance of winning the according to a email from the respected pollster silver up from a chance on so has had a good run in the polls in the final days of the campaign projected margin of victory in the popular vote has increased to from a lot of you north and flipped from red to blue over the course of we think a particularly meaningful because the forecasts are probabilistic chances of winning increased to from for which is nontrivial but not an especially large change we know something a lot of readers follow unlikely that any further states will flip to in our final as too far behind in the state possible that and north could flip to trump by tomorrow though probably not where lead is a bit larger who is to blame for not stopping trump few suspects spared a mention in hall of shame they include the other republican presidential candidates such as and who themselves to be by a reality host and serially bankrupted but also trio of and newt those three horsemen of the republican apocalypse conspired in the lie that a salesman was fit to be president and destroyed what remained of their reputations in the process plus running mate mike defender of family values who has served as the running mate of a serially grabber of also rounds on the on a epic of the media and there are cameos for and and finally a dig at the us some blame surely attaches to the who let trump keep up the bullying and the bigotry and voted for him anyway there is no escaping the fact that north of of the us electorate have been prepared to vote for trump despite everything that he has said and done one poll found of own supporters believed he would start a nuclear war they thought but were prepared to vote for him anyway none of them will be able to is to blame for this awful us read more video of final campaign rally lady gaga and were on hand to sing living on a prayer before introducing the democratic candidate lady gaga and back at final campaign rally unlike the trump and his team chose not to pose for pictures as his plane returned from his final notes trump 's plane has landed at a different airport than the traveling press to a packed crowd in a community college gymnasium in trump outlined his closing message that election will decide whether we are ruled by a corrupt political class or by the polls set to open after and trump make final pitches read more reports on biggest closing rally in and and all visits city of founding fathers for final rally as goes to polls read more emerges from the plane with bill at her side wearing bright red she waves at her supporters with both hands she also claps and looks very chipper blares as steps off the plane 2016 campaign plane has just returned home to county airport in new after her final rally in north has live footage of members of her campaign team staggering off the plane it also showed bill milling about in the plane at the top of the steps scene in white plains as lands after her final campaign flight supporters chant 2016 election day has been and gone for three small towns in new which thanks to the quirks of the electoral system count their votes as soon as the clock strikes midnight if anyone still uses striking clocks any turnouts huge but then nor are the 4 2 1 1 sanders 1 if wondering how the stock markets are reacting to election has you covered over on the business live markets nervously await election results business live read more where are the polls as the us tips into election day there on the west coast too gives a chance of latest forecast gives a chance to win the state of the nation study puts on a likelihood of the new times sees on and trump on clear politics national average that including fringe candidates and stein also puts but by only 2 2 percentage poll of polls gives her a slightly more comfortable cushion of v read on the polls and what they telling is leading the polls the day before not a clear or read more
to become the 45th president of the united or trump has to win 270 electoral college votes the candidates have spent what feels like 100 years locked in mortal but in the next few hours there will finally be a victor probably if a or a mandatory prepare for constitutional remind me how the electoral college works each state is assigned a certain number of electoral ultimately based on its population has the with 55 seven states north south and have just three electoral votes gets three there are 50 states in the most of these are republican or democrat they vote the same way every time going back at least six elections so the presidential election boils down to just a handful of the 10 or 11 states that have a recent history of selecting both republicans and democrats this is why voters in places such as north and new are subjected to a barrage of television advertising and campaign stops also why you have not seen and trump holding rallies in or twitter how does the us electoral college faces a much more difficult path to victory he needs to win almost all of these swing states to become the next whereas if wins two or she wins the race this is because democrats start from a stronger position there are 18 states plus that have voted for a democrat for president in every election since 1992 that batch amounts to 242 electoral votes there are only 13 states that have voted for a republican in every election since 1992 those states carry just 102 electoral simply wins all the states that have voted for her predecessors in the recent then adds has 29 electoral she is the next president if she loses but and north she will be the next needs to hold on to all the historically republican win states such as and which are usually republican but where he has struggled in the polls and then win enough swing states to tip him over closing et in because now the real fun polls close in eastern and most of of each state are on central so the polls there close at running is the governor of in the past 50 years the state has voted democrat only once for in some states we will know the winner almost immediately after the polls close most news including the rely on the associated press to races is able to announce the winners so quickly because it deploys thousands of people on election night to collect results from counties and locales as they are announced it also uses exit polls and voting history solidly democratic or republican states are likely to be called quickly swing states are likely to take trump drink but trump have to worry about the prospect of a trump presidency a nice way to toast and if you were minded to do so the builder might be to mix up a cocktail as you settle in for the night got cinnamon schnapps and orange juice but the most fun bit is the cotton candy on top it look just like his twitter the cocktail it could be a long or a short one but at this stage we likely do not yet so our advice is to fuel yourself for a not a sprint and you can feed yourself and prominent role in us elections by preparing a chili a more take on your traditional brought to by in the if drinking more than one of you will want to line your rolling you always get what you want a perfect to election given that both candidates are incredibly unpopular with the public trump likes the rolling stones and played this song at his rallies the rolling stones do not like and asked him to stop he et ends in three key swing and new a minimal number of polling stations may stay open until 29 electoral college votes have proved crucial in the recent past gore can tell you that he narrowly lost the state some still believe he actually won and the election to w despite winning the national popular vote away from the top of the senator and republican presidential candidate is up for he has been running a bit ahead of democrat in the polls who resigned as chair of the democratic national committee in after leaked emails showed the party favoring is expected to comfortably win to was a reliably republican state until won there in 2008 and again in 2012 the mix of rural wealthy federal government employees and military and so on make it difficult to but has been decisively ahead this year new has been won by a democrat in five of the past six presidential elections but the granite state gave trump his first big primary and recent polling here has shown a tight race twitter spice things up states closing at et include south and home state sanders won the democratic primary in by an amazing 73 points but now with has a cocktail called dirty little a vodka martini with hot sauce in a reference to an interview in where said she always carried a bottle of hot sauce you could quip to your friends that a perfect as the race is to heat et close in west north and expect the result from west very quickly trump should win easily north and are swing states and will take longer has been seen as a reliable bellwether voting for the presidential winner in every election since 1964 that run might be coming to an either because of the changing demographics or because of the strangeness of the current in terms of the of both candidates while its demographics are complicated a mix of rust big farmland and more the electorate has grown more white and less educated than the national mean that trend appears to account in part for strength in the buckeye state this the message of love because is was born in you could also make a point about spreading a message of love or of someone pretending to spread a message of love not that in any way at how much politicians love the et the associated press called the result just before which borders in west is seen as the ultimate bellwether it has

militant rebel was shot dead by armed forces and police in a remote village the killing sparked a series of spontaneous demonstrations and in a matter of turned into a reinvigorated popular revolt

on the use of the pellet guns a spokesperson for the representing the described its position to the disapprove of it but we will have to persist with this necessary evil till we find a there is no recorded instance of a modern democracy systematically and willfully shooting at people to blind the statement appeared as a typical the sort of thing that officials must compose and recite with studied ambiguity for the press the as its known but i was struck by its cavalier of state violence and it was obvious that this was not the personal it was a clear articulation of the intent of the state in was an unprecedented expression of state violence there is no other recorded instance of a modern democracy systematically and shooting at people to blind them at the end of according to data

woefully wrong one hoped but the numbers kept piling eye after mutilated eye popping up on the screens of phones and as journalists began to publish their none of the powerful men who run from expressed qualms about the blinding of it became clear that in its hubris the state had decided that snatching vision from a few hundred young people was a fair price to pay for keeping in check perhaps itself blinded by a strain of arrogance peculiar to occupying it continued to pummel a subject population into phrase used in mystic poetry to denote the passion of the translates as the of

nationalist any sense of the basic rights of a suffering population has been eroded or vanished entirely the hostility now appears to be and for those on the receiving unbearable powerful studios urge the state to be more aggressively while actively suppressing or distorting news from one prominent newspaper ran an poll about the continued use of the pellets that had wounded and blinded so many a clear majority voted in support eminent columnists speak calmly of the need for toward civilian protesters to the ruthless response and the twitter account for a government digital posted a poem calling for the army to murder until they images from began to circulate on the despite frequent attempts to block including at least one midnight raid on the offices of a local and a blanket ban on one the reader pictures of the wounded emerged by the many of them looking as though they had ruptured fruits where their eyes should have been on the second day of the more than 50 people were admitted to the main hospital in medics and parents were desperate to save vision in at least one eye for those who had been attempting to extract the jagged and irregular pellets only happens in a a surgeon sent from later said twitter a protester who was shot by security forces in in 2016 protocol for the use of these crowd control weapons is to aim at the legs to disperse demonstrators but it seems that the paramilitaries and the police have been deliberately firing into faces some may only have minor some will suffer limited loss of some will lose one some and some will be impaired for but the pitiless assault on protesting adolescents forces us to ask one is the state happy to blind a is inconceivable that policy mandarins in or their advisers in could be unaware of the destructive power of earlier this the international network of civil liberties and physicians for human rights published a report titled in it an indiscriminate spray of ammunition that spreads widely and cannot be aimed not only likely to be lethal at close but are likely to be inaccurate and indiscriminate at longer even those recommended by manufacturers for countries have banned police from using ammunition meant for hunting animals the spray of pellets was designed to catch prey in flight but many countries have continued to use them as a means of force to control civilian security forces often deploy lethal and ammunition against and weapons have blinded at least five young in the last two years the use of rubber bullets by police was banned in the region of in after at least seven people were blinded by them on the streets of months after the uprising in square that toppled an a young police became infamous for firing pellets into the eyes of protesters against military government his exemplary skill at blinding civilians earned him the nickname the and his notoriety as a symbol of ongoing state brutality eventually led to a jail prosecute its own eye or outlaw the use of these the present every kind of other is a suspicious a scapegoat for any failure that befalls the politicians determined to make great the secessionist the impure the traitorous the woman who speaks her the the dissenting writer any voices who might call for a ban on these guns are certain to be ignored to the ministers and and their demagogues and have continued to advocate the use of both pellets and bullets against protesting crowds in unruly cattle must be reined in at any have become accustomed to the violence inflicted on them as they are to the indifference of the world when pellets were first sprayed at protesters in the heated summer of most people processed this as nothing more than a new just another element of the war in if one were to draw a diagram of the assaults inflicted on bodies over the hardly a single part would remain in the when the violence was at its the eyes were now they seem to have become a target the victims of such consciously and cultivate reserves of tolerance for but also a capacity to too i grew up amid the darkness of the late and early i remember that most of us teenagers innately understood that being or beaten with batons and rifle butts by an trooper was a bit of a joke when compared to the horrors that others endured in the dungeons of of the most notorious torture papa ii a building on the banks of lake in was refurbished and and served as the stately residence of the late politician mufti his as the current chief now presides over the of another generation of remember that the war in those years taught us to treat corpses and shrouds as reminders of passing which was measured for the young in massacres and assassinations i the tragic rupture in the body politic when an atmosphere of fear and loathing forced out the a minority that had cohabited with for centuries in an almost overnight many of them targeted and killed by separatist militants who runs an for the welfare of the past 20 we estimate that 650 were killed in the i know what happened to and my childhood mates from the primary school we all attended near an idyllic river bend in in south i experienced a bleak as response to the uprising included the grotesque policy of and under which combatants and alike were dispatched in summary executions or tortured to death and i remember such a vengeful assault on ordinary people as we are seeing now buoyed by a belligerent nationalist at the helm in the security forces on the ground perhaps feel emboldened to unleash a more widespread an affecting photo essay by journalist in the new times documented a few of the stories of those who had been blinded by pellets it remains a grim testament to the darkness in even though the blindings at that amid hundreds did not attract too much notice at the hardly any civil society group or human rights thought fit to speak up about such a wicked crime the wanton of the a project that some media in take particular pleasure was perhaps fully even then it certainly is when fed on a daily diet of nationalist take to social media to celebrate the and blinding of young the government in a collection of local elites comprising career and loyal to considers pellet guns a might make us feel grateful at least they acknowledge the part perhaps to address their own guilty few days into this the a local reported that the local government had deployed a fleet of brand new ambulances to securely ferry visiting to picnic spots in the valley this was while protesters were being maimed and blinded and while the ambulances carrying them to hospitals were coming under fire from security forces twitter victims of police shooting who have been blinded in one or both eyes in hospital in ophthalmologist at the main hospital in told the express in the first time the foreign bodies are irregular which causes more damage once it strikes the sharp i had assumed that the pellets fired at protesters like rubber or plastic were round things it turns out that there exist different kinds of and in some forces are using the jagged variety which inflict greater damage to flesh and eyes and which doctors say is far more difficult to did get how is it all right for a constitutionally democratic and modern nation to blind scores of civilians in a region it not an authoritarian not a crackpot not a rogue nation or warlord outside of legal and ethical commitments to international but a democratic a member of the comity of nations how are thinkers and its thundering televised custodians of public and private all untroubled by the sight of a child whose heart has been penetrated by metal this is the kind of cruelty we expect from not the largest such an inhuman response to an uprising to mass dissent has been the province of empires and tyrants a modern democratic nation rarely unleashes such except upon victims whom it does not regard as its own people it is quite clear that for and its have been subjects and not citizens for as long as have refused rule you do not shower projectiles that target eyes and viscera on a people you consider your own in snatching away the vision of the state has decisively announced that it has only one a hubris derived from its might and military dominion over the state convinces itself that it has the power to inflict blindness in no it blinds itself too to the character of democracy that is its central founding principle the harsh repression of the economist sen declared in is biggest blot on is hard not to see this mood of brutality at the very least in its to the larger register of extreme by both state and that has come to be over the last couple of has been some dissent in even some have written elegiac columns and essays on the savage response to the rebellion in they have implored their government to cease the to be and to talk to but it appears that the clouded by a newfound chauvinism and a hunger for is in no mood to listen to the voices of sanity in only a few days after forces in murdered a watchman by firing 300 pellets into his body from close the prime minister used a speech on to taunt over its own atrocities against separatists in the province of where the army has inflicted forced disappearances and summary executions on the people forgets that it bombs its own citizens using fighter he said but chose to forget that his own forces by killed scores of young need to interrogate the circumstances that have led to the deliberate blinding of hundreds of young people at the hands of armed forces in before this too is forgotten as some of the wounded have begun to some accounts have suggested that the damage may have been less severe than initially feared that perhaps many of those who underwent eye surgery will regain in at least one eye this might make one feel better relieved that its not worse but there is something wrong with that kind of moral akin to the security officials who continue to maintain that pellet guns must be used because the alternative would be worse one security official told an news website that pellet guns had actually is unfortunate that there have been eye injuries but the pellets are less lethal than getting hit by we might what if the armed forces stationed in had fired live bullets but this in the security forces have already killed nearly 100 civilians is that an acceptable a year or as and continue to harp on their there will arrive a season of surface calm a to in people will marry off their and celebrate an they will also welcome tourists in their blighted when this new

when will we know the us goes to the polls on results will start to come in on from about in when some states close their polling stations on the eastern seaboard of the us some states with clear majorities for or trump will be called very quickly depending on how close it is and how certain key states the final result could be known anywhere between and the early evening bear in mind that in is midnight in new so it is likely that and trump will speak to supporters sometime late afternoon be getting results from and from around noon though it may take a while to know who has won in either place if trump pulls off a surprise in he will be in a strong position the result in will be a big indicator one way or the followed by new and north many states will call early at about will win if going to win the this could put her ahead on the day for the first time we may well have a result by twitter how does the us electoral college is the us electoral of it has nothing to do with schools or universities it is not a building or a but rather a way of counting votes in the presidential state is worth a certain number of electoral college votes if a candidate wins a then that candidate wins all of that electoral college votes my year with covering a curiosity that became a dark phenomenon read number of electoral college votes a state gets is based on its population size a state gets a vote for each of its house of representatives districts plus two votes for its two senators the more people in a the more members of the house of representatives it has and the more electoral college votes it has 55 north has has has and so on there are 538 electoral college votes in total that means the first candidate to reach 270 electoral college votes wins the presidential election there have been cases in which there is an electoral college in when finally emerged as and more in the sitcom veep in a tie would likely look more like the latter than the former is it possible to win the popular vote but not the electoral college just as labor under won the popular vote in the 1998 election but win a majority in the a presidential candidate in the us can win the popular vote but fall short in the electoral college vote this has happened four times in us 1888 and when w bush beat gore in the electoral college despite losing the popular vote can trump really voters in could have crucial role in tight us election race read he could though it looking likely in the past week lead has largely off the back of the announcement that it was reopening an investigation into her email server some national polls have even showed trump drawing even with her but has consistently led in the electoral and many polls project her electoral college result at 270 or more most polls now project trump at 200 to 215 electoral college making his task of winning 270 more difficult a blue state and what is a red the 2000 election the us media have used the red and blue to depict how states are likely to vote democratic states are shown in blue republican states are shown in red because red is usually the of the and blue is traditionally the of the right if i look at one of those electoral college it looks as though trump is winning everywhere a sea of red going on is winning a lot of states but many of the states he is winning are not full of people so they have small numbers of electoral college votes by has a of including new and are swing and which ones are states are like marginal seats the ones on a knife edge that can swing between the two parties sometimes they are referred to as purple states mixture of red and swing states to watch in this election are north and new only needs to win all the blue states plus one of these swing states to win the whereas trump needs to win all the red states and all of these swing states to reach 270 do actually there is no consistent method of voting across the with each state running their elections polling hours will vary by city or county as well some states use paper as does some use electronic where it looks as though the voter is using an three states and conduct voting by mail for though in voters also have the option of attending a polling us election how much do you remember from the presidential read states use punch card where the voter uses an implement to punch a hole through the ballot which is then read by a device first time i voted in a us election from the state of mailed me a punch a pad and a metal spike so i could cast my this form of voting gave rise to the term a in when result was challenged on a number of bases including whether a vote was valid if the punch seem to go all the way through the only voting for are voting for a wide range of measures and local tax levies for should the county impose a tax to provide more funds to the local state should the state county officials such as coroners and dog catchers judges they elect judges in governors states are voting for governors this state legislators voting for your state all 435 members of the federal house of elected every two 34 federal voting for your local state federal government and in several state and local plebiscites all at the equivalent of what are voting for tomorrow a democracy the difference between senate and the the congress is the general term for the entire legislature the house of representatives is like the lower house in and the senate is like our senate that it is an upper it may or may not have its own quirky la rod and the republicans are likely to control the house of mainly because the state legislatures get to draw their own boundaries and have ensured the districts are as friendly as possible to the republican democrats may well control the senate it is on a knife edge if it is tied at then the casts the deciding vote meaning the presidential election and the senate election are two to watch in tandem so tired of hearing about emails just give me the

not recommend charges against her email issues pale in comparison to w who 22 million emails he kept as president on a private email server but the controversy has dogged as it fed a perception that she was not an honest person last 11 days from the the announced it was reopening the email investigation based on newly discovered that is emails on another computer lead substantial at that point took a blow this week 48 hours from election day the has announced that it reviewed these new emails and uncovered no new and thereby stands by its recommendation that should not be charged with any crime twitter campaign that email investigation has been this means in terms of voting intentions is hard to say should she at least start her presidency with a investigation into her emails still hanging over her are three facts i can wheel out impressively on ways the us election could play out read did you know is the of us it is the ultimate bellwether it has voted with the us president in every election since 1964 this year population is older and whiter than previously and will probably vote for trump it is likely that for the first time in more than 50 years will go with the party that win the did you know that us territories get to vote in the primaries but not the general people in and the virgin islands get to vote for who should be the candidate but they get no say on who

the canyon creek complex fire advanced along a canyon leading to john destroying homes in the process the in last palmer deputized 11 grant county residents to draft a natural resources plan for land management such a developed outside county is in keeping with patriot tactics of establishing bodies which are intended to function as shadow governments pushing their own agenda the plan calls for negotiations between the united states and the county a in determining public land not mere consultation this means the county is seen as having equal or greater authority than the federal government one of those to write the plan was of prairie city told the guardian that the plan was intended for in the coordination which is federal law and allows local government agencies to have a meaningful say in these land use describes the writing committee as adding that supports us because he knows right and the group was and neither elected not formed by any recognized process members wanted to put it to a but county commissioners rejected believes that if the plan were put to a it would be successful why seeing so much of a push against our he claims the plan was shot down by commissioners

between palmer and the federal government in he terminated a contract with the forest service which had seen deputies patrolling federal land in exchange for payments and the use of forest service

consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall for the erection of and other needful in the patriot movement believe that these are the only purposes for which the federal government can acquire land national wildlife reserves and public land they simply unconstitutional it is also the same fragment quoted by the occupants of the national wildlife refuge to underpin their demands that the federal government hand over control of public lands to in the letter also cites issues as a reason for breaking off the agreement like the palmer attributes the decline of grant and by extension the western to the refusal of federal agencies to allow unbridled economic exploitation of public public break between palmer and arose from the decision to write a letter to the local newspaper disagreeing with the decision not to renew that contract palmer put him on administrative leave the truth involves a bigger story grant county is in the an area stretching from northern to which has suffered from the disappearance of logging and milling jobs over the last four militias recruiting in fear of winning activists say read every county in rural has shown some degree of recovery from the depths of the last recession but according to figures from office of economic employment in grant county peaked in and is still around down on with very few signs of some timber belt towns have increased in size as retirees and others move grant demographics look a lot more typical of the rest of rural in 1980 there were 8 , 210 people in 2035 projected there will be just while as a whole will have practically doubled its population to almost five million over the same county is still dependent on its remaining timber mill as a private sector but the future may be even bleaker than its immediate past environmental protections and more stringent management of public lands have played some role in but only some more efficient cheap the disappearance of the of old growth and the decline of the us labor movement have also badly affected the logging complex misfortune heightens the temptation to blame federal agencies for local says less unemployment people want to blame so they blame the forest to the disappearance of timber jobs from the on led many mill workers to leave town this tipped the balance further toward conservatism in a now go beyond mere conservatism part of a gathering movement that wants to challenge the very idea of federal public and democrats have few incentives to challenge such candidates in conservative of grant problems come down to the fact that is it a long way from anywhere but versions of this political dynamic are visible to the extent that they have come to define the political landscape of 2016 in the face of change and politicians like him throughout the and the patriot movement as a whole are offering their own version of the promise to make great again there any polls in grant county we know until tomorrow whether people have

trump lies like he at all sometimes in malice and sometimes in and sometimes without any apparent purpose at all the guardian has more than 100 falsehoods made by the republican nominee over the last 150 and sorted them according to has been caught in more than a dozen falsehoods of her for instance about her email practices and her past support for the partnership but often makes her falsehoods in dense making them hard to pin a motive many could as easily be errors as careless exaggeration or deliberately misleading on the other will say when he hears his own quotes his own lawyers met him in pairs to counteract his court documents show he has invented false fictional videos and sex tapes and a nonexistent man named to talk about his sex life months of reveal methods whether he means to

military leaders are always clueless received five deferments from except when they love him we have no idea who refugees or undocumented migrants and they take our jobs know very well who they they include his vision of the us has for one of dystopia he even described the as a crisis worse than the great depression but amid all this desolation trump gains three things he fuels doubt and leaving people he denigrates his opposition en blaming the world on and he raises himself up above the nonexistent wreckage big a man who once took a joke about the size of his hands too trump spends a lot of time trying to look as large as from his worth estimates to crowds at his rallies and his success in meaningless is pierced throughout by paperwork in the guardian found that trump valued a new golf course at in one document and at in a court filing sued to pay lower on the new times reported similarly huge discrepancies in his reported income the post has shown repeatedly that boasts of charitable giving have virtually nothing behind has also falsely bragged of endorsements from federal agencies and claimed environmental and tried the ploy in he has called the millions his father gave him as small and portrayed his loss in 1995 as an example of tax sort of exaggeration is a common sales overstate the value of a product to make it more attractive and assume it will be bargained

independent voters and experts he often cites news stories about and even praised in a presidential debate for catching her in a every trump says the cameras refuse to show his even though his campaign forces cameras to stay within a small where they pan to show the crowd as anyone at his rallies or watching can see only one camera at each event stays fixed on the shared whose footage networks share and which stays on trump so as not to miss his a target for criticism from the noted that trump joked in private with reporters about how he understands how the pool camera is a shtick that he does to rile up his she give them an excuse for polls that might not be in his to give them an excuse to berate someone not scorched earth like his attacks on other try to authority and leave only himself in its place but while most still respect other institutions that trump has the press was vulnerable decades of cable news punditry had already diminished opinion of the and the has sapped major newspapers of their powers to compete with openly partisan fake news and social media networks trump tried to fill the fire not most famous false about birthplace and who started is only

and his secret terror and the plot of bankers and the category includes what the dale calls the oddest of falsehoods these claims include an invented letter from the about the authorship of the poem the and that frank hate my way his entire life trump himself seems to get lost in the and sometimes slips into a dadaist jumble of allusions cattle 33 , 000 emails that sound sinister when put together this is apparently the desired a haze of noxious even if no one has found fire for all that smoke for more than 20 journalists and congressional republicans have tried the latter have spent tens of millions of taxpayer dollars investigating the associations and careless email practices but have yet to find criminal conduct arguably worst conspiracy is his insistence that voter fraud has the which merges his fringe claims with his attack on institutions no evidence supports the claim of widespread fraud and the decentralized electoral college makes such a conspiracy functionally impossible but the claim gives trump something to blame failure on besides himself like his other it sows doubt and diminishing the nation so that trump can portray himself as an favorite escape from this maze is the phrase something going which lets trump suggest claim ignorance and say nothing of substance at everything twitter never used language as bad as jay in my cornered by his own quotes

once upon a a long time small children might get told off for being loud or unruly as we called it not so much in cool to be disruptive what every startup in silicon valley is straining to what has done disrupting the hotel industry as has disrupted taxis and amazon has disrupted bookshops and almost everything else two years ago i went to a conference in and met many people claiming to disrupt many in one what no one anticipated was though it may be convenient to summon a motor vehicle to home with a tap of a button or to buy things while wearing and possibly it might also lead to where we are 6 2016 two before the world changes trump is not just an star gone rogue he is not a version of lord sugar he is what happens when technology changes everything wrote the professor at business school who coined the is the mudslide how some scrappy little upstart like overthrew the colossus that once was how some small new technological breakthrough can have trump the breathing version of the scrappy little upstart that overturns an entire industry only this time not an have governments have stood by and watched it take down all industries in its path the market must do what the market must do only the wave is breaking on its what the last week of this presidential campaign has shown us is that technology has is is threatening to upturn the democratic process itself the most most equitable form of governance the world has yet come up many crucial it even matter who wins on because perhaps the best thing you can say about trump is that if it been him it would have been someone else the opposite of the great man theory of a misogynistic star is not the days the same hackers who took down twitter and and the and and last week in the biggest attack of its kind that the world has ever started on a country computer had been used to infect inanimate objects in our homes the connected devices that comprise the of things and been a bit are hopelessly has harnessed these to create a gigantic the and honing its power last week it took aim at an entire country a huge attack was launched against the two companies that own the only going into the west country bringing its entire infrastructure to a worst case that the hackers behind it are for when aim their massed computing power against is everyday objects in our own toasters and refrigerators because this is where we our toasters and refrigerators may be about to be used to subvert the democratic process of the greatest democracy on if that reads like the most lunatic sentence ever you maybe been paying close enough attention to this is the year when it hits home that technology is not just some cool gadget in our pockets the facilitator of the degraded news space that treats facts and lies the same that has enabled thousands of algorithms to scrape the for stories about trump and then was robot accounts that caused to trend after each debate and allowed trump to claim how a man who set foot on the street for four with just his create havoc in the critical last week of the campaign by leaking emails that potentially implicate has inserted himself like computer into the heart of the democratic process infected it he like the law of unintended consequences writ in human we mind the fact that the data he leaked was stolen here in the liberal we championed it because it was stolen data that served to underscore our liberal sensibilities at least mine and not so then technology is neutral there is no left or right there is only hackers and and in reported last earn money via for writing stories about trump and making them go viral on a single town there are at least 140 websites about politics run by kids who make money from fabricated stories teenagers can earn up to a month by making up things about trump they care about trump or or anyone else just worked out what the us public wants to read and have found a way of serving it up to them whether true or best way of making money via is to write and the best the stories that are spread widest and furthest in and are stories about trump more false stories about in 2016 we read the news we want to read the the means by which and give us more of what we or what we already know our searches and our are programmed to reflect our previous searches and is becoming not so much a bubble as a ghetto walled closed not just that search engines have been shown to influence election results the higher up a name is listed in any the more likely they are to win also that the less we know about how other people the less we increasingly living in an echo exposed only to views which chime with our own the impression this gives is that everyone is like thinks like wants to be like most people are not like us maybe what 2016 has come to teach us that and the idea that and are out to make the world a better place is both absurd and matter what mark wants or what intends the people who donated to intend to get the first potential female us president investigated by the nobody wanted their fridge to bring down intend to drive all newspapers out of business just something that is happening along the this the big

your lot from me but fear not because i have match report for hot from the principality stadium as for reading and do join me in just a few hours for v new live from dispel of demise with demolition of wales read more a day to forget for wales and a 12th consecutive loss to a bit more fight in the second half and a try from but in a cohesive attacking it was dross utter dross significant backwards steps have been taken since the summer tour in new they have a habit of starting autumn campaigns slowly but no excuse for the abject in the first half particularly at least put in a shift and can take a bit of too in everyone else nope not after their heaviest defeat by since 2007 and the heaviest against the wallabies in since nothing away from though they were they the fluidity with which they attack is a delight to watch the chasm between the north and south in that sense remains as big as ever ruled the breakdown and as a result had plenty of front foot ball and he had a field day that probably do him justice he was at the level he was when ripping england to pieces last year outside him and also enjoyed themselves and after a difficult will be buoyant that their tour can ensure it finishes on a first grand slam since that may be getting ahead of ourselves a touch and they did leave plenty of points on the pitch but they will head to now full of confidence and deservedly for are the visitors and will that he has and in particular available showed japan no mercy earlier today and if they are in the mood they can be very difficult to leave with dejected wales captain leads his team off the pitch following their 32 8 defeat images 80 cooper is on and flicks an inside pass pounces on a loose ball though so wales have it in the half he looses it forward which rather sums up day wales have it back though and finds who looks for halfpenny out wide a or two but the ball stuck and all she wrote 79 turn the ball over from a scrum love to finish with a flurry considering the amount of points left out there 77 knocks it over from in front of the posts and lead by 24 wales have been improved in the second half but to be honest lead ought to be more 76 yet another get chance for a wales try against that called for cool heads and was promptly butchered to throw in wales have it and are finishing the but as soon as i say that picks off a loose pass from and scampers clear been excellent and deserves his try is congratulated by after scoring fifth try images 75 almost gets there a massive overlap on the right wales take it until too late but they have it again on the left whips the pass on and it looks like is over in the corner the will decide it be a after a brilliant tackle from the replacement nick 72 another going to be reset are making sure that if wales are going to score a going to take plenty of time out of the clock 71 should score there or at least have found the telling pass back to the scrum wales are on they have a no penalty try just yet 69 clear their thanks in no small part to a bruising carry from and wales will have a on the wallabies line makes his first real mark with a lightning pass to who pins back his is he going to get no he makes a great cover tackle wales still have it but find a way through they have a penalty though and take the scrum 68 hits hill and wales get a bit of a drive going picking up and wales are on the move but it goes to ground and a bit given a which prompts to hook slipper replaces him 67 penalty for wales though for putting his hand on the floor so kicks for the corner now or never 66 back underway with a scrum on for puts in things really going for wales and when accidentally runs into an scrum is receiving oxygen the replay shows a horrible he really rolled his ankle more bad news for wales an extended break while receives treatment so have an email from a kiwi in sorry to say it but wales are just not good enough what exactly do and north they are both exceptionally for some bizarre reason real lack of skills and attacking nous in this welsh 65 wales have turned it over on halfway has taken a whack to the head and staggers he needs to go off for does indeed go on comes son of for his debut is receiving some treatment he looks in a lot of pain hill is also on for his debut in the second row 63 halfpenny completely shanks the conversion from both sides today has been pretty shocking seventeen minutes to go and wales trail by 17 62 north is is on north look best pleased as he trudges off have it inside the wales half but kick is charged down and has a dart down the left wales are up to the almost wriggled through has and something for wales fans to cheer at of wales gathers his own kick ahead to score his first try images 59 better for wales after a from a naughty one at that has the chance to get some territory he duly does that wales change their front row so throws to on the made a ear of it though 57 tugs the conversion lead by 22 in 2007 they won by 31 points in and that could well be improved upon here and in terms of biggest wins in they won by 35 points at the 1991 world cup 56 goes himself and is hammered by have turned it over trouble has it in his and the dashes all the way to the line in the corner set and match celebrates scoring a try henry 54 a forward pass off the scrum means wales will have the on right in the middle of the pitch an opportunity to build predicting to take the ball from and smash nearly but pops an inside pass to halfpenny it was telegraphed though but wales will try again 52 wales are improved in the second half if there is to be any way back though they must score next and they must do it soon need the ball to do that though and after gets in it stays in hands scrum time once more 50 very scrappy but come back for a welsh scrum time 49 wales eventually clear their boots it out near halfway so be an better from working the ball from one side of the pitch to the other best player by a distance makes a thumping hit on and things are getting scrappy for 47 wales still have through up the then on the left but isolated charges again wales are into the half and up to the line quick hands find north on the right but he runs out of and turn it over 46 wales win it collects and launches one for to chase but collects with effortless ease blusters up the middle but picks off a offload a chance for wales to attack but is stopped in his tracks 44 wales make a mess of the and after a scrappy period of north is adjudged to have taken the ball out so an just inside the wales half on the left 43 are into the wales threatening try but wales are let off the hook when are for crossing kicks to halfway in a notably quiet principality stadium 42 finds himself on the right wing wales are at least hanging on to the ball but they look so ponderous in comparison to halfpenny injects a bit of life as pops up on the left wing but made precisely no and force the turnover 41 kicks us off is on for a glimmer a light for wales kicks long so wales have it near halfway are back out for the second half wales follow ears still ringing the decline of rugby has been greatly exaggerated any suggestions that the wallabies were there for the new the north were closing in on the have proved to be utter poppycock have played with a speed and accuracy that wales simply cannot live with some of the wales defending has been abject but the wallabies have toyed with the scored three excellent tries through hodge and and if who has been magical with ball in hand had his shooting boots on it could be worse wales should have seen it coming warned that would be targeting the breakdown and the speed at which they are recycling possession is meat and drink for and wales are defending too narrow and hodge and are having a field for they should be further behind much further they be as bad as this in the second can will be reading the riot act at present and wales always begin the autumn rusty a rousing comeback is then 40 boots long and then fields the return from has a dart in his own half but get very far so goes long again and picks out are on the march again this could be curtains for wales it gets to five out but the ball hits the deck and breathe 38 sashays his way into the wales half and are on the front foot again a bit of respite for wales got advantage rather tellingly says going so be back for a scrum nick of receives the ball from images 36 finally finds his nailing the hardest of the three conversions wales often look rusty at the start of the autumn but defensively they have been as impressive as have been 35 carries over the 22 though and some more stardust from finds who throws a dummy and cruises over into the corner too easy far too easy will be seething scores a try 34 from the resulting have won another penalty and again who has an enormous right finds touch he quite reached the wales 22 though but will threaten again 32 a first aerial bomb from and it causes all manner of problems he hold it and wales pile forward a little overeagerly though and north gives away a penalty with under pressure 31 but halfpenny is off target a bad miss from halfpenny when wales really could have done with the points halfpenny lines up a kick at goal via images 30 the contrast in styles of attack is remarkable wales are not exactly subtle about it but they have earned a penalty pinged for being offside halfpenny will go at goal 29 rare possession now for wales so does and going backwards though 28 shoves his conversion again so the difference is 10 points

privacy we get is through social pupils often discuss social networking their attractions and but this is the first time they have turned their scrutiny on their own parents and yet parents are the object of an increasingly aggressive interrogation this spring a mother from called out her bullying on only for the post to go the criticism of her became so intense she removed it and changed her page and phone number next came the mother from whose photographs of her daughter in tiny high fashion outfits attracted an following that included until critics claimed the woman was her baby she has since locked the account and gone to ground after her came the father who nakedly cradled his feverish baby in the an image his wife snapped and before removed it as sharing about your children has long incited but recently the disapproval has begun to acquire a tinge in police warned parents against posting photos of their children on social according to social media analyst the children could soon be able to sue them for posting inappropriate under the privacy laws the treasurer of the human rights lawyers echoes the idea that it is only a matter of time before children mount legal challenges against parents imagine it not being something that starts to develop within the next five to 10 she says see how there be attempts at suing people for putting up posts that unhappy one day my hair was all sticking up all over my auntie put it on i was so embarrassed i parents may shrug off the shaming stories and the sharing of family such as the the the as beyond the range of their own moderate social media activity but listen to the children in the classroom and it becomes clear how many degrees there are of shame to these even small instances of sharing can be divisive when i ask if anyone has experienced being hands shoot but the answers are a long way from the public shaming that normally grabs headlines they are exactly the sort of infringements that many parents will commit without a second was eating a subway chicken eating that and my mum just took the picture and posted it on one pupil i was little my parents took a picture of me being three weeks ago they posted it on me on the toilet it was really another was with my aunt in the park i was wearing my scarf but i have a pin it flew off and my hair was all sticking up all over the place my auntie put it on i was so embarrassed i was crying i asked her to take it down but she it looks uncle posted when his daughter had for raises her hand love to post things about personal information that you might not she says kind of affects your relationship with them when you want to speak to them about certain worried they might post classmate stands up her team supports the motion on the that parents should be banned from posting and they have an idea want to pass a law that requires open forms of social media to put a consent button on their so a child can report whether their parents have posted about them without she declares parents refuse to they will be fined the amount of suggestions may sound excessive and in fact they lie squarely within the recommendations made by a number of adults campaigning in this field idea of a for echoes the attempts by a democratic state representative in la k to make the shaming of children on social networking sites an offending parents should face a he has just like would be a fine paid directly to the child as for the apparently idea of a this sounds uncannily similar to the proposed by the campaign steered by the peer and to protect and empower children the irritation chimes with research published in march by a team at the university of after interviewing 249 pairings across 40 us the researchers found that children were more than twice as likely as parents to say that adults should not post information about them without permission would the children class rings with shouts going to their miss one of her students cries a thing called wishful is children are unlikely to gain control over their posting habits but there is still scope for a conversation about what constitutes fair and each family will draw its lines differently consider the case of heather the photographer and teaching assistant who took the photograph of her husband and son in the shower that like saw the and the as the height of parental care their had had a temperature for hours her was trying to cool the fever for two kept the image finally posting it in may after removed other pictures she had shared of her children she wanted to take a show that just innocent pictures that people are twisting and getting offended was unprepared for the response for the way in which removed images from her page every time it received sufficient for the level of disapproval the image including claims that it was or but stand had one other unexpected consequence as the interested and the outraged followed the link to her some began to question the as well as the of showing children naked just thought you were free to post what you wanted on the says now but then she discovered that in the state of show any naked images of pelvic area or and i i was technically breaking a removed the everything but the moral i feel done anything wrong not exploiting my children not abusing my children just sharing our lives exactly how they she saw how many pictures there were of her and she like it now any time you see it is with her experience shows just how nebulous and fraught the territory of sharing can be her experience would never befall those for whom posting naked images of children is strictly out of bounds but the case of is complicated she and her partner are raising their children not be ashamed or embarrassed of their they are living within the boundaries they have set for themselves show nudity a lot of times because they think it will have a negative impact on their child your footprint is for ever on the says absurd i just hope to combat that a little who knows how it will actually turn but i hope that my children ever look back and see pictures of themselves as children and feel embarrassed by other people seeing them as well because there is nothing to be embarrassed the toddler in the is still too young to veto or cherish the photograph that caused such but his older sister according to her mother really wrap her head around why people would think there was anything wrong with while lily was comfortable with the image of her baby she was deeply unhappy with other photographs her mother had uploaded the apparently harmless kind that many parents post one day at around the age of lily began to scroll through her saw how many pictures there were of her and she like says for whenever lily saw with the she hid really opened up a conversation about why i take why i share who i share pictures time you see it is with her a researcher at the school of believes we are entering a crucial moment are starting to see kids who have grown whose parents have shared and who are beginning to a minute not sure comfortable with what families she is a conversation after it was lily at who instigated the with her mother that earned her the right to veto content does lily have advice for other should take any pictures of me it makes me she says might change my mind one but today i want to have to hide from your soon this chat might become as standard as the one about the birds and the bees sees nothing to fear both she points are united by being the first generation of parents and children to negotiate this path can be a really shared she says enthusiastically dilemmas are shared the pleasures are shared pleasures a moment of who has says she is a person who advises total protection i certainly share things about your children important that parents are able to claim their own space about that to need this has always seen her sharing in those feel i share everything as my story this is my perspective on my life as a mother with these children not trying to put words in their or tell the story from their is one of the oldest questions of who does the story belong and countless others believe they are telling their own and sharing posts about their children where they fit that perspective but complicated never had a filter says sounding forlorn love the idea of having connections with other mothers and people but i share the way i used after the she is still fathoming whether to photograph differently or simply stop sharing other such as the author who has written about her commitment to post nothing about her daughter the same process of consideration deters them from sharing altogether they have the big conversation with each sometimes their children and decide the best answer is the guardian asked readers about their who is 30 and lives in the north of i started to my own i began to feel intensely uncomfortable how could i in her a principle of privacy when i had essentially devalued hers from the she stopped posting we post is facets of said a teacher in whose includes a chapter on think there is a morality to using children to explore parts of ourselves my children are not me they are who says she has never interacted with her children on social networking sites are now 19 and thinks that her reflects the idea that is inappropriate when the whole point of the journey to adulthood is to to work out who you what your values how going to fit in i think we have not thought hard enough about what that process might be if so much is shared and so much is are three issues she says is the right to a certain sort of privacy the second is the need of young people to transgress and bump into their and for that to be somewhat safe the third is the need to break away from the model of your own posts dried up as i researched this article of i can ask my children for but i am not sure they are ready for a responsibility with permanent consequences if an consents to a is it fair to act upon that or should a parent how those feelings might after posts are eternal and a child cannot speak for his or her future any a consent can be even within one given day my at would prefer her photo not to appear on but would be more than happy to see a video of herself playing on my says he is sad that know even the teenagers at are conflicted in the they vote against suggestion of a fine for parents who share without their but they squirm in their clawing the air for a turn to speak when i ask what rules they would lay down for their say embarrassing jokes too far as the world is not pictures of me when i look post baby pictures unless happy and fully ever comment on my stalk my profile waiting for me to load add me or my tell dad take pictures of me eating my friends take it out of try and use slang on our wall on your profiles you can embarrass yourselves all you but when on our profiles it looks like taught you to say that and it makes us look really behind the every family is different in a quiet in newton with sunlight pouring into the molly and her son roman are sitting on the sofa discussing their experience of going with roman desperately unhappy at molly posted a plea on her page for his parents to send her birthday cards have any friends and often cries himself to the post began it was shared around the world 40 , 000 molly says her post breaks only the second of the by disclosing that molly and roman are molly nor nor his two nor his dad who says he hates social were prepared for what happened next thousands of people left birthday greetings at the office of a friend whose address was hastily borrowed to protect privacy cards and gifts began to arrive molly the chaos into a cards for roman were and some of them have lasted to the extent that in a year after his plea for roman celebrated his 12th birthday with 150 strangers and friends at a in and at a second party in they have even met up with in twitter molly whose post about her loneliness went with some of the birthday cards he was sent by strangers all over the world for the molly tells this talking quickly because there is a lot to fit roman scurries to and fro with his a star wars chess set from someone in the pictures from schoolchildren says he is very big in wicker baskets of sometimes molly worries bit i what happens in years to come if he himself and finds boy with no last year the local paper ran a headline saying just that oh my what have i roman was with and comforted her it is he said am really the the benefits of post are visible each day his tearfulness has declined the whole household is happier molly herself has in the a community that makes her feel supported and in needs her now got a says a strange he himself has never read the initial usually declines to appear in and thinks that when it comes to best to err on the side of molly tells her community that roman is having a bad or that she she want to pretend to people who know loneliness that loneliness happen and as difficult to know sometimes what roman really thinks about leads the way up to to show more of the gifts people sent there is bond notepaper from the actor who played the baddie in and a crew from star episode wonder if roman minds thousands of strangers knowing sad you molly asks him you mind that people know you get really roman replies know go i like like molly that people around the world know you are like it she asks molly says she sounds just feels it roman tells molly has publicly revealed aspects of her emotional life that other parents might hesitate to she is not incautious for months she withheld full name and has only recently felt comfortable disclosing that he is autistic before her heartfelt she deleted baby pictures of older brother because he was about to start secondary surely the debaters would and heather molly has rules about whether appropriate if in a year or five years your child would be embarrassed by anything done and just why are you actually doing is it a positive or is it to give you a social boost as opposed to the molly might appear to be at the opposite end of the spectrum from who never but the morals that underpin their are remarkably alike and while molly thinks be posting pictures of kids in the in some ways her posts are as exposing as that evening molly emails to say that the conversation with roman had troubled her after left the she offered to take down the she but roman said not to out he was confused in his room and was talking about not liking being and not his maybe in that wished no one knew he was lonely when his mother he minded less or maybe he understands that the community his mother has created has benefited him and his family but these are only guesses it is impossible to know he is and the world changes many times a day his parents have his best interests at but like any who share news of their every time they they cross a line between privacy and publicity where each parent sees the line is an question for and others like the truth may be something they are still working or simply prefer not to gone after a few glasses of wine and said things i parents and children talk social media twitter posts can be really star with her browning for the a pa and and her youngest daughter a live in had a account for about 10 so was probably seven when i first joined i use it to keep in touch with different groups of people old my poetry the puppet show i work with also friends with a lot of my because often the best way of locating where mine are i think it bothers them all their friends are happy to come to the house and sit around my kitchen table and so i think odd i post on their pages maybe just a message but really impressed by the sorts of things they share about politics very funny and have definitely made mistakes gone on after a few glasses of wine and said things i have there have been some angry messages about the state my kids and their friends have left the house in and they have all asked me to take down various photos i get sensitive to the fact that trying to be cool or think past the stage of worrying too much about embarrassing my kids i write poems that are very and i share them on but how i express myself the kids have occasionally living your life on but an open all fairly streetwise we have a very open in our house they have occasionally posted things that i think are a bit questionable showing off a bit about drinking with their that sort of thing i might have you might want to think about but never that glad around to record my teenage though hate my siblings and i all use in different ways posts a lot of likes to talk about stuff me and post a lot of news and i like posting videos or songs i like to put up personal or get too emotional on my posts can be really the i really want to be friends with her on i really want her seeing pictures of me that my friends had posted they anything they just felt like a bit of my life that was separate from her now i mind as much more open also friends with a lot of my friends on there not a except that quite free with what she writes something would happen between and put it in a and post it to and i wondered whether my friends would see her in a different way i think maybe i felt protective of her but no one has ever said has a lot of photos of us when we were little when i was a bit i hated seeing some of them i remember there was one where i was holding my pet hamster and i just thought i looked greasy and rough and once my room was really messy and my mum take pictures and put it on i would have hated it if actually done it now a bit learned to let go of it all a bit more i think with out there about me twitter feel like the same person i was when i was her lewis khan for the a marketing and events and live in with father and her brother 10 been before one of my followers on someone i turned on then a couple of others who thought were friendly were making comments on my posts it and i sure how to handle it in school they give you lessons about what to do if it happens to but when it comes to the reality is very different but the school did deal with i became a lot more careful about who i accept as and what people can see now i have one account for my photography and a separate one for my closest have looked briefly at but i have a clue about how works i think i mind that there are photos of me if you know the people that can see those then if not not so sure about that but i find it embarrassing maybe because i feel like the same person i was when i was little it feel as if those pictures are of the was a harrowing time for but what was good was that some of her friends were supportive and took of the comments as proof of what was happening was worried i would be so she come to me until after it was over it was but in a i think it helped her understand what exposed to is a great and she sends me but i check that she is happy before i post anything on your children have every right to veto what you put although they have to be a certain age before they understand what it means neither of mine have ever had an issue with something but then the generation that are used to having photos of themselves everywhere i think it meant something different for my generation it took so long to get photos developed that seeing yourself was so much more children were very little when i first signed up i remember thinking much about privacy then it until i read in the paper how posts about your children might be seen by complete strangers that i changed my time went i began to feel uncomfortable about posting it felt like everything was becoming more about how wonderful i and it made me feel quite down so i left for a while eventually i rejoined because it was hard to keep up with everything so now started again but in

actually have been awoken this year by rhetoric the bad news is that the such a vital element in the coalition built by in his two successful presidential is relatively sluggish this time as is turnout for young voters the fall in black turnout could be especially perilous for in swing states such as north which has been identified by both candidates as a key early voters change their as

england need to sort out the way they play and the way they deploy it cook had three slow bowlers but showed little faith in and set fields that just gave away easy singles so history is and history is invoked by our resident paraphrase admiral at he seems to be something wrong with our the astonishing thing about this victory is not that it but that it came so fast england were 100 0 at and with making an electric first test fifty the first ball after got a and then stood tall and lured england into one of their great collapses they lost all ten wickets for 64 in 22 3 overs staggering stuff is plumb and the teenage wonder has given his country their first win over england he may also have given the rest of the world a laugh but this win was no and a drawn series is the right result 45th england 163 9 target 273 a pattern has already established itself for this takes a comfortable single half way through the and uses his long reach to see out the rest if they can just keep it up for a couple of england will be fine 44th england 162 9 target 273 has been formidable for the past four but this is surely beyond him 43rd england 161 9 target 273 was poor at the start of this but he has had the last laugh three of them in one over and that from was phenomenal writes last decade has been tough as a supporter of arsenal and the giddy highs there are always unspeakable every silver lining has a welcome to tiger great series look forward to me but england may be dreading it sees off one ball but cope with the clipping to leg and falling to a superb catch from nominal at short leg that was 161 9 and england still need more than a hundred history is beckoning to scholar and has to see off a from wit six men round the bat he manages propping forward solidly sent in ahead of after his has gone straight stone and i am running out of exclamation marks given first and he looks a goner no doubt this time stokes b flummoxed by the flight england sinking fast 42nd england 157 6 target 273 we already have a test again the suspense is delicious stokes saved by the flick of ball on which means he technically hit it you make it up given he reviews looks stokes goes down the track to fails to reach the pitch of the and still lofts it over immense 41st england 150 6 target 273 when the hundred came england were right on top now they are in a tight corner and a desperate scrap can the dominant personality of the series so dig them stokes reprieved by off his own bowling a tricky falling in front of but catchable 40th england 149 6 target 273 stokes tries to live up to

england are and are now hot an email from message from my dad that happy to share as it demonstrates both cleanliness and had quick lost 2 if you count as a 37th england 137 5 target 273 stokes survives an appeal from not that it bothers him he then goes for a reverse sweep and but gets away with it and drinks seldom has an hour belonged so utterly to one five 37 mostly mayhem but can finish england as they narrowly failed to do in the heart says the head says probably 36th england 136 5 target 273 drops short and stokes pounces with a stylish pull for four he is happy to take up the gauntlet thrown down by 35th england 129 5 target 273 stokes chops out a then keeps out the rest and nicks the strike with a handsome push to the cover sweeper england have the personality to rescue this the question is whether they have the asks john the partnership going to rescue england 34th england 127 5 target 273 now has four wickets in this spell and ten in the match the one that got cook seem to do but rob key spots that it was a slower ball an ball teenage kicks are not what they were no doubt this as cook pokes straight to silly point and perishes to a juggling catch 127 5 and appear to be racing to their first test victory over england but stokes and so effective may have other ideas 33rd england 126 4 stokes target 273 after surviving fifth cook plays and misses at the sixth when was england were making a molehill out of a mountain now making a minefield cook survives by a again fabulous drama for against who could be in trouble 32nd england 124 4 stokes target 273 so a maiden from who is having a spectacular debut series 16 wickets at and he is only 19 but cook is still there and england have a batting order has to go it was clipping leg well bowled and four wickets for 24 since tea another classic england collapse of england leaves the field after being dismissed by images given he reviews nightmare continues as he somehow turns a long hop into a leading edge and hands a simple catch to the man at game absolutely on test not so much 31st england 124 2 target 273 cook trundles on 30th england 118 2 target 273 so calm has broken out but are still in with a very good answer to and england supporters tweets guy have i cook plays a studious tuck into the leg side for and his 52nd test fifty but his first of this series cometh the cometh the chef

gone for 20 if had still been with us 26th england 110 2 target 273 high drama in that may have been the moment this test turned on mutter the and although a never been truer the one that got root was only brushing leg the one that get cook was only just missing it umpire and he took a long time to raise the finger and cook survives it was missing leg great review given sweeping at he reviews 25th england 108 2 target 273 in comes been hopeless so far to be he is just as busy as looking for and he has already outlasted him can almost says guy is feeling right pinned by arm ball root could have reviewed but perhaps cowed by abysmal reviewing earlier out for 1 and game on 24th england 105 1 root target 273 is but his spirit remains root is instantly into the gap at wide for a and cook gets four more with yet another sweep be before long first ball after gets a grubber from and bowled england 100 1 still a fine innings and a great start to the run chase and that sinking feeling
tony former editor has a nickname for him was how put it in the new director faces fury for cryptic letter about email inquiry read there have been many behind the rise and rampage of trump included the republican with its years of divisiveness and racially charged the with its collective chase of the next shiny and the baby feeling the cultural and economic ground give it was who sparked this strange political creature into life as the ghostwriter of bestselling 1987 book the art of the he did more than anyone to create the public persona in it he translated coarse ramblings into charming straight talk and came up with the phrase which captures brilliantly an approach to business and politics in which everything is the the most beautiful helped give trump the sweet smell of success now seemingly irresistible to millions of people clinging to the been he says the nearly 30 years after the book was the main thing i felt i want to be as far away from this man as i but i feel i created because he was a real estate developer and reality television star who it that consequential to the building on the foundation of the art of the trump spent a decade hosting the reality show the reinforcing his image as a preternatural businessman with the power to say blurring the boundaries between reality and reality just as he would throughout the presidential many supporters say they trust him to run like a the business of is business it was no coincidence that he launched his presidential campaign at trump a marbled cathedral of capitalism in he is a man who is a chameleon and have any core beliefs beyond his own and simply think that much about it until he decided to run for president and it became clear that this going to just fade that he was actually in a position to win the nomination when i my contributed to creating the public image of the man who is and people he were writing the art of the deal call it told the in an interview that broke decades of silence on the matter certainly felt a kind of moral imperative to step in and say what i knew about a man i considered to be so and i am very relieved that i trump he observed was vulgar and a narcissistic liar with a short attention no appetite for reading books and an business record a trump presidency he lead to martial the end of press freedom and the risk of nuclear dangerous worse than i imagined when he began to run unthinkable horrifying way more out of control in the last couple of months than ever seen him he have any core beliefs beyond his own and twitter tony with photographer and trump at the book party for the art of the deal at trump in 1987 fell into writing the book almost by accident a liberal journalist in he wrote a scathing magazine article on only to receive a note from the ever greedy for saying he liked it when went to interview him for trump said he wanted to write an even though he was only 38 suggested instead a book called the art of the deal trump agreed and said he should write series trumps presidential election in two cities read a high mortgage and a second child on the needed the money he struck his own a joint half of the advance and half the royalties it paid off in financial if not spiritual the art of the deal sold more than a million copies and spent 13 weeks atop the new times bestseller at the felt he was selling but to say he feels regret alone would be too simple spent a long time thinking about why i did he muses the only choice i made that not proud of in my life a complicated question to say whether i would do it differently today and if i knew everything i know about what would happen to of course i do it the complexity is that the experience of writing that book was so in a negative that it led me to change my life dramatically and move from a focus on being successful and earning more money to really exploring what a meaningful life looks quit journalism and set up a consulting the energy which aims to boost productivity with healthier workplaces spent 30 years doing stuff proud that not sure i would have gotten to if i written that book it gave me such a profound experience of the wrongness the direction of my life was taking so does good things and bad things over the course of a life if you get to the age i am and feel good about the life hard to i wish done this differently or that maybe i have landed where i delivered an address to the oxford union in the last with the title the belly of the how trump led me on the path to he are the consequences of the choices you make that you to but can little imagine potentially huge remains to be seen who else will find a moment of after election day on 8 probably not the facing bitter infighting after hostile takeover it will also be a time for the media to look at itself closely last the republican candidate bush told press playing you guys like a fiddle by saying outrageous things and garnering chairman of network may not be good for but damn good for by march trump was already estimated to have earned of media attention there will be hard questions over the thousands of hours of airtime he has been given and whether his bigotry should have been called out rather than and mainstreamed i was a reporter for many years driven by the story to write about policies just as has often been in thrall to newspapers have shown their mettle with a series of investigations and exposures the new times obtained records showing the billionaire may not have paid tax for 18 years then the post revealed a 2005 video in which trump bragged about groping women says he did not witness in 18 months shadowing this opened the floodgates for a dozen women to come forward with allegations of sexual assault or unwanted think my journey has a parallel in the journey of the media over the past six to 12 months along comes something that seems pretty damn a guy who attracts huge ratings and you know that people are going to read your story if you write about him twitter trump gleefully responds to new probe into think the best people in the media have come to see that hate without considering the consequences of giving him that much attention turns out to have potentially really takes center stage in presidential race about men 's sex lives read this most astounding of all nothing will be quite the same he believes going to change the media because no way not to go through a period of true for the for for the culture of this country and for the whole issue of assuming it ends without trump being we have to use this as an opportunity to question a lot of assumptions that vast numbers of people had accepted and he has proved are not trump does lose the as opinion polls strongly there will tremendous relief for is an inflection point and if as soundly rejected as it looks like he will be quite a for to it will suggest the forces of progress and evolution hurled away the forces of hatred and how would whose entire

those around you who see you as a threat that rocks the hierarchy where everyone should know their an anonymous hospital consultant says in response to the results of the guardian survey he may well

out to network members via an email newsletter it was also promoted via twitter and network readers were also invited to take part through the who left the the loss of my role was like a was an experienced nurse working in a fantastic team of staff following a our ward manager was replaced by someone who was known for being a bully she frequently made comments and used language inappropriate for the role her of me began immediately on one due to staff sickness i was expected to do the jobs of four other people and was reprimanded when i objected i was expected to attend meetings on my days off i was constantly ridiculed and told that medical staff had me even when they quite clearly had not on one occasion i was physically pushed out of the way this went on for over a year along with the treatment of me that had a devastating effect on my psychological health i was having panic attacks and suicidal took out a grievance and was immediately moved to an area where i had no previous experience or expertise unable to continue working i was signed off sick with stress my bullying complaint was not investigated properly and not upheld i believed that i had been targeted as i had previously raised concerns about patient care i appealed against the decision and with the support of a union representative and i won but the bully remained in post and i was offered a job in another at a lower grade i was advised by my union that i was being constructively dismissed and not to return to work i negotiated an exit strategy with payment of a lump sum under one of the compromise agreements i am now in receipt of an permanent injury benefit which guarantees me a in excess of what i was previously for the rest of my natural life i now work for a private company in a setting the loss of my clinical role has been like a bereavement and not a day goes by when i do not think about the injustice of my the bullies have wrecked my is an endemic culture of bullying at

she insisted that i had to contact her every morning to tell her where i even at work other senior people soon started to target me and i would be admonished for the smallest of errors and for things i done because of the seniority of these other members of staff began to pull and i soon became isolated by this i had gone to see my who had diagnosed me with severe depression i have had suicidal thoughts occasionally i still do been demoted and moved into a job where i have no experience and been offered no being set up to fail resigned to the fact that i will have to leave the trust at some

and you can read a full report from game 1 win world series game 1 against cubs as sets strikeout record read more email from this a good start remains to be seen if the goat fingers a seven game series and a lot can but no doubt this was a huge victory for the terry is now undefeated in world series games the more you a game 2 an hour earlier than game due to weather concerns a win there and the cubs have gone 1 1 on the which is what supposed to well then might start panicking be covering that for the hopefully be joining us thanks for following along with especially those who cubs 0 6 is in to here falls behind 2 0 it feels like with a 6 run lead the mission should just be throw but given the hard not to understand if his command gets the benefit of a high strike call on the next pitch 2 1 his next pitch is a definite strike 2 2 progressive field gets real loud and swings and misses at the next pitch and it gets the have won game 1 of the world series cubs 0 6 top takes ball one and then swings and misses at second pitch 1 1 he swings and foul tips one into the mitt for strike two 1 2 he swings and misses at a high fastball and out number two the cubs are down to their final out of the game cubs 0 6 top falls behind 3 1 and then hits a fly ball off the wall for a double improbable rally cubs 0 6 top closer comes in and immediately strikes out the are two outs away email from don stuck in without a functioning what to get on and find your coverage much like the early days of radio coverage when one had to wait while the announcer recreated the sounds of the bat and ball and the crowd for the kind be every game of the world series here at the hopefully stick with that goes for everybody reading right now hold we still have half an inning left here cubs 0 6 bottom grounds out and the inning finally ends cubs 0 6 bottom the one time i praise one of moves literally the only time this and it goes completely wrong hits a double off of ratings in start to plummet cubs 0 6 bottom hector is up here to face done no i just realized gets into a 1 2 then wastes a pitch and then throws a hanging breaking ball and hits his second home run of the cubs 0 3 bottom is up with one two out falls behind him 2 0 yeah this is the i remember he lines the next pitch over the guess we have a pitching although in this in the right to make a move here cubs 0 3 bottom guyer falls him 2 0 but guyer swings through the next two pitches to even the count guyer checks his swing and a full count now misses up high with his next pitch and guyer takes his base cubs 0 3 bottom hits a routine two down cubs 0 3 bottom is still out there imagine if the game were be someone else up also is to come up with another uh is ready to hit a soul never nobody on base to move any he strikes out badly on a unchecked swing on a 2 2 count not so getting a tad loopy here cubs 0 3 bottom the good news for is that probably not going to be available to for for more than an inning in game 2 not nothing it feels like might have leaned too heavily on his best but he knows the old that win game 1 of the world factoid cubs 0 3 top gets ahead 2 1 next swings for the fences and comes up empty 2 2 and on the very next strikes leaves the mound to a huge ovation cubs 0 3 top with a sharp is at third the tying run is up to the plate once again stopped you have to admire that cubs 0 3 top is up miller gets ahead of him 1 2 the crowd starts to get loud again every two strike count with miller is an event next pitch is a ball 2 2 fouls off the next pitch still 2 2 next a slider just off the gets called for a crowd like but it did break swings at the next pitch but he quite get a good swing at it and it ends up just being a that eventually tracks down thrown 38 pitches already cubs 0 3 top works a full count against getting him to throw as many pitches as possible might be the best strategy for the cubs at this he takes ball four cubs 0 3 top is back for his last inning one would assume is up in the bullpen he gets fowler to line out to is feeling good about a team called the winning in hopefully their own fans are even a little bit definitely a conversation to be had about the one that i imagine will only be amplified over the course of the serious it should be in my opinion cubs 0 3 bottom keeps in the game to face falls behind 2 0 before getting a strike call on a nifty 2 1 he throws another curve and gets to ground out cubs 0 3 bottom were the producer of there would have been 300 on that now we have who i remember as sucking pretty bad confirms my memory by hitting a rocketing double off of him cubs 0 3 bottom wood is in to face with one out and nobody on he induces a and once again what did i tell email from d after the top of the my feelings as a cub of well shit cubs 0 3 bottom the maddening has begun strop gets to pop out to second and brings out a new reliever going to somehow see the entire cubs bullpen over the next and is doing the catching now and is in right miller might be the only player who was both with the and the red that fans of both teams still like equally cubs 0 3 top is up with a chance for a storybook moment and he gets a 3 1 count with the bases loaded he takes the next pitch and a 3 2 count now this is the biggest pitch of the game right attempts to check his swing on strike three he two straight strikeouts from miller did i tell and the cubs load the bases with nobody out and push a run feels like the game please keep cubs 0 3 top strikes out on three pitches the cubs score on an out now cubs 0 3 top is for he flies out but not enough to score the runner from third one out miller is two strikeouts or one double play away of getting out of the jam first option is more likely with cubs 0 3 top is up next with two hitters on and nobody out he immediately falls behind 0 2 swings and fouls off the next pitch it really looks like lunging and think miller would be able to exploit that and put him away here rather lines a single and the bases are loaded and nobody out wow did this dynamic just change dramatically in the span of a few batters cubs 0 3 top who has been frighteningly throughout this is up to face what a welcome back to the major leagues this has to from to actually works a full count which should be as good as a solid base hit and in he takes a walk on ball four the tying run is now at the plate den s has immediately transported me into a brothers routine with this email and i honestly am completely down with what is difficult about saying strop is the first reliever to play in this world cubs 0 3 top from do you really think will play 3 times this try and do a and make a long relief if so do you think be as honestly part of the reason miller is warming up here is that would like to use on short rest for a potential game 4 but he is back to start the top of the 7th where he immediately allows to hit a a single and the end of night here comes miller cubs 0 3 bottom strop time in the ends up being the first reliever used in this world which is something not everybody can say going to be facing who he strikes say he did the job cubs 0 3 bottom flies out to left and that will do it for inning is taking him out into the everybody cubs 0 3 bottom guyer going to be bunting with a runner on second with nobody he might not get a he takes two there is stirring in the bullpen lester might not be long here it might depend on this throws a strike 2 1 guyer swings away at the next pitch 2 2 this has taken a turn think bunting now guyer takes a pitch on the corner for a strike cubs 0 3 bottom back up he been really just that first inning where he came close to unraveling why do i keep saying things like that hits a double off of him the second i finish that sentence years ago i beat i walked my 2 pugs while wearing a life comes at you 2016 cubs 0 3 top is to see if he can do anything on 1 1 he swings wildly at a pitch like not even sure it occupies the same dimension as he does on get the call pops up and it for this maybe for this miller has been throwing with purpose it would unorthodox to pull the way been pitching been unorthodox with his bullpen use all long cubs 0 3 top who falls behind 0 2 a real good hitter it feels necessary to point that out throws a ball and then gets to swing on a breaking ball that he just pops up out two
