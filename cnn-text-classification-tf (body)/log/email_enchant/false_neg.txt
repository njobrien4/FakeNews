an email i received from a reader some time ago has begun to haunt me the sister was dying of cancer she asked would i respond to the word in the context of a cancer my correspondent did not gloss over the miseries of her terminal state she outlined a series of horrific tests that led doctors to withhold food she described infections and the caused by edema but then she testified to her uncanny ability brighten any with her smiles had i received this query while i was undergoing my first it would have triggered irritation bordering on apoplexy why should a cancer patient be expected to lift her own spirits or anyone it hard enough dealing with such dire circumstances without having to become a booster for oneself and for one scholar of cancer decries tyranny of that gets too many patients making us feel guilty about expressing understandable anguish during the intervening i have interacted with friends as they confronted an irreversible condition and have witnessed a kind of grace that i found inspiring while coping with these people contested it and sometimes the medical protocols upon which they had to rely yet when bodily functions shut few of them dug in and battled a condition pronounced terminal their sense of seemed to be founded on acceptance of their impending mortality what might have contributed to their patent and patient and given my own impatience with circumstances beyond my could i possibly tap such catholic and protestant authorities agree on the mysterious nature of which they see as a free and undeserved or gratuitous not a reward a disposition that works to perfect the grace cannot be known or acquired through beliefs or deeds in the the word for appears in the benediction the lord be gracious to though the word for is used more frequently to denote an unmerited gift for believers who seek this benefit from as for nonbelievers who seek it grace remains a highly elusive but highly desirable especially in troubled times people with cancer explore all the activities that people without cancer use to make themselves receptive to a sense of beneficence or loving religious private breathing and body verse or mantra making or looking at listening to or making walking in communing with and alcohol or marijuana those engaged daily in one or more of these practices testify to their efficacy a zillion books offer instructions some of but the trick must consist in finding own eccentric way my correspondent had glimpsed grace in her smiles also found it in an obituary that a beth had composed for herself while she was dying of and she included a link to it the eerie opening died prefaces a description of ms life and then her conclusion that the end grace and love not it reminded me of the first i had read after a recurrence of the author and editor lotter posted an essay in which she recalled the high points of her education and career because she wanted to be about having a full rather than about having to she closed with thanks for her family and ended with happy to have been might the introspection and retrospection of writing serve as one source of grace that transforms it from a gift received to a gift after my friend pep died of metastatic colon his in the local paper brought tears to my eyes it was as if i heard his voice from beyond the grave the act of composition must have composed providing an opportunity to reflect on his to express appreciation of his family and and to make peace with the posthumous presence he would become in common the word means ease of a style that charms those who observe it a scholar of many pep would have known that it derives from the which mean pleasing or and that it gave rise to the and the by virtue of his gracious pep bestowed a gift of grace on his family and friends i cannot imagine attaining a durable state of grace throughout the ordeals that will surely arrive in the future i consider practicing a series of brief grace notes the musical notation of these short notes is printed in smaller type to indicate an ornament and with a slur mark linking them to the note they a fleeting sound before a longer lasting duration that immediately follows to they look like a tiny bounce or skip forward there must be as many ways to play grace notes as there are people in the world what might they i in this i give thanks for the time that remains to resist animosity and i want to devote it to becoming proficient at all sorts of grace notes before the chords of closure resound into silence

president legacy looked on not long to include a major push against deeply entrenched housing segregation in his administration rolled out a rule requiring local communities to assess their own patterns of racial and income segregation and make genuine plans to address them the move followed years of debate and came as segregated cities like and faced renewed bouts of racial unrest the federal advocates was finally trying to repair a promise of the fair housing act now that rule is likely to be undermined and possibly erased by a department of housing and urban development headed by on j trump officially offered the cabinet post to a neurosurgeon and a former presidential who grew up poor in but has no experience in housing policy while we know little about what would do at the he has played down the role of government in his own story you his mother taught according to his autobiography have only yourself to and he has specifically criticized the housing rule known as furthering fair the rule has been politically contentious its backers argue that it is essential to remedying the long history of government and discrimination that has resulted in segregated neighborhoods persisting to this day critics say that the rule amounts to government overreach into the decisions and demographic makeup of individual communities and a free housing market republicans in congress have tried to its implementation wrote last year that the new policy followed the history of failed and would redirect housing primarily into white communities that oppose it if he is confirmed by would have wide latitude to shape or slow the of the along with broader enforcement of the fair housing act the president of the national low income housing said interpretation of the rule as a social experiment a fundamental misunderstanding of obligations that have been around since the fair housing act passed that year included two one banning discrimination in the housing and the other requiring local communities to the goal of integration the latter language means that not enough to punish landlords or communities who intentionally deny minorities housing communities also have a responsibility to actively ensure open housing which exist today neither in public housing clusters on segregated south side nor in exclusive new city suburbs that use zoning laws to outlaw multifamily housing and jack past republican acknowledged that second implication of the law but for much of the time since the fair housing act was this mandate has been largely ignored by both local communities and itself the administration rules were an effort to address that oversight and some advocates have spent just as long fighting for it recently told fox news that cannot have a strong nation if we have weak inner is the very insight that motivated senator another republican to include a provision in the fair housing act requiring counties and states to further fair as a condition of receiving federal a lawyer with the law firm wrote in an email the administration rule nothing like the partisan caricatures that have sprung up around said of the poverty and race research action council many advocates wanted the rule to be much tougher than what emerged from several years of debate with local communities in the rule provides those communities with detailed data on factors like racial poverty school quality and housing voucher use to help them determine whether and minority families are isolated from good schools or segregated from opportunity the rule requires communities to use that information to draft plans to reduce segregation where it exists those that habitually defy the requirements risk lose funding from the agency the first round of communities scheduled to complete the process have been at work on assessments due over the coming year before a new administration hostile to the idea could begin writing another rule that would reverse this or it could simply halt implementation or congress could pass a law even as it remains on the books for all the years that went into shaping the a new administration could relatively easily set it aside that would also fundamentally change the conversation in about how segregated communities came to exist in their current incarnation and other critics call efforts to dismantle them but these places were created through policies that can themselves be labeled social redlining that denied blacks policies that concentrated public housing in minority government decisions to locate highways that isolated them further while many of these policies were first put into place decades communities remain shaped by them today the mandate was based on the idea that this history of active government intervention requires an active government too a theme of campaign was that structural forces hinder workers in the rust belt and beyond the decline of the lack of educational the opioid at would have ample opportunity to show whether he believes that structural forces undermine poor urban minorities historic troubled and if government should take an active role in pursuing a remedy
j trump sat down on with editors and columnists of the new times for an exclusive interview times reporters have annotated portions of the interview the full transcript is available here the personal interactions between president and trump have so far been but not clear that the moment will last has already indicated that he may weigh in against trump once the new administration takes especially if the new president attacks legacy achievements here is our story on the cordial meeting between trump and in the oval office trump is working to reset his mercurial relationship with the media as he looks toward assuming starting with this meeting at what he branded the new during his presidential campaign but he still nurses intense grievances toward news outlets in general and the times in particular here is more about relationships with the news media and the times trump is hinting that even though federal law does not require him to do anything specific to separate himself from his vast business he is inclined to submit to some sort of voluntary standard of ethics that would avoid conflicts of interest or their appearance but he leaves open the possibility that there may not be a way to accomplish it this story has more about business ties trump is correct that federal for the most exempts the president from conflict of interest meaning he is allowed to take actions that could benefit his financial holdings but in modern most presidents have voluntarily put their financial assets into blind trusts trump has said he does not intend to take such a instead will turn his companies over to his children read this story for more on potential conflicts of interest the wall street journal editorial among has suggested that the only solution to potential conflicts of interest is to sell off all of his and then have a blind trust reinvest the proceeds trump suggests that this is not practical crowds at rallies frequently targeted chanting her and referring to her as a criminal in trump himself encouraged a crowd in telling them starting to agree with as they chanted her in despite remarks the and the justice which have investigated email server and the conduct criminal inquiries largely independently of the white house a president attempting to intervene in those kinds of in any would be a major scandal here is our full story about reversal on prosecuting trump has been criticized for not specifically denouncing bigotry and groups that spread bigoted views his statements about such conduct tend to be including when he says disavow the that nonspecific language has been comforting to leaders of the a white nationalist including b who led a gathering at a federal building near the white house last weekend that included some audience members offering a salute trump here perhaps for the first that being president will perhaps help enrich his family he also concedes that the arrangement might fairly be called a conflict of interest back in when he was still a trump said definitively that torture was effective tell me it work torture he told an audience in south you half these believe it works so answer on offered a revealing insight into his willingness to shift or rethink a especially after talking with someone he respects gen n may well be secretary of and his rejection of torture clearly had an effect on the the reality is more complicated the number of factories and the number of who work in factories both have declined sharply in recent decades but the manufacturing output is at the highest level in history the production of like has been replaced by the largely automated production of like circuits in president signed a landmark law that prohibited the hiring of illegal provided new resources for enforcement along the border and offered legal status to several million illegal immigrants experts say the law did little to slow migration to the united but made crossing the border more difficult and dangerous premiums for many health plans under the affordable care act are increasing percent to percent or but increases of percent are extremely rare deductibles for many plans are but not for a family plan in the maximum including the is comments about his fellow republicans had a sharp edge and an implicit they owe their congressional majority to and he expects to be treated accordingly whether this is and to what will be one of the pivotal stories of the new trump and crucial to figuring out how much or how little he can get done he needs congress to achieve many of the campaign promises he including the deep tax cut and large infrastructure spending not to mention and it is an open question how with his policies republicans will prove to be read these stories for background on relationships with republican leaders in and the stalwarts who are pondering the future of the conservative movement trump suggests here that he may name his as a special envoy to the middle charged with making peace between the and the buried in this answer is an assertion by trump that the federal law does not apply to him as but he also says he would want to avoid the appearance of conflict installing as a special envoy could have that essentially giving him an important task that would allow him to be involved in national security deliberations without hiring him outright this is a role that was often discussed as a potential landing spot for bill if had won the white house
if you think back to this presidential campaign and recall a lot of articles mentioning email troubles and j various you be wrong if it seems there were fewer articles about the economy and because there were the temptation to blame news organizations for this imbalance is but there is at least some reason to resist it critics have long assailed campaign coverage as focused too much on candidate campaign strategy and assessments of instead of on policies and ideas but this the candidates share the blame i compared the content of campaign ads with the content of news articles about two specific candidate traits or and the economy or jobs both the candidates and news organizations spent more time discussing the fitness for office lack of than they did the economy and the imbalance grew more lopsided as the election approached using analytic tools provided by crimson i categorized the campaign news coverage of media outlets this consisted of four broadcast three cable news national public radio and on the two news and newspapers i specifically searched for news about campaign and her email server or her campaign and and several controversies connected to campaign things like trump the khan family and the i also looked for news about the campaign appeals on the economy and jobs this list but it gives a sense of the between coverage of these controversies and the economy the controversies received more on than their views on the economy from until election percent of the stories mentioned various and percent mentioned email only percent mentioned trump and jobs or the and only percent cited campaign and the economy closer to the from the numbers got even more lopsided this was an important date just after the release of the video and a few weeks before director b letter to congress from this percent of the campaign articles mentioning either controversies or the economy discuss while only percent mention her alongside jobs or the economy as for percent mention his while percent mention him related to jobs and the economy the imbalance in coverage of the character is as is the lack of coverage about the economy compared with the controversies moving one week past the video between and election roughly half of the stories about scandals and the economy mentioned and only a quarter discussed trump and his imbroglios a mere percent of the stories in these last three weeks mentioned and the economy percent mentioned trump and the these choices have consequences according to the reports of what they heard or read about between and were mainly references to her handling of emails during her time as secretary of state in mentions of trump changed week by tracking what was happening on the campaign trail but before anyone blames the news important to examine what the candidates themselves were talking about over the course of the campaign if media reports reflect candidate discourse then it is not merely the media choosing to report on scandals it might be at least as much the choosing to campaign on them that results in unending coverage of traits and characteristics to figure out if this was the i used data from on all the campaign ads aired between and election day i coded all of the appeals in each ad and weighted the appeals by how many times the ads ran on television made more ads than and she vastly running nearly three times as many ads as he did all over half a million ads were run in during this period the content of the ads is revealing both candidates spent most of their television advertising time attacking the other character in the losing ads did little else more than of the appeals in advertisements nearly half of were about characteristics or dispositions only percent of appeals in her ads were about jobs or the economy by percent of appeals focused on the taxes and trade since the start of presidential campaign television advertising in no campaign has made percent of its television ad appeals about any single topic on traits typically garner about percent of the appeals the economy typically generates about percent of the appeals usually much more balance of this was an unusual election with two very unpopular so the flaws may have simply been too big a story for either them or the media to pass up whatever the the criterion of fitness for office dominated the messaging and made up a good share of the trump messaging as and the news media covered it

j trump said on that he had no intention of pressing for an investigation into use of a private email server or the financial operations of her dropping the her pledge that became a rallying cry for his campaign for the white house who branded his rival and said she would go to jail if he were said in an interview with reporters and editors at the new times that he was no longer interested in pursuing in part because he wanted to heal the wounds of a divisive campaign want to hurt the i really trump said during the interview went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different and i am not looking to hurt them at all the campaign was his reversal on prosecuting was particularly striking given the outsize role the issue played during the presidential in which her use of a private email server as secretary of state became a prominent and one she has blamed for her loss to trump trump said he wanted to from the subject without he said that have people that do perhaps a reference to the or republicans who might continue to press for prosecutions in the email or foundation cases but the made clear that he would not seek to pursue an investigation himself nor make it a priority after he assumes office the decision angered some of his most fervent who immediately criticized his seeming change of heart blared the headline on a conservative news site that has strongly backed trump not something that i feel very strongly trump said at the unlike health care or immigration has been a very painful period of aides did not respond to a request for comment about remarks during their second trump turned to and i i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your because never been so many so much after turnaround on the conservative commentator one of his staunchest supporters during the suggested on twitter that trump was overstepping his role i thought we elected she wrote we make him the his job is to pick those not do their tom president of judicial a conservative advocacy group that has been a relentless critic of said on that it would be a mistake for trump to drop the threat of appointing a special counsel to look into her email use said that although the had already investigated the matter that inquiry was flawed his group has gained access to thousands of pages of state department emails through lawsuits and is pressing its case in court even after her defeat representative a republican who leads the house oversight and government reform said last week on fox news that his committee would continue to investigate the matter as well because got to get to the office said on he was unavailable for comment about statements although the email investigation is the agency still has an open inquiry into the foundation that inquiry began after the publication of a book by peter that asserted that some foreign entities had given money to the foundation in return for state department favors when was there the have denied the assertions the and justice department conduct their criminal investigations largely independently from the white so trump cannot tell agents to close their cases a president ordering the to stop a politically sensitive case would be a major scandal does seem like an extraordinary breach of protocol for him to get involved in that glen a a former federal prosecutor in new said of the know of no recent circumstances when the president ordered an attorney general not to pursue a criminal as trump were to order the b to close the foundation could choose to rebuff him directors are given terms to insulate them from political but the president still has the power to fire a as president bill did with s sessions in after a justice department investigation uncovered ethical abuses by sessions in an interview last week with trump said he had not yet decided whether to dismiss over his handling of the email saying the director have had very good reasons for doing what he as a practical remarks will probably have little impact the investigation into emails is already closed while the one into her foundation remains senior officials and career justice department officials have said there is little evidence justifying moving forward with a case when the case comes up for senior agents and prosecutors may decide to shut it but it will not be because of remarks while the decision is likely to frustrate investigators at the who are fiercely protective of their independence to follow the facts they some legal experts applauded decision to not pursue investigations into emails or her family foundation k a professor at the university of hastings college of the said he was inclined to support both moves by trump a decision to shut down an he not out of step with constitutional as the constitution gives the president the power to issue pardons for federal crimes
thank you for being guide to thriving in the age of l pp from trump to to marine one thing that unites the unhappy west is a profound sense of mystification across and north people have an acute feeling that their world is accelerating away from them but they quite understand why there is no narrative hence the attraction of leaders who it like it and identify convenient like immigrants or the union but what most people really crave is an honest explanation as with patients on a the first step is to understand what is going wrong then you can decide on the medication into this darkened room steps tom while other journalists dream of being investigative reporters or news l is a whose goal is to be a from to and he is extremely good at it a talent for explanation has garnered him a column at the new times and a string of books on huge subjects like and climate change snooty critics might grumble about his folksy but it is hard to think of any other journalist who has explained as many complicated subjects to so many people now he has written his most ambitious book part personal part manifesto you for being has two overt aims wants to explain why the world is the way it is why so many things seem to be spinning out of especially for the white middle class he grew up in and then he wants to reassure us that it is basically going to be in general the explanation is more convincing than the reassurance but as a guide for perplexed this book is very hard to beat argues that man is actually a fairly adaptable creature the problem is that our capacity to adapt is being outpaced by a built from three ever faster the market and climate change that sounds like a predictable but digs cleverly into each one for on technology he argues convincingly that which saw the arrival of the android and was the year when software in the words of the he introduces us to vital obscure like and he points out that if law the power of microchips would double about every two had applied to the capabilities of not computer then the modern descendant of the beetle would travel at miles per cost cents and use one tank of gasoline in a lifetime the chapters on climate change and the market are stuffed with similar nuggets but also shows how all three forces complicating and speeding up one another in climate change is wrecking crops even as technology is helping more children

maybe i have been surprised that trump could be elected but i was i live in and work in two of the most liberal places in the country but even i seeing many signs of support for him how did that blindness social media is my portal into the rest of the world my periscope into the communities next to my into how the rest of the world thinks and feels and it completely failed me in that failure makes sense spent nearly years coaching and and twitter on what kinds of news and photos i want to and they all behaved accordingly each time i liked an or clicked on a or hid the algorithms that curate my streams took notice and showed me only what they thought i wanted to see that meant i realize that most of my family who live in rural were voicing their support for trump and i see any of the that were in heavy circulation before the election i never saw a trump hat or a sign or a shirt in my and the only election day i saw were of people declaring their support for to be not blaming the algorithms for what i assume to be their role in augmenting my they did exactly what i told them to blocking out misogynist and hiding anyone who support black lives all with such deftness that i had no idea that a candidate who ran a campaign on exactly those values had gained enough popularity to win the election but considering that more than percent of our population consumes news on finding alternative perspectives have been that hard i knew about theory on filter or the idea that personalization distorts the type of information we and even i still chose to let algorithms shape how i perceive the world everything i could want to see is available at my and yet i look in mark chief executive of addressed a room of developers about the importance of his social network he has the power to bring people together who might otherwise never have the chance to meet has enabled all of us to access and share more ideas and information than ever he said gone from a world of isolated communities to one global and we are all better off for but not what has happened idealism is belied by his desire to duck responsibility for mediating the content of his site on the political divide has only been entrenched further the dress only for our entire we are two one that sees blue and black and the other that sees white and gold the once offered outlets we could use to understand one another but they are rapidly disappearing most social media like and is curated by software built to manage the high influx of information flowing into but there have still been a few islands of digital a of where culture thrived untouched they included vine closure was announced in and and even which were homes for marginalized theories and lifestyles the vine was the first place i got a glimpse of cultures beyond my including those of the middle east i was able to see how some women there wanted us to see aware a young woman living in who goes by the name used vine to show clips of herself living her life her version of normalcy at the goofing off at home in her most viral she stares into the her face covered in a save for her perfectly outlined eyes called me she snaps the emphasis on the last word becomes the punch line as she whips off one to reveal a second underneath i was thrilled to realize that women living there could have a sense of humor similar to my own vine was born as an and intended to be a social community but vine links could be shared independent of the and people did so with meaning that vines appeared around the defying the sorting mechanism of streams and feeds they could land on your screen via text direct email vine was a riff on one originally posted by a young black named who was miffed that someone thought she needed makeup to be

was also named in the suit and hired top lawyers who put trump through an unsparing deposition asked about his trump was caught lying or exaggerating times thought get a friendly and we would roll says who is now the executive editor of view the case went through four judges and was dismissed in suit against is one of seven forays trump and his companies have made as libel plaintiffs he won only when a defendant failed to appear but the standard measure defending his reputation and achieving victory in court how trump says he thinks about his investment spent a couple of bucks on legal and they spent a whole lot he told the post in march about the hefty sum he spent on the case against did it to make his life which happy trump was warner books spent less than he and paid nothing but that make central idea any less that libel law can be a tool of revenge disconcerting for a maybe not as rich as he plaintiff to treat the legal system as a weapon to be deployed against critics once installed in the white trump will have a wider array of tools at his and his record suggests more than his he will try to use the press and also control and subdue it as a trump blustered vaguely that he wanted to up our libel i asked his hope by email what he meant by but she answer the question others i not within the direct powers to change the rules for libel suits but our legal safeguards for writers and publishers foolproof in the last few trump has been joined by at least two billionaires who are determined to exploit cracks in the wall of defense around the press the members of this club are innovators they have sued or funded suits to defend reputations or protect privacy but an underlying aim appears to be to punish critics like or even destroy entire media outlets this kind of manipulation of the law is unfolding at a keen moment of weakness for the which has already been buffeted by falling revenue and mounting public disaffection only percent of the public the lowest rate since at least the trusts the media report the news accurately and according to a survey conducted in this mistrust has been growing for a long but it was stoked by trump during the campaign he called the reporters who covered him and whipped up yelling and booing crowds there is no consensus among his supporters that the press should hold those in power accountable a recent pew survey found that only half of trump backers agreed that it was important in a strong democracy that organizations are free to criticize political media outlets have won many cases by persuading a judge to dismiss them

reputation was false the jury agreed with on that point and awarded him in damages equivalent of about million with similar cases the times pulled its reporters out of but when the newspaper appealed to the supreme the justices threw out the verdict and set a far stiffer standard for proving libel the court wrote that a public figure has to prove that a false and damaging statement about him was

pharmaceuticals international is a onetime wall street darling that has become a punching bag for how pharmaceutical firms drove up drug prices and engaged in questionable sales in the process losing percent of its market value the first case to emerge from multiple federal and state investigations of its portrays it as a not a perpetrator the justice department charged a former with taking about million in kickbacks from the chief executive of a specialty while hiding his true intentions from corporate management had a relationship with and in paid million on an option to buy but it dropped the association last year shut down in the criminal complaint depicts surreptitious payments and a cavalier highlighted by an email from davenport to tanner evoking how the two men would be like butch and the kid and into the sunset off the cliff as in the the case appears to be a straightforward tale of but there may be more to proving the charges than meets the perhaps portending a more difficult prosecution for the justice department was really the or was it a willing participant that wanted to build up so it could increase sales of its lawyer issued a statement asserting that his client did his job greatly benefiting and regularly communicated to his superiors what he was lawyer took a similar claiming that also benefited which is why and its highly sophisticated and active management team sought to buy job was to develop what was called the alternative fulfillment in which sought to have prescriptions filled with the drugs through specialty pharmacies like rather than with cheaper generics in that tanner was and helped the company increase its sales but executives also wanted to develop other outlets for its which tanner is accused of resisting the criminal complaint portrays tanner as a classic unfaithful servant who made a key outlet for drugs while working out a secret agreement with davenport to get a cut of his profits he is accused of pushing to enter into an option agreement to acquire the mail order pharmacy while denying to his superiors that he had any financial interest in tanner received about million of payments to money funneled through corporate bank accounts to a shell company controlled by tanner if they were trying to hide those the two defendants certainly did a poor job by using an account over which tanner had signature which would be easy to and keeping the money in the united states rather than shifting it to an offshore account at one the justice department could bring a case against an employee for breaching a fiduciary duty to the employer as mail or wire fraud for violating the right of honest services statute but the supreme decision in skilling v united states in restricted this type of fraud to cases involving payment of a bribe or kickback to the not just unethical conduct that deceived an employer figuring out whether the million constituted a kickback to tanner is the prerequisite to proving that he committed honest services fraud a federal statute cited in the skilling case defines a kickback as a benefit given improperly obtain or reward favorable treatment in connection a transaction whether the dealings with were will be the crux of the case against the defendants the criminal complaint goes to great lengths to describe how tanner kept senior executives in the dark about his role at and the benefits he would receive he also made sure that played a crucial role in the alternative fulfillment program by never pursuing relationships with other potential pharmacy partners buying turned out to be problematic for when the company had to issue an accounting restatement after finding that it had incorrectly recorded million in sales to the pharmacy and after questions were raised about whether it properly disclosed the relationship with in its filings with the securities and exchange shut down the unit but that does not necessarily mean that the relationship was or that the million tanner received constituted an illegal kickback was aware of how the mail order pharmacy and the role it played in growing pharmaceutical a key to wall embrace of the company that took the stock to more than per share in the new times described an view that benefited significantly from its ties to the allowing it to increase sales of ailing products and obscure more significant problems with the unlike the typical kickback scheme in which a supplier pays an official to award a contract that should not have been the defendants can argue that the development of was a benefit to and the option to buy it was arranged by experienced executives who paid no more than what they thought the mail order pharmacy was worth at the time a decision in by the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit in in united states v may offer a path for tanner to argue that not revealing his interest in the deal does not constitute fraud in that the conviction of a bank officer who negotiated a sale of the interest in a development while secretly taking an ownership interest in the property was overturned the appeals court found negotiating and certainly the sophisticated businessmen in this do not expect complete candor about negotiating as distinct from facts and promises of future stake in the deal may not have tainted the transaction even if he breached a fiduciary duty to by not disclosing any arrangement he had with davenport unlike the typical he can argue that his share of the deal was a means to bring both sides together in a mutually beneficial arrangement was not so much a victim of a bad deal as a willing participant that received the benefit that it sought by gaining control of an important conduit to sell its drugs and avoid losing sales to generics that argument would not put a seal of approval on what tanner and arranging to make
a man was on a train in reading a novel set in japan the train slid past the bound for where the was headed the year was the train was a bullet train the man on the train was in a and the man in the novel he was reading was in a and as he read the it emerged that his quandary and the one in the novel were essentially the same the man in the novel was a priest sent to japan in the century he was there to minister to catholics suffering under a brutal regime and also to find out what had happened to his a priest rumored to have renounced the faith under torture the man on the train was martin he was in japan to play the part of van in a movie by another master filmmaker he was also there to move past a brutal battle in culture wars over a picture of last temptation of the film had been pilloried by conservative for a dream sequence in which has sex with in depicting life as a struggle between his human and divine had intended to make a film that was at once an act of doubt and an act of faith in the novel he was the priest was shown profaning an image of and yet the act was an act of faith the train slid past the mountains turned the pages this novel spoke to him all at once he saw it as a picture he would like to make the novel was by a convert steeped in literature and the history of catholicism in japan published in japan in sold a huge number in that country was called graham and was considered for the prize referred to as of the finest novels of our the missionary brought catholicism to japan in in the next it was suppressed through the torture of missionaries and their who were forced to apostatize by stepping on the a piece of copper impressed with an image of in took the point of casting much of the novel in the form of letters by reporting back to his superior he goes to japan with another young vowing to seek the truth about their father but they are captured and shown the reality of human suffering under torture the shogunate invites the converts to avoid torture by stepping on the many some are tortured anyway sees converts burned drowned a magistrate fluent in makes a grim can save the lives of the converts under torture if only he will step on the and apostatize when returned from he procured the film rights to as the years hardly a day went by without his mentioning the project to the people around friends and even his old parish father as he made and and he insisted that was the picture he really wanted to make a was elected terrorists began targeting in the middle east in with wolf of wall a declared that would be his next he commit to another until it was finished years filming began what led this great artist to make a story of missionaries in japan his ultimate passion he is known for his gangster he is a grandmaster of the profane from the he has revealed himself to be an artist of intensely catholic and the poisoned arrow of religious conflict runs straight through his career a vet as a spiritual bent on cleansing the city of filth through violence a tattooed fundamentalist determined to exact justice a young man raised to be a spiritual thrust up against communism even in the material documentary about takes as its theme the conflict between flesh and between and seeker is a novel for our it in the missionary so many of the religious matters that vex us in the present the claims to universal truths in diverse the conflict between a profession of faith and the expression of and the seeming silence of god while believers are drawn into violence on his behalf as material for is and yet commitment to it has been even by his exacting standards to understand that i spoke with the with members of the cast and the production team and with others who know the novel well trying to grasp just what kind of an act of faith this film is know if but there is such a thing as trying to get it said to in the new voice familiar from the cameos in his movies how do you do the right way to live has to do with selflessness i believe that but how does one act that i think you practice it consciously it has to be something that develops in you maybe through a lot of he had invited me to his east side townhouse at having spent a full day editing in midtown the living is decorated with a vintage movie posters for jean grand and photographs of his wife and daughter he is compact and with tremendous life in his eyes and a youthful ardor that seems to have its source in reverence for his elders like the polish filmmaker who had signed a storyboard that unhooked from the wall to show me we took and he began to talk as the hours the already seemed to diminish around until it resembled a screening or a a place where questions of how to live are posed through stories and images goes back to what father was telling me the last time i saw a couple of years he said doing something that is morally that is a great sin many people will never come back from that but the way would be to get up and try again maybe not but you get yourself into a situation where you can make another choice and the situation is he can choose to save the lives of others by renouncing his the act he considers

was out of town at a conference on information technology in when he was struck with terrible abdominal pain he tried to go to an urgent care center and called several local doctors no one could see him so he headed to the nearest emergency room on the he called his insurance company to make sure the visit would be covered once he got to the palms of hospital emergency a doctor gave him some medication and and let him go a month feeling better and back at home in baton received an bill from the doctor who treated him for really makes me and kind of breaks my he said when people go to the emergency they are often stunned to discover that doctors who treated them are not employed by the hospital and bill their insurance company separately these doctors negotiate separate deals with insurance companies for payment if the doctor and the insurance company never strike a the visit is billed at much higher rates while the insurance company sometimes pays the higher unlucky patients like can be caught in the crossfire they receive care and have no idea what it will end up costing them new research published in the new england journal of medicine on found that more than one in five patients visiting the emergency room may face the same financial shock the study looked at billing data from one large national insurer and found that percent of the patients who went to a hospital covered by their plan still received a bill from a doctor who was not in the insurance network the average such bill cost more than though there was a wide the highest was for more than this is not the first time researchers have examined surprise medical but the broadest analysis to date of the problem nationwide the study found wide variation across the country over the likelihood that someone would get a surprise medical bill in for the rates of surprise billing were compared with where it was near zero once patients get to the emergency they have little choice over who treats them put it in very blunt this is the health equivalent of a said an assistant professor of health policy and economics at and a of the paper cooper argues that the problem could be solved by which could make the visit a package that includes both the doctor and hospital consumer and scholars like see the surprise bill as unfair nearly impossible for patients to uncover the contract arrangements of individual physicians once they walk into an emergency room or are brought by ambulance by and not aware that playing that type of financial said chuck the programs director at consumers an advocacy group that has been urging states and congress to help solve the problem follow the and they go to the and then just like a several states have passed legislation aimed at tackling the including new and where a law recently went into effect but the state laws affect only a fraction of insurance customers insurance offered by large like is regulated under federal law and most of the laws work by setting up a dispute resolution system for which means they need to know they can go to state authorities to fight a big bill congressman a democrat from introduced legislation last year to tackle the practice but he said he experienced healthy dose of from his colleagues on the ways and means committee had heard complaints of surprise bills from and it turns out that the new study found that is a hot spot for the practice said he would introduce the legislation again next year think that got to be a way to get consumers out of this he said president included proposals to limit emergency room bills in his budget and recent regulations have made it more difficult for doctors to collect certain though those rules are being fought in court by physicians the acting administrator for the centers for and services has said that surprise bills are a policy priority for him the data in the study come from one large commercial but the researchers agreed not to name it in exchange for access cooper said there was only a little difference in the share of surprise bills in places where the insurance company had a lot of compared with those where it did less business emergency room doctors criticized the findings and were quick to blame the insurers the college of emergency the medical society that represents the said patients are much less likely to face large unexpected bills than the study citing an analysis the group did in of patients who were or asked to make up the difference between what the insurer pays and what the doctor bills balance bills are less than a couple of hundred on said the president she said that most doctors want to be included in networks but that they are not being offered reasonable fees is insurance company bad said whose group this week put out a parody video that accuses the insurers of paying too little for their work insurance companies like to blame the arguing that while they can reach a deal with the there are many doctors who refuse to be part of the network they offer under a plan and the insurers argue hospitals have a responsibility to make sure the outside doctors they use to staff their emergency rooms sign contracts with the same health plans they do would go a long way to reduce and prevent consumers from receiving a big surprise balance a spokeswoman for health insurance a trade said in an email the new authors agree when received his he tried appealing the charge to his insurance company understand that you went to a preferred provider facility and did not have a choice of the emergency room physician who treated his insurer wrote back but denied the claim then

know this by now creating strong passwords and never using the same password across sites is one of the simplest things you can do to protect yourself from digital invasion not everyone agrees about frequent password changes most say you should use really strong passwords and no more than one password per then use the password managers but making up new combinations all the time is irritating and tempting people to reuse them or make them too simple that is one reason some experts object to frequent password changes far better to create really strong ones for every login and new passwords can pose security because hard to remember complex so you are tempted to write them down that can lead to a lot of passwords to keep track of recommends password which help store many with one master

description of business partners as his in an interview published by on drew an angry response from who took offense at the racial connotation of the word the dispute between the and who plays for the cavaliers and is one of the most visible also left forward in the uncomfortable position of having to answer questions about a sudden feud involving one of his bosses and one of his good friends the interview was a q and a in which talked about the state of the the criticism of his management of the and his relationship with but took exception with description of the group of friends who travel and work with him as his and maverick his close friend and business both took offense at use of the word carter told he was bothered because of the idea that said it because and his friends are and he can use that said he had lost respect for as a result of the comments see the success that we but then there is always someone that lets you know how far we still have to go as told reporters in believe that would have used that term if he was doing business with someone else and working with another team or if he was working with anybody in sports that was owning a team that and had a group of guys around them that agree with what they did i think he would have called them a posse but it just shows how far we have to go but it stop us from doing what we need to do as a carter and two other high school rich and randy founded management company a decade ago the agency handles marketing and representation duties for and other players the company has been successful since its positioning as one of the top of his generation in the responding to a question about decision to leave the and whether he could imagine magic leaving pat and the or leaving and the turned his response back around to was playing with the they went to and he wanted to spend the told do overnights teams just so now a reference to the heat to text and do i do in this and who has are on the you are with this you hold up the whole team because you and your mom and your posse want to spend an extra night in did not respond to remarks he left practice without speaking to members of the news media and did not respond to an email while posse is defined as a group of friends or a professor of and studies at said he could understand why took offense the cultural definition of the word has shifted toward defining drug cartels in cultural the group of that surround a celebrity talking about is a rhetorical and one of the things interesting about rhetoric is sort of the study of who can say what to whom and under what conditions or can say what whom and under what said word in and of itself is never neutral it never means the same in all and when the word is used as by instead of in a private its connotation said you have an official or executive that uses that language that makes its way into mainstream it has a different he added shifts depending on with it left a close friend of to answer questions about the subject agreed that he considered a loaded and he said that he would not want his group of friends or family to be referred that way but declined to ascribe any assumptions or intent to i think he meant it any kind of said really know i think he did i would hope that he just says things and he says the first thing that comes to mind and then probably is in his office right now regretting it i know when it comes to you just never know going to be coming out it depends on listening people take it the right way or people take it the wrong way you just never know when it comes to just understand him talking about right in i understand

travel booking sites such as and are for travelers in search of accommodations or deals on packages that include both airfare and a hotel stay but as sites to book not so much that until recently these sites and two new search engines skylark and are looking to attract consumers seeking luxury getaways by including prestigious hotels in their inventory and selling discounted packages that combine luxe accommodations with or flights with which is part of the luxury travel network users pay an annual fee to get favorable rates on upscale discounted packages and email and live chat access to a team of about travel agents want to be a luxury travel agency where our clients can plan their own vacations but also rely on a travel adviser if they need said chief executive and for a member is considering two hotels in the and the they can instant message an adviser to inquire about location and other deciding the advisers can also arrange airport theater tickets and tours but biggest attraction may be the discounts to percent and perks it offers on upscale air and hotel packages a recent example is a stay for two at the mandarin oriental with flights on airlines from john f airport in new city to airport the trip costs for compared with if airfare and hotel were booked separately and because the mandarin is a part of members who book this package receive the virtuoso amenities such as an if space is and breakfast a free membership is also a virtuoso with around of the bookable hotels being virtuoso properties where clients receive extra said chief marketing one example is the where perks might include a room early and breakfast and airport transfers and skylark are coming into the market at an opportune said the travel industry analyst henry the founder of atmosphere research because affluent consumers rely on digital technology for much of their travel planning but these travelers also use travel and both search engines offer a chance to work with agents booking and both around since are also getting into the luxury game on reservations at properties grew percent from to compared with the same period a year said a vice president and head of global communications is pursuing luxury travelers with the premium package business it introduced last year the packages pair flights in business and first class with upscale hotels and sell them to consumers for an average of percent compared with the cost if each were booked separately is a shrinking price gap between economy and premium cabin and we saw an opportunity to offer discounted packages that bundle these airfares with stays at luxury said a spokeswoman for the company at any given has at least a few thousand premium packages for sale a recent at a cost of a was a stay at the park from to with airfare from new city some luxury hotels see an upside to being a part of travel sites is the chief operating officer for the a group of properties that includes the plaza in which can be booked on skylark and the other three search engines he said that travel sites are a way to bring in more business get a new set of who may not be familiar with our and sell said make sense about
so just when we thought that get any more it with a trump victory i told you last week that strange happenings were afoot in the what with the cubs winning the world series and all i hear that new yorkers are taking it pretty hard are people stocking up on canned greetings from the land of duck and not sure quite sunk in but foods and subterranean real estate are in demand and sounds like a hunting club so where shall we a little weary of the conversations get right to what do you think will happen trump will set up an administration the sun will rise in the east my dog will chase squirrels the world will go on glad to hear taking it well he stayed cautiously neutral in the but a very good boy i think you once made the point to me that there are no permanent victories or defeats in politics so perhaps a good place to start a conversation about the future been since i came to at the collective failure to understand that point it is patently true upon the most cursory inspection of recent history in democrats were popping champagne over the dawn of a permanent era of progressive politics now they see most of their dreams being unraveled and republicans celebrating today will sooner or later be miserable i made a things are looking better already both winners and losers who ignore this reality make silly unforced errors the losers err on the side of excessive like the classic threats to leave the country reader email has informed me way harder to leave the country than one might think we in all that much demand and the winners fail when they convince themselves that since victory is they can set an agenda that attracts no one from the other side looking at a president trump and a house and say we are in for a stretch of dumb things presidents generally get most of their big changes done in the first year or two president did that with health care his agenda was nothing compared to w who did everything from tax cuts to getting authorization for the invasion but was certainly a big lift it was also a central campaign promise i know you think it was a bad idea i think that strategy is enormously shortsighted i remember thinking when the democrats held the white house and both houses of congress in though they have it might be wise to give a little to bring some centrist republicans into some day the republicans might be in a position to reverse everything if they have zero political investment in and sure here we are my point is that of course a president should have a vision that matches his ideology why he got elected but i think it is impractical and imprudent to forgive me for another reference to is spinal turn it up to give on a few things where you have because someday going to need friends to protect the stuff you care about most the trump administration might learn from the outgoing horror at seeing some or all of repealed we part company here my perception of was of a democratic party willing to work on compromise legislation while the republicans just stalled there was no unified republican just a ton of people who wanted to be but kept changing their mind but the bottom line is that left behind the old congress now got guys who sleep in their offices and even talk to the other side at the house gym secretly a lot of them are actually but i take your point and another recommendation i would make to president make friends everyplace that was the magic golf with the same people every week since i have no prepared to look on the bright side for a while the republican hatred of is so great that even if had gotten elected it would have been really hard to get the necessary fixes through congress trump has promised and as of his interview something better that preserves the most popular parts of the program so see what he comes up with i know a big fan his agenda and agenda really do congress is set to have a big influence on the agenda over the next and and trump will figure out how to make their ideas jibe plan includes a health care replacement plan for it will actually do some of the things liberals really like getting more people covered i realize that very disappointing for progressives to see but not like it will be replaced by nothing this is one area where the product usually resemble the recipe i remember presidential candidate saying all health care negotiations could take place in on grab your crystal ball and give me a couple of other predictions seeing a big tax cut and huge spending on infrastructure repair followed by a stupendous rise in the national debt certainly true that neither party has been great at getting the deficit under control in my lifetime nobody calls his or her congressman and just do sit only one side adds to the deficit while simultaneously complaining too big but move on obviously cranky how any other how about the early the republican establishment seems to have as white house chief of staff but is going to be chief strategist which could mean anything to me is the kind of guy democrats should learn to live with they and going to be a republican white house but is a very bad dude who represents all the worst strands of racism and misogyny in the trump crowd who do you think will really have the it looks like both will be influential after watching the i find pair of appointments too surprising they signal that in as during his trump will seek to merge traditional republican politics with his unconventional
j election victory was powered in part by forceful opposition to what he described as an economic and political system rigged against the people for the benefit of shadowy forces in the news the banks and the government trump and his allies often describe that system with one globalism it is a word that conjures many none of them shuttered unchecked immigration and a distant cabal believers controls the economy and the media analysts who track extremist groups in the united states have expressed alarm at the use of the word by the they say it carries multiple meanings from benign to sinister and often serves as a for and conspiracy theorists is a principle driver for the fears that animate the radical right in the united said the editor of a published by the southern poverty law center is the globalism is often used as a synonym for the system of global economic interconnection that has been critiqued for decades by liberal groups like labor environmental organizations and opponents of the international monetary fund and the world bank but for the far the term encapsulates a conspiratorial based on xenophobia and according to mark a researcher at the league a host on the media site rebel explicitly rejected its use as a synonym for in a video she posted in she said the word meant rule by autocrats such as president former president w bush and the united nations who value false flag of and immigration from the third almost always sneer down their nose at disdain national laugh at religion and generally despise the west while holding a creepy affection for the third she added want open cheap labor and to benefit their business and political and are all too willing to shaft the little people to achieve the website run by k newly appointed chief white house frequently attacked globalism and during tenure there but no one may have done more to popularize the idea of a globalist conspiracy than a radio host who commands an audience of millions through his media empire he has been called most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary by the southern poverty law center among his the sandy hook school massacre in was a hoax and the sept terror attacks were an inside job posted his own definition of globalism to in in his trademark he described it as a digital control engineered by shadowy corporate and political elites he called it total form of the who has enthusiastically supported hailed the republican as a historical figure who appeared on his show last has in turn heaped praise upon reputation is trump said will not let you down you will be very i hope and i think be speaking a so what is trump talking about when he talks about his hope provided a definition in an email before the election last groups in the united states began to refer to globalism at the end of the cold when it replaced communism as an idea that was an danger to the said they have also referred to it as the new world and soon they saw its tentacles everywhere the shape of that conspiracy had distinctly in part because many of foes had historically seen communism as inextricably linked to said members of the far right became fixated on prominent like the businessman and philanthropist those conspiratorial beliefs were bolstered when former president bush celebrated the end of the cold war in a speech by saying it was the dawn of a world his use of the phrase was taken as proof by many that a globalist conspiracy really was afoot was very easy for especially because he was the one who said to take that ball and run with said that point the phrase became the short hand for that kind of globalism conspiracy the multiple meanings have made it a powerful political and and his frequent references to globalism have drawn in a wide and varied audience is a very efficient net to unite disparate parts of the from the mainstream to the said the director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at state professor called globalism defining folklore and narrative for the racist but said it had also a convenient to explain the various declines that the united states is perceived to be globalism was an important theme in the final weeks of for when he told a rally in in that his opponent for the had sat at the heart of a conspiracy with international bankers plot the destruction of the league criticized the speech for classic conspiratorial talk has continued after the election trump referred to a plot against him again last when he complained on twitter that protests were the work of the news media and paid protesters a trump ally and host on fox business later accused of many on the far right have celebrated election victory as a momentous blow against the globalist conspiracy last claimed on that trump had called him personally to thank him and his audience for their support and to offer to appear on his show again soon ms the trump did not reply to an email seeking comment late night then pivoted to what he thought was most the coming destruction of globalists that hijacked the primarily the news media and international business people soon they would be destroyed once and for he suggested is battling back to restore humanity and to break the he said not gonna be any dtente we know and just here to let you know

the space suit is only a few layers of plastic and metallic material a very thin plastic shield covering your a few your visor between your body and the other side of that plastic visor is instant an amazing outside in the cosmos life in space is very interesting in some ways similar to earth busy and you have a schedule you have to follow but one overriding thing that is unlike anything on and that is weightlessness two crewed space stations now orbiting earth read is like this force it just envelops everything everything floats the instant that the rocket engines shut down on your space you were born on you had a year or two to learn how to and really three or five years to learn how to walk and run but when an the second the engines shut you have to learn how to float there is a steep learning most astronauts are learning for several weeks and often a month or two before you get as good as you a fun process you move with your hands and you carry things with your which is the opposite of how we were designed on earth it was really for lack of a better to learn how to do food in space is actually pretty good much better than what i cook by myself also fruit oranges they look pretty bad because kind of but they smell amazing the space station is this sterile very plastic and metal and every never any ever messy always like a very sterile so great to have smells from day i was floating through and i heard a bird chirping and i the heck is and i stopped and i went back the psychologist had sent an file with sounds from and he was listening to birds chirp while he exercised we had a rain sound sent up and i spent about a month going to bed at night with my headset just listening to rain as i fell asleep twitter moon over the south china photographed from the international space station terry weekend we took all the laptops in the station probably or laptops and we put rain on through and all weekend it rained it was really cool at first but by night we were like enough so we went around and turned the rain is a big part of life in space because and when weightless your muscles and bones atrophy so they have this exercise protocol of running on a you put on a shoulder and bungees that pull you down the treadmill is on the wall you have to learn how to run in this weird but over time i got to a point where i could run very which was really cool a bike which is interesting because no handlebars and no just some pedals you just kind of float there and and watch your show after days of more than half of a i came back to earth and had lost of my bone density i was amazed to the space station had shown that humans can live and work in space for a long period of time at least days and come back to earth in great shape while i was in passed away from star trek we were doing these space three space walks in a and my friend from emailed me and gotta do something for so i ran down to the i did the i took a and i tweeted the background there is which just happens to be his home down terry a fighter pilot we had a rather be lucky than good and this was an example of that it was just completely it was not i just happened to take this picture with home town in the background it was a wonderful piece of fate my first space i launched at four in the morning both my launches were at four in the morning if ever going to a great time to go shoot for four in the the views are great about minutes later we were going over the north in the daylight and i saw this blue atmosphere and i never seen that shade of blue never expected seeing a that i had never seen before but that was my first impression of earth in the never seen that shade of blue twitter seen from the international space station terry pictures of sunrises and sunsets never got but the camera does not capture them well enough i want to learn how to paint so that i can paint what i we were in a rocket blew up the same one that launches crew so they delayed our replacement crew while they did an investigation we know how long we were going to be up there but my mentality in going to enjoy and then have the rest of my life to be on earth and that just knowing that there would be an end to and to try to enjoy it while i you launch with a rocket filled with millions of pounds of rocket the word really apply even just being in space if a meteorite hits your spaceship and puts a big hole in all the air will go out you live with the danger of that happening in the space station there are three kinds of air leak or ammonia and we had the ammonia alarm go off for the first time it had never happened in the history of the space station our most serious alarm because ammonia is a very deadly chemical they told us in you can smell worry about because going to how bad it is that alarm went off we spent several hours hiding on the side with the hatch closed because the use only the side does thinking that the space station was possibly dead had there really been an ammonia leak it would have ended
a wonderful and discussion of an immensely complex and issue some final forcing the hand of policy makers and developing responses to poverty are vital to elephant conflict cannot be but we can try to control how humans network of parks and wild lands is needed to allow elephants to roam out demand and the legal market in china is going to be but the government appears to be for the future is not but it is probably limited to small pockets of land an entirely i will but my this excellent panel give us measured hope for the future many countries afraid it will not possible we often forget central and west where elephants are in many areas doomed if we cannot stop the current elephant poaching your grandchildren will probably be able to see wild elephants only in a handful of in the eastern and southern tiny islands of elephants surrounded by oceans of people but unless we all redouble our efforts to combat build community support for reduce reduce trafficking through market and dramatically reduce demand for the number of places with significant numbers of wild functioning as they will be very much smaller than now but there is real think so because high value tourism areas will be maintained they might be like and in in getting to them you and your kids will drive through or fly over farms and livestock grazing lands because people have eradicated the know what the word in is for pest animals with no value vermin current policy is in effect making wildlife vermin from the perspective of rural communities i think that with increasing momentum to listen to the elephant specialists talking about the just local abundant populations in one or two we can get ivory under control and poaching significantly lessened and i strongly believe that if we do want simply islands of elephants but migrating we have to plan this now and in the next years while we have something to work with this applies in where the elephant specialist group just met last week for all of those people who have or are going to have grandchildren the question is back to you are you with we need you to make your desire known to politicians and help us fund the work until the governments and corporations step up their funding and stewardship for elephants and their habitat elephants are whose elephant family focuses on elephants paints a frightening picture of the future the past years of elephant populations have been wiped out without this iconic animal could be facing extinction within which is why this species is listed as endangered they now number as few as across countries in with probably occurring in habitat loss of and fragmentation of populations are causing and then the results of that such as train strikes are killing as well as hunting for ivory though not all elephants have tusks and females do have retaliatory killing for such as by electrocution traps hooked up to the mains or setting out poison bait such as poisoned pineapples are killing what these superb wild giants have been reduced to crop especially in places where people have settled and have no history of living or knowing how to live with stiles also thinks things are looking bleak destruction and fragmentation is the obvious answer it remarkable how well they done in and when you think of the population pressures it looks like poaching for ivory is on the increase in and carvers are still churning out the and read how various states are planning what can be done says we have hope by protecting and keeping habitat areas connected and working with both rural communities and experts alike to understand more where elephants need to move and what they need to eat we can lessen the interaction between people and elephants and help people safely we can work with governments and companies to rationally plan where land change will occur but we need to resource that research and those experts so they are ready with the so there is but we need to act now as we attempt to get control globally on the battle against ivory and illegal poaching in we are learning tremendous lessons to be applied in to protect space and empower people to allow our largest land mammal still have room to roam our biggest project at the moment with other is our corridors campaign on asks why we use funds from tourism to support local communities so they turn to just not enough to go says there are working examples of involving local communities in the way you it simply a drop in the ocean there are million and millions of poor people and just a fraction of them is actually with tourism and you need just a few poachers and a couple of traffickers or brokers to create havoc a huge human toll behind the ivory trade and poor exploited people are a big part of it the same situation in even with the number of poor people who actually benefit from it whose lives are uplifted by its effects is a very small number whatever the solution it has to be more though out and must benefit the poor community in money also fails to reach the communities says hedges the reason is that entrenched big businesses that are not set up to provide significant benefits to the local people in and around the areas corruption is sometimes a problem too governments need to do more to and otherwise help local initiatives and to require more equitable benefit sharing by the big operations you are correct to say that in can generate see the paper i referenced weaver g c complementary benefits of tourism and hunting to communal conservancies in says there is an important role for development aid to play to fill these gaps think community needs are greater than the support they are
bloodbath of an a friend emailed me watching someone get another said over the phone and this in an email from a veteran of the third draft dodger is now commander in to the full flowering of the era of which began with that now glide down the escalator at trump where trump commenced his candidacy with these historic when sends its not sending their best sending people that have lots of and bringing those problems with us bringing drugs bringing crime rapists and i are good ever a monument is erected to the trump then surely these words shades of will be carved into the marble along with coming out of her bucks a and would bring back a hell of a lot worse than in true demagogic trump bypassed the head and spoke directly to the to the biles and bubbling acids of raw emotion he said things that many temperate hardly dared to admit we carried in ourselves were hardly aware of just how deeply we resented our own how angry our interior lives with all this stuff bottled years and years of internalized from a culture that kept insisting on tolerance many discovered just what a drag political correctness was all these and to be free of freed from this code that was jamming us that was relief akin to a primal scream from the start rallies had the air of the tent that same hot thrum of militant exorcism and not fool a friend wrote stand anything but cold honesty right now this is not a winning the which would be bad enough this is white supremacy tempted to say really not that bad stances are things get said in the heat of a and we could take heart in the newly conciliatory trump on display for several days after the election then came the news that the erstwhile chairman of the trump campaign who bears a striking resemblance to the town drunk on the old was named counselor and chief for the incoming trump administration the mainstream press still feels compelled to explain the term but we know we we we white aka honky dig too deeply into the family along with glistening of apocalyptic and a style sense that falls somewhere between for and eye for the straight prior to his gig on the trump spent four years as chairman of which he proudly declared to be

the have to remember that actually all on one a character is his as and what a twisted fate indeed that ever seeking to reconcile and accommodate an pastor in once his presidency is will no longer have to be the least threatening black man in has had to deal with an opposition that very much regarded him as not on the team there was the for starters the conspiracy theories the terrorist founder of teenage crack dealer hanging out on the corner this damage done to is said during one of the republican which is a laugh if wanted to trash the all he had to do on taking office in was sit on his hands and let the hot mess of the bush economy continue its meltdown to the issue is bigger than any particular president after his on one the is that we all go forward with a presumption of good faith in our fellow because that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant and functioning goes to the heart of the matter the system of constitutional government is founded on deliberate fragmentation of the of and and that we all learned in high school civics for government to be effective for government to meet the needs of the people the us constitutional order requires a healthy measure of good faith cooperation among the players this good faith began to fray in the early as leaders in newt and tom delay chief among declared war on all efforts even from those in their own party to govern from a stance of bipartisan cooperation in world of moral were enemy of normal and his allies were fighting no less than a with and as he declared in a speech to the heritage war has to be fought with a scale and a duration and a savagery that is only true of civil so began the constitutional hardball and tactics that have characterized the past of politics you may recall the government shutdowns of and over budget and the impeachment of bill for lying about a in more recent there was the famous dinner at a steakhouse on the evening of the day of inauguration at which congressional leaders with by then a highly paid k street vowed to sabotage presidency by opposing every item on the new economic agenda at a time when jobs a month were disappearing including those items previously supported or even proposed by the all rooting for said of trump when they met recently in the oval office if he senate republican leader later summed up the stance when he publicly single most important thing we want to achieve is for president to be a burying was the and if bringing him down required shredding the constitutional then to hell with the past years of constitutional order the once reserved for only the most major policy became routinely deployed even for matters by withholding funding or refusing to consider appointments to government the senate effectively nullified laws that had been duly enacted in accordance with the constitution at a time when the federal courts had a record number of
he must be disappointed by that typo in the first line of the email that was my first thought when the following landed in my might sound shocking and but i feel shocked or threatened this was just another day on the where people disproportionately people of color and queer people are intimidated and threatened what writer describes as a ceaseless flickering hum of emotional women abandoned to their abusers read around the same time i assume the same signed me up to a which meant i received thousands of unsolicited email newsletter within a few hours thankfully filters learn but it took a minutes of flagging messages to clean up my a mild irritation meanwhile on someone else was sending me pornographic and asking whether penis size matters for a i blocked as sure i will have to block many others in the future in a tedious game of would love to say that this is but not in go as far as to say that this feels entirely just your regular rape threats and dreary dick for one of my is dealing with racial slurs or having her profile photo edited to have for a male people telling him to commit suicide or saying they want his kids to die if we complain about these either overreacting or feeding the trolls but if we speak letting them get away with it by this we fall back on swatting the antagonists away like flies perhaps as a coping telling ourselves that normal most of the the flies are few and far between but you only have to look at the relentless campaigns of hate against public figures like actor and comedian diver tom or games developer to see what happens when the flies form a swarm it becomes exhausting and incredibly difficult for the individual or the police to make on what constitutes a credible in the media you are familiar with how things work but for an average person these types of interactions could be said author of this is why we have nice how did we get and what should we do about many are aggrieved white men who feel like they given the fantasy life they were author of bullies have always found ways to antagonize but digital tools have given them new powers fifty years ago if you wanted to wind up a you could write anonymous messages and leave them on his or her could tease that but there would be no archive and it be amplified it could potentially be upsetting but it be indexed in said the ability of search to index abuse or what she calls that changes the ethical stakes your history follows you meaning those targeted struggle to move on and have a fresh and have been part of the since its inception a side effect of anonymity and unfettered free both critical pillars of the web once restricted to niche forums and with their own codes of ubiquitous social media has brought it into the used to be so few people occupying those spaces and the people who were were a lot more than what you see said means more and more just teenagers in their basements a lot of them are otherwise very well adjusted normal adult men with wives and children and said author of of them fall into the camp of very aggrieved middle aged white men who feel like they given the fantasy life they were owed they tend to take it out on people who are successful or present in a way that makes them feel not to say that white men get harassed but that harassment is more frequently directed at members of historically underrepresented populations whose voices have not always been privileged people who have always had their voices taken seriously tend to be the said arguing that it comes from a sense of trump that same sense of disenfranchisement that propelled trump to the white house with a campaign that normalized says absurdly offensive degrading things about women and people of color and specific groups whether whatever he says these terrible things and that normalizes hate speech in mainstream discourse so normal to open up or any news and see says tenor of discourse that trump and his associates have been engaging in has emboldened some people to say are in charge now and we can say whatever we adds a student at school of communication and comments about sexually harassing women are a reflection of the normalization of violence against threats and rape threats are a form of domination that has been used against women for all of time it ties into seeing women as not fully human and having their value contingent on whether or not they are worthy of said in an effort to draw attention to the ends up amplifying it publications might be trying to troll but some are just calling attention to it but inadvertently or not it ends up more problematic said opens up the vexing question of whether or not to feed the trolls wary of that framing as it comes with a undercurrent the message is you give them attention you get said suggests keeping a record of posts in case a situation escalates and then reporting the perpetrator where possible individuals should make up their minds about whether they mute or following safety guides like this one or this offers an alternative way to handle such by creating a to an explicit against these behaviors as opposed to repeating she said about taking more control of that so that the antagonist is no longer the center of the suggests the rest of the community can help here solidarity is asking how you can help is important basically trying to take a stand and say is not same behaviors that can marginalize and denigrate and traumatize can really bring a group making them feel good and paltry effort was to take
i just found out that i am four weeks cannot carry on with this pregnancy for numerous reasons and i want to have an abortion though it is an option for me in the united in it is not really an option because the to have it done is simply out of the question hoping you can advise me and are able to help i am absolutely read through her email once again and hovered her finger over the send button the message was addressed half a world away to women on a dutch group that mails abortion drugs to pregnant women who live in countries where abortion is outlawed lives in where abortion is restricted but legal making it one of the places where women on web refuses to mail the drugs thought she would try her luck she had lost her job to and in its place she had found only work her rent had gone up she was borrowing money for was no question that she afford to have a child the question was whether she could even afford an had an inkling that what she was asking for help performing her own abortion might not be fully legal but she was out of answers she hit send then she began to case the for other ways she could cause her own this scene feels out of place in that may be because there was a time in this history when thousands of and abortions prompted calls for the procedure to be legal after the us supreme court established a right to a legal in the decision roe v abortions were supposed to become a thing of the almost as soon as the court legalized opponents of abortion rights began to whittle them away congress began prohibiting poor women from using to cover abortions in the largest expansion in allowed insurers to continue to pick and choose the circumstances under which they would cover abortion and allowed states to ban the coverage altogether the two decisions have ensured that millions of women who have sought an abortion have had to pay for it out of pocket and a sweeping wave of laws has closed clinics in many cresting with an awesome force over the last five such a hostile it is no wonder that abortions are still a if largely hidden phenomenon one that even rights groups are only just beginning to grasp one study of abortion patients found that had tried at some point in their induce their own abortions without professional medical assistance another estimated that potentially of women have tried to or at least kind of kept under the so it needs to be talked is no concrete data on how many women in the us have tried to but there is some evidence although it is inconclusive to suggest that attempts are on the rise from to as the economy worsened and a wave of new restrictions choked abortion access around the queries about abortion almost according to an economist who analyzes this crisis of reproductive rights now walks trump as trump has promised to restrict abortion even further he has vowed to nominate justices to the supreme court who might overturn roe v wade because the court is loath to reverse has survived such threats before but trump has explicitly promised to nominate justices who might put roe in their in his first major interview after winning trump described truthfully what might happen to some women if roe v wade were overturned perhaps have to have to go to another he said he was asked trump see what we have to wait and see what happens history has already shown us what happens when women in the us access abortion so has the present day in women on the dutch received more than emails from us women looking for a way to end their own pregnancies group does not send abortion drugs to the because the us does not outright ban women on web agreed to share scores of these emails with the providing an unprecedented window into the lives of women who feel they have no other option but to end their pregnancies the hundreds who wrote to women on web was she contacted the guardian shortly after she found out about her unwanted pregnancy and shared every step of her which eventually took her across an international border she provided including of her travel documents her name has been changed for her she sure if she faced a potential legal risk and in is in a legal gray and many enterprising prosecutors have charged women who carried out their own abortions with crimes felt compelled to feel like such a negative stigma to she said kind of kept under the so it needs to be talked people needed to she that abortion restrictions had real victims not really helping anyone not really protecting anyone just causing women who are in these situations who feel desperate to take desperate letters to women on web form a uniform chorus of desperation and and and appear in dozens of signaling the nature of how these women became stranded he is threatening saying i can never am afraid of what he is capable a variety of an abortion must look like a has to look like a have parenthood wants my bf and i live in our afford an simply cannot afford an teenager in a state where minors need parental consent for an abortion said her parents were forcing her to have her woman in wrote to say that she had gone to her only abortion the shamed me into going back not a citizen and its a little scary i feel very am beside read another email one month before she wrote her she was raped she received her coverage through the insurance plan for military personnel and their families policy is to cover abortion in cases of rape as long as

bestsellers such as the floor lamp and egg chair and threatens to put scores of companies that supply them out of further proposed rule change will slap copyright on iconic designs which never qualified for copyright protection in the first making it a criminal to incorporate any element of them into a new work this means that anyone without a from the copyright holder who is selling for

a few years yahoo chief executive mayer hit the headlines concerning a confidential memo sent to employees the message seemed to go against everything we know about how a economy operates from now everyone must be present and accounted for at the office working from home is memo was carefully worded in the language of collegiality and staff development but employees understood its real if we see we trust surprising that yahoo staff were annoyed known for years that employees are much more productive if able to harness the freedoms that mobile technology can afford being chained to an office can be in many occupations employees feel hard done by and fight back as and rather we see the spread of business commentators believed that yahoo was an exception in this swimming against the tide of management wisdom in this rich information other stories started to emerge that seemed to indicate a sea change investigative reporters at the new times in revealed the shocking techniques used by amazon to manage its office workers you thought its warehouse workers were harassed wait until you join absolutely everything is even the time it takes to answer an email fear and intimidation soon became rife in the transforming annual performance review into a daily as one stressed employee was still to come employees at the telegraph recently discovered heat and motion sensors that tracked whether they were at their desks there was no warning employees simply found the devices on morning they eventually had to the brand name to identify what they were a memo was issued at lunchtime by senior management stating that the new policy was make sure we are making best use of our space in the of this sits very well with the official narrative hierarchies are meant to be dead and buried authoritarian have no place in industries that need workers to use their share be creative and excel at flat company structures and autonomy are the future back in the business guru tom peters even heralded the end of to do if you have a difficult boss read what why does it feel like there are more bosses now than ever telling us what to often adopting a needlessly authoritarian answer the question we need to remember where the idea of management comes from managers help things big need administrators but the modern manager was actually invented in the early us steel industry and with a specific rationale one of the first management deplored how much control average employees had over their jobs he trust and if there was a dispute always have the upper hand so something had to recommended that all knowledge about a job be transferred to a new breed of managers who watch staff like often with a stopwatch in their hand he drove the point home to the extent that workers began to complain that it was hindering their not helping them management was actually getting in the was more than years ago when employers were perhaps less enlightened so what about why are we seeing the same reappear in many including the it universities and there are a number of forces in often told that workers are happier if hired on a flexible be it as contractors or this may suit some but research shows that poorer pay and conditions often increase discontent and feel hard done by and fight back as and rather we see the spread of bosses precisely in those industries we would expect to see fewer hired to keep a lid on the seething dissatisfaction caused by and second driver is inequality the greater the division between those at the top and the bottom of any then the more monitoring and supervision see because rising perceptions of injustice make conflict and more the societal for no coincidence that the increasing wealth gap has seen more surveillance and policing the same principle applies to work just look at the figures in the average pay was times greater than the average worker in the ratio was in the real pay increased by between and workers only got over the same period under these tend to become increasingly even if such measures interfere with people doing their jobs third reason for all these managers is the huge importance placed today on metrics shareholders demand them senior bureaucrats swear by them pulling their weight and who the only problem is that marginal product what you add to an profit margin as an individual is notoriously difficult to measure productivity usually comes from a collective effort and how on earth do you quantify the more emotional and social dimension of many jobs the face of such employers either go over the top with every big data tool such as or simply give up and resort to like yahoo research has discovered a sort of sociological law when it comes to hierarchies and bosses they can easily take on a life of their own and automatically proliferate companies end up needing more supervisors to check on the supervisors this is how become inundated with and sooner or later all these managers need to justify their normally by creating extra work somewhere else in the why managers should show a softer side read problem is not really with managers per usually under the lash as much as anyone else the steep and hierarchies that have mushroomed all over society in the last especially in the employment sector that gap between a technocratic elite at the top and everyone else has never seemed so vast this fosters distrust dissent and inevitably of the knowledge society once promised we could have our cake extreme form of and eat it too it turned out to be a ruse now workers have the worst of both worlds definitely on their own in terms of economic insecurity but not left alone far from there a yes radically reduce the gulf between rulers and ruled managers and managed in other

for someone who made his career writing about and founding media is surprisingly downbeat about what they can the trump election has shown that we are ascribing too much value to what media can he says a week after victory has its it has to continue to do its even more important today but the view that it will somehow change the world and change or give people the right just too much to not alone in doubting the extent of the established influence following an election result which almost no outlet predicted and very few supported but in the many commentators have said at least some of the blame should be laid at the door of and its fake filter bubbles shares their particularly about the world where people have no connection to in which many millions of us citizens appear to live the fact of what they believe about is doing this or is doing this just he says many of the complaints from those working in or newspapers stem from an unrealistic belief in their own think that while obviously this is a huge we are trying to get out of media way more than capable of he says not like if the majority of the media goes or a big proportion of the media goes that suddenly people are going to miss has experience of the impermanence of media from his first which lasted not much more than a decade he launched the site in taking what was then a relatively novel approach by applying lessons from one part of the such as the recording to other areas such as which were grappling with the disruptive powers of the was acquired in by guardian media group for an undisclosed sum in the millions of pounds it was run as a standalone business and stayed until before leaving to travel the world for two years in early sold to another digital media which later that year shuttered the brand and itself closed in had returned from his trip with a plan to apply approach to the world of travel and in the summer of he launched a business called with travel journalist most of those writing about the travel industry were focused on one sector such as airlines or based his plan on the that simply see an process of getting around the world that seemed to leave a gap for a media taking a more holistic approach while writing in a less more accessible way than the established trade the early who operated as chief planned to use the reporting as a foundation from which to sell data about starting with the way it was marketed things did not go to and while trying to drum up investment in he hit a brick wall able to raise the he says was the most humbling six months of my professional career we were three months away from running out of were or people at that point we had a famous as in famous in our company moment when we went to for our first it was a very seminal moment for us as it was supposed to be a celebration of us closing and the team tried to work out how to continue growing without any outside investment the answer was to drop plans to sell data and focus on more established ways of making money in events and advertising years says the business is now with revenue growth heading for upwards of a year within the next months traffic is not around million visitors a but priority is its list of email which stands at more than the company now employs close to mostly at its new and is expanding into with hires such as a editor based in he chose to build his second company around did not stop wading into arguments about the travails of established media including the guardian he says most mainstream outlets are operating more like where you hope and pray you show up in a but he pretend to have all the have a prescription for any of those he says hard even in our business which is doing very well people my god you guys are doing so and i say then i look back if they knew how hard it is to build a media always going to be victory is going to make things not just for the media but also the travel which says is facing a huge challenges from the insular ideologies that are taking over western politics think trump has already said a lot of things that will enervate people coming to the us even if he does half the things he said it will have a bad effect on the travel rhetoric stands directly opposite to what the promise of travel stands for the most progressive expression of human curiosity fringe is the new mainstream it is worrying for especially for which sits at the of immigration there a link between digital filter bubbles and the new geographical isolationism taking hold of western a direct line from how we have created a around in many ways as a result of that has led to the rise of and a virtual reality which manifests itself in believing in fake dispiriting picture paints is tempered by a belief in both the power of travel to increase understanding and the more and tolerant views of younger even if they will take or two to assert themselves good news is that the world is he says not like saying after the first bubble the is it turns out that people continued to use the the number of people from parts of the world is going to continue to which is changing in the is essentially the ultimate foil for any kind of isolationism same in same in the much as us older people like to laugh at the reality is that they are a ton smarter than

the challenge of fake and misleading news has come to the fore in the wake of the us presidential election has bore the brunt of the criticism that it allowed misinformation to spread unfettered on its skewing perceptions and possibly the outcome of the election something mark vehemently did fake news and polarized politics get trump read pressure on and the social network has promised to do more to eliminate hoaxes like has blocked fake news sites from its ad network the latter should strangle websites that deliberately publish misleading content by cutting off their advertising despite these is unlikely to explore the many options available to it because it simply has very little motivation to do experts mark is being polite about absolutely no way that will start preventing people from sharing what they want to share the core idea of the said writer and professor clay who studies social business model relies on people sharing and engaging with content news and gossip regardless

traditional news publishing values such as verification to the network where a the frog can carry as much currency as a new times is only motivated to censor content when it makes users which is why

on a afternoon in early sister drove into the compound of the catholic convent where she lived in the capital of and called out to her fellow nuns there was no sign of the other elderly sisters who lived in the so sister went to find father the head of the to ask if he had seen them he tried phoning but there was no reply so they walked across the shady compound to the where they found the curtains and called but there was no answer the priest was about to force open the but sister walked around to a side which was unlocked inside she found a horrific scene sister was lying dead in her blood pooling around her head in the bedroom next door lay the body of sister both women had been and their throats would have celebrated her birthday the next day sister was these three elderly friends had worked for almost years in south an eastern province of the democratic republic of that was at the of a series of conflicts sometimes known collectively as the great the deadliest in the modern history when the three sisters finally left south for they were looking forward to a more peaceful retirement called the local and his superiors in lorries and pickup trucks arrived disgorging police and and security forces circled the compound at around the congregation poured out of mass in their brightly straight into a crime scene a papal official stood over the bodies and wept outside the young women the sisters had taught to sew wailed with grief when noises woke sister in the she phoned father think the killer is still she who remained collected accompanied the bodies to the and then returned to the convent father wanted to find somewhere else for sister and the other nuns to sleep but the sisters insisted they wanted to stay and sleep at the convent as night heavily armed police patrolled the noises woke sister during the she telephoned father who was still writing down an account of the previous day think the killer is still sister told him in a shaky priest hurried to the but he was too late sister was already dead in an act of violence unimaginable to those who knew the small and wiry the killer had cut off her next shocked and angry locals closed their businesses and gathered outside the convent to protest against the murders people claimed the killers were being protected by the police some protesters saw the notorious head of the state intelligence general enter the convent some time father emerged from the gates and appealed to the protesters to disperse peacefully three weeks a leaflet was found at the convent urging the mission not to pursue an investigation into the murders at the convent horrified not just because of their brutality but because they took place almost a decade after the end of the civil in which were slaughtered and million a fifth of the population fled their homes in the wake of that which divided the nation along ethnic between and vowed that their country would never again experience such brutal missions to countries riven by civil strife are liable to get caught up in toxic politics the powerful catholic church in which represents of has come under suspicion for providing aid to militant groups during the civil war but it has also regularly government and paid a price for it in during the civil when the majority rose up against the abusive gunmen executed two priests and a lay preacher suspected of supporting the rebels a year a moderate archbishop was murdered by gunmen more than catholic clerics were assassinated in in the first three years of the civil war when church leaders have denounced the violence of the warring political leaders have often seen them as a threat and done whatever was necessary to silence murders at the convent followed a ripple of

sometimes i think i have never seen anything as strong as that mean that i like and admire everything about her not here to argue about who she just to note what she did i watched her plow through opposition and attacks the like of which no other candidate has ever faced and still win the popular vote to defeat her it took an unholy cabal far beyond what faced when he was the campaign of swimming with the tide of disgust about the bush administration as the new times the time all the ballots are she seems likely to be ahead by more than votes and more than percentage points she will have won by a wider percentage margin than not only gore in but also in and john f in twitter concession know can flip that and see that trump was such a weak candidate it took decades of scheming and an extraordinary international roster of powerful players to lay the groundwork that made his election possible defeating in the electoral college took the gutting of the voting rights act by republican appointees to the supreme court it took vast republican voter suppression laws and tactics set in place over many years it took voter intimidation at many polling places it took the long republican campaign to blow up the boring bureaucratic irregularity of use of a private email server into a scandal that the media obediently picked up and reheated us yet to join ranks of countries with female leaders read took the director of the using that and his power to stage a misleading smear attack on days before the election in flagrant violation of the custom of avoiding such intervention for days before an election it took a compliant mainstream media running after his sabotage like a golden retriever chasing a tennis ball it took decades of conservative attacks on the served as deputy counsel to the senate whitewater that fishing expedition that began with an investigation in a messy real estate deal in before bill presidency and ended with a campaign to impeach him on charges related to completely unrelated sexual activities during his second took a nearly reality the that deified racism and narcissism as essential to success and power as the feminist media critic points trump said and did was framed in a way to flatter and more flatter his the colossal infomercial fictionalized the cheating businessman as an unqualified success and gave him a kind of brand recognition no other candidate had it took the full support of fox whose roger was so committed to him that after leaving the company following allegations of decades of sexual harassment of he joined the trump campaign it took the withdrawal of too many from even that of journalism into the partisan unreliability of sites and bubbles of social took the mainstream of failure to address climate change as the most important issue of our time it took decades of most media outlets letting the propaganda arm create the false framework of two equally valid opinions rather than reporting the overwhelming scientific consensus and tremendous danger of climate change to stop it also took using as a tool of evidently considering his grudge against the democratic nominee important enough to try to aid the campaign of a racist authoritarian now appears to have so close a relationship with that he often appears on the channel and news site rt he tweeted protests when president information was included in the panama papers hack and has been coy about where his leaked information on the democratic national committee came intelligence experts say it came from and made it clear that he favored win the day dropped his the new times ran a story reassuringly titled investigating sees no clear link to with its own underplayed revelation buried the officials have become increasingly based on the evidence they have that direct goal is not to support the election of as many democrats have but rather to disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine standing in the world more beef over loss is with liberal young and old read it took a shortsighted campaign of hatred on the an almost hysterical rage like nothing i have ever seen before about any public figure some uncritically picked up outright and spin to feed their hate and rejected anything that diluted the purity and focus of that including larger questions about the other candidate and the fate of the earth it was so extreme that in recent i was attacked for posting news stories on social media by furious people who took the position that to be overtly was to be covertly if the perfect is the enemy of the whose friend is the greater of two a lot of people seemed to think the primary ended the night trump was elected i saw that from climate and others who you might expect would have turned to face the clear and present danger of a trump presidency i for much about failure to address the pipeline adequately which was and but overshadowed by what we heard so little million dollars or so invested in the pipeline and the guarantee he would use presidential powers to push it and every pipeline like it through impossible to disconnect the irrational emotionality from and the misogyny continues since election been hearing too many men of the left go on and on about how was a weak candidate wondered about that word not only because it is so often associated with but because what calling her weakness was their refusal to support her as if sent a pink lifeboat and we sent it because we wanted a blue and now we are very upset that people are as my brilliant friend put it some point soon we need to discuss whether sanders would have been able to but helpful it just sounds like democrats should have cut into lead in the misogynist
thousand how much time you could potentially waste on email over the course of your working according to a recent post article to put that number in roughly equivalent to spending five years on the writer we spend our days of how we spend our and we are spending our days largely on email the average office worker dips into their about times an receives about messages a and spends nearly of their total working week in their way to a better not read just because spending all this time on email mean enjoying it when i talk to people about their email the most common feelings they mention are and overwhelm certainly not enthusiasm research shows that the more frequently we check our the more stressed out we why do we spend so much time doing something that we particularly the fact is that even though we might not care for the content of every email we many of us are addicted to the act of checking email it activates a primal impulse in our brains to seek out rewards and in this regard not very different from in the the psychologist bf skinner invented a device called the conditioning now known as the skinner which he used to test theories on rats skinner wanted to see what effect different kinds of positive such as food and negative such as electric would have on the he experimented with putting the rats on a fixed schedule of reinforcement for if the rat pressed the lever inside the it would receive a food pellet if it continued pressing the every hundredth time the rat would receive another pellet skinner also experimented with a variable schedule in this scenario the rat know when the reward was coming it might have to press the lever times to get a or it might have to press the lever times to get a pellet the system was and the rat could never know exactly when the reward was the rats were significantly more motivated when they were on the variable schedule skinner found that even if he took away the rewards for the rats on the variable they would keep furiously pressing the lever for a very long time before giving up much in than the rats on the fixed schedule this starting to sound familiar for better or humans respond to positive rewards very similarly to rats and as a economist who studies the irrational actions of explained to email is a random rewards of work is making us miserable learn to live again read of the time when you the to check your email you get something disappointing or bothersome a communication from a frustrated client or a boss with an urgent request but every once in a while you press the lever and you get something exciting an email from a friend if really a cat video and those random rewards that we find so addictive they make us want to push the lever again and again and even when we have better things to it cuts both while you might get something you also might get something upsetting or and that feeling of queasy uncertainty is another aspect of strange many times have you confidently sent off a message only to find yourself just minutes over why you have not yet received a wondering if your request or your phrasing had been received as it was worried that you yourself should have written back said something asked for or asked for problem springs from a lack of social feedback normally when we communicate with someone in or even on the we are reading a thousand little social cues as we talk and deciding what to do next based on those cues it often happens that we will start to say something but based on feedback we get from the other think better of it and take another tack when we communicate through that social feedback loop is absent emails lack the facial physical and vocal tone that typically shape our interpretation of what someone is saying and allow us to adjust our delivery in order to get our true meaning results in what the psychologist calls a natural towards email argues that if the sender feels positive about an then the receiver usually feels neutral and if the sender feels neutral about the then the receiver typically feels negative about it in other as if every message you send gets automatically downgraded a few positivity notches by the time someone else receives all well and you might be but what am i supposed to do about solution to our email problem lies with getting more in touch with what makes us uniquely human overcoming the negativity and allaying some of its attendant requires us to upgrade our empathy and enthusiasm when it comes to digital communication to communicate more like feeling humans than impersonal robots exchanging recent study done by the people behind the boomerang email crunched the data from millions of email exchanges and found that messages that expressed emotion were most likely to get a response and among emails using positive words and subjective language earned the most replies in other messages that encouraged people and expressed a point of view were the most effective we want we want to communicate with people who are interesting and quality that separates us from animals and robots alike is the ability to set goals and pursue them with focus as we are uniquely equipped to train our attention on a given task and keep it there to not be distracted by random rewards or false urgency or of missing to focus instead on goals and meaningful rewards but right now we are choosing to succumb to addictive allure and to let it dictate our our and our lists at work rather than up the willpower that we know is necessary to turn our attention away from our data is clear about

pledges are increasingly hollow many communities are taking matters into their own and some are hopeful they might be able to secure a solution that would mean they are no longer stuck in the digital dark government has previously claimed that of the country should have access to broadband by the end of but last month successor may highlighted the scale of the challenge when she complained that of people living in rural and so many small get a decent not just in remote locations take for example he is a web developer who is forced to go to and the library to upload his work because his broadband speed is so lives in in just a few hundred from the towers of canary wharf as he central yet thousands of residents are only getting around two megabits per second the average broadband according to is is due to be updated in the coming and broadband is defined as or more in urban it is often blocks of flats that are are many other digital black holes around the earlier this year website named the places with the slowest average with the list topped by the village of where the typical figure was just and the lowest speed measured was just live in in west according to the news and information site lies seventh from the bottom out of constituencies for is the case with many places dealing with the everyday challenges of trying to work within an area with speeds supposedly often lower than those at mount everest base frustrations run urban it is often blocks of flats that are particularly afflicted because many of these buildings have a dedicated line from the ground floor to the nearest telephone exchange they are made of and can run long slowing the speed at which information travels in some communities fed up with waiting for to get to them are turning to the growing numbers of smaller companies and local ventures that offer potential solutions for those in supposedly include a local service provider based in that is owned by the diocese of and publishing company and uses parish church spires to deliver broadband to remote who was its chief executive until the beginning of this cable is a good technology for high transition speeds in urban but much more expensive per person in less populated regions you need to use other he reliable broadband is more important than for the majority of people for those getting by on under would be how are some of these people about live opposite canary which is almost central yet the area has one of the largest number of lines this means there are very few cabinets and so more expensive for to upgrade if lucky enough to live near the exchange you can get or but for thousands of us nearer got a pressure group and have been fighting for a better connection for four or five i became about five years ago i knew it would be an but i how much i can work from home when emailing or coding but i upload anything there are some nice and a good library in the area it feel like an inconvenience so much until you how much time wasting it affect the quality of my but i definitely have to put in longer hours to make up the got a pressure and been fighting for a better connection for four or five years and tried on around homes in the area get broadband faster than and hover around the local council made an election promise a few years ago to solve the and last summer the managing director of outlined what he was going to do to improve it in by march afraid i just believe what saying none of published plans addresses the issues of those most so the figure change much in the foreseeable says a company called which in bringing optic broadband direct to buildings is being very currently have plans to connect single which has a lot so this will only be part of the adds that a fast unlimited supplier covering central tried to extend its service to his area a year but its planning application for a new mast was rejected by now feel at an utter loss we would love the council to work and relish to reapply but to date they have not responded to our questions about says that they need the fastest broadband be happy with between and live in the village of two miles outside the busy market town of rural but not with several industrial estates and local small businesses we only recently moved here before we used the website postcode check on the property in it indicated that broadband was in

a month ago i tried to write a column proposing mean nicknames for on the basis that it would be funny to turn the tables on him for the cruel diminutives he applied to pull it off there is a darkness about trump that negates that sort of a folly so an incompetence so profound that no insult could plumb its has run one of the lousiest presidential campaigns ever in saying so i am not referring to his business practices or his vulgar remarks about women i mean this in a purely technical this man fractured his own party his convention was a fiasco he had no ground game to speak of the list of celebrities and pundits and surrogates taking his side on the campaign trail was extremely short he needlessly offended countless groups of disabled mothers of crying the bush and among others he even lost for now he is going to be president of the united states the woman we were constantly assured was the candidate of all time has lost to the least qualified candidate of all time everyone who was anyone rallied around and it make any difference the man too incompetent to insult is now going to sit in the oval whence he will hand down his verdicts on the grandees and sages of the old there is a bright side to a trump victory after there was a reason that tens of millions of good people voted for him and maybe he will live up to their high regard for him he has pledged to the of and maybe he will sincerely tackle that task he has promised to renegotiate and maybe will finally come to pass maybe win so much for us he once predicted in a campaign that get sick of not deceive ourselves we going to win anything what happened on is a both for liberalism and for the world as president trump goes about settling scores with his former picking fights with other and unleashing his special deportation police on this group and we will all soon have cause to regret his ascension to the presidential throne what we need to focus on now is the obvious what the hell went what species of guided our democratic leaders as they went about losing what they told us was the most important election of our at the top she has an impressive she worked hard on the campaign trail but she was exactly the wrong candidate for this populist moment an insider when the country was screaming for an outsider a technocrat who offered when the country wanted to take a sledgehammer to the machine twitter victory speech in was the democratic candidate because it was her turn and because a victory would have moved every democrat in up a notch whether or not she would win was always a secondary something that was taken for granted had winning been the number one several more suitable candidates were ready to go there was with his powerful plainspoken and there was an inspiring and largely figure each of them would probably have beaten but neither of them would really have served the interests of the party so democratic leaders made their candidate even though they knew about her closeness to the her fondness for and her unique vulnerability on the trade issue each of which trump exploited to the fullest they chose even though they knew about her private email server they chose her even though some of those who studied the foundation suspected it was a sketchy try to put over such a nominee while screaming that the republican is a monster is to court disbelief if trump is a as liberals often democrats should have put in their strongest player to stop not a party hack chosen because it was her turn choosing her indicated either that democrats mean what they said about that their opportunism took precedence over the or maybe supporters among the media help either it always struck me as strange that such an unpopular candidate enjoyed such robust and unanimous endorsements from the editorial and opinion pages of the but it was the quality of the enthusiasm that really harmed her with the same arguments repeated over and two or three times a with nuance and contrary views all the act of opening the newspaper started to feel like tuning in to a cold war propaganda station what it consisted was virtually without flaws she was a peerless leader clad in saintly a a caring benefactor of women and a warrior for social scandals real the economy was doing well was already people supporting if they it was only because they were botched humans racism was the only conceivable reason for lining up with the republican candidate how did the crusade the fourth estate came together in an unprecedented professional consensus they chose insulting the other side over trying to understand what motivated them they transformed opinion writing into a vehicle for high moral boasting what could possibly have gone wrong with such an put this question in slightly more general terms and you are confronting the single great mystery of the class just spent the year rallying around a professional really all that and either insulting or silencing everyone who accept their assessment and then they lost maybe time to consider whether something about shrill shouted from a position of high social that turns people even larger problem is that there is a kind of chronic complacency that has been rotting liberalism for a hubris that tells democrats they need do nothing they need deliver nothing really to anyone except their friends on the jet and those nice people at the rest of us are treated as though we have nowhere else to go and no role to play except to vote enthusiastically on the grounds that these democrats are the thing between us and the end of the world it is a

the emails that really matter are the ones being slowly released by from the hacked account of campaign chair john they are last scandal in a year running over with but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere they are a window into the soul of the democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party class to which i refer is not rising in angry they are by

tony former editor has a nickname for him was how put it in the new director faces fury for cryptic letter about email inquiry read there have been many behind the rise and rampage of trump included the republican with its years of divisiveness and racially charged the with its collective chase of the next shiny and the baby feeling the cultural and economic ground give it was who sparked this strange political creature into life as the ghostwriter of bestselling book the art of the he did more than anyone to create the public persona in it he translated coarse ramblings into charming straight talk and came up with the phrase which captures brilliantly an approach to business and politics in which everything is the the most beautiful helped give trump the sweet smell of success now seemingly irresistible to millions of people clinging to the been he says the nearly years after the book was the main thing i felt i want to be as far away from this man as i but i feel i created because he was a real estate developer and reality television star who it that consequential to the building on the foundation of the art of the trump spent a decade hosting the reality show the reinforcing his image as a preternatural businessman with the power to say blurring the boundaries between reality and reality just as he would throughout the presidential many supporters say they trust him to run like a the business of is business it was no coincidence that he launched his presidential campaign at trump a marbled cathedral of capitalism in he is a man who is a chameleon and have any core beliefs beyond his own and simply think that much about it until he decided to run for president and it became clear that this going to just fade that he was actually in a position to win the nomination when i my contributed to creating the public image of the man who is and people he were writing the art of the deal call it told the in an interview that broke decades of silence on the matter certainly felt a kind of moral imperative to step in and say what i knew about a man i considered to be so and i am very relieved that i trump he observed was vulgar and a narcissistic liar with a short attention no appetite for reading books and an business record a trump presidency he lead to martial the end of press freedom and the risk of nuclear dangerous worse than i imagined when he began to run unthinkable horrifying way more out of control in the last couple of months than ever seen him he have any core beliefs beyond his own and twitter tony with photographer and trump at the book party for the art of the deal at trump in fell into writing the book almost by accident a liberal journalist in he wrote a scathing magazine article on only to receive a note from the ever greedy for saying he liked it when went to interview him for trump said he wanted to write an even though he was only suggested instead a book called the art of the deal trump agreed and said he should write series trumps presidential election in two cities read a high mortgage and a second child on the needed the money he struck his own a joint half of the advance and half the royalties it paid off in financial if not spiritual the art of the deal sold more than a million copies and spent weeks atop the new times bestseller at the felt he was selling but to say he feels regret alone would be too simple spent a long time thinking about why i did he muses the only choice i made that not proud of in my life a complicated question to say whether i would do it differently today and if i knew everything i know about what would happen to of course i do it the complexity is that the experience of writing that book was so in a negative that it led me to change my life dramatically and move from a focus on being successful and earning more money to really exploring what a meaningful life looks quit journalism and set up a consulting the energy which aims to boost productivity with healthier workplaces spent years doing stuff proud that not sure i would have gotten to if i written that book it gave me such a profound experience of the wrongness the direction of my life was taking so does good things and bad things over the course of a life if you get to the age i am and feel good about the life hard to i wish done this differently or that maybe i have landed where i delivered an address to the oxford union in the last with the title the belly of the how trump led me on the path to he are the consequences of the choices you make that you to but can little imagine potentially huge remains to be seen who else will find a moment of after election day on probably not the facing bitter infighting after hostile takeover it will also be a time for the media to look at itself closely last the republican candidate bush told press playing you guys like a fiddle by saying outrageous things and garnering chairman of network may not be good for but damn good for by march trump was already estimated to have earned of media attention there will be hard questions over the thousands of hours of airtime he has been given and whether his bigotry should have been
