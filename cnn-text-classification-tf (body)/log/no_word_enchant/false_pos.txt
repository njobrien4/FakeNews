the 2016 presidential election has left the country more divided than ever as many continue to celebrate trumps others are fighting their way through the five stages of grief surrounding defeat and president departure as much as some would wish many of the wars that have stormed social media have extended through families and friendships with thanksgiving just a couple of days people are concerned that opposing voters may find it difficult to enjoy a long meal together politics should not ruin is always at least one person who arrives at the family gathering ready to talk politics and express why their view is the right one these are the worst kind of guests politics should be the uninvited guest to thanksgiving festivities as people from around the country celebrate the many reasons to be thankful this year anyone that brings up politics over thanksgiving with an aim of convincing another or adding insult to injury should be dismissed and possibly not invited trump has done many distasteful things throughout the recent but ruining thanksgiving should not be one of them families work hard to set up the perfect holiday gathering so they can rehash old bond with the newest watch their favorite football team win or and celebrate life over a table filled with favorite foods politics should not ruin instead of a deadly redirect the conversation back to what really without the likes of a tumultuous election holidays have the potential to produce large amounts of anxiety relatives and near and all gathered into one location hashing out competitive family updates can be stressful enough add some spiked cider to that mix and it becomes a recipe for a potential holiday so there is no need for politics to ruin thanksgiving should remain a family long after trump takes the oval so politics should not accompany the turkey at the dinner table somewhere down the attendees will be split along bipartisan lines instead of joining why not bow out before blowing up more than preserving important relationships should be the focal emotions have already complicated as many have known it navigating thanksgiving dinner should not be an added stress as many who are already bruised by the election are now dreading what should be an entertaining and eventful family gathering of food and fellowship this is a time for expressing thanks while making new not overshadowed by the results of a turbulent electoral should not ruin what has been noted as one of favorite holidays with multiple personalities and beliefs at the dinner the only safe way to handle politics at thanksgiving dinner is by avoiding it not only is it neither the time nor the but avoidance protects everyones health and sanity the holidays intent is to bring people together peacefully and to celebrate this great resiliency and families dread holiday after trumps election image courtesy of image courtesy of pixel image courtesy of license family holiday stress thanksgiving
