email if this story put a smile on your literally nothing will an girl from pa has been interested in politics and government from a very young and she followed the historic campaign of closely when lost on that meant something incredible for she still gets to dream of being the first female president this must be a truly special moment for the moment made her concession speech opportunity to become the first woman elected to the oval office opened right back up though it may not be for maybe even this key milestone in feminism is all to aspire toward some may say that another woman will be elected the first female president in the three decades before even eligible to but if the election is any it looks like she is still very much in the running to break the gender barrier in the oval office who could even be the first female president to abortion if roe v wade is overturned at some point in the next four it must feel truly incredible for girls in to see that this huge accomplishment is still on the theirs for the eventual taking the fact that most intolerant tendencies prevailed over means millions of girls can still envisage themselves as the one to make that landmark feminist and it get more powerful than that were uplifted as hell right when the time you can certainly count on our vote
the west is escalating its of media as weapons of information warfare that need but gilbert finds that accusation just another part of the wests own propaganda war one of the wests top points in condemning regime since has been his alleged suppression of democratic including an assault on media freedom and imposition of propaganda this the accusation was repeated in a resolution of the parliament calling for stronger in defense of values against information warfare from the charges that media are only an instrument of state propaganda directed at the domestic population to keep citizens in line and at foreign audiences to sow dissent among neighbors and within the union are taken as a matter of faith with almost no proofs adduced anyone who questions this group think is immediately labeled a tool of or worse president answering questions from citizens at his annual event on government i experienced this firsthand in march as one of three debaters on the a public affairs i objected to remarks by a fellow chairman of the parliaments foreign relations committee who maintained that crushed all liberties and his country has no free press based on my familiarity with the many different political lines of the print media and of the patently behind the national radio station and television station i countered for coverage of events in the was more and free than coverage in the lashed out with the slanderous and how much did the pay you to say the broadcaster then allowed this exchange to air freely i have ruminated on this exchange ever since and sought incontrovertible proof of the relative freedom of expression on broadcast media my close examination of the wildly popular political talk shows on television first as a spectator and then as a participant has provided just that i have written previously about my initial experience going back six months to when i first took part in a program on the state special correspondent i mentioned at the time the nearly permanent presence on these programs of domestic opposition figures as well as of foreigners from the and in who could be counted on to present views on the political topic of the days discussion at sharp variance with the line assessing the talk shows in early autumn i appeared on the same presenters new show sixty as well on what is probably the most respected show of this evening with another production has done television interviews with and may be considered to be as close to power as people in this medium get his personal views are probably more nationalist than the ruling united but on his shows gives time on air to very diverse and foreign views some of the estimated million who took part in immortal regiment parades across the country over three days in may in the past i broadened my experience with the talk show format by participating in shows on the other major state will and on the largest commercial television meeting this accelerated learning was facilitated by the presidential which made talking heads from like myself a rather hot commodity on television at least briefly in speaking to fellow panelists during break in interviews with i gathered some inside information about the production side of the talk including their target their technical aspects and their substantive positioning anyone looking over television programming in general quickly finds that talk shows as a format take up a very large part of broadcast time of the focus of talk shows may be highly and political talk shows were traditionally an evening as is the case with the shows cited while daytime programming more typically focuses on housewives daydreams of romance or tips for and the like in this it was a bold move when two years ago decided to launch a daily political talk show will in as the target audience proved to be women and viewers aged and although it appears there are also a fair number of viewers watching the program in the work place going daytime the ratings captured by this show typically are in the meaning that or so percent of all television viewers in at the given time are tuned to the given yielding an audience numbering in the millions on when i appeared on the show dedicated to analysis of the election the numbers spiked to as one might well understand given the very great interest among ordinary in the outcome of the race for the presidency and the outlook for war or peace a orchestra performing at roman theater on may after backed by air reclaimed the ancient city from the state from of the as time will tell presenter explained to the decision to appear on daytime television called for certain production decisions differentiating the programs from the evening talk shows the expectation of a less sophisticated audience meant that the language of panelists should be free of political science jargon and allusion to little known names or philosophies said panelists are asked to pitch their arguments as they would talking to their their mom or their lover on the other overly calm discussion is not seen as a benefit the presenter explains that his audience sitting at home at is in need of an adrenaline and the normal penchant of panelists to shout down one another in a is not discouraged in the way it is on evening programming the evening viewer is assumed to have come home from work and is seated in his armchair before the wants his nerves soothed more than excited all political talk shows on the main channels are produced in the and all feature on screen the caption live on air where and when these shows are broadcast live versus rebroadcast from video tapes is another matter for the programs are broadcast live to the far where they appear at the end of evening broadcasts

the mainstream media is faulting trump for a turbulent start to the presidential but part of the chaos is baked into the process and its excessively large job says analyst r pillar disarray in the trump transition apparatus has been a major news so much so that one of the recent twitter offensives has been to assert that there any disarray and to castigate the new times for covering the disarray amid all the transition horse race coverage of in and out and which appointment will be even more controversial than other almost no one is taking this episode as another reminder of how needless is much of this confusion and turmoil trump and mike pence during day three of the republican national convention grant the united states is alone among advanced representative democracies in subjecting itself to disruption in which thousands of government officials are replaced every time the electorate changes the political leadership far more common among sister democracies is changing of government that entails replacement of a slate of ministers and a small number of assistants and with a permanent professional service underneath them charged with carrying out whatever policies are identified with the leaders whom the voters have elected most of the positions that have been the focus so far of the transition in the united states are posts that would be changing as well in those other democracies but there are thousands more jobs to the turmoil is just beginning the confusion is worse this year because so many of the presumed policies are themselves confused extrapolations from fragmentary and often contradictory comments he made during the with no prior public service on his part from which to draw conclusions because of the quality of so much of what passes for a trump more is riding this year than most years on who wins the contests for plum jobs but the disadvantages of the whole disruptive process are not unique to this transition or to trump unnecessary disruptions one of the biggest disadvantages is the sheer disruption with all the resulting interruptions to governmental programs and foreign relations newcomers are still learning the location of rest rooms and the phone numbers of essential contacts elsewhere in the government as continuing business must be transacted it also has become routine with each transition for many senior positions to remain vacant for months after the inauguration president returning to the white house on white house photo by the quadrennial purge of upper levels of the government may be consistent with the habit of thinking of policy in terms of discrete but it is inconsistent with the larger reality that notwithstanding the understandable focus on where political parties and candidates differ most of the important business and important interests of the united states continue across administrations this certainly is true of the vast majority of issues in foreign relations here the trump transition has made transition confusion among overseas partners even worse by eschewing the usual procedure of coordinating a contacts with foreign leaders through the state departments operations center the politically sensitive matter of who gets a phone call before whom has been thrown to the wind and the ordering determined by such things as whether pro golfer had trumps phone number to give to his prime minister not least and the knowledge that comes from continuous work on a problem matter a lot in the sound administration of policy that is what one gets from a professional civil service and does not get from most newbie political appointments political support appears so far to be at least as important a criterion in trumps appointments as it is with other incoming administrations it is not what makes for carefully crafted and skillfully executed policy passing out plums the usual rationale for making political appointments in the thousands is that this helps assure that the elected presidents policies will be fully implemented and is thus consistent with the democratic principle of policy reflecting the will of the voters who elected that president political adviser to trump from in the filling of those jobs often has nothing to do with the will of the results in policies that may even be contrary to that and puts into office people more inclined to pursue their own agendas rather than any agenda associated with the president or any platform on which he or she ran in most transition probably the single factor that most influences which of the ambitious and willful people aspiring to senior executive branch jobs will get the jobs is which of those early in the primary stage of the election made better political predictions than other people and hitched their wagons to what turned out to be the winning horse amid the disarray of this we have the added spectacle of senior appointments depending on such things as internal squabbling over who runs the which in turn depends on such things as the getting revenge on the previous transition head because he had prosecuted the father for tax evasion and other crimes none of this has much of anything to do with democracy the periodic purging of the senior governmental ranks is one of several ways in although may be reluctant to admit democracy lags behind democracy elsewhere a better this years election gives multiple reasons to long for a parliamentary system one reason is that those appointments that are the focus in the united states of transition team politics and possibilities such as a john or would instead mostly go to members of the winning party who had been shadow had themselves been elected by the and had acquired and demonstrated some expertise with clusters of issues as exhibited in parliamentary debate the system also makes for far clearer and better understanding of who is responsible for policy and who should be held accountable for failures or rewarded for successes notwithstanding the advantages of checks and balances in the it does not provide democratic accountability when

level of opulence and one which even minor princes like enjoyed but hunting was not just a topic for artistic representation at the hands of a or a it was a dangerous especially since prevailing attitudes towards gun control and safety were almost as primitive as those held in today musicians were not spared mortal danger the male alto and writer on music who was also among the funniest and

donate speaks in on march la n by on trump managed to pull the biggest upset in us politics by tapping successfully into the anger of white voters and appealing to the lowest inclinations of people in a manner that would have probably impressed propagandist himself but what exactly does trump victory and what can one expect from this megalomaniac when he takes over the reins of power on what is trump political if and is a will us foreign policy be any different under a trump some years public intellectual warned that the political climate in the us was ripe for the rise of an authoritarian figure he shares his thoughts on the aftermath of this the moribund state of the us political system and why trump is a real threat to the world and the planet in general for the unthinkable has in contrast to all trump scored a decisive victory over and the man that described as a dangerous clown and will be the next president of the united states in your what were the deciding factors that led voters to produce the biggest upset in the history of us before turning to this i think it is important to spend a few moments pondering just what happened on a date that might turn out to be one of the most important in human depending on how we react no exaggeration the most important news of was barely a fact of some significance in itself on the world meteorological organization delivered a report at the international conference on climate change in morocco which was called in order to carry forward the agreement of the reported that the past five years were the hottest on record it reported rising sea soon to increase as a result of the unexpectedly rapid melting of polar most ominously the huge antarctic glaciers arctic sea ice over the past five years is percent below the average of the previous not only raising sea but also reducing the cooling effect of polar ice reflection of solar thereby accelerating the grim effects of global warming the reported further that temperatures are approaching dangerously close to the goal established by along with other dire reports and forecasts another event took place on which also may turn out to be of unusual historical significance for reasons once were barely noted on the most powerful country in world which will set its stamp on what comes had an election the outcome placed total control of the government the supreme court in the hands of the republican which has become the most dangerous organization in world history apart from the last all of this is uncontroversial the last phrase may seem even outrageous but is the facts suggest otherwise the party is dedicated to racing as rapidly as possible to destruction of organized human life there is no historical precedent for such a stand is this an consider what we have just been witnessing during the republican every candidate denied that what is happening is happening with the exception of the sensible like who said it all but we do have to do anything because we producing more natural thanks to or john who agreed that global warming is taking but added that are going to burn in and we are not going to apologize for the winning now the calls for rapid increase in use of fossil including dismantling of rejection of help to developing countries that are seeking to move to sustainable and in racing to the cliff as fast as possible trump has already taken steps to dismantle the environmental protection agency by placing in charge of the transition a notorious climate change trump top adviser on billionaire oil executive announced his which were dismantling tax cuts for the industry the wealthy and corporate sector more fossil fuel lifting temporary block on the access pipeline the market reacted quickly shares in energy corporations including the world largest coal which had filed for but after trump registered a percent gain the effects of republican had already been felt there had been hopes that the agreement would lead to a verifiable but any such thoughts were abandoned because the republican congress would not accept any binding so what emerged was a voluntary evidently much weaker effects may soon become even more vividly apparent than they already are in tens of millions are expected to have to flee from plains in coming years because of sea level rise and more severe creating a migrant

environment these catastrophic consequences can only not just in but in all of south as already intolerable for the inexorably rise and the glaciers threatening the entire water supply already in some million people are reported to lack adequate drinking water and the effects will reach far beyond it is hard to find words to capture the fact that humans are facing the most important question in their history whether organized human life will survive in anything like the form we know and are answering it by accelerating the race to disaster similar observations hold for the other huge issue concerning human the threat of nuclear which has been looming over our heads for years and is now increasing it is no less difficult to find words to capture the utterly astonishing fact that in all

why does everyone love it hard to say her unfavorable ratings have hit that makes her more popular than the bubonic plague bin corpse it not much to go on but the decided to run a piece by is so widely your response to seeing the name was probably huh unless you a gender studies student at an ivy in which case you know exactly who she is and love her is a novelist whose should all be is big in those circles the campaign is unbearably awkward and this panegyric by was an obvious attempt to channel some of that canned poetry and like most it fails badly there are howlers are millions who admire the tapestry of and are people when becomes the first woman to be president of the united will weep from it not quite a hymn to comrade nor is it getting there by any means except a tow truck and then there the phrasing oh the phrasing was guilty immediately when she stepped into the view of the public as the first lady of this is an awkward attempt to channel that but instead it reads like a manual badly translated from the the piece is full of lines that straddle the border between propagandistic and just bad writing was a lawyer full of was guilty of not being a traditional first lady she offended the old patriarchal then there the theme of the which is to just deny reality conservative writer labeled her a congenital liar when she was first and the label stuck because it was repeated over and it was a convenient label to harness misogyny if she was a then the hostility she engendered could not possibly be because she was a first lady who refused to be still and silent liar has during this election even though a respected source of information about has certified that she is more honest than most the perfect timing for that defense would have been not right after shouted at a rally that she had been in new on but do worry is more honest than most politicians a site supporting her said so other words have been repeated over and with no until they have begun to breathe and thrum with life especially emails the press coverage of emails has become an unclear morass where emails must mean something if only because of how often it is how about or or of regulations dealing with the handling of classified that got lots of context or people who love know that the it system at the state department is old and nothing like a smooth whirl was used to her and wanted to keep using it when she became secretary of people who love know that she love high tech blackberry love blackberry she is a lawyer full of dreams who fights for the children of migrant workers and loves their smooth whirl thrums with life says her blackberry is more honest than the has many dreams of thrumming blackberries whirling smoothly that offend the traditional stodgy patriarchal order it system conservative media saw an opportunity to blow the emails story out of soon almost by the rest of the is that how it works in because that not how it works in is no objective basis on which to equate to her they both they need oxygen to they better writers than people who love see the failings of the general where news entertains rather than informs they bristle when benign stories about her are covered with an ominous they bristle and they hug their blackberry and weep for they fear that the patriarchal stodgy it systems will prevent from being the thrumming first lady of north know that she is a bit too but they understand that she has to that she cannot afford you would think with all those six figure she could afford a little actions so falsely that she leaned into wrapped herself in a kind of caution that sometimes makes her appear stilted and wrapped in her her whirling blackberry in one she bristled at the retracting her quills and occasionally hissing in an informed fashion for the children of migrant workers who admired the tapestry of her past are millions of who do not have the expectation that a politician be perfect they are frustrated that is allowed no complexity get on the phone i think has got another hit
mysterious universe do other realities brush up against our are there parallel dimensions lying just beyond through some untraceable veil separating the idea of parallel realities beyond our own is not yet what if this phenomenon were to come bursting forth from the realm of theory and speculation and come crashing down into the are there perhaps some people who have stepped over that barrier into domains we have not yet to see and which we may indeed not even be meant to i have covered such alleged excursions into the horizon beyond our known reality here at mysterious universe before and here i will revisit this topic with a selection of other cases that seem to imply the possibility that not only are parallel dimensions but that they are destinations to which we can be whisked whether intentional or not in the issue of fate magazine there was the curious story of a woman who apparently shifted into another parallel universe in according to the in the fall of that year a woman by the name of golding had a profoundly unusual experience while riding an elevator with her in the elevator was and when made a mistake and got off at the wrong floor she found that she could not push her way back in past the throng of people and resigned herself to waiting for the next one that was when she looked around and was startled to realize that she was no longer in the store at but rather an expansive train station the enormous railway station she found herself in was allegedly bustling with fevered with throngs of travelers rushing to their trains and booming announcements of arrivals and departures echoing through the air there seemed to be no way this busy place could have any connection whatsoever to the music store she had been in moments before the confused made her way to an information booth to ask where she but found that the woman working there completely ignored as if she there at all followed a series of signs pointing the way to the street and she emerged out into a sunny afternoon that seemed to be in the midst of summer rather than in a place that was most certainly not she wandered about in confusion and noticed that everyone around her seemed to completely ignore her and walk on by as if they did not even see her at some point she claims that she saw a confused looking boy standing in the sidewalk similarly being passed on by people who seemed to have no idea he was even and approached him wondering what was going on the boy was able to actually see and respond to and looked in her the first time anyone had acknowledged her presence in this surreal place as she the boy seemed equally relieved that he was visible to smiled slightly and purportedly i guess they let you off at the wrong too the two lost people walked together down the street in the whole time completely ignored by those around and the boy told of what had happened to him he claimed that he had been playing tennis in in the united and had gone to the locker room to change his shoes when he had gone back to the courts to play some more he had found that the tennis courts that had been there moments before were now gone and in their place was a huge train which had turned out to be the exact same station into which had enigmatically entered from the elevator the two allegedly kept on walking until they reached an open area that led to and over the waves they could apparently make out a sand bar with several women upon it chatting and seeming to act as if nothing was beyond the ordinary to one of the women was oddly her sister the women out on the sandbar seemed to notice them and began waving and shouting to and her companion this encouraged the boy to try and make a swim out to the which did not seem so far and which he was confident he could reach yet even though he was a good swimmer it seemed that no matter how much he tried and pushed against the he was unable to draw any closer to the mysterious sandbar and he returned to shore in frustration it was then that the sandbar supposedly suddenly vanished into thin air closed her eyes in and and then was overcome by the sensation of floating through space after some time of this odd feeling of hovering in darkness she claimed that she suddenly opened her eyes to find herself sitting atop a stool in the music store in which seemed to be in the process of closing for the suggesting that she had been there for at least several hours looked around for her but could not find him and decided to head back to his home when she her was noticeably relieved and explained that he had lost her in the store and had waited for her to come to the right floor for a few hours before deciding to go back home the whom had seen on the mysterious sandbar claimed that she had seen in town and had even called out to but that she had been too absorbed in talking to a young boy to notice her where did go during that why should she see her sister on a sandbar while the sister had seen her in all while they could not reach across to were they separated by strange barriers we do not and may not ever it is a mystery another strange article in the issue of fate magazine tells of the weird experience of a e of who in was traveling home with her husband and four children from a weekend trip to on the way they noticed what looked
photo of the great wall of editor note the relationship between china and the united states has a very long history regardless of whatever might that the has had at a given the sheer power to accomplish the amazing cannot be denied starting with the most incredible border fence of all the great wall of china china has been seen as a provider of labor for from imported labor to build yet another great this one in the the transcontinental to an in situ labor force for the world china was feared because of the number of soldiers they could use to flood and control the to a subservient

united states are going through hard prompting the how far will their disagreements in answering this it is worth recalling why the and china began to cooperate years what objectives they and what results they have achieved fighting communism p for cooperation between the communist party of china and the united states emerged even before the took power in china in there is information that communist leader sought to establish even though with the united states when he was still at his revolutionary base in during world war communists had regular contacts with political and military officials in china in the established the army observation commonly known as the in such an approach to the united states was natural for the communist regardless of how radical its doctrines were at that time above a nationalist who saw communism as a way to restore the greatness of his country his dependence on the soviet union irked him he shook off this dependence as soon as he this is why his desire to conduct a policy was logical and experienced both military and reasonably spoke of certain prospects for cooperation with communists already at that time the regime established by the

a group of renowned state department known as china praised merits of their effective discipline and as well as their willingness to make bargains with the united states their point of view was supported by some prominent military leaders in the including general but they were opposed by a group of dogmatists led by ambassador to china in the last years of world war who completely fell under

harassment even their forecasts that had become true were used as grounds for accusation for john a political attach to and one of the organizers of the predicted that communists would win in the civil war he was accused of sympathizing with them and fired from the state department after the went to where he ran a furniture business even interference by the judicial authorities was not enough

by on in awareness spiritual awakening by guest i wrote this article to help people who are unhappy with election results i hope it helps to bring you peace and understanding the election morning when i awoke to news of trumps ascendancy to the position of president of the united states my first reaction was disbelief i found myself wondering if i had jumped overnight although i did my best to ignore the campaign that waged south of the with so many high octane it was impossible to tune out i was sure was a to shake off the surreal i headed to the kitchen for a bracing cup of coffee thinking that the biggest shock of my day was now behind i was for the turmoil that lurked on my laptop and email were abuzz with upset posts although there were plenty of celebratory message by elated trump the majority of reactions i read were negative even more distressing were the conflicts that erupted between friends and coworkers rather than weighing into the i energetically cleared myself and readjusted my focus to a higher perspective i then channeled divine love and sent it out into the world for all in need of reassurance while in communion with my highest i also put my faith in my highest self to bring me divine guidance so i could help people deal with their distress this is when i was reminded of my activities the day prior soul ages on the day of the i was guided to revisit a book i had read several years ago called the instruction in author and psychic described soul ages in a very enlightening manner before i proceed in explaining the difference in soul i should point out that all souls are the same age because we are but we employ the term soul age as an indication of the amount of earth experience a being has young and old souls for simplicity broke soul ages into levels he then them into two groups the first five levels represent young with the remaining five being old souls each earth lesson mastered helps the soul to mature souls who complete their earthly education finish at level at this the soul is ready to graduate or ascend home the difference between young and old souls is their primary motivation young souls are motivated by leading to the need for safety and power old souls are motivated by which drives their need to and ultimately transcend polarity back into unity consciousness and divine love this is not to say that young souls are unloving and old souls are never scared both young and old souls feel fear and love young souls and politics a souls journey begins with the basics of level and then progresses through the learning increasingly more complex lessons as it goes young souls are driven by a need to protect themselves and strictly enforced laws are all part of that protection they crave structure and conformity in their personal lives too this includes moral fundamental religious practices and a traditional family and social structures the younger the soul the more his or her perspective at level the soul has acquired enough experience to start branching out into the world evolving from fear to love is but given enough time and experience most young souls eventually master their fear to become paragons of worldliness and leadership in the majority of politicians are level souls this is the group who rules the world they thrive on money and prestige its interesting to note that level politicians rely heavily on the support of level such as in the case of war the politicians who make the decision to engage in conflict need soldiers to the majority of whom come from level in level souls tend to idealize their along with their so this is truly a symbiotic relationship old souls by levels are old souls they look inwards for guidance and inspiration level is the hardest in some ways because they remember feeling on top of the world and having all the answers gone through a spiritual awakening which shattered their paradigm and left them unsure of themselves and their world through a spiritual they begin to find their eventually regaining their sense of purpose subsequent levels draw heavily on intuition to help them bring amazing inventions and works of art into the world at level many became activists for worthy causes such as environmental issues this frequently pits them against the younger souled politicians by level the soul is in by level souls are so peaceful in their own skin that they no longer are concerned with prior earthly pursuits these senior citizen souls are quite baffling to young souls who see them as eccentric and rather strange in old souls and their tend to scare young souls soul ages and the us election by probably figured out that connection between soul ages and the president elect trump in case its very trump ran on a platform that appealed to young souls the concepts of and limiting for appeal to people who are innately afraid of what lies beyond their borders think back to the middle ages and when the majority of souls were and thus needed the protective walls of fortified towns the concept may seem archaic to old souls rather than its important to keep in mind that every old soul went through a similar young soul journey collective consciousness may have evolved beyond medieval but there are still pockets of souls who are learning young soul lessons earth school taking the educational model a step imagine earth as a one room schoolhouse grades ages are all together in the same classroom the younger students on the left side and the older students on the right within those two students are grouped together with others in the same grade level so that they can learn cooperatively throughout each the teacher delivers lessons to each
riots in on third night of protests trump returns to twitter to complain about protests by media by reason there were more protests around the country against the election of trump last with police in declaring the protest there a riot due to deteriorating conditions rioters there threw objects at attacked newspaper and smashed windows police said protesters were trying to stop from destroying and tweeted that it encouraged others to leave the before declaring the situation a riot and issuing orders to disperse the police say they made arrests and dispersed the crowd using pepper ball distraction and rubber baton returned to twitter for the first time since being elected on night after spending the day in tweeting that incited by the are calling it news described the tweet as an end to a brief stretch of conciliatory behavior since although one salty tweet in a hour period does seem like enough data to come to that conclusion trump had to as news put also pointing out trump himself had tweeted in favor of a march on after mitt and suggested if he lost riots could least two other prominent trump sheriff and former rep had also tweeted supportively of protests and civil disobedience before the election but called for a tough response after they did not expect trump to so the calculus changed things are different now that he not for trump tendency to make loose statements and the media tendency to botch interpretations of those tweet was characterized as not sure what was expected at this particularly since such protests until worked in trump favor the trump campaign a rally in after massive protests there trump said the protests would his clinched the nomination in may by i noted how attacks on trump supporters by protesters were an apparent effort to help get trump elected in late when protests and riots erupted in after a fatal police shooting i suggested the city was working hard to get north in the trump when there were protests and around the i suggested this trend to could end up helping trump by earning him political capital and helping drive conservatives back into the fold protesters say they are demonstrating because trump has created a climate of fear for minorities riots also have that tendency if the mostly white rioters in last night provide police in the city to ramp up that endangers marginalized people the most protests last month over a police contract the outgoing mayor pushed through before leaving office failed to stop the and it not unreasonable to fear tonight riots will increase tensions in altogether different for all the talk of what else could violent protests over the result of an election be other than voter won but that still leaves a minority of trump voters watching their fellow citizens destroy property over the way they voted and it leaves a slew of residents who did but will probably eventually be blamed for trump win as well blame anyone but and the democratic protesters like to compare trump to yet it does seem they understand their own comparison used civil the greatly expand his powers after he had already been elected at the republican trump called a crime and said he could solve the country problems protesters are setting the stage for him it hard to imagine what continued violent protests group has organized as a can accomplish other than creating a climate of fear trump could exploit to make it easier to get what he whatever that turns out to of a mostly white riot in would perhaps be incomplete with a note about the occupation of a remote outpost in the national wildlife refuge in in protest of federal prosecutors reneging on a plea deal with two ranchers who had set a fire on their property that spread onto federal appealing the sentences handed down in favor for longer ones those protesters were called by many commentators because they were armed the went viral no one has suggested or have been under attack nor has anyone called the protesters or rioters terrorists but as one side has created a precedent when it was convenient rhetorically in the short term that can be used by the other side with as if not protesters are concerned about the powers trump will president and the congress have two and a half months to try to get something accomplished in terms of limiting executive power the prospect is unlikely already protests make the prospect less and also place efforts at reducing government power after trump is in office at a disadvantage although protesters may be more interesting in expressing their including by than reducing government power and constraining the office of the smashed protest in proclaimed riot some people started their protest at pioneer courthouse square and moved to northeast according to the daily about time for an trump death threats swamp twitter numerous disgruntled have taken to twitter to encourage the murder of echoing the reaction to election albeit from a different side of the political school students chant that were running down my said who is was so upset a friend went to the bathroom mansion estimated that the residence would cost about a month its not known if who has a net worth of up to and is entitled to a presidential pension of a is paying the going rate
the foul stench of fascism in the may be shocked by the election of trump but black and brown smelt it throughout this summer and i have interviewed fellow asking them about their feelings and experiences regarding this presidential election in all of these one thing was we knew this was some of it hung like a foul smell in the air the acrid stench that generations before somehow learned to live though it choked them many of us coughed and spluttered when that suffocating air filled our lungs some of us cried out in when those of us who spoke up were heard at we were greeted with or with laughter like some i wrote about that were given the assurance that there were some for whom that acrid stench was a breath of fresh but those foolish people were few and unimportant we were told the smell would go away on its own it went nowhere it lingered and it got for some of it was more than a smell for some unlucky ones such as it became a physical parked his car in my beloved town of hood to take his dog for a walk as told the town started to get out of the and heard someone the car door smacked my head and then my head hit the door frame i lost part of my memory for about news of the assault hit our small it shocked us all we had a hard time believing especially when reported that the only other words he heard were you is not a he is a monk in typical monk his response was filled with am happy it happened to me and not to a he ca feel safe in a third of my own in my we spoke at length about the assault and what it meant by we had already seen that racism and white nationalism were on the rise the fact that an innocent monk was attacked at all was but that he was attacked for being something he for being nothing more than not was what really my town assumed it was isolated we assumed there was a small minority of people filled with assumed that the smell would go away on its news stories abounded about white people verbally or physically attacking and people with disabilities many people mostly white allies thought that it was rare not something to worry did believe that for a is a black designer who was living in in but was returning to his native white girlfriend and i are moving back to this he told me had originally planned to drive across the country and stop in new and phoenix needless to we not doing that any and his girlfriend took an plane instead too many stories of white backlash attacks in too many disparate places made them cancel their was jokingly worried about being opinionated in the south before this he said it untenable it incredibly sad that in i ca feel safe in a third of my own is not alone by many minority people in had already changed their and outlook marina an artist from began to avoid eye contact with people on the metro when someone looked at her and people are so experiences with actions and violence have existed before but have gotten the attention they getting now social media makes sharing these experiences easier than ever so things encountered kept to but with and twitter talking about with people throughout the i saw this pattern repeated minority people of various and racial groups were all doing the same were talking about the foul smell in the pointing out the real danger to anyone who would and they were all being more cautious around white people many of them changed their in subtle ways wear headphones more at work said a white lesbian woman who wants to remain anonymous for fear of a backlash at the legal practice where she works outside i just want to avoid the chance of getting into was being verbally assaulted and called because she spoke about wanting to marry her partner even in national symbol of a lesbian woman felt afraid to argue for her right to a marriage that the state had already given a black writer and actor in who did not want his real name had a somewhat similar take on avoiding arguments when he talked about the police goal is not to win the he told me goal is to get home happens to be tall and his car is fitted with special gearing to allow him to drive only with his hands it is a car that only someone his size can a white cop pulls me over one he told is looking me up and looking at my insurance and my and he asks me this your i what is that question supposed to we all know what it supposed to mean you looking at my and i have a car only i can drive i know why you asking that but not going to say because the goal is to get home so i just say sir it is white men are taking back to the i heard similar responses throughout the summer and minority people universally spoke of this election as a they spoke of being scared white people universally saw it as an accidental event that would just that could really happen warned us of exactly that sentiment a political writer who studied has written of the seriousness of this election in numerous telling us that ca happen is exactly how fascism happens her essays are like a plan for how to avoid a yet it seems that no one wanted to bring her map on this i warned us writing that are on the cusp of a historic decision in the us we can make history and transition from the first black to the first female
wall street and the political and military wall street and the pentagon greeted the onset of as a banner a glorious turning point in the quest for malleable regimes willing to the most lucrative

by most interesting watching the progress of the comprehensive economic and trade agreement between and the through the various opaque ministrations this past week first as the progeny of north free trade agreement it serves to refer to a bit of history former prime minister very recently on said that was a wonderful agreement he said that its purpose generally was to help all economies but more specifically to help workers who at that time had been devastated by the devaluation of the peso due to capital flight from of the many outcomes of fiat currency the record does not support this used the example that this year more were returning home than entering the implying it was due to the success more realistically it has been due to the increasing police violence in the accompanied by the election cycle fought between a manipulative liar and a misogynist xenophobic narcissist the truth behind is different yes thousands of jobs were created in the along the border these jobs were filled by workers who in general were displaced from their lands through a combination of two economic hits first was the and its structural adjustment programs and admitted at least in an economic not in a political control applied after the debt collapse this was quickly followed or accompanied by which allowed ample cheap subsidized agricultural products to flow into cutting the main basis of support for the agricultural sector not only was not good for it also seriously affected well paying jobs in and the as corporations moved their production to where the wages and benefits were lowest as for much of the increased trade was not due to increased economic activity but the recording of transactions that used to take place internally views of the rust belt and the declining number of living wage jobs in both and the testify to the negative impact of for the corporations and their managers who have gained enormously another aspect of that is of note is the political manipulations that occurred in was essentially a conservative creation under pm as above the conservative party was devastated in in part due to also due to other domestic interesting part being that his jean liberal campaigned against but once in power accepted it as it was additional side deals and one of its significant other than selling out workers and was the trade dispute settlement the appropriately labeled chapter section this allows for supranational national closed door arbitration panels staffed by selection rather than qualification than perhaps their financial along with this is that a foreign corporation can sue the government for perceived loss of profits due to some regulation or regulations that would generally serve to protect the the benefits of and the independent agricultural sector this has resulted in many lawsuits against sovereignty that has cost the taxpayer billions of dollars in lawyers fees and settlements to companies that may or may not have intended to set up business here in the first place it has also caused the government to change some of its regulations in of corporations begets the same indicators on dispute settlement occur with many informed citizens object to corporations having supranational rights over sovereignty both in and the concerns that reflect the same investor dispute settlement mechanisms note also that it is investor dispute and not citizen meaning that the average citizen cannot sue either the government or the corporations for damages to wages et there is a lawsuit currently underway to challenge the constitutional legality of the agreement as it also overrides and first nations jurisdiction these are not national functions but can be effectively manipulated through various degrees of transfer payments and the good old fashioned crony benefit payment system the opposed the investor dispute in part because it would facilitate the loss of an independent agricultural sector in effect branch suing for agricultural of agricultural sector is already by a small number of supranational while listening to on discuss and the he said it was amazing how money and politics are intertwined if that is the ignorant level of commentary that can considering it abides by establishment guidelines no wonder we get little truth from the media and the intertwined what is truly being negotiated with but also reiterated the tired old will create jobs and promote growth also added his support indicating the agreement is another meaningless platitude when given without context progressive for the middle and pm spoke this morning after signing it was almost a after having listened to brag about jobs and progress with even it has another similarity because it was the loathed conservative government that began the secret only to be in part because of only to have the liberals accept the agreement essentially as a few side deals with and allowing it to be voted on in a referendum do they not trust their ability to manipulate a relying instead on their false majority of the in the house to give it in very similar to the and also very similar to our wherein the democrats and republicans are essentially two sides of the same much literally as it is the coin that determines not the house nor the ever absent but on the rhetoric from this morning was quite with the same old platitudes brought forth he indicated we need economic growth contribute to we have progressive values and concerns very similar to the the dispute mechanism is a progressive and has provided leadership on values with countries even though it needs to be ratified after it has a provisional implementation clause that clause has not been and we will feel benefits and it is good for middle class sounds but if is our not much benefit will be seen by the middle not much progress will be made how is that not many jobs will be created to lift the poor up into the middle class by and what really are our

even republican politicians and former politicians are telling trump to knock off such talk as trump shrewdness and defiance of standard political decorum in which the party merely rolls over and surrenders in the face of democratic pressure is winning the other than billionaire investor and longtime democratic supporter has said that the fix is literally in for the in favor of no matter how much of the popular and from which battleground trump reported by top right news and other during a recent interview with news a democrat openly admitted that trump will win the popular vote in a he said that none of that would because a president is already a the which is now going says with certainty that trump will take the popular despite what the polls say now are completely rigged to oversample democrats but not the electoral which will go to the reporter asks if that is already a that will be our next president no matter what says and nods his just making a prediction out of or does he truly know something most of us do a recent column natural news founder and editor mike the health says that and democrats have electoral college in a bid to the election outcome in favor of in that would be the only way it could be short of massive voter fraud through electronic as some reports have already claimed further pointed out that was one of the main money men behind the black lives matter which is being blamed for generating hatred and mistrust of police officers all around the country some of which has led to the deaths of several officers also funds websites and groups that pay and deploy volunteer at trump to start fights and engage in physical violence against trump supporters that the establishment media then blames on trump are electors legally obligated to cast a ballot for the presidential candidate who won the majority vote in that elector they not percent of electors have done what they supposed to do throughout our but this is no ordinary election per there is no constitutional provision or federal law requiring electors to vote according to the results of the popular vote these pledges fall into two state law and those who are bound by promises made to respective political the the supreme court has ruled that the constitution does require electors to be completely free to cast ballots as they please respective political parties may pledges from electors to vote for the notes some state laws hold that could be subjected to fines or disqualification for casting an invalid and could then be replaced by a substitute supreme court has not specifically ruled on the question of whether pledges and penalties for failure to vote as pledged may be enforced under the constitution no elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as said site notes that throughout our percent of electors have voted as required but this is no ordinary and it no ordinary election and democrats the establishment have already proven that they will do anything to stop a trump presidency establishment republicans do want trump so you can bet they would balk at or challenge the buying off of electors

centers discusses the links between the parliamentary and presidential focusing on political future and the rivalry between the hawks and doves within the rd centers discusses the links between the parliamentary and presidential focusing on political future and the ongoing rivalry between the hawks and doves within the inner circle from right to speaker of the state defense minister director of the federal security service and director of the foreign intelligence service recent parliamentary elections by and a dress rehearsal for the more important presidential elections coming up in between now and members of the political establishment will be able to try on new experiment with new campaign and determine who will play a starring role within the inner circle the central consideration is how to consolidate power in a way that balances the interests of the government and the get an inside look at current political direct sat down with of the center according to the parliamentary elections provide a preview of what to expect in and to what extent were the parliamentary elections fair and in your in they were juridically legitimate because they were conducted in accordance with law the degree of the not juridical legitimacy is a debatable question because of the low it means that the representation of citizens in the parliament became even less than previously about of the population voted at the elections though the united ruling party garnered four million fewer votes than during the it received more seats in the parliament in liberal politicians are not included in the parliament at all the legitimacy of the elections is a matter of these elections were fair in the polling stations with to a large extent they were honest in the in which the central election commission controlled the electoral process in cooperation with observers a lesser these elections were fair and transparent in the distant regions or in the words of prominent political expert zones of peculiar electoral which saw an abnormally high electoral turnout i for the republic of in southern the north region etc regions were controlled by the central election commission to a much lesser extent no wonder that people were compelled to vote in accordance with the orders of local authorities the violations in these regions were likely to be common associate and chair of the domestic politics and political institutions program at the center press photo does central election commission have any tools to influence voting in the distant there are some but local authorities limit and restrict them i think the administration of the president hampered the work of the central election commission she tried to balance the interests of president and the interests of the civil society is the position and it is very difficult she just tried to take into account all positions and signals that were coming from the regions during the electoral campaign and could not ignore them there were so many of these signals that she objectively and physically could not control the throughout the in the distant regions what kinds of violations took place during the if violations took even though they were not like previously during the elections these violations included the use of administrative resources for rigged and fabricated stuffing the ballot and dirty political techniques against the liberal and communist parties during the political campaign and before election day was also orchestrated when students and governmental employees were ordered to vote this also should be taken into account all these violations took place not only in distant but also in those under the steady control of the central election why did the united party win despite its declining popularity throughout the fact the united won the majority in the state and the popularity are basically different things its popularity has been decreasing indeed it is one reality but it prevent the party from winning most of the seats that is the other reality citizens see the party as a body that deals with the problems of the population the credibility and approval rankings of almost all governmental except law enforcement agencies and the president are dropping and united is not the because people perceive it not as a but as a kind of a governmental body its rating will keep going but step by step if you vote for united it means a symbolic a sort of political ritual if you are and go to the polling you are likely to vote for united because it is necessary this is the very logic and motivation that drive average voters to elect united though some people preferred not to vote for the ruling they voted for the current because there were no real they voted either for one of the three systemic parliamentary parties or the spoiler which aimed at distracting the attention of voters and preventing the opposition from gaining parliamentary seats why did the opposition fail and what is its key the reason why they failed can be traced back to the personal ambitions of the opposition leaders they team up and compete with each other in they have different in fact i mean liberals and liberals always agree this does after all these leaders have enough political heft most of them cannot be considered powerful and influential political figures problem is that the authoritarian regime in will prevent the emergence of new powerful liberal forces in if such a party emerges and poses a serious challenge to the authorities like opposition leader it will be either destroyed or discredited and marginalized in such a it is very difficult to come up with a pragmatic solution this years parliamentary elections proved that the only political democratic force on a scale of a whole country is the party and its leader no matter how you view them it is losing popularity year after but this party remains firmly within the political landscape and if the opposition is able to persuade voters that brings together different representatives of

with and with and it is clear that there is quite a disconnect between the went to the polls on to give their opinion on a referendum question that each political side interpreted in its own way the turnout remained well below the necessary percent of all valid although percent of voters more than three million people said they wanted the parliament to have a decisive say about any future redistribution of inside the referendum and its campaign had two separate goals the ruling party had to test the loyalty of their political thus they tried to redefine classical political fault lines and checked on the unity of the opposition prime minister used this occasion to bring forward his arguments about reshaping the competences of the especially the commission referendum question has been thoroughly debated ever since it was as it reflects both of the above goals the question you want the union to be able to order the mandatory settlement of citizens in without parliaments political and civil groups were enabled by the ambiguous wording of the question to focus on significantly different interpretations neither the constitutional court nor the national election committee declared the question despite the fact that it raised concerns among experts the constitutional rules within most member states declare that no national referendum should be held on issues already regulated by international a way of getting around this the government later claimed that the referendum did not concern the decisions of mandatory quotas already decided at the level of the council it would only concern future possible the competency of the the council is required to give the final word in any such case of distribution of resettlement or relocation among member in any case where has a way to raise its own voice or to build a blocking coalition the government decided to go against the quota system after the councils decisions of last autumn and went to the court in to dispute the legality of the measure was the final point where the government turned the migration crisis into a sovereignty question it had started in the official government rhetoric already after the attacks on but the referendum question undoubtedly raised the stakes of the debate it is not anymore about whether migrants or refugees should be welcomed or the opinion of the government focuses on the competence of the institutions whether they in enforce decisions on member position is openly on the side that the quota system violates the sovereignty of member states and unnecessarily forces a instead of paying attention to securing the external borders of the area this has been the argument already since last when hundreds of thousands of refugees crossed the country and the route towards the borders must be because if member states start the redistribution the political pressure for a sustainable solution at the border protection level would dissipate and would be left with an influx of uncontrolled deal seriously decreased the number of arriving in the though the route remains open and is under growing pressure again have not seen masses of migrants since last when the government sealed the southern borders with a fence despite this the government continued to communicate a permanent threat of uncontrolled migrants throughout the why migration represents a new existential threat for the momentum of in the member states while pew research and other polls do not put the electorate among the friendliest towards foreigners from other it is still a member of the community of values came up with a very positive response through civil society last summer during the crisis at the eastern train station in where medical and social services as well as food was provided by volunteers and churches to the tens of thousands stranded not one single organized attack was carried out against the people on the while in safe homes and groups have been attacked in the of not resistant to strong government messages that but the invalid referendum gave proof that the will of the government is not enough in itself to completely reshape the perception of the electorate while xenophobia has risen to a new high in the it is still not the general attitude of the average voter live in their own facing economic hurdles and caring about how to make a living in a country where the average salary is about half of the minimum wage in government campaign focused largely on classic media public and television and radio leaflets in the mailbox it was significantly weaker on social where youngsters remain a relatively disaffected number of invalid votes those who put their paper in the ballot box but did not pick any of the choices together with the more than voters who actually decided to take home the ballot instead of casting it at hit a record well over voters sent the message that they did not want to reply to such a referendum must be dealt with at the

more than a few feel that as long as they can provide and basic medical needs for themselves and their nothing more is required other may feel that self power and machine repair are skills that will be required in the post crisis world many and also tend to ignore or underestimate the need to have a computer that can be used to help make it easier to survive in all these are also the people most likely to have serious problems in the post crisis world because they do not have a computer available to help meet a range of goals computers and prepping can get along a computer cannot hunt a deer for boil or make a pair of obviously on the other any computer with a connection to the can help you find out how to do these things and much more when you find good it is also very easy to store those files on your computer so that you can read them and work with them whenever you want and if you are in a situation where access is still you can use your computer to contact friends and loved ones as well as people that might be able to help you get through a crisis then you can certainly relate to the quandary of many that are finding out it is becoming impossible to make or obtain raw materials that would be needed in a major crisis scenario on the other side of the many of the items you need for basic prepping can still be purchased all you really need is a prepaid debit card and an connection so that you can find websites where you can place your orders not only will you be able to get the supplies you you will also have a much wider selection of other goods to choose from regardless of whether you are interested in the best quality gun cleaning need a certain type of fishing or need good quality vintage hand you can find them all in even if you are you may be able to find customized materials and tools that have been modified to meet your needs most people realize just how important it is to network with from diverse geographic regions and make plans for bugging out that include those friends and connections consider what would happen if an earthquake or hurricane strikes your area if you only have friends and family in a or small chances are everyone will be affected if you have friends in other states that might be able to offer temporary shelter or help you make a new then you will be well ahead of the game in these times and both money and barter systems are vital for exchanging needed goods and services a computer is very important for expanding your trade and marketing options it is also very important for securing alternative currencies that may play a vital role in remaining solvent in the face of currency collapse most people would be truly amazed at how easy it is for the average consumer to secure foreign keep a good supply of and even use them as down and dirty form of currency trading or flipping the tough choice on the best obsolete devices may still be very useful because certain older technologies are easier to work with and may be safer than newer devices that are routinely or are based on unstable hardware platforms if you are interested in newer here are some and models that you can start off with for each category of desktops if you are primarily interested in a conventional desktop my own experience leads me to believe the best option is to build the computer yourself so that you know exactly what parts are being used and how best to optimize the is where you can determine how fast the computer will whether or not the system can boot from a and other aspects of basic settings since modern computer chips tend to run it is very important to provide plenty of ventilation and cooling options inside the case if your and motherboard kit come with heat conducting do not hesitate to find the best on the market it is also very useful to add extra fans and other cooling devices right inside the case always the cooler you can keep the chips during the lower your chances of erratic or even ruining the chips insofar as other vital parts such as hard and video it truly depends on your personal tastes you will need a dedicated video card to gain access to these specialized chips that will reduce wear on the and enhance computer performance at the same time be sure to study gamer forums and video editing forums to find out which video cards work best with specific and motherboard combinations a bad fit between these parts can truly be a disaster memory cards are yet another yet vital area of the computer that you will need to think about this is also one area where only the best will do it is better to go with the fastest cards that the motherboard will and also from the best rated vendor laptops unlike desktop you will have far less control over what parts are found inside the case before purchasing a be sure to find out the model number of the and motherboard from you will need to look up the to find out what the optimal clock speeds are i have seen more than one laptop burn up at around the year mark because a mother board with a slower timing chip was paired with a faster since most buyers do not ask about the motherboard there was no way for them to find out that they basically had an system that was going to fail very quickly i can safely say that i recommend spending times as much money on a laptop when i can choose
views comments guest posts by my friend roger is a staunch democrat supporter he is in his seventies and has always voted democrat him and i have had countless discussions over the many years that we have known each other his paternal roots are and he sees himself to be on the left side of but of him and i have not been able to see on the race to the issue he is with the view that has inherited a financial and military disaster and did the best he and that he should not be blamed for his failure to perform as many did after his elaborate and successful yes we can slogan he supported and other domestic reform and this is perhaps where roger and i stop to agree and start to disagree including look at the appalling record of the republican party and try to paint a tainted image of it the party that is affectionately called the grand old party or the by its own staunch supporters certainly has enough such records to put it up there with charges of global mayhem and genocide the has given birth to people like the and of who can forget is another character that comes to one that no thinking man could trust with a a federal senator who commands authority that no one seems to be able to either understand the mandate or challenge at the end of the infamous line republican well at least thus enter trump and what a character he need one say god forbid if this article may be read like a defense of the the is run by the rich and the and as described by w bush by the haves and have more it is the party of dick who saw in an opportunity to generate contracts for if tens of hundreds of thousands of had to die for him to achieve his he would not and did not blink this is the party that condones and feeds it is the party that has huge control over the media it is the party that runs the world like it is a business enterprise and whether the rest of the world likes it or until the current global status quo no political party in the world affects the rest of the world like the ruling party in the united states whilst elections in other countries are domestic affairs that affect domestic politics of the country elections have implications that are not only domestically but have a much further global reach that encompasses every corner of the world as a i am much more concerned about the wider global implications of politics than the domestic ones this is not to say that i am indifferent about and the people as a matter of not only do i have close friends who live in but also close family members and i have grave concerns for all mankind in every corner of the by my interest in politics remains focused on foreign policy and to this i am only able to relate to the choice between the major two parties from the perspective of their foreign policies as insists to be the world police and the a stature many are refusing to accept that they have already it must accept what comes with it and concede that the rest of the world is hoping that the people will choose the better candidate as the new or should i say the one who is less harmful to the world in between and who fits the this is the question enough has been recently said about health to write a horror novel her and alleged recent case of pneumonia have made headlines as if not bigger than her infamous hidden allegations of involvement in the murder of an ambassador and even selling arms to very recently the issue of the emails is resurfacing and very late in the perhaps late enough to serve with a knock out her zeal to reach the seems to have been in her mind even before bills scandal back in was prepared to publicly support appear to forgive him and move because she had a bigger fish to the she somehow managed to hush down all other sex allegations against all the and trying to score mileage from similar allegations against trump her unabated lust for power will not stop at anything for as long as she ends up at the the first female even if she has to be

retain some faith in the they are not willing to the kind of cash that might allow this increasingly unpopular regime to survive what keep wall street on board the sinking ship are the political and

by on future now rests in the hands of a man older than the supreme leader of celebrate in the streets of the coastal city of after election of former general as president the news come as much of a surprise in the end presidential posters with face were already being hung around east before the results had even been released but now its has finally elected a new a and former military was elected on making him the ending a political vacuum in the top post that had left now takes the reigns of a country heavily plagued by a massive refugee overload with refugees from various practically public constant threat of war from their southern and bomb attacks from terrorists interestingly this is the second time that has been announced the president to when he and the military government of east appointed itself in and anyone who dared disputed this was met with which did eventually occur even went on to fight a war of liberation against the army forces stationed in during which ended in failure and forced to flee his native land into exile in the man behind the poster is by his to be a strong leader with a military background who knows how to play the political field to achieve his goals on the other most i have spoken to about have offered plenty of negative feedback even from people who i assumed would throw their full support behind the old boy an overall slippery character who has been lucky enough to pick the right partners since his return to after his exile i have to the side of my personality that appreciates dark comedy chuckled at the picture of president sitting in the big chair of the presidential palace with just the slightest whisper of a cheeky smile on his face the last time held the the army under the authority of pictured at the presidential palace in being elected president of president of bombed him out in a attempt to illuminate a stubborn nationalist troublemaker yet years son of offered his personal congratulations to on his election victory just president also shares my dark which would explain his sly smirk while he sat in his prize seat despite all the he has returned to and claimed what he had always the presidency carries with him a considerable amount of political baggage from a long career full of civil war and side switching which has left many in questioning if this lord of war is the man worth appointing to end the political stalemate which some have suggested would be better off remaining politically frozen instead of appointing a man who has fought against the administration in during the late but now fully backs and in this is a totally understandable stance given the lack of honest candidates available in the fact remains that has been left completely disabled by the political deadlock which is pushing the country to the brink i personally agree with the progressive socialist party and leader who said on twitter prior to the vote that its time to elect any president to escape the presidential vacuum why elect i have a growing concern that behind closed doors some very egotistical and conniving millionaires are beginning to see the massive potential gas wealth just sitting off the coast but political class has been far too busy infighting among themselves to invest in steps towards harvesting and selling gas also have their eyes on this untapped wealth lying below the perhaps this could be why so many old adversaries of have decided to suddenly put an end to their refusal to back ally for who is smart enough to see this type of opportunity on the horizon and just about desperate enough to surrender his staunch opposition to candidacy in return for inclusion in any future plans given recent bad luck with his struggling business in i put it past him who is still eagerly perusing the trial and conviction of what he believes where who at news beside former prime minister after announced that he will back to become president assassinated his is now willing to throw his vote to candidate in order to secure the position for the second as prime minister certainly there are many more aspects to consider in what has been a leading up to yesterdays grand finale but i suspect that political godfathers are smart enough to realize they are sitting on a potential trillion dollar money maker is at risk of being high jacked if they continue pussyfooting around over never sectarian feuds what could during my last trip to i was shocked to see how even the average struggle with the lack of basic services the country is a mess and the only institution that is worth any praise is the army that has coped remarkably well under the strains of constant terror attacks from radical terrorists the rise of regional sectarianism and a huge lack of money equipment the proxy of dictator who fought a long bloody war against is now considered the candidate who confirms an political victory over its competitor for political influence in what has largely held the country back is the fact that has been stuck in a vicious game of between refusal to pick a side has left the country empty handed with no vision of a safe future has a desperately needed arms deal with a pathetic blaming the deal cancellation on a statement made by foreign minister happens to be who refused to accept a statement referring to as a terrorist group the produced statement patriarch president of also demanded all league members to condemn which both refused to do in previous attempts to remain has also refused to accept any or offers to provide free arms deliveries to the army in order not to upset the countries ties to the us or the gulf now that holds may have the guts to finally
secondary verification by key thoughts thoughts forwarded message at pm thoughts mills i have put together my thoughts on the campaign ideas and i have scheduled some meetings in the next few weeks for veterans of the campaign to tell me how to make these ideas better this is simply a draft but do let me know if this is a helpful process for you all thanks notes for a democratic campaign draft draft draft draft here are some comments and observations based on what we saw in the campaign if we get started we will be in a very strong position to execute well for structure and timing lets assume a total budget of about with more than paid employees and of volunteers the entire startup ceases operation four days after the structure includes a chairman or chairwoman who is the external face of the campaign and a president who is the executive in charge of systems and building and managing the organization every day matters as our end date does not change an official campaign right after midterm elections and a preparatory team assembled now is best location the campaign headquarters will have about a thousand mostly young and hardworking and enthusiastic its important to have a very large hiring pool as or from which to choose smart and low paid permanent employees is a poor choice as its full of distractions and interruptions moving the location from elsewhere guarantees visitors have taken the time to travel and to help the key is a large population of talented people who are dying to work for you any outer borough of are all good examples of a blue state city to base in employees will relocate to participate in the and will find low cost temporary housing or live with campaign supporters on a donated basis this worked well in and can work elsewhere the computers will be in the cloud and most likely on amazon web services all the campaign needs are portable tablets and smart phones along with credit card readers the pieces of a campaign the field its important to have strong field with autonomy and empowerment operations talent needs to build the set up the hire the and administer what is about people initial modeling will show heavy hiring in the key battleground states there is plenty of time to set these functions up and build the human systems the field is about organizing voter and get out the vote programs for organizing build a simple way to link people and activities as a and let the field manage the all cloud based build a simple organizing tool with a functioning avoid deep integration as the benefits are not worth it build on the cloud organizing is really about sharing and linking and this tool would measure and track all of it there are many other crucial early investments needed in the determining the precise list of battleground doing early polling to confirm initial and maintaining and extending voter protection programs at the state level the voter key is the development of a single record for a voter that aggregates all that is known about them in smart phones will be used to and update profiles on the voter a dynamic volunteer can easily speak with a voter with their email or other digital get the voter videos and other answers to areas they care about benefits of to the scenario includes a volunteer on a walk encountering a potential updating the records real time and deepening contact with the voter and the information we have to offer digital a large group of campaign employees will use digital marketing methods to connect to to offer to use social networks to spread good and to raise money partners like blue state digital will do much of the fund raising a key point is to convert and other partners to pure cloud service offerings to handle the expected crush and load media and and polling new tools should be developed to measure reach and impact of earned and social media the impact of press coverage should be measurable in reach and and effectiveness measured by attention and other surveys build tools that measure the rate and spread of stories and and model how it works and who has the biggest impact tools can tell us about the origin of stories and the impact of any person or theme connect polling into this in some way find a way to do polling and not on phones analytics and data science and polling and resource optimization tools for each a score is computed ranking probability of the right vote analytics can model social factors and many other attributes of the needed voters modeling will tell us what who we need to turn out and and studies of effectiveness will let us know what approaches work well machine intelligence across the data should identify the most important factors for and preference it should be possible to link the voter records in van with upcoming databases from companies like and others for media measurement purposes the analytics tools can be built in house or partnered with a set of vendors core voter database and contact with voters the database of voters is a fine starting point for voter records and is maintained by the vendor needs to be converted to the the code developed for is unlikely to be and replaced by a model where the vendor data is kept in the van database and intermediate databases are arranged with additional information for a voter quite a bit of software is to be developed to match digital identities with the actual voter file with high confidence the key unit of the campaign is a and each and every record is viewable and by volunteers in search of more accurate information in the case where we ca identify the specific we can still have a partial digital voter for a person or

to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on their empathetic feelings instead of the law judges are elected and wrote justice tom parker this week federal as recently noted by chief justice in his dissent in v hodges a case in which five lawyers on the united states supreme court announced a fundamental right to are unaccountable and unelected he pointed out that three of the four dissenting supreme court justices in noted on eight different occasions that the five lawyers who decided were unelected chief justice said on two occasions that those unelected five lawyers unaccountable parker previously commented that the five lawyers failed to base their decision on legal the courts own or the rule of but upon empathetic is the product of

exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear arguments parker said active judges should have been included in the because retired are unelected and unaccountable unelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their instead of faithfully applying the rule of parker warned is not the first case concerning marriage to prove this principle true before the united states supreme court decided the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the united states miss now available autographed at the who killed the before states passed laws affirming traditional marriage in of those the traditional marriage laws

the situation that developed in the supreme court of was one of the unelected courts that struck down traditional marriage law as unconstitutional the judges of the supreme court of are appointed by the governor of although the judges are initially they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires he explained that after the legislature adopted marriage as in in a decision largely viewed as judicial the supreme court of unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of and held unconstitutional the very next three of the judges who had concurred in had to stand
