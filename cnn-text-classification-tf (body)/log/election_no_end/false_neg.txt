trump the family plead for the white house to save him the drama is dominating the news networks a media storm what will trump nobody has a clue trump lacks military experience he has never served in the armed forces nor does he have any background in diplomacy what trump does by all is a short fuse a tendency to shoot first and ask questions later his predecessors would have played for appealed to local or pursued talks while examining options for a president trump is different unused to the awesome responsibility of the oval under fierce pressure to enraged by personal infuriated by accusations of and determined not to show it is easy to imagine trump making a hasty and disastrous call with a few translated into trump could not only lose the he could plunge the us inextricably into the quagmire of another middle east war there are grave doubts about trump volatile temperament and macho doubts about volatile temperament and macho instincts also apply in other global where a

local are becoming more likely as the endgame in the fight against the caliphate battle is being fought out on two main fronts one is the siege of northern principal city trump has the conduct of the

says that defeating terrorism is a top priority and he will the shit out of but including appears to know what this means in practice if the battle goes will he will he cities where millions of civilians is he prepared to deploy us ground what will he do as seems both sieges become bogged or begins daily executions of is also silent about significant military intervention in and and its

exercises is reaching new heights and operations are increasingly reported in and elsewhere in the eastern remains a ticking any of these could ignite at any time in first governments want to present a united front but trump seems more interested in buying off by acquiescing in reclamation of former cold war spheres of influence disdain for the he loudly applauded vote to leave and critical

nails it my wife and i have just returned from across for six weeks we looked for election signs all the way the only trump sign we saw was on the trump tower he once owned in we saw one a damp print in a front yard in the lefty area of the night of the second we saw one sanders same same area we did see two feel the bumper stickers on a car at an surf beach this was the only bumper sticker we began in across the and west to we through to st then through central up into then to across and to where i mailed my absentee ballot yet most significant was what we never the word republican nor the word anywhere on any sign or poster everywhere we saw posters and signs for candidates for the for state senators and and sheriffs all avoided listing their much attention has been focused on the timing of chief letter to congress saying his agency is investigating more emails potentially related to he chose to issue the letter just days before the hotly contested election but it is the scheduling that reveals the letter to be political released as it was on a afternoon that timing guaranteed no new information would be revealed at least until giving speculation and hyperbole a head start on the facts and it teed up the issue for the influential morning political that timing is a colleen burns when was running against for the democratic the popular narrative first female president versus first president excessive personality triggered a different about two maniacs running for president the fact that some of the original narrative has been lost that a week away from potentially seeing the first female president of the united states is a shame i follow politics but seeing the us elect a female president is an important and exciting sign of progress that seems to have been lost in the elections

a wealthy republican whom j trump selected on as the next secretary of has spent her career promoting a privatized vision of public education if she pursues that agenda in her new she is quite likely to face disappointment and frustration school reforms generally come in two vouchers and charter schools they differ in both structure and political orientation charter schools are public open to accountable in varying degrees to public and usually run by nonprofit organizations by allow students to attend any public or including those run by religious organizations and companies while charters enjoy support from most republicans and some vouchers have a narrower political those who tend to favor free markets to replace many government responsibilities working primarily in ms has been a strong advocate of and her charter work has often focused on making charter schools as private as possible the large majority of charters are run by in contrast with most states the family donated more than million to republican lawmakers earlier this year during a successful effort to oppose new oversight of charters that support made ms a natural choice for who proposed a billion federal voucher program on the campaign and has likened the public school system to a monopoly business that needs to be broken up but any effort to promote vouchers from will run up against the basic structures of education the united states spends over billion a year on public schools less than percent of that money comes from the federal and it is almost exclusively dedicated to specific populations of most notably students with disabilities and students in communities there are no existing federal funds that can easily be turned into vouchers large enough to pay for school tuition on the open market billion proposal would by very expensive it may be hard to fit into a budget passed by a republican congress that has pledged to enact large tax cuts for corporations and expand the military and eliminate the budget all at the same time yet billion nearly enough to finance vouchers which is why proposal assumes that states will kick in another billion states have that kind of money lying around the only plausible source is existing school funding but even if ms were to find a willing governor and state not that easy roughly half of all education funding comes from local property taxes raised by over local school districts they and their elected representatives will have a too this is where the intersection of geography and politics makes any national voucher plan much more difficult to enact the practicality of school choice is highly related to population density children need to be able to get from home to school and back again every day in a large metropolis with public there could be dozens of schools within reasonable travel distance of most families in a small town or rural there will be few or none and population as saw in the last is increasingly the dividing line of the politics a significant number of most ardent supporters live in sparsely populated areas where school choice is logistically unlikely at the same many of the municipalities where market reforms are theoretically much easier to put in voted overwhelmingly against the on election voters in liberal rejected a ballot measure by a margin that would have increased the number of charter schools in the despite strong evidence that the charters produce superior results for and minority schoolchildren in information technology offers a way around the population density problem virtual schools can be attended from anywhere with an connection colleges that have pocketed billions of dollars by offering courses are poised to make a comeback under the trump which is likely to roll back president efforts to regulate them but the federal government is a much larger financial contributor to colleges and universities than to and college students need an adult looking after them all day ms will probably be a boon to the relatively growing population of families that their children but most parents will still want their children in a school building during the taught by a not by a computer ms will also be hamstrung by the fact that her deregulated school choice philosophy has not been considered a resounding success in her home choice policies have led to a wild west of cutthroat competition and poor academic results while there is substantial academic literature on school vouchers and while debates continue between opposing camps of safe to say that vouchers have not produced the kind of large improvements in academic achievement that reformers originally promised
appears to have rebounded in popularity according to a new post which shows her leading against trump another poll from the la times shows trump ahead by five percentage so the overall average support for each candidate has remained unchanged since yesterday at a point lead for measures of national opinion are poles figures are but they ignore two groups of the undecideds and those who plan on voting for a third candidate look at the who are planning to vote for someone other than or trump take a look at the in in the midst of primary there were a lot more who seemed to be still making up their minds one in likely voters said they were undecided since that figure has slowly not so declined to about one in likely according to the polling the of voters who claim to be undecided seem capable of swinging the election if they all vote for she would win the popular according to if they went for win although they all swing in the same worth considering the intentions of these a undecideds arouse cynicism could anyone in this election possibly be skepticism they keeping their the where undecided respondents in the seemed to make a decision to leave the has only deepened suspicion of these there are three possibilities the undecideds truly know who to vote the undecideds know whether to vote at and they know exactly who they will vote for but want to disclose it with nosy pollsters briefly examine each of if individuals made up their own pretty difficult for analysts to anticipate their actions some electoral theory suggests that when people they opt for the safer option of preserving the status quo as was the case in the independence referendum that would work in favor as she would preserve her vote share in states like that have been democrat for decades but which now appear to be leaning increasingly voters in might break with history a majority of us adults trust elected officials the media for that the rise of with his suggests that many may now consider the status quo a scenario turnout will be crucial in this election and there is a real chance that many of these undecideds will simply not show up in survey firm changed their respondent group to better understand undecideds of their respondents said they would not vote though did not find a substantial partisan divide among these current campaign strategies would seem to suggest that low turnout will work in favor has been repeatedly trying to boost particularly among minority whom she will need in several swing states campaign advisers have claimed the strategy is now to suppress turnout rather than encouraging potential undecideds to vote trump also mixed evidence when it comes to understanding whether undecideds are actually secret trump voters who are hiding their intentions from pollsters in the primary polling averages matched pretty closely with final results in most states but voting in the primary season and the national election are pretty different partly because the individuals who show up to pick a nominee are more politically engaged voters in respondents who say undecided are some mix of all of these three groups for early voting suggests that some black undecideds might decide not to show up on election day but the geography of being undecided also matters why visited north on where he told a fate of the republic rests on your is worth of the electoral college votes required to win the white house and voters here are deeply split about which way the state should go current polling averages show trump beating by percentage points a meaningless lead because these numbers could be wrong by a few percentage points in either of likely voters in north said they were who they would vote for in a poll conducted on but a pretty crude measure of intention polls often force respondents to pick a side by starting the question with the words the presidential election were held today a later question in the same survey asked voters how certain they were about their choice of said they might still change their minds and said they change their minds early ballots in the state have promising news for though they suggest voters in north are choosing over trump elections
among the many asphyxiating gut punches delivered by his denigration of immigrants and pledge to deport them en stand out trump has now signaled that he will move to deport as many as three million immigrants after he takes and roll back executive action protecting more than undocumented immigrants brought to the united states as guesswork under way over the damage trump might from decimating what remains of the social safety net to trashing precarious efforts to curb global is chilling the promised attack on immigrants suggests we will see communities terrorized by what can only be fairly described as a police state received little attention is that trump would probably use tools developed by the bush and administrations to orchestrate mass deportations over the last the federal government has used local police and jails as a key tool to orchestrate mass deportations and precisely what trump plans to do on a more frightening scale than is secure now called the priority enforcement program it links an database comprising fingerprints entered by local law enforcement bodies to immigration and customs enforcement under secure communities made local arrests the key entry point to a deportation pipeline that removed million from the country another is authorized by bill but first implemented under which deputizes local police and jails to search out undocumented immigrants thanks to a strong immigrant rights curbed both to a limited in the case of secure heavily degree after overseeing mass deportations trump has clearly stated he will get rid of restrictions and embrace both programs with open the last two the political tied to wall street and indifferent to working has received a just share of blame for allowing trump to come to power when it comes to that blame is more well deserved than is widely understood for establishment leaders like bush and have attempted to placate rising on the right instead of confronting implementing immigration and border crackdowns instead of sating the hunger for the establishment has lent credence to their paranoiac fears over criminal immigrants rather than fighting their extreme policy the establishment built the right a monstrous deportation machinery that could now be used to utterly monstrous ends is how been used all what sounds so terrifying coming out of mouth today is not so different from what minus the brazen has articulated as policy in recent not families not children gang not a mom working hard to provide for her said in you meet the you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law if a be executive has failure to rein in national security policies hands trump a fully loaded to extend that analogy on has provided trump with fully loaded bullets and a army the immigration debate at the center of this election has at its core been utterly and his track record on immigration has been one that should have made trump proud he has orchestrated mass deportations the border patrol boasted more than agents in up from agents in and in there are miles of fencing along a heavily militarized border where human rights abuses are was a he was susceptible to pressure from an emboldened immigrants rights movement led by young people a movement that trump will be proud to include on his enemies list that movement won historic victories protecting the undocumented brought to this country as and another executive action protecting the parents of citizens the former could very well be overturned by trump the latter is held up in court thanks to an evenly divided supreme court thanks to electoral college win and republican will probably tilt right hard right once something that can do to help thwart trump and do penance for his own immigration sins in the after sending sharply and misleadingly conflicted told states and localities that sharing fingerprints with ice was essentially mandatory immigrant rights activists are campaigning for him to reverse course and make the program voluntary if does trump will have to explicitly make the program mandatory once again in order to implement mass deportations localities and states can sue in court to stop him administration has options to prevent a crisis of its own as the national day laborer organizing network put it in a memo sent to the white house on political bears responsibility for rise and should take action to limit the damage up to the who are now protesting about the coming trump presidency to make him do elections
oliver shadow he reveals the psychiatric association has a set up after psychiatrists told a news magazine that they believed the republican candidate in the presidential had advocated the use of atomic bombs in north was unfit for office went on to lose by to how unfortunate that the prohibition not to diagnose from a distance has prevented what would surely be a far stronger assertion of unfitness for purpose in respect of who has repeatedly asked why the us does not deploy nuclear weapons attention has been drawn to the similarities in mannerism and message between trump and another authoritarian and belligerent with there seems little room for doubt as to how with his dysfunctional would have reacted to the missile crisis and subsequent foreign policy if he is arguably the greatest threat to all our futures that we have for readers of novel the plot against campaign for the white house may sound rather in novel on an alternative history in which aviation hero is nominated as the republican candidate for president in and goes on to defeat franklin d on the back of a strong tide of popular first act is to sign a treaty with and promising that the us will not interfere with expansion in with as families increasingly feel like outsiders in society if you swap for for and for then novel seems frighteningly prophetic scrape away at the surface of society and there is something very nasty lurking you say police fended off trump supporters who attacked a peaceable protester but not whether they arrested the aggressors who had piled on holding him on the ground and grabbing his testicles while he was choked by one man who had him in a headlock those familiar with fascism in will the i cannot help thinking a lot this past year of the pioneering journalist from in who lamented that people ever their dictator in advance when our dictator turns up you can depend on it that he will be one of the and he will stand for everything traditionally and nobody will ever say to nor will they call him or duce but they will greet him with one great bleat of fix it like you oh she say great but you get the may be unduly optimistic to suggest that a victory for will end the nightmare of trump it may be only the beginning trump has indicated that he will not accept the result if it goes against him it is not beyond possibility that with his trump will accuse the of fixing the result and lead an armed insurrection after the extreme right in the us is nothing if not paranoid and certainly such a prospect is a deep concern of many fears that a trump victory would us all hope instead that on remember the motto of noble spirit the smallest i imagine it is the women we will need to rely elections
as news of shocking loss sinks many supporters looking for someone to blame are pointing fingers at a familiar people who voted outside the are already trying to blame libertarian and the green party for win for concocted a scenario in which by taking every stein vote and half of could have grabbed enough states from trump to eke out an electoral college a story repeated by unwilling to accept that motivate enough voters to win the and explore the reasons many pundits are instead looking to put responsibility for the loss onto the if every single stein voter had voted for still where drops and inherits half of libertarian where does the other half in exit polls showed that only of and stein voters preferred to who preferred while the majority of voters and of stein voters simply have voted for either if we were barred from might have gained a net of those but still lost these are delusional candidates snap their fingers and make their supporters vote for someone else they support pundits may think their favored party is entitled to those but actual voters make their own decisions no candidate owns vote votes have to be for scapegoats is a way to avoid criticism and accountability after failure those who claimed that was more electable than despite his stronger polling against are now desperately trying to spin the failure of their media gives alternative parties just a tiny fraction of their election coverage when we do get smear campaigns and charges dominate the discussion pundits justify our exclusion from the airwaves and debates by saying we a factor yet after election day they declare us the most important anyone outside the system a with no right to run is it suppresses political discourages citizen participation in democracy and shields the toxic system from criticism or party voters consider it to perpetuate a system that keeps getting worse many of them make deliberate decisions to use their votes to change that system yet after making minimal effort to understand these pundits caricature them as selfish normalizing bullying behavior and threats towards anyone who steps outside the collapsing people want more not fewer some think a new major party is needed because the establishment parties do such a poor job reached a new low with the most disliked candidates in history if most of us want more the media inform us about other candidates on the instead of attacking when can we move past this trap and take our democracy into our own good voters in and elsewhere are tackling the head on with ranked choice voting this voting system lets you rank your so if your first choice your vote is automatically reassigned to your second choice ranked choice voting empowers you to vote for the candidates who best represent your values no one can tell you your vote if you vote for the in order to stop the candidate you fear most ranked choice voting also rewards both candidates and voters who find common ground with rather than slamming them with negative are the of this bitter election merely looking for a or are they willing to work constructively to fix systemic the very fact that the political and media establishment was able to ram two historically unpopular candidates down our collective throats exposes a critical need for greater democracy ranked choice voting is an obvious first said that those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat its mistakes so the real question ready to join us and get to work fixing our broken electoral

last week the new of all ran an opinion piece in of hereditary monarchy under the consider a argued unlike elected heads of monarchies offer continuity and a focus for national togetherness quoting the historian advantage of monarchy is that the institution the hopes of by rising above the toxic partisanship of competing parties and vying elected as thousands march on trump tower chanting my you can rather see his the crown on as a distraction from the nightmare of the a similar thought struck that there may be considerable advantage in having something beyond the ballot box to appeal something transcendent around which to when the immanent is so hopelessly fraught and i reference the transcendent advisedly as the depiction of coronation makes perfectly the coronation is a theological transaction the queen was anointed in an abbey and not appointed in a government building and anointing has been the manner of conferring divine office at least since the priest and the prophet anointed king in ancient in other we just live in a constitutional monarchy in the united we live in a constitutional theocracy get me i want our monarchy to have zero executive authority but the idea of retaining something like the crown around which to something that stands apart from democratic has rarely seemed so compelling citizenship and immigration website crashed within hours of victory time for us to move to new suggested us supreme court justice only and the new immigration website has experienced an increase of traffic from the us not that thousands of good republicans have finally decided to return to the royal bosom but no coincidence that these places have the queen as their head of the still small voice of calm at the of the many and new want a foreign queen as their head of state either but it is a testament to the political value of monarchy that even in such proudly independent countries they have still found it impossible to dream up a more acceptable alternative and in both places progressive politics flourishes similarly in the idea of an elected head of state has been frequently scotched with just two president who directed the is no fawning courtier and his politics are clearly on the left he and i both worked in the now destroyed camp in he with a that he helped to i with st which the have now bulldozed we had a discussion once that they performed similar roles both being places to come together when produced the opening ceremony of the he was again telling a compelling story about our national togetherness and the same thing again with the own church for is as diverse as it in in social in ethnicity outside of they probably have very little in common not not the food they not their choice of entertainment but they will sing god save the queen with and none more so than those who have emigrated from former commonwealth countries where the queen represents a fixed point of national solidarity when she is prayed for on it is with a sense of genuine affection that could never perhaps should never be directed towards an elected official and before you say the royals represent no threat to progressive reform indeed arguable that without steady presence introduction of radical ideas like the and the welfare would have been hugely more difficult to an age where the money god has now become incarnate in the person of this man we should thank our lucky stars that our head of state worships at a very different elections
like so many with the overwhelming sense of despondency at compounding the lingering depression of as one tries to find some explanation for the spreading darkness of the tribal nationalism that seems to be pervading so many of the countries long viewed as the bastions of progressive it is too easy to offer the cloak of alienation from the or even of to those with their are welcoming the leaders of this so accentuated in recent plays a significant part what is common to the success of such leaders is their cynical and dangerous plumbing of the depths of the most negative facets of human veneer of painstakingly applied over so many years by the now seemingly distant voices of ever has become allowing those who seek to do so et to prise open the breathing the oxygen of negativity on to the malevolence which had been so precariously the hostility towards whatever factions happen to present themselves as enemies of that we hold firmly to those tenets of true the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary it is a sad reflection on the state of that the supreme court has become so as our supreme court faces its sternest test of never has such independence been more the scenario and the saga of the us election suggest that archaic systems of democracy are no longer fit for purpose in the century as unconstrained racism and demonstrable lies have become accepted as successful political the apparent result authoritarian and nationalistic systems of government and social conjures of the fascism if this does not represent the objectives of the and is simply a result of democratic reprogramming of the system is urgently letters on election victory us election result is a sharp lesson from losers and two nations divided by a common must his pledge to close bay crave politicians who actually stand for something media and politicians are out of man make grate elections supreme

for his second john a journalist with extensive experience in has taken a microscope to an enormous the relationship between the united states and from to the present with growing stress points in that relationship and the emergence of strongman leaders in both the beautiful country and the middle arrives during a precarious inflection point it is peppered with characters that uses to trace a long historical from a to a prominent and henry m the former united states treasury secretary is scheduled to speak about his book on at the politics and prose bookstore in in an he discussed the history of interactions between the united states and president xi and what china policy might emerge from the trump administration what has been the overarching paradigm of united relations from the century to and have been enchanting each other and disappointing each other since they first met in when the first ship landed in with a cargo of ginseng and silver to trade for tea if a pattern to the it has been rapturous enchantment followed by despair right are in the disenchantment phase of the as are the you tell many colorful anecdotes of and in contact with each other which one do you think best reflects the wider one of the main goals of the book was to bring to light stories of unchronicled influence on both sides the first minister to the court in was a young republican named was a radical abolitionist who was dispatched to by the administration believed that the west needed to give china time to develop and modernize and stop pressuring china to change he believed that the west had no right to for the way china treated and he argued that western officials should tolerate the habit of maintaining that their emperor actually ruled the entire world to encapsulates one side of the view of one that reappeared in the and lasted up through the beginning of the administration the or rather the bet that china would liberalize and become more like us as long as we facilitated its rise in opposition to other believed his views on china as one of his successors in put a that also has formed a key part of the perspective on china your book discusses the way governments in the two nations have interacted with each but you also go into detail on the roles that notable nonpolitical figures have played to what extent does the united relationship depend on the attitudes of each leaders versus those of other whether they are from the elite classes or the grass in many we and the and our elites and those from the grass are captives of our past in the beginning of the individual and created the relationship and imbued it with much of its meaning merchants and missionaries saw china as a vast market for stuff and for souls saw as a place that could save china from the depredations of other imperialist nations with its educational as a model for china to emulate at the same other groups of feared the starting in the late oppressed workers in starting a long history of fearing the industriousness of the had their own prejudices against and ideas as viewing them as sexually deviant and dangerous many of these dreams and fantasies and biases we have about each other have resurfaced in subsequent decades in claim that china has been the united states when it comes to one can hear the populists of the party in late railing on the streets of against heathen in your many years as a journalist in what were the most notable changes you saw in the united with is less willing to bend to will than before and more willing to aggressively pursue its whether they involve trade or the south china sea spent decades arguing that as china strengthened it would become more like a liberal western nation it turned out that and as such the has stopped doing china any favors much more than it is blocking the sales of western companies to firms and strengthening its alliances with nations around periphery the careful balance of containment and engagement that defined policy toward china is now heavily skewed toward containment what are your thoughts on president xi and how the united states fits into xi has said he wants to rule which i think can be translated into a desire to see china rule in this the is an interloper and would do best to retreat to and let china handle the western pacific china benefited greatly from the in the but now xi feels that china does not need the to protect it anymore it wants the out of not next not the year but one day soon with the election of trump as the next united states where do you see the relationship trump is not an when it comes to his views on china they are but so were and those of many of his predecessors during the trump seesawed between accusing china of the united states on threatening to walk away from alliances in east and thereby ceding the western pacific to and mulling the idea of some type of with china where the would accept rise if china did not endanger the status quo in trump will enter office against a backdrop of an facing a dictator in north and a china eager to capitalize on missteps how he juggles and his own competing mix of disappointment and realism about china will help determine the future of the relationship and the future of the globe if i had to i think he is going to be more pragmatic than many initially but prognostication is a tough especially when it comes to china and trump
prime minister of japan is planning to sit down with j trump in new on in what would be the first meeting with a foreign leader since his election wants to find out how serious trump was during his campaign when he repeatedly criticized japan on trade issues and for not paying more of the cost of its own defense and since the establishment was expecting to win the wants to assure trump that he is willing and eager to work with him the prime minister is concerned about commitment to protecting japan the united states is most important and is legally obligated to defend it against attack there are around troops stationed in a powerful deterrent against the rising threat of north and an increasingly assertive china during the trump suggested he might withdraw troops not without resistance from members of officials at the state diplomats and military advisers the united alliance has been in place since the end of world war and has a lot of backing on both sides of the pacific ocean maybe there are signs that japan might be willing to pay or do but many experts contend troops are not only defending japan but the united own interests in the pentagon is budgeted to spend about billion to support troops and bases on and elsewhere around japan this year japan is set to spend billion to support the in addition to at least billion on related including compensation for the communities that host the bases and funds for relocating troops under its which was written by occupying forces after world war japan can keep an army for defensive purposes but has said he wants to revise the constitution and expand the military in his government requested the latest in a series of increases in military spending japan has committed to the nuclear nonproliferation and will probably remind trump of that on the campaign trump decried the cost of providing a nuclear umbrella to allies such as japan and south that do not have their own nuclear arms in trump told the new times that he was open to those countries building their own nuclear but on twitter this week he denied having said so has reaffirmed his commitment not to develop atomic weapons any move to do so would face severe public opposition in the only country that has suffered a nuclear attack he has been one of the biggest enthusiasts for the partnership or as it is known though japan was the last of a dozen pacific rim countries to join the sweeping trade pact trump repeatedly criticized the during the presidential campaign made politically painful concessions on agricultural imports to close the deal and get manufacturers access to export markets in the united states and elsewhere the trade partnership could bolster the limp economic growth rate in his country and serve as a counterweight to the superpower acknowledged after victory that the partnership was in a difficult but his government still plans to have parliament ratify the and he has not given up on selling it to trump may also seek to soften angry campaign in which he accused japan of crushing the united states on and manipulating its currency to gain an economic advantage trump says for free trade in but wants a for the united states what that for remains a mystery
so just when we thought that get any more it with a trump victory i told you last week that strange happenings were afoot in the what with the cubs winning the world series and all i hear that new yorkers are taking it pretty hard are people stocking up on canned greetings from the land of duck and not sure quite sunk in but foods and subterranean real estate are in demand and sounds like a hunting club so where shall we a little weary of the conversations get right to what do you think will happen trump will set up an administration the sun will rise in the east my dog will chase squirrels the world will go on glad to hear taking it well he stayed cautiously neutral in the but a very good boy i think you once made the point to me that there are no permanent victories or defeats in politics so perhaps a good place to start a conversation about the future been since i came to at the collective failure to understand that point it is patently true upon the most cursory inspection of recent history in democrats were popping champagne over the dawn of a permanent era of progressive politics now they see most of their dreams being unraveled and republicans celebrating today will sooner or later be miserable i made a things are looking better already both winners and losers who ignore this reality make silly unforced errors the losers err on the side of excessive like the classic threats to leave the country reader email has informed me way harder to leave the country than one might think we in all that much demand and the winners fail when they convince themselves that since victory is they can set an agenda that attracts no one from the other side looking at a president trump and a house and say we are in for a stretch of dumb things presidents generally get most of their big changes done in the first year or two president did that with health care his agenda was nothing compared to w who did everything from tax cuts to getting authorization for the invasion but was certainly a big lift it was also a central campaign promise i know you think it was a bad idea i think that strategy is enormously shortsighted i remember thinking when the democrats held the white house and both houses of congress in though they have it might be wise to give a little to bring some centrist republicans into some day the republicans might be in a position to reverse everything if they have zero political investment in and sure here we are my point is that of course a president should have a vision that matches his ideology why he got elected but i think it is impractical and imprudent to forgive me for another reference to is spinal turn it up to give on a few things where you have because someday going to need friends to protect the stuff you care about most the trump administration might learn from the outgoing horror at seeing some or all of repealed we part company here my perception of was of a democratic party willing to work on compromise legislation while the republicans just stalled there was no unified republican just a ton of people who wanted to be but kept changing their mind but the bottom line is that left behind the old congress now got guys who sleep in their offices and even talk to the other side at the house gym secretly a lot of them are actually but i take your point and another recommendation i would make to president make friends everyplace that was the magic golf with the same people every week since i have no prepared to look on the bright side for a while the republican hatred of is so great that even if had gotten elected it would have been really hard to get the necessary fixes through congress trump has promised and as of his interview something better that preserves the most popular parts of the program so see what he comes up with i know a big fan his agenda and agenda really do congress is set to have a big influence on the agenda over the next and and trump will figure out how to make their ideas jibe plan includes a health care replacement plan for it will actually do some of the things liberals really like getting more people covered i realize that very disappointing for progressives to see but not like it will be replaced by nothing this is one area where the product usually resemble the recipe i remember presidential candidate saying all health care negotiations could take place in on grab your crystal ball and give me a couple of other predictions seeing a big tax cut and huge spending on infrastructure repair followed by a stupendous rise in the national debt certainly true that neither party has been great at getting the deficit under control in my lifetime nobody calls his or her congressman and just do sit only one side adds to the deficit while simultaneously complaining too big but move on obviously cranky how any other how about the early the republican establishment seems to have as white house chief of staff but is going to be chief strategist which could mean anything to me is the kind of guy democrats should learn to live with they and going to be a republican white house but is a very bad dude who represents all the worst strands of racism and misogyny in the trump crowd who do you think will really have the it looks like both will be influential after watching the i find pair of appointments too surprising they signal that in as during his trump will seek to merge traditional republican politics with his unconventional
exasperated voters may soon see an end to the political deadlock that has left the country without a government since last embattled socialists have voted to abstain from a parliamentary confidence vote in a move which will allow the conservatives to form a minority the announcement of the socialist the end of the of the system the grand coalition is united left party the oligarchy has who is in charge of until it elects a new argued that abstention was the given that the other option was to force an election in which would have been third in a like you to know what you think about the state of politics should the socialists have voted to have you switched your allegiance to another how well do you think politicians are serving the your thoughts on the state of politics by filling in the form and use a selection in our reporting
somehow trump manages to dumb down everything somehow he manages to lower the bar to the point where he can play by a different set of rules and somehow the media and elected officials just shrug their shoulders and walk his own the is negotiating business deals at a time when his predecessors you filling cabinet positions and transitioning to power he met with his business partners and the trump organization signed a deal last trump tweeted earlier this to the election it was well known that i have interests in properties all over the world only the crooked media makes this a big explained this in more if not entirely in his interview with the new built a very great company and a big company and all over the world people are starting to when they look at all these different like in and other number a job like that builds great relationships with the people of so all all is indeed approach to mixing his business and political affairs law is totally on my he the president have a conflict of be profiting from the presidency would not be a quaint conflict of is not about whether trump favors one country or president over gives a contract to one company or or spends more time making money for himself than he does boning up about policy there are laws on the books about us businesses influencing foreign officials with payments or other inducements the law is called the foreign corrupt practices act and its goal is to stamp out bribery by any us is what the law calls favors and payments given to foreign officials in exchange for business deals not a conflict of and favors going the other way into the pockets of the president are so clearly corrupt that they were forbidden by the founding fathers in the constitution the emoluments clause prohibits gifts and titles from foreign powers as person holding any office of profit or trust under without the consent of the accept of any or of any kind from any or foreign this clause that leads to exceptional red tape around any and all gifts received by the white house and every other from a homemade quilt to a watch everything is declared and surrendered officials can only keep the gifts up to a value of if they repay the us process will be hard within the world of international real where foreign powers can grant gifts ranging from planning permits to investments from sovereign wealth funds the list is almost we know if trump discussed his investment with president of but we do know that his daughter now running the family business was on the call we know if there was any suggestion that president could expect any benefits for himself or his country spokespeople for president and trump have denied reports about the mixing of trump business and politics on the we do know that the project is now moving news that emerged just three days after the call between and trump for a president who has refused to release his tax the need for transparency is not exactly any the fact that even having this discussion tells you something profound about the trump presidency before it officially begins promise to his voters was that he was incorruptible because he was so independently wealthy that nobody could touch him he knew how to drain the swamp because he had lived in it for so buying off begging politicians for so many years that it made him argument was always a but clearly many voters bought into his pitch just two weeks since the obvious that trump has no interest in separating his personal wealth from his political agenda the damage caused is not confined to public confidence in the united states government being leader of the free world is not a casual concept that cold war phrase encapsulates the notion that the united states is a beacon of freedom and democracy for the world as his own transition came to an best summed up the notion in his final address in in have been guided by the standard john set before his shipmates on the flagship years as faced the task of building a new government on a perilous frontier must always he we shall be as a city upon a hill the eyes of all people are upon eyes of the world are on the trump transition right now they see a who lost the popular vote by more than million votes and almost percentage is a difficult notion of democracy to explain to a world struggling against authoritarian regimes where votes are routinely ignored and discounted the work of democracy promotion by the national endowment for established by is immeasurably harder as a result of the work of spreading government has become just as hard as a result of business dealings if a sitting president can enrich himself while in then why a president of a developing country set up his own businesses to do the why should they not do after as trump told the theory i could run my business and then run the country corruption the seeking of personal profit by government officials derived from their roles is a plague that condemns the most vulnerable people in the world to poor or public services if the us talk credibly about the need to stamp out conflict of the world will struggle to eradicate corruption and improve life for the poorest people on the needs to lead by example and that starts with the president not a conflict of interest the national
victory in the us presidential election has produced worldwide bewilderment some of this may prove depending on how trump performs but in part it is a reaction to the way we conduct our election campaigns the oceans of the overweening role and the tested and proved tactics of despite the accusations and mutual when the result was declared both trump and showed once again that in the peaceful transfer of power is sacred friends and allies take more than of there is nothing to be bewildered about their candidate with the margin of victory provided by trump breaching the firewall in the supposed experts underplayed or ignored the rising unhappiness caused by the squeeze on the middle class and the failure of political institutions and leaders to address its legitimate concerns sanders and trump both understood this and it is the principal fact to take from this campaign for friends and what does a trump presidency mean in the question of trade can be disposed of easily however much value there can be for countries on both sides of the the transatlantic trade and investment partnership is not going to see much progress any time if trump the businessman comes to see its trump the champion of the us middle class will be a tough and will not be high on his agenda that place is reserved for underscored by the election to attend first to domestic economic problems notably infrastructure and plus project of national growth and twitter us soldiers take part in a exercise in is this ordering of priorities entirely bad for an slipping further behind in holding its own economically with and with the huge domestic inequalities that threaten political and social would not be a sufficiently useful partner for friends across the what of prominent among concerns is the fear that trump will abandon the alliance or at least substantially downgrade its importance to interests of national which historically are the principal determinant of us actions in foreign argue is not to suggest that an alliance that has prospered and proved itself relevant in all weathers will not be abandoned by this or any other president when he enters the oval office on trump will find that the us still has vital interests in remaining deeply engaged that threats and challenges are no different then than they were on and that his pledge to great must include an indeed a commitment better to face that world with allies than trump wants more spending on the us as an astute he will know that his hopes for transforming relations with must include keeping its powder its guard up and its western alliance in good says he will do what is necessary to defeat especially though unlike he will not use us military power against in line with most he wants no new wars in the including with at the same the us will take in no middle east a resistance to helping that is shared by and victory speech what trump said and what he meant read did say he wants allies to their which means meeting goal of spending of on five of allies now do this is also the policy but careful reading of what trump as opposed to the political meal the campaign made of his imprecise provides no evidence he would abandon the states if they faced aggression and his asking to stand more on their own militarily is also an would trump stand up to an assertive and president the latter welcomed the us election outcome so more in his victory the us want to tell the world community that while we will always put interests we will deal fairly with with everyone all people and all other nations we will seek common not not conflict we will get along with all other nations willing to get along with do prefer that a us president says the opposite providing he means what he said and learns the frustrations and limitations of putting it into trump said on election night is far better than simple acceptance of the current drift by both and into a rigid which key by see as almost unavoidable maybe approach will work in offering a if will to get back on the road to president goal of a whole and free and at perhaps it but it is worth a and it is worth our at least for trying to calm and carry

presidential elections do not just determine the fate of the next four years in the united states they shape the fate of the rest of the and the world pays close means you need a special perspective to do justice to the remarkable spectacle of a presidential cycle you need the reporters to cover multiple working on the shortened news cycles of social media you need the specialist writers to dig into both the domestic and international you need the columnists to make sense of it all for readers at home who are about to and for those overseas who sorely wish they columnists are as diverse and spirited as our readers we have traveled with all the immersed ourselves in the and been trolled by all sides i do read the comments and mean the political coverage in the there is so much information at our disposal but so little understanding to separate the signal from the noise requires experience and the kind of context you can only get from being expensive to cover us elections the country is the candidates are and the news never stops but it would be far costlier for us all if our voice were can we understand where the democratic party is heading after what animates and motivates can we make sense of trump when he can barely make sense of his own your we can answer those questions along the you might just understand and appreciate this carnival of an election a little no livelier debate than the one going on between the writers and readers we always but we will all be smarter for the that conversation today by making a contribution or becoming a
as the technology industry came to grips in the last week with the reality of a presidential election that did not go its many in silicon valley landed on the idea that widespread misinformation spread was a primary factor in the outcome on both and altered their advertising policies to explicitly prohibit sites that traffic in fake news from making money off lies very likely a worthwhile even if it comes too late the has loosened our collective grasp on the and efforts to fight that dismaying trend are obviously worth pursuing yet it would be a mistake to end this investigation at fake news in the dangers posed by fake news are just a symptom of a deeper truth now dawning on the with billions of people glued to and other popular social media has become an increasingly powerful cultural and political to the point that its effects are now beginning to alter the course of global events the election of j trump is perhaps the starkest illustration yet that across the social networks are helping to fundamentally rewire human society they have subsumed and gutted mainstream media they have undone traditional political advantages like and access to advertising and they are destabilizing and replacing institutions and established ways of doing including political transnational organizations and unspoken social prohibitions against blatant expressions of racism and xenophobia most because these services allow people to communicate with one another more they are helping to create surprisingly influential social organizations among groups these ad hoc social movements range widely in from white supremacists in the united states to in to in the middle east to the hacker collectives of eastern and but each in its own way is now wielding previously unthinkable resulting in sometimes destabilizing geopolitical spasms now have billions of people on the and most of them are not that happy with the status said the president of the a research firm that forecasts global risks think their local government is authoritarian they think on the wrong side of the establishment aggrieved by identity politics and a middle many factors accounted for economic anxiety in the industrial an inchoate desire for some kind of change in the national and some mix of latent xenophobia and sexism across the electorate but as even trump acknowledged in an interview with aired social media played a determining role in the race in the the concerns of supporters might have been and his candidacy would almost certainly have foundered after he was universally written off by just about every mainstream and he faced disadvantages in organization and access to traditional political expertise yet by putting out a message that resonated with people trump hacked through every established political order this new people are now empowered to express their grievances and to follow people they see as echoing their said it for social i see trump for people who like an predictable this is the scariest thing about not that it may be full of lies problem that could potentially be but that its scope gives it real power to change history in unpredictable ways but where we are time to start recognizing that social networks actually are becoming the forces that their boosters long promised they would be and to be rather than by the huge social changes they could uncork this should come as no surprise in a we are now living through a kind of version of the utopia that some in tech once envisioned would be unleashed by social media over much of the last we have seen progressive social movements powered by the web spring up across the world there was the green revolution in and the spring in the middle east and north in the united we saw the occupy wall street movement and the protests social networks also played a role in electoral politics first in the ultimately unsuccessful candidacy of dean in and then in the election of the first president in yet now those movements look like the prelude to a crackup in the global order in this organizing on played a major role in the push to get the country to leave the union in the a firebrand mayor who was vastly outspent by managed to marshal a huge army of supporters to help him win the presidency the state has used social networks to recruit from around the world to fight in and as well as to inspire terrorist attacks overseas and in the united both a socialist who ran for president as a and who was once reviled by most members of the party he now relied on movements to shatter the political status quo why is this all happening clay a professor at new university who has studied the effects of social suggested a few reasons one is the ubiquity of which has reached a truly epic scale last month the company reported that about billion people now log on to the service every month because social networks feed off the various permutations of interactions among they become strikingly more powerful as they grow with about a quarter of the population now on the possibilities are staggering the technology gets when the crazy social effects get said one of those social effects is what calls the of the a term coined by the researcher p to describe the range of subjects that the mainstream media deems publicly acceptable to discuss from about the early until the very recent it was usually considered unwise for politicians to court views deemed by most of society to be out of the things like overt calls to racial bias were of like the but the shifted

social media has been in the glare since the election for its perceived harmful such as the spreading of hate speech and the false information but the effect of social media on world affairs is much larger than just misinformation and mean writes in his new state of the art he argues that social media now collectively used by billions of people worldwide through services like and has grown to a point where it is increasingly influencing the course of global events the election of j who used twitter to magnify his is evidence of that writes so was the rise of whose liberal philosophy and policies were also spread by social media and there are many other such as and the momentum behind of events and movements most likely enabled by social media each person with views can see that not writes when these people find one they can get things done create publications and entire worlds that bolster their and then break into the social media is also in the spotlight for a different reason these days the kind involving big dollar signs that comes in the form of the parent company of the social media service which has filed confidentially for an initial public j la and write which is likely to take place early next is set to be the biggest tech offering since that of the company in it presages a wave of other possible public offerings from highly valued tech such as and time to mark your calendars
this election year has often felt like one enormous swarm of poll vote forecasts and nonstop statistical analysis and coverage has provided little relief how key was the vote to j did young voters shy away from what about all this number crunching led the two of us a and a polling editor to wonder what might be missed when we try to explain entire groups as being or if we write that rural voters were especially likely to back are there assumptions that we might be but that actually hold true for many rural if we say that millennial voters were unlikely to support are we getting the full the video above is our attempt to unpack just a few of these terms we hope it will serve as an invitation to keep and to look at the headlines we see reporting exit poll statistics as only telling part of the story
it is with civility and equanimity that the welcomed the trumps to the white house a smooth transition of where victors are magnanimous in victory and the defeated graciously are the hallmarks of a politics the office of the president of the united states in some ways resembles an elective kingship in a democratic which explains perhaps why it is afforded such a reverence in society it is a good thing that the spirit of shared commitment to the ideals of has led to an outbreak of mutual respect between political who had traded lower and lower blows in the final days of a vicious campaign actions are important president welcomed a man who spent years questioning his birthplace trump accepted an invitation from a man who had declared him unfit for the presidency trump was wise to say he would accept counsel from the current who he described as a good man in setting aside politics gains words carry weight trump cast political opponents as criminals and accused them of treason he threatened to investigate his rivals and sue his female accusers who claimed he had sexually assaulted them as president he finds himself facing a slew of civil law suits he wore his grudges and resentments like badges of one wonders how such a figure will administer neutrally and fairly perhaps he might be tempted not to this would be a grave a nation trump campaigned in mendacity he now needs to govern in work on dictatorships run on fear in a democracy citizens accept the disappointment of defeat because they believe that their rights will be protected in a disinterested and impartial way voters know that they can make mistakes but there is always another chance to engage again in a fair fight for hearts and minds limit this and legitimacy drains away there have been signs of such dissatisfaction in recent decades popular discontent coupled with a deep mistrust of government marched with falling voting turnout and declining party loyalties the state and citizen were prised and a deficit in democracy yawned open bucked this trend like trump he too was an outsider who toppled a party establishment and beat to the presidency unlike trump he campaigned as a uniter not a divider of people his appeal was he would attempt to reach out to his opponents in the end he did not succeed and he left imperfect trump would do well to pick up where left off there is an urgent need in the united states for politicians to the middle ground of common sense this means not resorting to the that turned paranoia into a presidential campaign trump exhorted voters to the read the yet the fake news industry he gave rise to a segregation that and damaged society refashioning social and economic relations to preserve liberty and justice will rely on facts that a country can agree ideological approach of republicans determined to win at all costs must be the stoking of white anger should be consigned to history a nation divided needs to be brought elections

democrats and republicans in this fiercely contested political battleground have regularly resorted to creative legal maneuvers and changes in their efforts to wring every last vote from the nearly seven million voters but even by that the hairbreadth race for governor is plowing litigious and acrimonious ground scrambling to save the incumbent pat republicans said they were pursuing protests in about half of north alleging that fraud and technical troubles had pushed the democratic attorney general to a statewide lead of more than votes but county elections including one here in turned back some of the challenges on the legal and political jockeying raised the specter of a and it could ultimately climax in a political wild using a state law to contest the election in the general assembly supposed to have an inauguration on a republican said we going to have a i is what most people are going to start wondering pretty the race this year was among the most bitterly contested campaigns in the country the state was a prime battleground in the presidential and it has been fractured by debates about and abortion republicans largely prevailed here on election j trump won north by more than three percentage and senator burr was by a larger margin but struggled the aftermath has become a protracted spectacle campaign said this week that there were instances of votes being cast by dead felons or individuals who voted more than a spokesman for ford replied that the governor had a new standard for such arguments helped transform what might have been perfunctory meetings of elections regulators into crucial sessions that stirred frustration on both sides in a democratic officials held a gathering with sworn an lawyer and detailed discussions about the mechanics of elections is not a situation where politics enters into j a republican who is the chairman of the county elections sternly told the crowded hearing room to widespread laughter and skepticism but to the delight of the critics who filled the the elections board unanimously spurned a challenge that the north republican general had filed according to preliminary cooper won the county by nearly or about percentage points county will not certify its count until at least are a lot of protests out there going to specific issues that are more votes here and stark said by the time you move a lot of votes if not resolved at the it will end up at the state and the state board will have to sort it all as other county elections boards rejected challenges from allies on the critics complained of baseless protests that they believed were intended to discredit north political climate small in poorly researched and often a lawyer for the southern coalition for social said of the republican challenges ms who was monitoring proceedings in nearby wake which includes the state said some challenges brought by supporters had been easily rebuffed through a few minutes of research a spokesman for the said that the campaign expected people who brought the unsuccessful challenges to appeal to the state board of which comprises three republicans and two democrats county elections boards are made up of two republicans and one democrat the wrangling plays out in a state that has often been the epicenter of the national debate about voter identification requirements and changes to elections rules when north democrats controlled the state government in recent they sought to cement their franchise by enacting a string of laws that made it easier to register and aiming in part to recruit more black voters combined with enforcement of the federal voting rights the effect was by turnout among who are overwhelmingly soared to up from about percent in but when republicans gained absolute control over the executive and legislative branches after the they set about undoing the framework democrats had built after the united states supreme court struck down a crucial part of the voting rights state legislators pared early imposed a photo id requirement and ended registration a federal appeals court ruled against much of that law in concluding it had targeted black voters with surgical that decision faces an uncertain future before a supreme court poised to have a justice nominated by trump but the immediate question in north is how long will dispute the results and whether he might ultimately ask the general assembly to consider the election under state the legislature could order a new election it can determine which candidate received the highest number of it may declare a winner the law asserts that the decision in such a contest is by the courts said talk about legislative involvement to be but not going to discuss possible future steps that the campaign may or may not he are extremely concerned about the voter fraud revelations that are emerging across the state and intend to ensure that every vote is counted and counted a lawyer for e who also played down the possibility that the general assembly might decide the said republican challenges were at nothing other than needless is he gov or his legal team are going to be able to do to undo what is just basic

the long i have a lifelong republican who voted for am very disappointed about the but i be despondent i am by nature an optimistic person as the evening wore on and it became clear that trump was going to i started thinking about what is actually going to happen after this in the there will be dark and things will happen that are not good for our or for the world sure that the affordable care act for i believe that the republicans will start to realize that they really get what they wanted after a republican he has made that clear he just agrees with them on some or claims to i think the first half of term will go very badly for the voters will become and the midterm elections in will be disastrous for them democrats will probably end up with control of both houses of congress get a new supreme court but not worried about whether be too conservative i would be more worried that they be qualified in the long i have believe in checks and voted for voted shortly after polls open on and i voted for trump no disrespect intended to the third party but a vote for an alternate candidate is in reality a vote either trump or so i was faced with a vote for an incompetent or a crook i chose to vote for the incompetent in the end it the emails that sealed the deal it was the remaining hope that and would modify the impending chaos the system of checks and balances appears to be in position to better counter trump than trump has already lost substantial support among the so he count on either the existing supreme court or congress to ignore there is the press what we see is a press overwhelmingly a vote for means we can not count on the press to honestly and diligently keep the public informed of potential malfeasance nor at this point can we count on the institutions of government to counter in any meaningful way so i voted for the candidate likely to lead us into the weeds without establishment underestimated the voted for i think all astounded instead of predictable fifth facing nobody quite knows what i never thought this was a serious possibility until but the establishment apparently made a misjudgment in underestimating the rage after decades of being impoverished to benefit the since the primary was rigged against the only major this was the next prominent way to give the democrats a heave else refreshing to see their awfulness finally backfire on not exactly shocked at but dismayed that so many of my fellow citizens still refused to look outside the duopoly or help the greens reach federal funding levels the impetus is understandable this is a rejection of the status quo more than an actual endorsement of racism or but the forces unleashing are volatile and damn scary as the bigger struggle starts after voting positive change only comes from public so arguably a better chance for it now than under a democratic president if no actual policy coming from the oval space for saner voices to shape it be but at least the citizenry seems ready to seriously push back the campaign got younger voters surprisingly engaged and proved that candidates have to be owned by corporate money if enough remember the power lies with we may have a fighting chance after am ashamed of how this plays with the rest of the voted for lost this election because sexism enabled voters to perceive the most qualified candidate in the world as someone more reprehensible bar the most despicable person who has ever sought the presidency because the contingent of mostly white overlooked empathy for minority groups due to their own positions of privilege because of voter because we watched happen and refused to heed its am ashamed of how this plays with the rest of the world ashamed of my state in particular and dread what consequences it will bring the fallout of supreme court turnover alone will last long after his term is done it should go without saying that a president should not threaten the wellbeing of certain citizens as a main selling point in his and my heart goes out to any individual who feels unsafe i know the cold fear you are experiencing the only way we can think to proceed is to brace for a prolonged fight ahead of man slated to be president has built his platform on harming the vulnerable and shouting over the voices of the oppressed if you find this rhetoric if you are then seize any opportunity to defy it do not wait to speak out until they come for you to your loss is the loss i am sorry they were too blind to see waking up to today scares voted for my wildest dreams i never would have thought the public would swing so wildly away from reason as to elect someone like trump i grew up in a family a liberal but my father was conservative been a single mom working multiple jobs to keep a roof over my head and struggled to make ends meet as long as i can remember i understand the feeling that represent the but the waking up to today scares me and left with only kind of world will my grandson grow up what will happen to friends and people of color who unlike born here someone once called it my how could it be a good idea to elect a man who treats women so makes promises he has no interest in learning the nuances of and brags about not paying why does the public react so negatively to a woman taking a role of where is the critical decency and respect have gone out the door in this election and just sold our collective soul to the country split in two
frank is absolutely right to say that liberal complacency has cost the democrats this election trump is moving to the white and liberals put him whoever said route to the summit lies through the really misread the state of world politics right now was a lack of any serious political conviction one way or another cost ed the election and explains the lib decimation it also goes a long way to explaining why be beaten for the leadership the electorate craves politicians who actually stand for something and have this on the but the establishment complacency has meant utterly failed to read the public for which we all now have to pay the letters on election victory us election result is a sharp lesson from losers and two nations divided by a common must his pledge to close bay rule of law and a reboot for democracy media and politicians are out of man make grate elections
are a lot more on my way home today i walked passed a patrol of armed and i was suddenly surprised by how normal that has become to me definitely become part of the scenery in and are part of a new at vocabulary along with national security alert levels in public places have been heightened and i think people and perhaps still a lot more wary about two months after the attacks a car and people threw themselves to the ground i had a hard time going out to concerts and big events for a and even i have to scout out the fire escape when i get there my friend was killed at the last year and i still get used to that he was a kind accepting of everyone and brimming with potential not a day where i think about that and feel sad and bereft attacks are being used to often spend nights near the republic square the and i was shocked to see how empty it months after the attacks i also surprise myself i go as i prevent myself to stop at the square for a moment and to feel did change my relationships with especially with some friends as i come from a town in the suburbs which has a lot of immigrants making up the with of origins debates about what happened and what is still happening are part of our daily life and some friends have the same opinions as me some people i thought i knew started to call for or to call refugees animals because they thought they were having really racist thoughts and talking to some very good friends of mine because what they said really hurt me my father being i got personally offended by been said by some people i think the attacks are being exploited by politicians to win the upcoming presidential elections they just scare people and hope to win like and now no difference between the parties as they just all target nationalism is is in an utter mess and has been for a long time the front national have made gains the country so in on the magnanimous fear since the and the left is too to do anything about it the fact that veteran leftist is putting himself forward once again for the next elections speaks volumes about the lack of progress made by socialism in the past few years here people are exasperate by the their handling of the travail protests was country is currently having an identity crisis politicians have been saying that is the home of secularism in the same breath as saying that is a catholic what they really seem to be getting at is want levels of nationalism being stoked by even the politicians is scary obsession with referencing the as the is as nauseating as it is historically inaccurate i really tell if resilience or simply hard to say been a real change the country has rocked and but its foundations are solid it feels more like what a or the crash of strong reactions at slowly dwindling out one year you deny something did but the scar is if not the is poised to the various cafs already people have resumed their normal lives looks the same it was before those appalling events it has may be seeing more cops and soldiers patrolling in the but not that striking if a change has taken it is happening at a deeper level and while true the emergency state has been there been any report of real though some may have flared up every so really tell if resilience or simply numbness and resignation as a matter of if the purpose of the attacks was to spread then it panned out people are both willing to resist and if something must it will and hardly anything you can do to prevent so the best course is to carry on as before and be oblivious of the danger which is the right path to tread has changed dramatically since the has changed dramatically since the attacks during there was this fear of mass gatherings and the possibility of an attack politically has changed politicians had been making a discourse out of what it means to be for years but since the every party and every politician has something to good and for bad the whole political debate gravitates around what defines the fundamentals of society and on what kind of social contract we all rely my biggest hope for is too stay united and not to get lost in adversity i wish that we can continue to live with different especially in a city as mixed as most relevant think is the rise of the every day i hear conversations about whereas it was not the case before when i talk about politics with my the first issue they mention is immigration the migrant crisis which is facing has bolstered this atmosphere the most relevant thing is the rise of the national front takes advantage of it in the little town where i live near of the inhabitants voted for them at the last regional election it is a democratic town i was at the counting after the election with my father and the mayor told us believe of the population i administer vote for them taken we also were and it is far worse in other regions in the wake of the a released a song in which he says have no choice we have to live together or to die it is exactly what i feel if our country is divided then they have won the terrorists want the national front to win the election next they want to divide the nation quite the i would like to see a united country which has no scapegoats angers is doing very not feeling very optimistic the coming presidential elections will make the latest one seem like
following the election of trump as the next of the thousands of have been exploring their options to move away from the the past the website of immigration new received visits from the us a rise on its daily average of within the same more than registered interest in moving to new which is more than double the monthly thinking of making plans to leave the get in touch with us where do you plan to migrate what are your reasons for doing perhaps you have family living in another country and wish to move closer to them also like to hear from those who are set to move to the us but are considering their your thoughts with us by filling in the form below feature a selection of responses in our live elections
i get it call to shorten our presidential cycle will resonate with just about everyone this year who counting down the days until this is even has been winding the months in crow points out in a petition on as of had more than this extended political circus is a singularly phenomenon election will have lasted nearly days by the time polls close on by had its longest campaign season in recent history last and it lasted just she writes across the globe have limited campaign seasons to as short as weeks with an organized a professional campaign could be suggestion for how we reform our electoral process that we ask the and to reform the process is less compelling in a segment on morning on she threw out five days as the optimal amount of time she and previously floated the notion that all states and the district of should hold their primaries on the same a move that would prove hugely advantageous to the richest candidates by grassroots opening clip for morning segment certainly felt ironic in former prime minister is seen ribbing president about the stupidly long length of elections always look on at the elections in awe of the scale of the process and the length of the says to in a news conference from of adding he marvels that anyone is left standing at the end of it joked back that term limits meant he too would get to sit back and in at the of might have wanted something different two months later be pushed from office over a voter referendum the result of which almost nobody saw moved on to how toxic media discourse has become petition is simply an appeal from a a single working mom who dives for the remote control before my kids can turn the on and see something going to have to the sentiment is but perhaps the problem is less the length of the cycle than the fact our republican nominee for president actively brags about women by the a fact worth come out until more than days into the crow deems the of the election choosing to announce the beginning of his campaign is not something the or can actually control nor is the fact that campaign reporters often start sourcing up to cover the next campaign the moment the current one ends party committees do set the timetable for but even there they are in a constant with state which battle to move up in the primary calendar so their voters get more for entreaties to focus more on we may not have gotten as far into the weeds on the tax code or what we need to do to save the but we have furthered the national conversation around xenophobia sexual and those are things that should not be written off as empty identity politics since audio leaked of trump bragging about it on a dozen different women have spoken about his alleged sexual not something i want kids watching either not something loved covering been emotionally and physically exhausting but more important that voters know who our next president actually is rather than collectively covering their all due i think crow understands the value of what journalists have done this cycle muting the television protect our kids from our reality and reducing the amount of time we have to learn about the people running for the most powerful job in the particularly when so much of what comes out of their mouths is make it harder to fool the it will make it infinitely elections
all eyes are on the race to be the next us but the battle to control congress may be almost as next congress could determine whether the supreme court goes back to having nine whether the makes good on its climate promises and for is should she be elected the senate and the house stay republican and trump wins the he would not necessarily have carte as much as trump may want to build a border wall with he would not be able to spend the estimated it would cost until congress legislated for it assuming does not pay for the wall as trump has sometimes promised it would likewise need help to deport undocumented slap new tariffs on goods or fine us companies for moving manufacturing overseas unclear whether the would back him on these issues but a quick agreement on issues such as repealing the estate tax and law might well be in the is extremely unlikely that the democrats will seize control of the house of representatives on owing to an republican majority in the lower gerrymandering at the state level means there many house races this cycle only out of according to the cook political report democrats could win every single one of the toss ups and still fall around eight seats short of a house majority but the senate is a different with most analysts putting the chances of overcoming the current majority and taking the upper chamber at about even basically harry a polling analyst with told on have in my opinion maybe six or seven seats that are going to really determine democrats controlled the and were the supreme court vacancy could soon be filled although republicans have already hinted at a procedural fight to stop that from happening as with every aspect of the election presence is palpable some republican incumbents appear to have been wounded by associations with the nominee senator in new saw her numbers drop after she was asked at a debate whether trump would be a good role model for and replied representative heck loses his senate analysts will point to the record number of voters who lined up in the state to cast early ballots for against senator burr in north may fall victim to the abandonment of trump by moderate republicans in his other there is no perceivable trump drag and there may be trump coattails in where trump and appear to be republican incumbent rob is polling points ahead of his a former governor and in where trump appears to be crushing republican incumbent blunt is in a seemingly tight race with the democratic state secretary of state in incumbent pat appears to be running behind his but not as far behind as trump is running in the just very difficult to understand exactly going to to congressional big outside money is trying to block progressive star zephyr from making it to a law has strong support from senator but her opponent says a first congressional republican a county dropped out of a congressional race in after an who was also an undocumented outed him as gay and said the sheriff threatened him with deportation if he said anything democrat tom a state appears to have the congressional one of the sweetest of all potential pickups for because it would send incumbent the loathed former chairman of the oversight committee packing he faces retired marine colonel will tar heel voters make incumbent governor pat pay for signing the notorious house bill which allowed discrimination against people in access to public state attorney general cooper looks senate the moment when state attorney general touted as a future national star for could step onto the main stage of politics representative like a is putting up a elections
j trump embarked on one of the rituals of the presidency on meeting in new with the prime minister of as he continued his fitful adjustment to the protocols of diplomacy am convinced trump is a leader in whom i can have great said after the meeting at trump tower he described the encounter as the visit with came after congratulatory phone calls from foreign leaders in the nine days since trump won the election none seem to have adhered to established diplomatic in which the state department choreographs the sequence of the calls and provides policy guidance and translating services on the state department said it was finally in contact with emissaries but until they had not requested any nor had the calls including with president v of and other adversaries of the united states been routed through the state as is according to a department official aides did not respond to questions about whether the had used his own interpreter in the meeting with and calls with other or whether he had relied on interpreters provided by them order that the calls are done in seems like a silly protocol issue but one that people really think said a senior fellow at the center for a new security and a former top aide to the national security e rice are taking messages away from whether you think important or visit first with a foreign leader since the election came on a day when the was steeped in foreign policy he met with former secretary of state henry a to discuss and issues around the ranging from and china to and the according to the transition team he met with ambassador to the united who told reporters afterward that has no doubt that trump is a true friend of said he looked forward to working with of the members of the trump including k chief who has been accused of promoting through his news media news he met s the director of the national security agency and the top officer at the which gave him his first exposure to the surveillance abilities and he met with gen jack a former army vice chief of staff who has been a longtime informal adviser to and a mentor to gen h as well as a prime architect of the troop surge in the w bush administration was for a couple of general said in a telephone interview by how personable he and by his intellectual curiosity about national security events most presidential candidates have an knowledge of national security issues but he asked excellent general declined to discuss the advice he had given trump but he said the new greatest challenge would be to maintain leadership in a world in which radical militancy was threatening to metastasize into a and hostile powers like china and were seeking regional dominance during the trump called into question the network of security alliances that the united states had maintained since world war saying the partners in and were not paying their fair share for the umbrella of protection few allies were as rattled by campaign statements as japan at one he suggested that japan and south consider acquiring nuclear weapons to protect themselves in the days leading to officials from the foreign and trade ministries were urging to take a tough line with trump on the value of the partnership a huge trade deal that trump opposes and the defense which trump has said japan must contribute more money according to j a former official in the bush administration with close ties to japan but appeared to reject that preferring to focus on cultivating a personal relationship with trump some japan experts speculated that was concerned about getting off on the right foot with trump because when the leader traveled to new in for the united nations general assembly he met with who was then the favorite in the presidential but not trump prime minister has done very

presidential elections are a form of madness that comes over us once every four years they fit the or narrative of seducing us into forgetting how powerful we are they erase our memory of grassroots direct democracy and civil society leaders beget people pin their hopes on one and with that they seem to shed responsibility for anything beyond getting that one person into office they wash their hands of any further involvement if not their one person we forget our own the innumerable times swayed so it is this time around with the election a matter of days away and the media engrossed in a fight to end all it sometimes seems as though lost sight of the powers that belong to us and not and the responsibilities and possibilities that go with our power the intensely personal nature of this campaign and the particular danger of trump has created a kind of tunnel is not to say that the outcome is unimportant far from it many supporters seem quietly confident of a win i am less complacent had enough surprises this year in in to know that voters have a way of confounding those who observe them a trump presidency would be a terrible thing but a victory would be far from an occasion to sigh with sit back and resume life as though the last few months had been a bad dream a in would be just a starting point for a new kind of campaign a politician is not a given each one is in part what we make by organizing every election season we pretend that one person will have all the power and that whatever they promise up front is exactly who for better or worse we forget our own the innumerable times swayed such as the decision to veto the keystone pipeline we forget the way culture and activism set the norms for political decisions on matters such as marriage seasons erase the memory of movements that worked for years or outside and below and above electoral politics they drown out the histories that how women got the how the civil rights movement how the free trade area of the trade deal withered and how the world trade organization was hobbled and its poorer member nations inspired to revolt by the great shutdown in how got banned in new how rape law has been radically revised in many ways and places thanks to feminist action and discourse in all these the people who we mislabel leaders only followed the will of the it matters who is but what a president does has everything to do with what the people demand or refuse or do and what the house and senate send them or sabotage mitt promised to build the keystone pipeline himself if republicans for the foreseeable future will be puppets of the industry democrats are not necessarily our friends or but they are sometimes politicians who can be pushed wavered on that pipeline for several years when he vetoed it was not because of who he but because of who we we the members of a climate movement that blockaded and demonstrated for building a powerful movement that the president has become so much more engaged with climate is a result what the movement it educated us on the made the case for the urgency and importance of built global shed light on the ways climate is an economic and racial justice started innumerable campaigns to block implement efficiency and good and shift to renewable resources a lot of other changes that matter have happened at the local level as regions and states have done great work on led by community small groups and minor politicians never hear about the administration could have done much more if more of the people who elected him stuck around to push back against the conservatives and interests which is not to even raise the question of that more useful to ask what are our if most of us do little or nothing about policies we deplore or ideals we praise the same will be true of a if the one voters choose on the extent to which it serves the interests of people and our planet depends in part on the extent to which citizens apply pressure to it you may feel exhausted right tired of a bruising cycle which has left no personal stone unturned to the detriment of policy but the truth at the beginning either of a period of sustained resistance against a deranged or a period of sustained action to push the first female president to deliver a genuinely agenda if we end up with a democrat i regret that the best choice we get in this binary a lot is up to us a gift and a responsibility take it i hope join me elections

dozens of major regulations passed recently by the administration including changes on health consumer protections and environmental safety could be undone with the stroke of a pen by j trump and the congress starting in thanks to a law that dates back to and it comes with a if the law is used to strike down a the federal agency that issued it is barred from enacting similar regulation again in the future the obscure law called the congressional review act was passed years ago at the behest of newt then the house speaker and now a member of transition team it gives congress legislative days to review and override major regulations enacted by federal agencies in the the vote would not be subject to filibuster the president can veto the which usually renders the law toothless but when one party controls both the white house and it can be a powerful legislative weapon so far it has only been successfully used in a republican congress invoked it to eliminate workplace safety regulations adopted in the final months of president tenure president w bush signed the repeal two months after his wiping out stricter ergonomics rules that had been years in the making on when trump takes office with a congress one that has indicated its zeal for undoing president doings more than rules adopted since late may are potentially vulnerable to the according to an analysis by the university regulatory studies center allows the election results to be applied almost to snip off activity that happened at the end of the last said a law professor at the regulations at risk many environmental including limits on formaldehyde use and stricter truck fuel efficiency a food and drug administration ban on the sale of antibacterial a requirement that federal contractors provide paid sick leave for their stricter consumer protections on prepaid debit federal loan forgiveness for students at schools that shut a rule that bars nursing homes that receive federal funding from requiring residents to resolve all disputes through rather than in court under speaker d the house has used the law several times to try to reject a number of the policies those challenges were symbolic president vetoed every one that reached his desk but trump can approve any sent to him after he takes office office did not respond to requests for comment think go after every single but i think get eight to that may be said the director of regulatory policy at the action a group that has been tracking which regulations are subject to congressional review the threat posed by the law may slow the usual rush of that administrations typically race to finish in their final days this it will be a game of chicken put out a rule and hope it or hold to preserve the chance to revisit it in the would imagine there will be a serious discussion about regulations that they were planning to said e the director of the university regulatory studies center bluntness of the may be exactly what makes it appealing to the next congress and the labor department has never tried to revive the rule that president bush struck down this has only been done once no litigation said a professor of public policy who previously worked at the office of information and regulatory the unit that coordinates reviews of executive branch regulations wipes the rule out for quite a at the very he said know what would happen if an agency eventually decided to go back and try because congress takes so many legislative days stretches out for many calendar months the congressional research service estimates that the review deadline for the rules will fall at the end of based on the planned schedule for the rest of this year adjourning early would buy congress some extra days when the new congress the clock resets and lawmakers have additional time to review eligible rules some republican lawmakers are eager to slash where they can on the interior department issued a new regulation designed to control emissions of methane a powerful greenhouse gas from oil and natural gas wells on federal and tribal lands it is a relatively small part of a larger set of regulations that the administration has been rolling out to prevent inadvertent leaks from processing plants and pipelines with a few the oil and gas industry has opposed the regulations as unnecessarily costly senator republican of fired off a scathing statement has many tools with which to rescind this and i look forward to working with the incoming trump administration to ensure economic expansion prevails over misguided bureaucratic he said daisy communications said the congressional review act was one of those to which he referred

the us has gotten to fascism you would have an president that is nationalist and and we would see mass and a wall being which is likely since he will most likely not deport million predicted this would force to turn more towards and could upset free trade agreements and hurt economic is so unpredictable and politically inexperienced we have no idea what he will but he seems sexist and

regional policies were unlikely to see a major but election of trump would at least in the short term cause dramatic impacts on the international system if he puts into practice some of the he is advocating come away unscathed for if he makes the entrance of people more builds a wall between and the has members pay for us encourages japan to have a nuclear gets tougher on and other free trade

our shared history and culture ensures a natural affinity between and our government must seriously consider its approach to trump may has said we will remain and close as home she policies and rhetoric she is right to commit to continuing good relations but must not give way to the more poisonous elements of leadership as she has to the far right of political spectrum if trump wants to pursue protectionist there is little we can do if he wishes to complete trade deals with us after then it is in the interests of both our nations that these be signed discriminatory rhetoric and policies such as a ban on entering the us must be condemned without in the way that khan rose to the must remain but poor decision has demoted their moral standing our two countries now stand shoulder to shoulder after victory and the referendum result the liberals from both nations must cooperate and the venomous prejudices of extremists must be quelled we have both sunk now we must improve in a world that has overnight become much less predictable and much more the primary responsibility of the state remains to ensure the security of its citizens supposed that a could maintain security of every kind of but also a sustainable and the international rule of law the prospect of an and xenophobic makes that now quite implausible we must hope that fine people and robust institutions temper but we may expect a decade or more of us isolation and dysfunction has always been a risky but last night the risks went off the graph in a uncertain world we must value and develop the partnerships and friendships we already have in our victory demands that we rethink i think the us like the confirms what we all substantial parts of our societies have been all but abandoned by our politicians the are more concerned with balancing the books and cutting budgets than dealing with the real world where billionaire business owners can treat their workers as badly as they like with complete impunity and the only politician calling for real is treated like a even by a large part of his own while the media simply ignore him my worry is what happens in a few time when people see they are no better off as the us and economies nosedive and things turn even is can you remind letters on election victory us election result is a sharp lesson from losers must his pledge to close bay crave politicians who actually stand for something the rule of law and a reboot for democracy media and politicians are out of man make grate elections

in a justice department prosecutor from stopped by to see the united states attorney in at the time the j said he had heard a shocking a federal judge had called a prominent white lawyer disgrace to his for representing black clients sessions according to he in testimony before congress in and others painted an unflattering portrait of who would go on to become a senator from and according to numerous sources close to j transition is a potential nominee for attorney general or secretary of defense testified that sessions had referred to the civil liberties union and the as for to force civil rights down the throats of one prosecutor testified that sessions had called him and joked that he thought that the until i found out they smoked sessions denied calling the lawyer but acknowledged or did not dispute the substance of the other remarks the bitter testimony sank his nomination by president to be a federal district court judge and foreshadowed the questions that sessions could face at another set of senate confirmation hearings if trump nominates him for a cabinet position after nearly years in the now has more allies and would face a clearer road to confirmation than he did as a young judicial nominee and as the first senator to endorse presidential he has a special status as an early supporter who became an important surrogate and close adviser but for trump a sessions nomination to a critical position at the justice or defense department still presents risks trump faced criticism over his derogatory remarks about and his support from racist groups throughout his and for his appointment of a nationalist media executive to a top white house position since his election a sessions nomination raises the possibility that a trump administration will open with racially charged hearings a spokesman for sessions did not respond to a request for comment but on senator a south republican who opposed enthusiastically endorsed sessions for a major job in the trump administration think sessions has earned the right to serve trump in the highest he told reporters as attorney sessions would be responsible for upholding civil rights laws as secretary of he would oversee one of the most ethnically diverse institutions in the percent of the military is or as one of the most conservative members of the sessions has been a reliable voice for strict immigration reduced spending and measures he is generally well liked among colleagues in both and took a political risk endorsing trump shortly after the south primary his views on immigration and trade are aligned with the message that trump conveyed during the race sessions has frequently traveled with trump and was said at one point to be under consideration as the nominee sessions has long considered it a personal triumph that he was elected to the senate and became a member of the judiciary committee after that same panel rejected his nomination to the bench two republicans joined democrats in opposing his nomination one of those senator specter of later said his vote had been a mistake a fact that sessions likes to point out but hearings were unusually both for the era and for the position he was seeking the sessions stretched for hours as justice department officials were called to testify about their views on race sessions said his comment about the was meant as a joke and said it was so preposterous especially since he was in the middle of prosecuting a case involving the group that he thought nobody could take it seriously he was less clear about his remarks about civil rights groups asked whether he ever said the hates white people or was commie group and a pinko sessions said he could not recall specifically saying that am loose with my tongue on and i may have said something similar to that or could be interpreted to he testified he went on to praise the for its work for racial equality in the south he said he never called the group or the but said that they take positions that are considered they hurt they lose credibility and many people do think that some of those positions they take are against the national interests of the united he said he was referring to liberal immigration policies and support for the socialist government in at the justice department lawyers regard officials as partners in the fight for equal rights alone do not guarantee eradicate hate or advance the top civil rights told the group in do people like you do organizations like the the also played a key role in fighting to integrate the military the percentage of in the military now percent has grown steadily since president harry s signed an order in that ended segregation in the armed forces sessions also did not dispute recollection of their conversation about the white lawyer he said he remembered the but not precisely what he said guess i will not disagree with sessions i do not know why i cannot imagine why i would make that an h testified that sessions referred to him as after an argument with a sessions admonished me to careful what you say to white figures testified sessions denied saying that and was adamant that he had never called figures sessions had his including an d have watched this young man since he started practicing law in judge wrote is fair and compassionate for all his fellow in a phone interview on said it was a that sessions might lead the justice department as for the he racial insensitivity might not be as manifest in such a but i feel good about it if i were a black

campaign promises are easy governing is hard it is a truism that j trump and his team will soon learn and a fascinating example has emerged since the courtesy of global currency markets it is a study in the kind of complex that trump rarely grappled with during his campaign but will face many times a day in the oval office a centerpiece of campaign was the united trade deficits he pledged to eliminate them and create a resurgence in manufacturing he has also pledged tax infrastructure spending and deregulation that set of policies has led markets to expect speedier economic growth and thus higher interest rates in coming years in is driving the value of the dollar higher since election the dollar is up percent against an index of six other major currencies the value of the peso has fallen percent against the a remarkable swing for the united trading partner you need to be an economist to see what that a pricier dollar makes it harder for manufacturers to compete it gives an advantage to companies that locate operations and it all else being tend to make the trade deficit higher rather than lower this is not to suggest that the shift in the currency so far is a major disaster for manufacturers and other exporters those that ship their goods to will feel the brunt of there was a bigger rise in the dollar in and that damaged export sectors even more but imagine that trump follows through on the policy mix hinted at so a combination of loose fiscal policy more spending on defense and and tax and tighter monetary policy federal reserve raising interest rates faster than had seemed likely before the at that the dollar could move decisively creating a tension that the president and his advisers would have to resolve one way or the other as a rule of said a senior fellow at the institute for international a percent rise in the dollar would be expected to increase the current account deficit broader concept than trade but closely by to percent of in the ensuing two to three years in that pledge to eliminate the billion united states trade deficit would have just become billion to billion harder this is the kind of dilemma presidents face all the time the oval office debate might go something like the commerce secretary this strong dollar is just killing our they compete with this kind of the treasury who is in charge of the a necessary our economy is booming so much that global investors just get enough of united states when there are these kinds of the president has to decide and when a president tries to find a solution that answers both there are always complex ripples for appoint fed officials who will cut interest might temporarily let you have both a booming domestic economy and a competitive export but would mean an increase in inflation which will make both the bond market and many retired living on fixed incomes unhappy the tension between currency policy and trade policy is just one example promises to repeal while keeping some of its most popular features would be hard to carry out in practice virtually every issue in tax diplomacy and regulatory policy features similar complex none of this is to say that these tensions are or that trump overcome his lack of a policy background to arrive at good solutions but he will almost certainly find out that great is a not an answer
ever since us presidential candidates railed against free and parties made sweeping gains in the question has been are we witnessing the demise of a trend that has dominated economics and trade for decades appears to be coming to an end as a percentage of global world which have been on a slow steady decline in the past two have peaked fines on multinationals have reached record levels breakneck is probably over a nation famous for building its empire on will exit the biggest area by the end of this decade an opponent of deals all his public is about to become president of the united states these signs point to the slow death of the form of that the rich world has refined and patrolled since the end of the second world war for the period from to marks the mark of such policies a period that came to an end with global financial crisis there is a worry that these years resemble the previously most integrated period of world the gilded age between and this ended with the first world history does not necessarily repeat itself it is important to note that global prosperity is bigger than any one nation some of the reason for the flattening off in the trend is poorer economies are growing faster than richer and they import less as developing share of global the effect will be to shrink the ratio of trade to global income others could take place as a driver of worldwide is probably the only country that has the potential to mount a transformation of similar scale and global consequence also a number of nations could the pattern of global growth the international monetary fund suggests that annual growth in a dozen countries with a combined of would add more to the global economy than the growing at full these feel like the wrong questions and answers we need to settle whether in its current incarnation aids or relieves poverty in an equitable way given the worldwide revolts on the right and left of the answer would seem to be that it fairer arrangements will help poor nations get richer trade is not a all should benefit from engaging in it but the world that exists has not been designed this way the thinking that has dominated recent decades comes from classical theory which holds that although imports do cost exports will generate new ones and competition keeps prices over everyone gains recent academic research tells a different story when economists at the institute of technology looked at the impact of the trade relationship between the united states and china they found a heavy cost to workers when jobs the paper the workers would bounce but many workers did not losses in manufacturing are magnified by being geographically concentrated and entire communities were punished little wonder perhaps that protectionist message has been central to the populist campaign that has made him the trick is not to retreat behind walls that would see a return to policies and the threat of war policymakers must go back to watching the numbers that matter to the trade deficit international prices must be fairly set so exports are not artificially expensive and imports are not artificially cheap imports from nations where rights are trampled need addressing these are concerns that sensible thinkers on the left have raised for years most notably the who has long worried about the corporate capture of trade deals his warning that president partnership operated under rules that would harm the economy and us workers was a call that went unheeded by democrats until it was too late work must be done to resolve the tensions between the nation state and global economic integration trade deals need to show nations are open for business by putting not corporate at their heart we may be at a turning point in the nature of capitalism that may not be such a bad elections
bill disparagingly referred to as being selected for leader because he was maddest person in the according to a leaked transcript of a campaign speech he made last former us president spoke mockingly of responding to its general election defeat by moving further to the left and having got a guy off the street to be the in the shape of was speaking at a presidential for his in in last according to the transcript of his leaked by as part of the release of a wider cache of emails from campaign john was the period when was battling sanders for the democratic presidential a subject that led bill to discuss the changes in the party at the told his audience that response to economic questions was go get the money from the according to the leaked a view to a lot of people around the argued party disposed of its most because they were mad at him for being part of tony government in the they moved to the left and put his brother in as leader because the movement wanted it when thumped him in the they reached the interesting conclusion that they lost because they moved far left and so they went out and practically got a guy off the street to be the leader of the what that is reflective of the same thing happened in the election when people feel been shafted and they expect anything to happen they just want the maddest person in the room to represent he does not make it it seems is likely to be using in the us context of such a political reaction was psychologically understandable and argued in the delivered at the home of a local real estate developer and his people in had a raise in he said per cent of the adjusted for have an income today lower than it was the day before the crash the median income of adjusted for is lower than it was the day i left rest of the speech made no mention of instead covering a range of areas including the us gun control and the rise of and talking up qualifications to be spokesman for said he had no response to remarks
family law was written to discourage and in that sense it has succeeded the last in showed that the number of who described themselves as separated was nearly three times the number who were divorced the legal code offers a notably narrow selection of among them incurable leprosy and renunciation of the world by entering religious orders many applicants plead but defining mental cruelty is a murky often coming down to a discretion uniform standard can ever be laid down for declared a supreme court panel in that is cruelty in one case may not amount to cruelty in another here are some examples of the idiosyncratic ways judges used their discretion to support claims of cruelty approve forcing a husband to move out of his home a it is a pious obligation of the son to maintain the parents if a wife makes an attempt to deviate from the normal practice and normal custom of the she must have some justifiable reason for the court found our no husband would tolerate and no son would like to be separated from his old deriding a husband as a calling of names and hurling of abuses such as and by the appellant in respect of her husband even if he was overweight is bound to strike at his and the court found the respondent was sensitive to such and it is not the case that the taunts were made or out of love and and without excessive interest in politics case depicts the sordid episode of the life of a woman who spoiled her homely environment and family relationships running after the politics and forgetting her solemn duties and responsibilities of a matrimonial the court found was cautioned and reminded of her pious obligations but she was mesmerized so much by the political thoughts and quite adamant that she failed to understand the consequence of her negligent withholding of sex without a good excuse assuming for a moment that the appellant wanted to have a child only after two does not mean that the appellant and the respondent cannot and should not have sexual the court found both of them are well educated and there are so many contraceptives available and they could have used such contraceptives and avoided

for the last four new democrats have had to contend with an in a state senate with slightly more democrats than there are how do the republicans manage to hold a the answer often lies with one rogue senator who votes with the republicans and whose heavily overwhelmingly orthodox district in voted just as overwhelmingly for j trump to the endless has never once caucused with members of his own defecting to the other side of the aisle within days of being elected in this the long electoral migraine did not lift with absentee ballots in two close races on long island still being counted to settle the final senate the democrats would need to win at least one of lure back the independent democratic conference which has teamed up with the republicans to govern the senate for several years and reclaim in order to form a working majority but declined to come revealing on night that he would remain a republican in senate allegiance if not in telling the political television program that he would to have a compelling reason to the republican caucus the mainstream he had fallen short who ran on the republican as well as the conservative and democratic ballot lines for the first time this said the republicans had not promised him anything as the voter rolls have the district which is dominated by and other orthodox residents in the borough and neighborhoods is heavily the better to register influence in city democratic which often determine the outcome of general elections but party affiliation often bows to parochial concerns many of whom send their children to want the state to provide tuition assistance for religious among other and senate republicans have been far more receptive to taking measures that would benefit religious education than the democrats the district went for a by large margins it was also an easy pickup for mitt four years ago allegiance is to their foundational religious practices and not necessarily party said a political consultant who has worked on several races involving orthodox communities democratic leaders have considered trying to oust in a primary battle but his popularity in the district makes him all but immune to challenges said they primary they could say goodbye to any possible rapprochement in the democrats responded on to decision with overt appeals to party unity a given how important going to be to hold the line at the state level against what we expect to be very draconian efforts out of that likely to have a majority of the senate be elected democratic and still not be able to said senator n of who serves as the chief political strategist a spokesman for the said of look forward to continuing to work with him to move this state without the mainstream democrats would need to win the contested long island races and strike a deal with senator d the leader of the independent democrats emerging from election day without much clarity on which party would end up with a numerical both as so often have hastened to pay court to and before ending the suspense about his met with senator the county democrat who leads the mainstream as well as john j the republican senate majority saying as recently as last week that he would join whichever side offered him the he also got a call from gov m a in his efforts to position new as a liberal foil to may have a greater interest than usual in installing a true democratic majority
if you think back to this presidential campaign and recall a lot of articles mentioning email troubles and j various you be wrong if it seems there were fewer articles about the economy and because there were the temptation to blame news organizations for this imbalance is but there is at least some reason to resist it critics have long assailed campaign coverage as focused too much on candidate campaign strategy and assessments of instead of on policies and ideas but this the candidates share the blame i compared the content of campaign ads with the content of news articles about two specific candidate traits or and the economy or jobs both the candidates and news organizations spent more time discussing the fitness for office lack of than they did the economy and the imbalance grew more lopsided as the election approached using analytic tools provided by crimson i categorized the campaign news coverage of media outlets this consisted of four broadcast three cable news national public radio and on the two news and newspapers i specifically searched for news about campaign and her email server or her campaign and and several controversies connected to campaign things like trump the khan family and the i also looked for news about the campaign appeals on the economy and jobs this list but it gives a sense of the between coverage of these controversies and the economy the controversies received more on than their views on the economy from until election percent of the stories mentioned various and percent mentioned email only percent mentioned trump and jobs or the and only percent cited campaign and the economy closer to the from the numbers got even more lopsided this was an important date just after the release of the video and a few weeks before director b letter to congress from this percent of the campaign articles mentioning either controversies or the economy discuss while only percent mention her alongside jobs or the economy as for percent mention his while percent mention him related to jobs and the economy the imbalance in coverage of the character is as is the lack of coverage about the economy compared with the controversies moving one week past the video between and election roughly half of the stories about scandals and the economy mentioned and only a quarter discussed trump and his imbroglios a mere percent of the stories in these last three weeks mentioned and the economy percent mentioned trump and the these choices have consequences according to the reports of what they heard or read about between and were mainly references to her handling of emails during her time as secretary of state in mentions of trump changed week by tracking what was happening on the campaign trail but before anyone blames the news important to examine what the candidates themselves were talking about over the course of the campaign if media reports reflect candidate discourse then it is not merely the media choosing to report on scandals it might be at least as much the choosing to campaign on them that results in unending coverage of traits and characteristics to figure out if this was the i used data from on all the campaign ads aired between and election day i coded all of the appeals in each ad and weighted the appeals by how many times the ads ran on television made more ads than and she vastly running nearly three times as many ads as he did all over half a million ads were run in during this period the content of the ads is revealing both candidates spent most of their television advertising time attacking the other character in the losing ads did little else more than of the appeals in advertisements nearly half of were about characteristics or dispositions only percent of appeals in her ads were about jobs or the economy by percent of appeals focused on the taxes and trade since the start of presidential campaign television advertising in no campaign has made percent of its television ad appeals about any single topic on traits typically garner about percent of the appeals the economy typically generates about percent of the appeals usually much more balance of this was an unusual election with two very unpopular so the flaws may have simply been too big a story for either them or the media to pass up whatever the the criterion of fitness for office dominated the messaging and made up a good share of the trump messaging as and the news media covered it
face this year our options in the voting booth are historically terrible poll after poll after poll has told the same the majority of some six in by most view both trump and negatively movie was a real waste of more my daughter goes out with him she may not come home way to say that most people either despise or fear both major party which befuddles both presidential contenders and their insular entourages but not the rest of us why this year millions of voters are exploring casting their ballot for and even party candidates but is a year marked by terrible electoral options all around could a third party with actual power be trump next political read desire for another option was evidenced in the early of libertarian candidate who was hovering in the to range in national polls before the political conventions this summer that was before people even knew who he so many voters were elated to find out there was someone on their ballots who trump or put down his marijuana pipe and started to introduce himself to voters he promptly became the butt of every jokes for blanking on the devastated city then he failed to name a single world leader when lobbed a softball question in a town hall now when you type in his name on snaps at pops up no wonder his poll numbers have steadily declined since hit the green party candidate stein an alternative to the alternative will have trouble sleeping at night if trump is stein said earlier this cycle at a town hall will also have trouble sleeping at night if is elected and as despicable as words i find actions and track record is very a cursory look at platform reveals living in an alternative universe from most voters while most voters fear the growth of calling for cutting military spending by along with closing more than us military bases abroad this may be why her bid keeps her hovering at around the mark in national and other voters will see on their ballots the former operative and republican congressional staffer is taking advantage of repugnance to many and is angling to win just one state in order to have his name thrust before the electoral college makes sense for many voters who say their faith prohibits them from supporting either trump or but barring deep religious in other states the notion of casting a protest vote is just too dangerous in this grand party is having a grand food fight for all to see the tea party wing of the party has morphed into a populist movement that trusts conspiracy theories more than facts and data and trump himself has even lashed out at the house and other congressional republicans in recent in a sign of the times for the abandoned trump last month only to cast his vote for him this week that kind of even leadership from the republican party that led to the rise of the misogynistic and racist trump republican leaders have stoked fear in their base since president was elected and now they have lost control of their own narrative and why this the year to mess with a vote since no candidate is going to all those votes might do is prevent a putting the meltdown front and center in global governance do settle for the lesser of two evils in this election vote for the green party stein and read you were a progressive sanders supporter who cares about the soaring be voting against your interests to vote third or fourth party this because that protest vote is just giving trump an opening to transform the nation in his glitzy yet vacuous image a top trump official even reportedly admitted that the campaign is banking on voter suppression efforts to help keep out of the white house let them suppress your vote or ideals on election though the founders avoided setting up a partisan government in the we quickly grew into a system we should have a national after this election about changing that but not until on election crucial to vote your principles within the system we currently elections
there has yet to be a more impudent introduction at an awards ceremony than majestic effort for one former couple at the to present the award are and the host attention sure pissed about something primarily about that to see and stony faces as they made their way on to the present where pick for the us presidential election is being treated vastly more reverentially my theory is that coming out for green party candidate stein is definitely the most coveted celebrity endorsement since vote leave managed to get to come out for remain looking that was the i am amused by a headline in endorsement of stein only helps only helps i obviously the major endorsement would want would be for to come out for trump but in the absence of that big is certainly not to be sniffed in elections

mark has said will do more to tackle fake news while continuing to argue that the spread of hoax stories on the social network did not affect the result of the us a post on his profile late on said hoped to announce new measures to tackle fake stories he all the content on more than of what people see is authentic only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes the hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan or even to politics this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the we want any hoaxes on our goal is to show people the content they will find most and people want accurate news we have already launched work enabling our community to flag hoaxes and fake and there is more we can do here we have made and we will continue to work on this to improve fake news problem is not commentators and even outgoing president have raised concerns about its role in spreading false information during the election stories such as a report just days before the election that an agent investigating use of a private email server had killed himself were deliberately designed to tap into debate around the key tailors the its users see to what they and their friends have previously liked and especially partisan stories aimed at supporters of either candidate in the election could spread rapidly and in some cases earn significant amount of advertising revenue for their end of the election has not stopped the spread of false stories the day after trump was declared the false claims that president was planning to give a began circulating on the was already growing on to address its powerful role in shaping the information people consume after it removed images of a girl hit by napalm during the which it said breached its rules on nudity the decision was later but not before a post of the image by the prime minister was taken post goes further in acknowledging the problem than his comments at a conference near last during which he said suggestions the election was influenced by fake news were it also outlines some of the concerns says are behind its cautious approach to becoming more involved in policing content he is an area where i believe we must proceed very carefully though identifying the is complicated while some hoaxes can be completely a greater amount of including from mainstream often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual i am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most but i believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth elections
over the past president v of has received two starkly different messages about hacking into computer networks from the current and future presidents of the united you and not even sure it was you the white house confirmed in a statement on that eight days before the presidential the united states the government directly regarding malicious that was state it sent the message over a rarely used a connecting the nuclear risk reduction centers in both which they had agreed three years ago could also be employed to deal with major the warning only the latest after verbal cautions by president his defense secretary and the director of national intelligence was reported by the post the warnings to against further hacking into polling or registration or any further effort to affect the outcome of the are being hailed by the administration as a success in deterrence after they a year and a half of hacking activity seemed to or and there is no evidence that voting or counting of ballots was disrupted on election day but more than a few experts in deterring take a more skeptical view they say the had already achieved their main to demonstrate how they could disrupt the electoral process with the leak of hacked including from the democratic national committee and campaign john d suffered nothing worse than a they note no no counter no embarrassing revelations engineered by the united states and he now has the satisfaction of dealing with j who during the campaign praised promised to build a more productive relationship with and maintained there was no evidence that the were behind the hacking anything wrong happens they like blame the trump said in an debate with know if the doing the hacking maybe there is no trump contended that the allegations of activity were intended to for advocating a new relationship with he frequently repeated similar sentiments in the last weeks of the suggesting the hacking was a fabrication the leaks of emails worked largely to his embarrassing democratic leaders like representative of who was forced to resign as the chairwoman of the democratic national committee larger strategic message is that the united states and need to cooperate on a range of issues but for now the situation underscores the uncertainty around the world about the direction of foreign policy and gives the opportunity to exploit differences between the current president and his successor until trump is inaugurated on it is also raising the question of whether the white house pushed back hard enough when intelligence agencies concluded on that officials could have authorized these a a computer expert at the center for strategic and international studies in dismissed the claim that it had deterred hacking seems a little bold to claim this is a success for since the deterred from doing he said hacking work was mostly complete the issue now is whether they will be deterred in the and the guessing is they will not strong private warnings enough to constitute in the appear to have paid less of a price for their hacking around the election than north did for its attack on pictures entertainment in that attack melted down about percent of computers and servers at its wreaking considerable and embarrassed many executives it was in response to the release of a that imagined a plot to kill the north leader after the the united states issued more sanctions against north and encouraged china to limit the all of which runs through switching centers many experts had expected the white house to follow a similar path with the white house concluded that the and the unstated suggestion that the united states had the power to reach inside networks and see the origin of might suffice it is not clear if the administration plans any other actions against before departure from but that seems less and less likely the warning did not deal with the hacking of the democratic national committee or which r clapper the director of national had previously said was conducted with the knowledge of the leadership it referred only to the concerns about hacking around the election process and the fear it was originating from though it stopped short of saying it was a attack
barring some unexpected none of the refugees held in detention camps on the pacific islands of and are likely to be resettled in the united states before j trump takes and officials said this week the election of whose harsh talk about immigration and was central to his leaves in doubt the deal the two countries recently struck to move some of the hundreds of people who were banished to the camps by after being intercepted at sea trying to reach its shores many of the detainees are the issue is a contentious and emotional one in whose government has pledged never to accept a migrant who tries to come to the country by boat the stated purpose of the pacific in which such people are housed indefinitely on offshore is to discourage human who often pack migrants into rickety boats for the some of which have ended in mass drownings but conditions on those islands are dire on a united nations envoy visiting said that daily life for detainees on was inhumane and degrading human rights groups have reached similar conclusions about conditions on both islands the government said that it had reached a agreement in which the united states would take in hundreds of the detainees but just days after the announcement of the an secretary of the immigration told an senate panel that it seemed unlikely that any detainees would be resettled by inauguration day in the united states on in a written response to the united states state department said that the screening process to determine whether refugees were eligible to enter the united states was taking as long as to months to complete safety and security of the people is our top the state department said it said refugees were subject to the highest level of security checks of any category of traveler to the united involving the department of homeland the national center and the trump has not commented on the deal as a presidential he called for a temporary ban on all though his campaign later said that the ban would apply only to migrants from one of his mark executive director of the center for immigration which favors more restrictive immigration was quoted in news reports as saying that the deal was likely to be on once trump took office the united nations said on that conditions for detainees on were grim health issues are with stress anxiety and depression being among the most common said at a news conference in the describing what he found on a recent visit to refugees and asylum seekers are on a constant diet of sleeping tablets and children suffered from nightmares and he said said policy was punitive sends a message to the people he said to me this is not a justification to mandatory detention is a violation of human rights the united nations has endorsed the plan to send about detainees to the united states the camps were opened in island is holding men about women and mostly in family are held on and would be given the first option to resettle in the united states under the new agreement about others in seeking some medical treatment must return to or island before applying to go to the united states only those who have been granted refugee status by the united nations will be eligible to go to the united the government has said prime minister of and the state department have said the deal would not affect the total number of refugees accepted by the united states each year said the deal was the result of months of but he offered little reassurance that it would be honored under trump deal with one administration at a said similar concerns were raised during the hearing on one asked the immigration whether the government was sure that the deal would be given negative statements about refugees and about percent of the detainees are from while others are from and have an agreement struck between the two governments should other contingencies or other eventualities that is a matter that the government will have to deal with at that said
senator chuck of new planning on being leader of the senate minority and by extension the democratic opposition as the trump era dawns in the capital i regret what said who was hoping to be president right hand as senate majority leader before both he and came up short of their election day goals moments at do i think what could have i am fully occupied with the job at said in an interview in his senate office on just a few days after being formally chosen by his colleagues to succeed his senator harry of as leader of the senate democrats that in is to serve as the bulwark against a unified republican government led by his former campaign j to use the power of the senate minority to try to force compromise when and to stand in the way of republicans when necessary are the said noting that the rules of the senate at least as they currently exist give democrats there much more power than their house counterparts to hold the line against republican policies they oppose he is going to agree on issues like trade and transportation infrastructure in a very real way with we have an obligation to pursue said about who quickly reached out to by phone after his presidential victory at the same we have an obligation to oppose him on all the places where he tramples on our travels with racism or just dismantles things because the right wing tells him to do so that is where we are it is a delicate balance and talk of cutting deals with trump and senator the republican and majority has already alarmed some democrats who want no cooperation whatsoever with trump or the senate republicans who sat on president supreme court nomination of b garland would be a dereliction of our responsibility if we said who munched casually on a frozen three musketeers bar as he laid out his vision long as we sell we have an obligation to the millions of who are those are at the center of emerging strategy he believes that trump won by appealing to the middle of with what was essentially a democratic economic message on trade and job creation he is convinced he can leverage that with the new president are president you have two work with us and you will have to alienate your republican or break your promises to he said believe that voted for trump mainly because of democratic issues like not for republican issues like tax cuts for the that any legislation that can entice democrats will have to be substantial and not be used to chip away at other or they will not hesitate to oppose it for he noted that he had quickly issued a statement skeptical of the nomination of senator the republican and occasional senate gym workout for attorney and would be giving all nominees thorough scrutiny and he said some issues were simply such as reversing wall street and banking reforms enacted after the economic collapse it comes to repealing any of as they say in said the who also said democrats would not cooperate in any way with overturning the affordable care act democrats did pick up two seats with wins in and new narrowing the republican majority and making it that much more difficult for to round up the votes needed to overcome or perhaps even muster a simple majority though we get the those two votes will be invaluable in stopping republicans from doing bad said does not believe republicans will be eager to eliminate the ability to mount filibusters against preserving a chief minority weapon he hopes that any supreme court nominee can win bipartisan but if republicans threaten to eliminate the ability to filibuster he has an argument ready said to you come before this with clean hands because of what you did with who even get a hearing and who was clearly a mainstream said after an increasingly strained relationship between and believes he can negotiate with the top republican wants to make things work and i want to make things he said we will certainly both stand for our principles and each side will respect the we can get a lot more done than has been done in the but it will definitely be a challenge and it was not the one had hoped to face
thanks to the affordable care more have health insurance today than ever before million more than in the news this week that insurance premiums are going up an average may seem but many insurers had initially underestimated costs and set rates lower than the congressional budget office had projected now seeing a the been an unqualified success many poor and still have access to affordable health insurance the experiment may finally prove that only so much solutions can of the most popular measures under the was to bar insurance companies from denying someone coverage due to a health such as heart cancer or depression more than half of say that they or someone in their household has a condition some of these folks get insurance coverage through their job others are poor or disabled or old enough to qualify for or but before the the rest faced premiums if they could get insurance at all because insurers could deny coverage to people with they could sell insurance to the rest of us relatively cheaply because they were selling insurance to healthy people who use a lot of health services insurers underestimated just how sick those signing up for the plans would and a key reason costs and premiums are going up now and even though premiums on plans are going not as much as think health insurance is still more just because insurance premiums are going up mean pay more eight out of buying insurance on will still be able to get coverage for under per month because who make between and of the federal poverty level and for a family of four in of those buying an plan are eligible for a tax credit these tax credits go up if insurance premiums go so your costs stay about the there are some clear losers under you will face a big premium hike if you buy your own insurance and make too much to be eligible for a tax credit small business owners and their or if eligible for a tax credit but choose to shop for insurance outside the marketplace estimated million and if one of the million poor living in the states opting against out of concede will probably win the election next month have a narrow window to make changes to the before gridlock returns while democrats may take control of the the scales will probably tip back the other way in the midterm elections democratic control of the house remains a long shot this is the time to think and act has come out in favor of a public a plan that would compete with private plans on the health insurance marketplace with lower administrative costs and greater bargaining power to negotiate more favorable rates with a public option would have a competitive advantage over private plans and would probably prove cheaper premiums for private plans will probably keep going up as big insurance companies get bigger by acquiring smaller ones and less competition and fewer wants to close the gap and help the have to think more boldly she might consider expanding tax credits up the economic ladder and offering vouchers to the poor living in states that expand so they too can buy plans showed us that we can insure more how we treat our sick and our poor is a choice we make as a nation done could eventually pave the way for health insurance for
director set off a torrent of criticism late last week when he directly inserted himself into the presidential campaign with a vague letter to congress about the reopening of email case his conduct has shocked many observers across the political but the only thing truly surprising about this episode is that people are only now realizing how and dangerous actually his stints in the bush and administration has continually taken authoritarian and factually dubious public stances both at odds with responsible public policy and sometimes the law the case is not an part of a clear were once enthralled when appointed the republican as chief in they talked about as if he was above reproach because of his role as acting attorney general under w when he threatened to resign over an aspect of the illegal wiretapping explained at the time of confirmation in this story is incredibly misleading did curtail a small part of the sprawling surveillance program in that occurred before the public ever knew of the existence of any domestic program the version of illegal wiretapping that the new times revealed in which sparked a firestorm of liberal criticism and widespread accusations of illegal was the program that was totally fine with and signed off he is celebrated as anything close to the hero is baffling during the bush also aggressively defended the arrest and due imprisonment of a us on us soil he was held as an and refused a lawyer for three and half years to this one of the most egregious violations of the constitution by the bush administration in also gave his legal on torture techniques during the bush despite harboring personal taking over at the speaking up without all or any of the facts has become a specialty he has led a fight to essentially outlaw a vital tool that protects privacy and security he has done so freely admitting he know what talking while his demands fly in the face of the opinions of many prominent computer who have argued mandating in encryption is impossible to do safely and a recipe for having failed to convince the public despite claiming it was vital the public debate the issue he then went to a judge to try to force apple to its own encryption using a law written in the as previously a for former attorney general wrote in politico in steamrolled his white house and pentagon colleagues even scuttling an encryption policy that was under development by insisting that apple be forced to unlock the phone for the last wholly without promoted the discredited arguing that crime has increased because police were afraid to do their jobs now that there is a slightly higher chance that citizens might film them shooting an unarmed person not only do studies show this theory is false that crime has not markedly an insult to police officers ought to stick to what he o executive director of the national fraternal order of told the new referring to basically saying that police officers are afraid to do their jobs with absolutely no as president and many politicians in both parties have called for a reduction in harsh mandatory minimum prison sentences that have made the us by far the largest jailer in the publicly spoke out against any such criminal justice reform know from my experience that the mandatory minimums are an important tool in developing he said evidence shows the mandatory minimums have never been shown to make anyone safer or increase euphemism for threatening defendants with decades in jail so they forgo their constitutional right to jury trial and take a plea but facts have never gotten in the way of and his does the when it suits him in the was told by the bush justice department that it needed a warrant to gather email records and web browsing about but under the agency has continued to disregard the justice legal and to this demands tech companies hand it all sorts of data under free national security two months wrote in is a growing consensus that has wielded the powers of the directorship more aggressively than anyone since to the and even of some of his evidence against has been available ever since president nominated him all changed is that people are finally paying elections
evangelicals in the election have proven loyal to the republican party in spite of continued moral issues in the latest white evangelicals are the largest religious with of them supporting trump this support has created fissures in the with some evangelicals protesting while others such as jerry are comparing trump to king never thought find common ground with evangelicals enter trump read trump loses the the only unifying issues evangelicals will have left are abortion and their hatred of even with they stand to become less influential in political the performances of have been strong points for but ascendancy with evangelicals has eviscerated that expectation like other can be very pragmatic about the issues they want addressed by the leadership they support in the election evangelicals are concerned about the supreme and as shows for evangelical these issues trump the personal morality loyalty to trump has not only a moral but also a structural cost it will not mean the is rather that and other religious conservatives will be better positioned to carry its lessening evangelical influence have been very opposed to and catholic voters are evenly split between trump and not will be able to claim the values high ground has also proven that republican presidential candidates do not necessarily have to pander to power brokers such as bob head of the family leader in or tony of family research council trump amassed his own coterie of prosperity gospel preachers who were not traditional evangelical such as and as a result reached a whole other segment of the religious population more in tune with promise of returning economic prosperity and his use of the media even longtime evangelical leader of focus on the had to use white to convince his following that trump was really a because she had led him to trump has changed the ecosystem of the evangelical breaking the usual evangelical synergies that and worked diligently during the presidential campaign as a it will be difficult for those choosing to run in the election cycle to play the cycle of business as usual in courting the evangelical vote merely spouting language and talking about religious freedom did not gather evangelical votes this cycle as well as language of the decline of terrorism and fear of immigrants did whether trump knew it or his strong language tapped into evangelical beliefs about the and role in biblical prophecy bee jokingly evangelicals that ready to get the apocalypse by voting for but their fear of a presidency has activated their apocalyptic fervor trump has indirectly from a strong belief of evangelicals that the two terms of has led the country to the brink of destruction was bad enough in their having the back in the white house would be the end so while evangelicals are coming together to support internal frictions are many evangelical women are upset about trump and the accusations of sexual and verbal abuse of and many are angered that their male counterparts have been silent about it evangelical women are also large consumers of evangelical media and and their support of these organizations is crucial should they shun both trump and the predominately male evangelical it may have a ripple effect in these abilities and their ministerial efforts younger evangelicals and evangelicals of color are very opposed to trump of sojourners is very vocal that all support but only white evangelicals are being polled about their political not or this brings up the biggest issue that evangelicals face with their support of that they will be seen as agreeing with contingent that is not interested in but rather in white nationalism and the restoration of white as a evangelicals who have claimed to be find themselves aligning with hate groups who support trump and are also against and both important to evangelicals and their beliefs all of these issues pose important structural and political problems for evangelicals after the election i believe that the various coalitions under the evangelical umbrella will be in disarray evangelicals will fade in political and social clout on the national stage regarding religious abortion and the coveted replacement of on the us supreme court supporting trump on election day may have many evangelicals gritting their teeth in the ballot but it is nothing compared to the aftermath if their loses

each a admiral whom the white house is considering relieving of his posts it also raises the question of why would consider firing one of the top intelligence officers in the last days of his administration admiral replacement would not be confirmed until after trump takes over one senior intelligence official argued that letting word of the effort leak seemed more about politics or vengeance than about effecting any real change representative of the chairman of the house intelligence committee and a member of transition strongly defended admiral rogers in a letter to carter and asked them to testify before his committee to explain why they want to push rogers out not by accident that admiral rogers meets with the and two days later this which is completely built on said in a short interview carter and clapper had submitted a formal recommendation to the white house to split the which conducts foreign surveillance and secures military from the command but there are

administration officials had planned to relieve admiral rogers of his duties after the election and announce a plan to create separate chains of command for the and command but the supported by carter and stalled in part because of opposition from senator john republican of who heads the armed services committee under the command would remain under the armed services but oversight of the would shift to the senate intelligence committee victory complicated the planning on one major trump and admiral rogers disagree quite publicly while trump has insisted that no one knows whether was responsible for the hacking of email accounts of the democratic national committee and a range of prominent formal admiral rogers has said he has no doubt he recently said that was not something that was done this was not something that was done by this was not a target that was selected purely he was a conscious effort by a to attempt to achieve a specific coming into the admiral rogers said one

j election victory was powered in part by forceful opposition to what he described as an economic and political system rigged against the people for the benefit of shadowy forces in the news the banks and the government trump and his allies often describe that system with one globalism it is a word that conjures many none of them shuttered unchecked immigration and a distant cabal believers controls the economy and the media analysts who track extremist groups in the united states have expressed alarm at the use of the word by the they say it carries multiple meanings from benign to sinister and often serves as a for and conspiracy theorists is a principle driver for the fears that animate the radical right in the united said the editor of a published by the southern poverty law center is the globalism is often used as a synonym for the system of global economic interconnection that has been critiqued for decades by liberal groups like labor environmental organizations and opponents of the international monetary fund and the world bank but for the far the term encapsulates a conspiratorial based on xenophobia and according to mark a researcher at the league a host on the media site rebel explicitly rejected its use as a synonym for in a video she posted in she said the word meant rule by autocrats such as president former president w bush and the united nations who value false flag of and immigration from the third almost always sneer down their nose at disdain national laugh at religion and generally despise the west while holding a creepy affection for the third she added want open cheap labor and to benefit their business and political and are all too willing to shaft the little people to achieve the website run by k newly appointed chief white house frequently attacked globalism and during tenure there but no one may have done more to popularize the idea of a globalist conspiracy than a radio host who commands an audience of millions through his media empire he has been called most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary by the southern poverty law center among his the sandy hook school massacre in was a hoax and the sept terror attacks were an inside job posted his own definition of globalism to in in his trademark he described it as a digital control engineered by shadowy corporate and political elites he called it total form of the who has enthusiastically supported hailed the republican as a historical figure who appeared on his show last has in turn heaped praise upon reputation is trump said will not let you down you will be very i hope and i think be speaking a so what is trump talking about when he talks about his hope provided a definition in an email before the election last groups in the united states began to refer to globalism at the end of the cold when it replaced communism as an idea that was an danger to the said they have also referred to it as the new world and soon they saw its tentacles everywhere the shape of that conspiracy had distinctly in part because many of foes had historically seen communism as inextricably linked to said members of the far right became fixated on prominent like the businessman and philanthropist those conspiratorial beliefs were bolstered when former president bush celebrated the end of the cold war in a speech by saying it was the dawn of a world his use of the phrase was taken as proof by many that a globalist conspiracy really was afoot was very easy for especially because he was the one who said to take that ball and run with said that point the phrase became the short hand for that kind of globalism conspiracy the multiple meanings have made it a powerful political and and his frequent references to globalism have drawn in a wide and varied audience is a very efficient net to unite disparate parts of the from the mainstream to the said the director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at state professor called globalism defining folklore and narrative for the racist but said it had also a convenient to explain the various declines that the united states is perceived to be globalism was an important theme in the final weeks of for when he told a rally in in that his opponent for the had sat at the heart of a conspiracy with international bankers plot the destruction of the league criticized the speech for classic conspiratorial talk has continued after the election trump referred to a plot against him again last when he complained on twitter that protests were the work of the news media and paid protesters a trump ally and host on fox business later accused of many on the far right have celebrated election victory as a momentous blow against the globalist conspiracy last claimed on that trump had called him personally to thank him and his audience for their support and to offer to appear on his show again soon ms the trump did not reply to an email seeking comment late night then pivoted to what he thought was most the coming destruction of globalists that hijacked the primarily the news media and international business people soon they would be destroyed once and for he suggested is battling back to restore humanity and to break the he said not gonna be any dtente we know and just here to let you know
in for the first the census bureau counted more people living in urbanized than in the countryside this been a rural nation ever since yet the idea of agrarian has receded slowly despite demographic change we still romanticize the family though relatively few of them exist anymore we view even suburbia in pastoral terms the as the historian t put it as the recent electoral college results make we still live with political institutions that have baked in a distinctly by design the democratic candidate for president has now won the popular vote in six of the last seven elections but in part because the system empowers rural for the second time in that the candidate who garnered the most votes will not be president rural even as it laments its economic retains vastly disproportionate electoral strength rural voters were able to nudge j trump to power despite large margins in cities like new in a house of representatives that structurally disadvantages democrats because of their tight urban rural voters helped republicans hold their cushion in the the least populous states are now more overrepresented than ever before and the growing unity of rural as a voting bloc has converted the rural bias in national politics into a potent republican advantage talking about a political system that skews not as important if there a major cleavage between rural and urban voting said a professor of government and politics at the university of urban and rural voting behavior is so starkly different now so that this has major political consequences for who has power not just in terms of policy she continued pervasively advantages republicans in maintaining control of the national the electoral college is just one example of how an increasingly urban country has inherited the political structures of a rural past states containing just percent of the a historic can theoretically elect a senate lee said the bias also shapes the house of representatives it as a in the formulas that determine where highway funds are spent or who gets homeland security dollars it exists in state where bills preferred by urban delegations have been much more likely to be rejected the influence of rural voters also evokes deeply rooted ideals about who have power in and argued that the strength of the nation would always derive from its agrarian soil had this vision of what they called the this person who owed nothing to who receive any payments from the who live by a but who could support himself and his family on a farm growing everything they needed and that these were the people who were going to be the backbone of said a political scientist at the university of describing what could be the forefathers of the rural voters who tilted this election when the framers of the constitution were still debating the shape of institutions we have percent of was as the census classified the population the compromise at the time created the one chamber granting equal voice to every state to counterbalance the where more populous states spoke louder and they made sure the compromise stuck equal state representation in the senate is the only provision in the constitution that remains singled out for protection from the amendment no state can lose its full complement of senators without its permission but even as a deliberately undemocratic the senate has slipped further out of alignment with the population over time the senate simply favored sparsely populated politicians in sparsely populated states to leverage the skewed power we talk about all of that was an intentional policy said a political scientist at the university of republicans in congress passed the homestead offering free land to settlers who would move to territories that would eventually become states creating more senate seats and electoral college votes for a republican party eager to keep government control away from southern democrats they even managed to divide the territory into two worth twice the political power as the plains later depopulated and then the senate became even more unrepresentative suspicion of big cities also appears in the sites of state and not new city and not st and not political scientists at the university of have found that most state capitals were located near what was then the population centroid of each state typically closer to the geographical center of the and not the place where the most people already breaking with how much of the world sited its capitals the state legislatures there also grew significantly less

when the result of the recount over electoral votes was ultimately decided by the us supreme court after vicious partisan squabbling over hanging and butterfly ballots campaign trails in the majority of public the campaign is nonetheless likely to be just as in a state such as which in many ways resembles a confederation of fiefdoms twitter northern panhandle is the heart of the old south live oak trees are draped with moss and residents speak in slow southern drawls south is as much a part of the as the united and is as widely spoken as between is an ethnic north of in palm beach and there are heavily enclaves descended from transplanted new in there is a rapidly growing community fleeing the economic while in the there is an entire city of over residents who are all transplanted the state is beholden to neither the democrats nor the both and trump graced this week as the clock ticked closer to election held a rally on in an island of democratic blue in north where the presence of the state capitol and state university makes the sleepy city comparatively liberal twitter supporters cheer trump during a rally at the antique car museum property on in mark speaking in front of a farm wagon laden with pumpkins to mark the fall trump made a pitch for early voting in is under way so make sure you get out and vote we have a thing going on that never seen a more effective pitch was

bragging about groping women without their what drives trump read really know the said just knows

a man who uses misogynistic language and has been accused of sexual assault is soon to become the president of the united states of for feminists desperate to see the first female the result was how could someone with such disregard for rights become trump boasted about being able to freely grope women because he is and by the end of the race different women had come forward to accuse him of sexual assault he also suggested during his campaign that women should face form of for having before backtracking and saying states and congress should take the lead with lawmaking on this matter after the publication of a video in which he describes women by the experts and many predicted that lost the female vote but this turned out to be incorrect it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their to exit of white women voted for trump those without a college degree supported trump over democrat candidate by nearly two to one white women with a college degree only narrowly voted in of by six percentage points by of black women and of voted for some feminists are finding it difficult to comprehend why women so offended by misogyny that they voted for en mass we interviewed women across to find out why they voted for trump and why they describe themselves as feminists what they a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or she thinks and makes her own worker who lives in the much state of voted for trump she describes herself as socially financially independent and educated female i either friends or except for one voted for trump i want to show it was not only men or educated citizens that voted trump i am an economic conservative who is registered as a affiliate i feel that trump has the best economic polices to create jobs and therefore rebuild the economy truly thought video of as been having two and a i can make an educated guess that all heterosexual men have bragged about their exploits with women to another man at some point believe in equality between the sexes i have the right and capability to make my own and live the life i choose for myself because i am a feminist i know and exercised my right not to be put in a box or voting group and to freely think and make my own judgment as to who i thought would be the best candidate for president it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their actions a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or she thinks and makes her own choices thought the sexual allegations were unsubstantiated and therefore equivalent to and campaign mudslinging if these women had truly been assaulted why wait until one month before the election to come forward to the press not the authorities thought it incredibly hypocritical to him as a sexual predator when we know for a fact that bill is and helped him cover it up through libel and slander of the women who did come forward this change my opinion about except for maybe a more sympathetic attitude and feeling that the media was treating him gender has no bearing whatsoever in their qualifications for a including the presidency was not clear as to what her policies as president would except to maybe continue with the same failed practices her policies would not have helped our depressed and stagnant economy i believe plans for job creation benefits including minority groups i also and have for a long to a more isolationist foreign not going to vote for somebody because of their gender or trump voter a mother of two boys who is currently not calls herself a feminist most but she is fiercely opposed to voting for someone based on gender alone instead she backed who shares her own beliefs including not raising taxes her home state of a mix of farmland and more white and less educated than the national mean voted for trump some things i would be a feminist but it mean i vote for someone because she has a vagina always voted republican and always support the party they pushed a female candidate through to break the glass ceiling of a perceived gender equality the end of the day video of did not affect my support for him what he says and what he does matter in those senses because looking for somebody that has the same beliefs as i do in running a country at the end of the day all sinners and we all say things like this it uncommon we act like the president of united states should be some holy person can go through all the us presidents and you will see sexual dysfunctions in all of their personal even husband had an affair at the end of the my sex life does not involve his work life and my sex life does not involve my life these women that came out about trump could have been hoping for media or maybe just simply paid by to make her criminal issues look not going to vote for somebody because of their gender or race there is nothing other than whether they can run the country or a which naturally lends itself to traditional twitter republican nominee was knocked out of the presidential heather brown backed trump brown believes that under trump the us economy will prosper and the average will be able to succeed in areas where they are currently home work and finance she says that trump the misogynist reported to really just felt like they pushed a female candidate through to break the glass ceiling of a perceived gender equality bias politics can be unscrupulous it demands you constantly remember that behind every door lives a pushed agenda
it is make your mind up time for a incrementally united or a us flirting with a dystopia from the pen of a king or a serious but flawed democratic or a republican whose election would be the sum of all the the only on we had a we would use it to elect as president on she has a thoughtful and ambitious policy agenda for inequalities and injustices she has an internationalist outlook she has responded to concerns about her cautious by committing to more radical plans she is eminently prepared and qualified for the job she is a fitting successor to and it is high time there was a woman trump poses the greatest threat to all our futures letters read these can now be added the fact as of she is no longer under investigation the just over a week before that a new batch of emails was being investigated at an extraordinary misjudgment by the director it triggered nine days that needlessly shook us narrowed the polls and may have shaped the election now the bureau has said will face no further investigation or charges over her use of a private email server bears a share of responsibility for bringing this storm on herself but the essential fact is that she is in the thing that stares in the face on a election is that the only alternative to is trump it needs to be said at this fateful that trump is not a fit and proper person for the presidency he is an irascible egomaniac he is uninterested in the world he has fought a campaign of abuse and riddled with racism and misogyny he offers not a he propagates ignorance and prejudice he brings no sensibility to the contest except boundless he panders to everything that is worst in human nature and spurns all that is is far from perfect but trump plumbs the depths of imperfection in ways that have no precedent in modern politics all countries from time to time produce leaders who are ignorant or vain or who lack intellectual judgment or personal grace but trump is the first candidate to get so close to power who has no experience of the practicalities of politics and and who does not seem to care about them either if he is elected president it will send the worst possible message to about and an even worse one to the rest of the are three particular ways in which electing trump is a step that should be spurned by any responsible voter it would mean a president governing with a congress trump and the republican establishment have many but they would find no difficulty cutting taxes for the richest or sparking an aggressive trade war with former partners they would as a that the conservative majority is restored on the supreme court progress on civil rights and equality would be thrown into reverse abortion rights would be under threat twitter how does the us electoral college election would and would be seen a victory for white over and other ethnic groups in this campaign trump has campaigned against insulted stereotyped black people and disrespected at every turn he has been backed by every white racist in the land race remains deep foundation and trump will deepen electing trump will make the world an even less safe place it will threaten us commitment to international including the and support for international norms it will contribute to instability and set back efforts to solve environmental problems it will encourage autocratic leaders in places like north and elsewhere it makes the nurturing of the planet more difficult and the future of the human race more all these should summon a special level of seriousness and display a profound responsibility when they go to the polls anything other than a vote for is a vote for conservatism off the a deepened racial divide and a more dangerous planet the time for messing is over deserves much better than trump so does the world is much better so elect elections

we need to get back to basics in this election who is the biggest or elections
writes pundits said they do most pollsters insisted they do everyone from the pope to said they do it now indeed one resounding message from the seismic electoral events of and now trump is that democracy has been badly served by pundits and pollsters in the aftermath of many voters said they would have voted differently had they known how finely balanced the referendum was going to while significant numbers of might have acted differently had they known the true strength of support when making their fateful decision to stay away from the polling stations this knowing the true voting voters are blind if provided with inaccurate they think they can see when in fact they cannot people need to be able to make important decisions in an informed manner and political scientists either get considerably better at assessing the voting intentions of the or stop attempting to do so altogether the consequences of getting it wrong are too no one can express an opinion accurately with just a single x experience in northern shows that extremists are less likely to cross the party divides thus voting often gives extremists more success than is their due the trouble with trump was that the vote in binary if the us election had been preferential stein and trump the outcome could have been a more accurate reflection of the general and trump would probably now not be the if democracy is to preferential voting is both in elections and in both in and in the country at frank claims put trump in the white house in the we have heard similar claims that is really the fault of a liberal as someone who grew up in a family on a council far from any liberal i was taught that a vote is a powerful and valuable tool to be wielded responsibly so can we stop all the liberal and grant people enough respect as adults in a democracy to be accountable for their own nobody forced anyone to vote for trump or people made their own choices and should accept responsibility for victory is being explained in terms of the political elite being out of touch and unrepresentative the ordinary people but if those people are homophobic and or are tolerant of those attitudes in their political then it be seen as a good thing they are not it is better that those who make the important decisions share those views and instead work to change those attitudes where they are held by than that they echo them and govern their country in that spirit surely in a democracy an official body the electoral should have power to prevent the serial telling of lies to gain advantage in a poll it is no good prosecuting after the event vote leave leaders may face court for such liars should be made to own up to the error of their ways or barred from further engagement in the proceedings it cannot be right that two vital decisions in two major democracies have been influenced by repeated mendacious argues that the checks and balances that the us could normally have called upon to restrain trump may no longer exist he suggests that we rely on the military to stop trump from getting out of hand i am not so sure the most steadfast modern constitutional guardians probably are the as once they were in turkey what is to prevent them from stepping we might find ourselves welcoming why are people on the left not accepting democracy any having lost the challenges go to the having lost out to trump in the us presidential the challenges are taken to the streets for good or ill the votes have to be respected or else we are all lost the alternative is mob rule or letters on election victory us election result is a sharp lesson from losers and two nations divided by a common must his pledge to close bay crave politicians who actually stand for something the rule of law and a reboot for democracy media and politicians are out of man make grate

state of on night challenged the basic premise that he is losing if they seemed even more convinced than he is that opinion polls and mainstream media cannot be trusted so he should not throw in the the mix of vexation and continued been saying we win i want to be but the people are getting angry at me so just say we win on former miss is woman to accuse trump of sexual assault read the omens are not good as dominates opinion polls and gets positive signs from early trump has stopped major donor events for the republican party he has reportedly cut back on transition plans and taken time off the campaign trail to open his new hotel in recently trump dolefully asked supporters whether they were glad he let you know on the evening of whether the rally at a sports complex in his third in on drew an estimated people but was far from in contrast to his swashbuckling early campaign it was overwhelmingly including many retirees but those who did attend waved and great signs and chanted her and the with the usual nodded approvingly when trump described his opponent as and jeered when trump reeled off a list of state department expenditures during tenure as including on to try to make state department pages more popular and to send three comedians to whooped with delight when the showman made reference to recent comment that he would like to take him behind the gym know what you do

the way the situation is with the media we know who to believe any view was shared by a consultant think any sign of him giving he said at all the people here i live around here and there are trump signs in every yard and only two signs in miles i believe the polls i think the vote will shock there was a maintenance mechanic wearing a profane that referenced he doing three rallies a seven days a week not giving up a man on a mission got a broken system and this is our way of taking it back twitter generation the battle to win millennial is a corrupt globalist going to be eight more years of taunt and take money from people who pay taxes and give to people who want to work i know people who work and have more food in their fridge than if she not going to burn down the white house because this is still my replied mean done echoed own view that the media and the polls are rigged against him and that size of the crowds he draws to rallies which he holds more frequently than demonstrates his grassroots support in may trump told the new of mouth is the no thing and the word of mouth at my rallies is got to go see and you one person goes and they talk about it to a us going to quit if you follow the numbers of people who come out to these you have to believe opportunity like you go to a football game and the crowd is so you play hard if there are no you might want to go home real quick this guy is doing two or three shots a day if you compare it to overwhelmingly in his if there are problems when you talk about a us on accepting the election accept the election you wake up on the ninth and the president and no proof of then you have to accept it if there are going to argue it when you talk about pitchforks talking to a marine who is in combat it bother me either many of his loyalists are clinging to the hope that his campaign can emulate the shock vote to leave the union in then leader of the independence called it a victory for the over the establishment and has appeared alongside trump at an feel in a similar situation to i listen to speeches all the time i feel that we in are in tune with the on immigration issues has woken there is a globalist agenda those

as news and fox news polls are lying we all know rigged the real polls show him or points higher the only way she can win is to have it rigged horribly they all know going to steal it there is massive evidence of voter dead people are illegal immigrants are voting been a democratic also claimed that the involvement of presenter billy cousin of w in the lewd video that rocked campaign was evidence

if you are a close observer of the new as you might have noticed a headline about the fox news anchor it suggested that she had at age leaving us without favorite news this a news story written by a times reporter and it is alive and exceptionally so but it has with some on the times as an advertisement pretending to be a news story in other fake or at least a version of it a times reader from has been noticing the ad awhile and wrote me this week to complain or keeps popping up on various new times pages she said is unacceptable please stop these which frankly make me feel like the times is no better an outlet than the horrifying feeds with all of their fake news how could such fraudulent content wind up on the times through something called programmatic which essentially means that computers and algorithms conduct the transactions between advertisers and publishers rather than people machine to like a stock market matching buyers with sellers both the newsroom and its advertising department have rules that forbid misleading or otherwise worrisome ads from appearing on the site but it is difficult to apply those rules when computers are serving up the ads without a sales rep on the other end of the transaction screening out the misfits a senior vice president in says the times works aggressively to squash ads like the one that made the false claim but the nature of the mechanized system means that most of the policing is done after the fact once the ad has already appeared the ad has now been reported and taken down says another ad that fell into the same category was also removed recently says the times has one of the cleanest ad experiences in the publishing business i agree relative to the size of the site and the volume of the times have many ads that tout the premature demise of newscasters or make false claims about remedies when fraudulent ads do pop up and especially true now that the firing squads are out trying to punish those responsible for publishing during the election and are the prime because critics say they recklessly let their platforms be used by the who create fake news mark hoping to hose down the says his company is taking steps to curtail the flow of fabricated content onto its in an editorial this the times piled warning that its proposed changes go far enough and warning of the danger that awaits if to let liars and con artists hijack his as measured by sheer there is no comparison between a handful of ads on the times website and an endless gush of fake news stories that get shared by millions on one is a the other is an ocean but there are similarities too both organizations find themselves in the position of unwittingly publishing fake content that misleads and annoys and that can diminish a brand ads like the one may not be rampant at the but still worth taking a good look at whether the times is really doing everything it can to eliminate them particularly true at a moment when fake news is such a flash and when the times is dispensing advice to another publisher on how to solve its problems

democratic party outrage at the shock almost on the eve of the us presidential that it is resuming its controversial investigation of after declaring in that the matter was has been chairwoman of the democratic national was one of many to cry foul has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters even the faintest appearance of using the power to influence our election is deeply she the campaign also hinted at is extraordinary that we would see something like this just days out from a presidential said the statement left it unclear whether there was anything remotely new to may well be true in his letter of notification to the said he did not know whether a batch of newly discovered emails bore any relation to previous claims that acted illegally in sending private emails containing classified information when she was secretary of state from said the new emails to be but he and his officials had not yet examined them in a later he admitted know the of the but said he felt obliged to investigate and make his decision public it is not even certain that the emails came from private move is either extremely naive or extremely cynical investigations are routinely conducted behind closed doors only when a decision to prosecute has been based on persuasive is an inquiry made public or suspects a ostensibly independent figure like the director to tip his hand at this extraordinarily sensitive moment amounts to an overtly partisan act since it must be assumed that is no it must also be assumed that he knew what he was less damning explanation is that he was clumsily attempting to save the further criticism from the republican which denounced his earlier investigatory efforts as a but if that is the why did not have a confidential word with the relevant congressional oversight nobody could then subsequently accuse him of a and he would not have triggered the firestorm in which the impartiality is again being and this time from the the damage is done must now try to weather the storm until having previously believed that she was in the clear it will be a rough ride the ugliest and most personally vindictive presidential campaign in modern history is now set for a furious and trump and his supporters have been quick to wade in speaking on the campaign the republican nominee revived jibes that is a corrupt and habitual liar in typically hyperbolic he said that her conduct was biggest scandal since risible exaggeration undermines his case but the genuine anger and alarm expressed by surrogates reflect their fear his attacks may be hitting home and their knowledge of how damaging renewed questions about her honesty and competence could potentially in trump she faces the least qualified for a host of most objectionable republican candidate in living is still only about ahead in the as a national bald figure may be considered misleading in battleground or where the electoral college will be is ahead in all but and but polls across the nation are tightening this latest flurry of negative headlines in national media desperate for a sensational story to keep the race alive in some to dish will not her advantages in name political achievement and spending has evidently failed to knock trump out of the a deeply damaging few weeks for when he was beset by allegations of sexual he still to be in with a more skilled and savvy politician than could and would have buried trump months ago a more popular or democratic could now be awaiting electoral coronation this latest blow may cause some underwhelmed democrats to abstain and best pitch to independent and undecided voters that she is the least worst candidate leaves her vulnerable to a elections

government twitter people were talking about a in us politics an election in which the leading candidates have been a protectionist an avowed socialist and a democrat who explain how she is not a socialist has put an end to such talk finds rising numbers of voters in the which should put some constraints on the next agenda eight years after the financial policies of more and regulation have understandably kept growth very slow neither promise of trade war and immigration cutoffs nor doubling down on policies will help hawks think that who has bombed seven been aggressive enough looking forward to a more assertive foreign policy but trump proved that you can get the republican nomination by opposing the war and global and that may lead to more resistance to endless war and more congressional constraints on presidential war john john is no question that the future of the supreme court is on the ballot in recent the court has been closely divided on a number of contentious the first and second amendments religious liberty voting rights racial preferences marriage and the death penalty among others with the exception of the late justice cast a pivotal vote with the majority in each of these cases the stakes are therefore quite high in terms of who will fill his seat beyond three other justices and have already surpassed the average life expectancy for men and women in this country additional vacancies are thus likely to occur over the next four to eight who sits in the oval office makes a big difference looked for judges who would the integrity of the not add to it

finally starting to pick up steam and spread its rewards to people median incomes have gone up and the poverty rate is falling people are not wrong that there has been a long period of economic stagnation and increasing but we seem to be turning a corner this is exactly the wrong time to adopt policies that are going to throw the economy into a to shut down trade negotiations or promising to renegotiate settled trade for example the partnership makes no sense if the imperative is to build on the gathering momentum of the us economy the case for the has as much to do with political influence and interest in as it does with economics abandoning the would be a huge gift to china the other countries will make accommodations to and influence will is the situation will inherit if she

middle east without election will mark a shift from being a partner in us foreign policy to it instead becoming itself a focus of foreign policy this shift has been under way for some time but will be more marked in the coming no challenge a president trump or a president will face is trump thinks he can get a but there is reason to believe that will prove far more challenging that he and in the process he could upend a lot of relationships with us secretary given the series of hacks on the democratic party and her she will probably take a very different position the question then how much tougher will she get and how specifically she will engage with this will probably result in much more of an emphasis on countering disinformation and lead to much more intelligence gathering in collaboration with major challenge for the us will be to get to focus on something other than its own internal slow economic growth and domestic which have taken a sharp turn to the the and hold elections if trump is i believe there is more of a chance that parties will come to power in a his election gives permission to these movements to become more creating a political dynamic in that is more and more hostile to the has put the us in a position of trying to remain friends with both parties in a messy divorce the us will have to build new relationships with and with the and this will take heather heather has been legal throughout the us for more than but it remains one of the hottest political trump certainly has stumbled on the especially when he said in a interview that if abortion were made women seeking one should be criminally punished a
four barbers and a firefighter were pondering their future under a trump presidency at the upper barbershop last week got to figure this said one of the barbers got a gangster in the chair he referring to j trump they admitted that they could not complain too only two of them had voted but there were no regrets feel trimming a mustache is tired both of them were terrible they never do anything for us as democrats pick through the wreckage of the one lesson is the election was notable as much for the people who did not show as for those who did about half of eligible voters did not cast ballots a state that had assumed she would historically boasts one of the highest rates of voter this percent turnout was the fifth best among the states but by local it was a the lowest turnout in years and those were important trump won the state by just voters neighborhoods offer one explanation for the turnout figures of the council the decline in turnout from to in the five poorest was consistently much greater than the drop seen in more prosperous areas accounting for half of the overall decline in turnout citywide the biggest drop was here in district a stretch of fading wooden sandwich shops and restaurants that is percent black in this voter turnout declined by percent from according to executive director of the city of election commission it is home to some of poorest residents according to a has one of the highest incarceration rates at upper a bustling barbershop in a wooden talk of politics inevitably comes back to one elections infused many here with a feeling of connection to national politics they had never before experienced but their lives have not gotten appreciably and sourness has set in went to the said owner of the juice a brightly painted shop a few blocks down west north using a metaphor to describe the emotion after election then eight years all four barbers had voted for but only two could muster the enthusiasm to vote this time and even it was a sort of protest one wrote in democratic senator sanders of the other wrote in himself so said who had written in sanders he said no president in his lifetime had done anything to improve the lives of black including whom he voted for twice like i should have known this would happen worse off than but did do something did give black people something to aspire to a lot happy my son was able to see a black who has been trimming beards and mustaches for had hoped his small business would get easier to run but it us or a he trimming the mustache of a firefighter from the neighborhood his biggest issue was health insurance lost his coverage after his divorce three years ago and has struggled to find a policy he could afford he finally found which starts but costs too much at a month none of this been he said he did not vote of the election said other factors contributed to the decline in turnout this was the first general election under new state laws that required voters to produce an approved photo id and that stiffened the requirements for new voters to prove their residence this was particularly onerous for the who move often said he believed this change had cost several thousand people in the city their vote me very he said takes away from the fairness and integrity of the although two federal district courts had ruled that the photo id law discriminated against who disproportionately lack the approved the law was applied on election day after an appeals court stayed one of the decisions gov a republican who backed the has said they have no impact on voter and allowed that their effect on turnout would not have erased victory in the state perhaps the biggest drags on voter turnout in as in the rest of the were the candidates themselves to it was like having to choose between broccoli and liver felt said who works the grill at delicatessen and says he did not vote were stuck between trump and they really left us with no an avid supporter of spent months trying to convince him to vote for her but he could not get over his revulsion at what he saw as trust issues related to the foundation grandfather pushed him toward but he found him even less he thought would be a good candidate would you vote for he said in a loud voice to a line of customers vote for said a financial services worker waiting for her sandwich has a level head and few of the men and women interviewed on west north street last week had voted for though many said they admired him spoke his mind he was i would have i would have voted for said a security guard working the evening shift at a business i loved as for countries probably have respected us because we had a woman running the he said one exception was who said he voted for trump as a protest against he blamed her policies for putting him in prison for years as for the claims of racism that have dogged so worried better than smiling to my face but going behind closed doors and voting against our he said a program coordinator at a local agreed was unlike a lot of liberal democrats who are just as but keep it he his jaw slathered with shaving cream can reason with them all day but they think they

press has turned into the daily trump over the past six coverage of the us has dominated national trump was remarkable across five titles mail on express i counted pages with content about led their front pages with all carried leading articles about and he featured in most of the columns by senior political face stared out from most of the front whether smiling alongside brothers in the daily looking stern during his cannot imagine that a victory would have generated such intense newspaper interest as happened throughout the election campaign in the trump has proved to be a media positive or negative and the majority of the coverage has certainly been the latter the undeniable fact is that he is the a if somewhat lesser also managed still to attract undue attention from newspapers does that suggest some kind of inbuilt at least one i suppose it does because a demagogue would surely not have garnered as many headlines as trump and is no denying that both men have been lampooned in although the criticism has not amounted to they have been portrayed as figures of fun rather than as evil incarnate fate of many politicians think tony ed and now papers have shown an underlying sympathy for the views of trump and notably over their opposition to immigration and their consistent antagonism towards whether in or the same papers with an eye to their readership appeal have appreciated their naked populism with even greater their disdain for liberalism and the liberal elite so trump and even while being dismissed as mavericks and ridiculed for their lack of civility and benefit from the underlying often sympathy towards their central political articulating the prejudices of their readers the common people exercising commonsense the daily the sun and daily express could do no other than find common cause with trump and there is the simple matter of the volume of coverage name recognition is immensely important in and both men have enjoyed that because of widespread media coverage quite they have prospered by having a should we fall into the trap of seeing this as a peculiarly conspiracy the and the supposedly impartial and radio news have devoted a great deal of space and airtime to trump and is true to say they have disparaged both men but they have also been at pains most obviously in news bulletins and current affairs to treat them as serious representatives of people they like to refer to as disenfranchised and so ever careful to maintain as part of the required public service broadcast outlets have unconsciously given them credence in politics is precious we may be encouraged to laugh at trump and even loathe him for being unstable sexual predator and compulsive winning but he has just enough credibility to survive the onslaught it is not so much that the people love him the but that they love him for being willing to take it and ignore named as of the by the times in he has long risen above newspaper sarcasm he revels in aware that is viewed by many of his and as some sort of homogeneous liberal institution it therefore forms part of the trump and have not needed to manipulate the press and in a conscious sense having been within the modern media it has become second nature to them to use it to their advantage
the us has called for an end to by a coalition in at a security council but critics pointed out that continues to supply arms and provide other military support to us ambassador to the condemned missile attacks by rebels on and said the kingdom had a right to defend itself but she is also incumbent on the coalition and the forces of the government to refrain from taking steps that escalate this violence and to commit to the cessation of months of it should be clear that there is absolutely no military solution to this conflict that hit hospitals and other civilian objects have to stop in many cases these strikes have damaged key infrastructure that is essential to delivering humanitarian aid in severe criticism of the us and the continue to supply it with munitions and provide airborne for its warplanes over eight the administration has offered a total of in arms sales to the kingdom the director of human rights us call for an end to indiscriminate in would be more compelling if the us provide with some of the weapons that end up being used in these according to officials and coalition on the port city of on killed at least many of them inmates in one of the prisons more than nearly of them have been killed since the conflict began in march when rebels seized and called for the overthrow of the government of president and its gulf allies have backed while has provided support to the to the security council via on the humanitarian said was step away from per cent of million are in need of some form of humanitarian he adding that since the start of the conflict children under the age of five had died from preventable diseases due to the absence of basic medical senior us administration official support to the coalition is limited and under review as we have on several it does not include target selection and review we have been clear that the cooperation that extended to does not constitute us endorsement of offensive operations in that harm innocent us review of its arms supplies to the armed forces was ordered after on a funeral hall in on two former state department and said the us review was unlikely to lead to major changes is an old and established technique for avoiding tough they wrote on the war on the rocks website with a choice between unpalatable the government initiates a review to study the question in depth hope is that by the time the review is the political pressure to take action will have passed the purpose of a review is often to buy time and create space for an administration to keep doing what it has been not to create clarity or to change foreign east and north

race and sex stoke deep responses in the years ago the great oral historian studs recounted a story told to him by a woman been molested by a relative as a child tried to tell her mother but no one would believe her yet one day when she was shopping with her mother and they spotted a black man far away on the other side of the department store the women gathered the girl close to worrying aloud about the unbridled lust that that man might toward little white girls the woman told even as a young she could see the craziness in that they could not see or hear that she was being assaulted by a member of the but instead their anxiety against the distant figure of a black man obliviously going about his have been thinking about that story quite a bit in recent as pondered the phenomenon of peculiar appeal to any but especially a particular stratum of conservative women particularly intrigued by women who worry aloud about his extreme or misogyny or careless grasp of foreign affairs yet who then say that what really drives their allegiance is of the supposedly murderous and licentious this is often expressed as a repulsion so strong like the little mother and they are willing to give uncle a pass in the face of multiple allegations of sexual breathtaking unprecedented verbal incoherence and the intensity of vitriol directed at still mystifies me to a great story reminds me that there is an affective dynamic to all an emotional narrative that may make sense in an alternate universe from which i may be functionally excluded race and sex stoke deep autonomic responses in the psyche trump began his political career more than years ago by taking out a ad in the new calling for the execution of five teenagers wrongly accused of raping and beating a young white stockbroker who became known as the central park jogger although evidence pinned the crime to another trump has never backed down from his assertion that he was us has elected its most dangerous leader we all have plenty to fear read throughout the trump has evoked old tropes of a ravaged endlessly at risk from thugs and terrorists with endorsements from the likes of the and trump has a narrative of warrior masculinity that dates back to film birth of a nation the trope of pugilistic white vigilantes fighting against lying and libertine black invaders black voters in that in order to protect the of frightened white women it seems not insignificant that trump has consistently appeared with a backdrop of attentive beautiful women who smile and wave and whom he symbolically shelters from rapists and terrorists and the bad from many of us nasty women of a certain age and is not sheltered by such cowboy chivalry in her achievements as secretary of state were slandered or obliterated in ways underwritten by suggestions of combined with horrendous and ubiquitous caricatures of the dangerously black man who stole the reins of power in a lustily union with supposedly this alternative trump

j victory could well push the party system toward a clash between an overwhelmingly white ethnic party and a cosmopolitan coalition of minority groups and whites despite the unexpected trump lost the popular vote in an election that in some respects closely resembled victory over mitt in an ordinary end to a very abnormal campaign the power of party identification held approximately percent of republicans in camp campaign may set in motion a process that reorients politics toward the cosmopolitanism versus nationalism divide that he reconfiguring our party system and shaping our politics for decades to come the power of social identity suggests that such a dynamic could be difficult to stop once set in motion in recent the democrats and republicans have battled along a axis of conflict that emphasizes disagreement over the size and scope of government rather than divisive disputes about racial identity during the and presidential for john and ran against domestic policy proposals on issues like health care and the economy after the republican party hoped to continue along this path and expand its appeal to young minorities and women but as the political scientists miller and norm candidates and parties sometimes in flanking moves so as to enlist coalitions of disaffected by changing positions on social issues that cut across party they seek to attract voters who are only loosely attached to the other party trump seems to have pulled off one of these maneuvers in shifting from traditional conservatism to a kind of nationalism though the move cost him votes among he attracted support among the larger group of whites without a college degree substantial minority of whom had backed in pulling in just enough votes in the rust belt to tip the election despite all the attention paid to economic anxiety as the basis for the evidence to date is more consistent with his brand of identity politics being the most important cause of this shift in voting patterns from of course economic anxiety and group animus are not mutually approach has the potential to transform the party system the success of his campaign may encourage other republicans to adopt his model he has shown that the penalty for deviating from orthodox policies is minimal and that an style can have significant electoral advantages though presidents cannot impose their will on most of domestic they can help define the issues on the political agenda in the choices that he trump may play down conflict over the size and scope of government and shift the political debate toward questions of national immigration and culture few republicans are likely to want to cross trump and his energized supporters given the threat of a potential primary challenge in for decision to name as his chief strategist the head of a website described in an article in the conservative national review as catering to small but vocal fringe of white and though the move lacked recent no republicans in congress which made the issue into a partisan dispute with democrats trump has also stirred emotions by promising to deport two to three million undocumented immigrants by the fate of a tax cut normally the top domestic policy priority has received less attention the party will almost certainly pursue success is likely to provoke a response from democrats that could accelerate this shift they face an outraged liberal base that is likely to reject conciliatory messages intended to win back votes among the white working class the party might instead double down on cosmopolitan appeals to the minority voters and white voters who were the main target of campaign the strategy failed in but the incentive to try again is clear democrats came closer to winning several sun belt states where minority and white populations are like and than they did some traditional strongholds with higher numbers of like and a focus on cosmopolitanism might make electoral sense for democrats given the changing demographics of the but it could further weaken their appeal to whites without college dividing the electorate by race and class even more nothing about this process is of course republicans may yet succeed in steering trump toward a traditional agenda of tax cuts and deregulation but the effects he could have on party system could be of far more lasting consequence than almost any policy he might propose
when trump enters the white house next year he will bring with him potential conflicts of interest across all areas of government that are unprecedented in who manages a international network of has

something is deeply wrong when the reputation and influence can be borrowed by a source that describes itself as fantasy news to claim that he has endorsed a presidential and then be through a million individual shares the attention paid to fake news since the election has focused largely on fabrications and outright because they are easy to identify and extraordinarily viral fake news is created by the kinds of people when might call their work or admit that in it for the money or for the thrill of deception theirs is a behavior that can and should be and that is and maybe to deal with for many and especially opponents of j the attention paid to fake news and its role in the election has provided a small the discovery of the error that explains everything but as the attention has spread widely even president talked passionately about it on it may lead to an unwanted outcome for those who see it not just as an but also as a way to correct the course it misunderstands a new media world in which every and is at risk of being not by argument but by sheer force false news stories posted on websites were prevalent in this election were widely shared political videos some styled as newscasts containing outright image posted by individuals and shared by and endlessly shared quotes and video clips of the candidates themselves repeating falsehoods during the months i spent talking to partisan page operators for a magazine article this it became clear that while the ecosystem contained easily identifiable and intentional it contained much more of something else i recall a conversation with a fact checker about how to describe a posted on a website and promoted on a page copied from another site by overseas contractors it tried to cast suspicion on the father of a slain who had spoken out against j trump the overarching claims of the story were disingenuous and the facts it included had been removed from all useful context and placed in a sinister its insinuating mention of in proximity to mentions of and its misleading and strategic mention of amounted to a repulsive smear it was a story that appealed to bigoted ideas and that would clearly appeal to those who held them this was a story the likes of which was an enormous force in this clearly designed to function well within economy of sharing and it probably would not run afoul of the narrow definition of stories like that one get to the heart of the rhetorical and strategic risk of holding up as a broad media offensive especially after an election cycle characterized by the euphoric inversion of rhetoric by some of and by the candidate himself as the campaign criticism of trump was instantly projected back at his or at the critics themselves puppet no puppet the this tactic was used on the language of social which was appropriated by opponents and redeployed in an open effort to sap its power while simultaneously taking advantage of what power it retained were cast as the real racists progressives were cast as secretly regressive on their own terms this was not a new but it was newly effective it matter that its targets knew that it was a a clear bid for power rather than an attempt to engage or reason the referees called but nobody could hear them over the roar of the crowds or maybe they but realized that nobody could make them listen as shorthand will almost surely be returned upon the media tenfold the fake news as widely understood and has already begun to encompass not just fabricated but a wider swath of traditional media on and elsewhere fox fake news misleading claims about ford keeping jobs in fake news the entirety of fake news this wide formulation of will be applied back to the traditional news which does not yet understand how threatened its ability is to declare things even when they are may try to address the narrow version of the the clearly fabricated posts has plenty of tools at its disposal and has already promised to use to bar sites that have been flagged as promoting falsified content from using its advertising platform but the worst identified defenders make their money outside anyway another narrow response from could be to assert editorial control over external forces tried to a very limited with trending topics members of the editorial staff wrote descriptions of trending news accompanied by links they deemed credible this initiative collapsed in a frenzy of bias accusations and political fear but it is easy to imagine a system in which a upon reaching some high threshold of or a upon reaching some cumulative could be audited and declared unreliable this could resemble experiment to tag satire articles as such a number of narrow measures could stop a fake story about the for example but where would that leave the rest of the answered and and barely better positioned against everything else that remained it would be a news environment in which almost everything there before remained the main difference being that it would have all been not fake is a place where people construct and project identities to family and peers it is a marketplace in which news is valuable mainly to the extent that it serves those identities it is a system built on ranking and vetting and and yet one where negative inputs are scarcely and where conflict is resolved with isolation that provisions for open conflict on a platform present any easy for it has been a source of constant fake news operations are closely aligned with the experienced incentives of the economy more than most of the organizations that are identifying them their removal will be an improvement the outrage at their mere and at their promotion on a platform with the stated goal of connecting the will have been justified

public school without knowing a word of she forgot most of the her parents taught her years but taught me the words to the that we would sometimes hear when my family would go to a night fish fry up until i still believed my moral baseline bent toward empathy the i thought i where i lived for was filled with complex but fundamentally decent people who recognized that everyone is deserving of respect and could disagree without being disagreeable the state did elect walker as governor in and the legislature gutted setting off huge protests in the capitol but i think that state would vote for j turning its electoral votes to a republican for the first time since come we even voted for as much as trump won the election in lost it her which prided itself on employing all the data wizards and ground game gurus money can did not do nearly enough to lock down the upper particularly and and instead treated those states as a given is the mayor of capital in cerulean county he supported senator sanders in the democratic and said he talked at least once a week with a field organizer from the sanders campaign during the primary but once locked up the it was radio silence from the campaign i first held elected office in the early virtually every presidential been either by the candidate or by a he told me not saying this to say important but the point not only she in the but i never got a a anything after the president by made two campaign stops in during the including a huge rally with on the before election day frustration with the campaign was apparent understand the strategy never seen an explanation for other than assuming that they wanted not just a but a smashing victory the kind that trump he said voter turnout in was the lowest been in years roughly fewer democrats voted in county this year than did in the drop in turnout in county might be partially attributed to a voter identification law in the state in a federal judge found that roughly registered voters in lacked the necessary photo id card to vote under the new and a of those voters were low income election watchers have said the voter id law alone could not have flipped the state in favor did not visit once after the democratic national convention in neither did president or sanders made multiple trips to the state on behalf of but that was not enough to gin up enthusiasm like most of the my friends and family in were shocked that trump won the and the election my mom says still in my dad has progressed comfortably to anger my has been coping with the election result with characteristic wit listening to trump speeches about i was convinced to she emailed me i hate throughout the general the surrogates appeared reassured to the point of hubris that they would be able to convert moderate republican voters in suburbs every democrat we lose in western we will pick up two moderate republicans in the suburbs in and you can repeat that in and and new senator chuck said in this line of thinking was not just but disastrously so in won of counties this counties voted for trump republicans successfully built on the map that helped to elect walker to the mansion while the campaign was looking to run up the score in states like and a triumvirate of republicans also helped elect both actively and passively there is who worked his way up from republican politics in to head the republican national and to serve as chief of staff then there is house speaker d who now has a historic opportunity to pass his agenda through congress recovered from his own failed presidential will now oversee the republican governors association is a longtime radio host in who became a voice on the right for the movement after years on the he will retire from his radio show this year along with being a vocal opponent of the trump he has taken on a new role as chief apologizer for media he expressed frustration with his he had gradually grown immune to any inconvenient fact presented to them while he read news from the politico and national review throughout the his audience seemed to glean most of its news from fox talk radio and their feeds on his radio program last played a sound bite of s current head of the national security suggesting the government had made a to sway the election in favor asked his we all agree that this is a big deal and we ought to do something about he opened the phone and the first call was from who believe it i believe any of sighed break through he said is way harder to knock that stuff down than you would he says he is but not to see conservative media falling in line and supporting cabinet picks is the monster he said of the worst elements of the conservative media have now been empowered every one of them has got a strut now has a pipeline to the white house i think about spent half of arguing that conservatism was fundamentally incompatible with what trump was offering his party conservatism has been i in being aggressive but and very and also proving that you can do things and be rewarded by the he said trump
never forget the in one of the republican primary when trump looked into the camera and declared that destroying political correctness was his no campaign issue his fans went both in the crowd oh my i even then courting the troll over the subsequent i watched as wildly disparate groups of men from the slimiest corners of the white gun good old boys coalesced into one frothing hydra behind trump when mainstream news outlets started churning out about the mysterious the wicked green engine of i wanted to and other social justice activists already know what the is a roll call of the angry men been abusing and trying to silence us for years the only thing they have in common is a fixation on the of a vaguely pejorative for king social and in trump they found their the alpha male who was finally going to give these bitches what they deserve adequately convey how sickening it has been to watch groups of men who have posted my home address dug up photos of my husband and and threatened to rape and murder me lie and steamroll their candidate to the excruciating we were expected to entertain the fantasy that a person could vote for trump without voting for for for rape culture when that very slogan vowed to drag us backward to a time when the us was a time before people of and women and had in our few protections into law on a galactic people are terrified of what lies ahead we must look out for one another read know that seems like a shiny new but trump win the election because of new he won because of old ideas call it whatever you like social basic respect and decency but is our our watch keeping those old ideas at our avowal that our humanity matters as much as white our insistence that you cannot simply erase the line between racist actions and our hope for building a more inclusive is planning a in north next month hate crimes are at their highest since more than a dozen women have accused the president elect of sexual i had to listen to supposedly leftist men not trolls this time insist that victory was at least partially a result of and and correctness gone too this is the consequence of one man told me on twitter always a backlash from he admonished as though any movement in history got anywhere by asking politely and taking a seat as though there was some magical moment in the past when reached a perfect stasis no no sexism and white dudes could still have a chill time but those greedy feminists just had to keep is no such thing as a social movement a movement is acquiescence a movement is not a movement at all it is stillness it is the status quo the trump campaign counted on that stillness on the of being a dork to give hate speech and sexual assault the space to grow and what if validated us instead of helped us firm boundaries against oppression instead of letting hierarchies reassert correctness blaming political correctness for president trump is like blaming the civil rights movement for or feminism for rape or stonewall for hate crimes every battered wife who has been murdered by her husband when she tries to leave have to hurt you if just a disingenuous peddled by people who know they did nothing to help when of hate was gathering steam and are suddenly terrified because the stock market is crashing now now welcome late you spent eight years obsessing over college opinions on comedy and now a racist clown is is a man who believes in registering restraining black protesters with building a wall on the border and grabbing women by the genitals and you think he has a vested interest in tamping down the dissent of black immigrants and he is institutional silencing personified are you sure political correctness went too are you sure we were what do you actually want us to do on a shrug at when black churches are accept being when trans women of are murdered at staggering smile at when only of rapists in the us are ever never defend our boundaries until they shrink down and garrote not an option political correctness is not you consider yourself a good but you spent the past eight years parroting the troll party line and tittering at the silly activists mocking baiting treating us like eroding our credibility and now pointing at black rape immigrants and everyone else who is petrified for their lives under a trump and insisting that we brought this on ourselves by fighting too then screw you you fight at all and you will suffer the rights

the emails currently roiling the us presidential campaign are part of some unknown digital collection amassed by the troublesome but if your purpose is to understand the clique of people who dominate the emails that really matter are the ones being slowly released by from the hacked account of campaign chair john they are last scandal in a year running over with but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere they are a window into the soul of the democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party class to which i refer is not rising in angry they are by and large pretty pretty contented nobody takes road trips to exotic west to see what the members of this class looks like or how they on the they are the ones for whom such stories are written this bunch have to make do with a mountebank for a for this the choices are always pretty and this year they happen to be are the comfortable and mainstay of our modern democratic party they are also the grandees of our national the architects of our the designers of our the high officials of our banking the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or the middle east with precision droning they they not a class at all but rather the enlightened the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselves twitter learned to fight dreamers campaign against us turn the magnifying glass on them for a by sorting through the hacked personal emails of john who has been a power broker for decades i admit that i feel uncomfortable digging through this stealing email is a after and it is outrageous that personal information has been since seem to have redacted the emails in any way there is also the issue of authenticity to contend we know absolutely and for sure that these emails were not tampered with by whoever stole them from john the supposed authors of the messages are refusing to confirm or deny their and though they seem to be there is a small possibility they all that taken into i think the releases furnish us with an opportunity to observe the upper reaches of the status hierarchy in all its righteousness and personae of the liberal class are all present in this amazing body of financial innovators colleagues attempting to get jobs for their children foundation executives doing fine and noble things of and high academic industries loom large and virtuous here ingratiating speeches to wall street are well known of but what is remarkable is in the party of and and smiling financiers now seem to stand on every constantly proffering advice about this and that in one email for the reader can watch current us trade representative writing from a email address in appear to name president cabinet even before the great election was decided an important clue to understanding why that greatest of zombie banks was never put out of its innovators of silicon valley are also here in interacting all the time with the leaders of the party of the

opposition has been killed or forced into parliament is servile and the media largely despite overwhelming apathy in parliamentary at the grassroots level from across the socioeconomic spectrum have been quietly challenging the authorities and these challenges have become increasingly hard to environmental campaigners holding companies accountable for oil spills to campaigns against local activists preserving parks and residents taking control of their local activism is gathering strength and momentum such movements may be normal for most but in they are development should be understood as a reaction to the policies of the which have consistently the interests of business elites over the needs of society and as those business elites are hit by the financial they are increasingly trying to squeeze more money from of most significant victories for action was a countrywide strike by truck drivers against a proposed increase in road tolls the truck tax known as is being operated by the son of oligarch a close friend of action was and because the people who took part came from support while the payments the tolls were reduced significantly and the truckers have gone on to lend their name to other civil including a protest convoy made up of from the region outraged that their land had been illegally confiscated under there has also been a gradual erosion of trust in the authorities to protect their but one positive consequence is that citizens have to plug the gaps in the government was for failing to put out forest fires that swept through the central and western regions of the country which left at least people dead as residents were chocking on smog it emerged that authorities were actively felling the trees in a protected area of the forest near and were placing their efforts on dispersing not putting out the flames across the country and in some cases residents do not just perceive the authorities they actively fear them according to a poll by newspaper of in and in the region believed the police were an active environmental activists campaigning to protect green spaces from development have faced violence from the police and private security contractors in private security guards were accused of attacking women and children who had joined a protest to protect trees in park when the police turned up they arrested of the most active but left the private contractors alone for the first time in history we are seeing angry muscovites not just collecting signatures but risking their lives and safety to take a stand the growing strength of these civil movements means we can no longer say that citizens are they just vote in elections because they think their vote will change anything but as the government continues to crack down on the independent that traditionally support grassroots movements the road ahead will not be smooth activists need to keep promoting the idea that citizens can no longer rely on the state to fix their they need to keep fighting attempts by the government to smear them in the press and they must continue to encourage their fellow campaigner to local government as three activists did successfully this it would then be possible for these grassroots groups to become the network that the society can rely not a state that only has the interests of the elites at heart east

states of confusion thank you beat me to the punch having left the united states in to live in for a which turned into i returned in and have daily made a mental list of the changes during that quarter century eloquently speaks to many of and i would add a few some trivial but still the rampant advance of ranging from the commercialization of to the corporate naming of our sports stadiums and other public feminism and civil rights becoming dirty the rebirth of exclusiveness and like the system and and wearing religion like a lapel pin i could go on i left when bush was elected and came back because had passed health care reform maybe it was too soon speaking as an this piece certainly resonated with the palpable the extreme wealthy the militarism at every the partisan all seem to be intensifying since when i left with my family when we return from i usually feel exhausted from the stress of my while this is all often true at least feels also true that the states can also be a wonderful place to live and travel these places you covered are all exceptional the baton and even the evangelical zeal of are not the best examples of average i spent three of the past four years in in both rural and urban reading the news from home obsessively in a much shorter period of time than has felt like a stranger i am back in the and i am very much trying to hang on to my view of the as a someone who has not gradually adapted to the boiling water of citizenship situated between and depends on the for its commitment to democracy and and especially to its resolve to enforce these principles with its allies in you believe in the principles of surely you believe that you can share what saw in before i was the continued ineffectiveness of democracy to fix the problem of mass shootings by with guns that are or seem to be sanctioned by our government those who make the assault weapons support the representatives that make them legal even with ineffective this would be an easy problem to fix then comes the news that the police are shooting anyone with a nervous especially if they have a skin color that might have a grudge against their treatment by the police has only scratched the surface the entire world is waiting for us to get our act together article inspired a thought that it be surprising if this past election contest was nothing more than the result of a friendly not unlike the one by the two duke brothers in the movie instead of a endeavor to nurture a street hustler into becoming a successful commodities it was for running for president with the goal of destroying the republican party the percent have more in common with each other than with the rest of the country many politicians have more in common with each other than with the people they sometimes try or sometimes purport to serve no surprises in this article as if in that myth in this choosing between two flawed options that do have at least one thing in wealth and power what i get out of this is that politics is not for those with a weak stomach or an inclination to be kind perhaps the same applies for new the ability to manipulate money and crowds is not an uplifting way to spend a much less a life the piece is hugely but the story within is less a sensational plot than a sad on bad characters need to move away from entertainment as a way of life not too because if we this is who our will be
can it really be can the glorious victory of have led indirectly to another are we truly on the point of losing to if we are living through the most since the treaty of the indications seem clear as trump trailed his then only potential has drawn some of biggest cheerleaders to try to make it in the us according to previous words on the trump wins the race to the white moving to daring to bare what some people really given that someone at formal victory speech appeared to shout is going to have to dig deep for shock opinions yet but sure scrape manfully away until she does as she is fond of pointing she has the one doing one to seems as brain drain is normally a consequence of oppression or moral outrage searching for the commensurate historical parallel in terms of human capital you would probably go for the time when shut down the platonic academy in and the philosophers took all their learning to while the dark ages set in for try to imagine something similar except with taking scrolls of tweets calling migrants cockroaches and the other we have to accept a small provincial backwater such as the can no longer hold and that she was always going to sign for a bigger club at some point the us is the obvious answer after the one thing this election has shown is that the us really lacks for strident and intemperate and would help to address that drought under any immigration system you care to she would be the right kind of immigrant trump himself once noticed on you to respected columnist of for her powerful writing on the erotica to no for what plans she has to draw adoring attention to herself as she makes the transition to a big we must wait to see her act may need a little local fine tuning my feeling is retire her constant refrain that fat people bring it entirely on themselves once put on four stone for a documentary designed to prove the latter and although i would like to see her reprise it for her new instinct suggests not make it part of her introductory other big trump i accept there are one or two bigger ones but this is a celebrity column is whether the will take delivery of celebrities fleeing his presidency an awful lot did promise from girls creator who earmarked know a lot of people have been threatening to do but i really then there was who am moving if he is president i say things i there was even host and comedian who did buy a house in another country just in case so all these people that threaten to leave the country and then i actually will leave that what minuscule amount lost in showbiz got a huge amount of time for celebrities announcing that they will deprive a country of their personages in the event of electoral disappointment i think they should stay and just like should have stayed when won in and fought with his if necessary to give us a victory in no use crying over turn instead to more positive thoughts who are the major potential celebrity gainers in all which stars might do well out of as so often this thoughts turn to only last was regarded as having picked the wrong side in a new cold taking citizenship from having already long functioned in roles as diverse as arms firm and presidential buddy but well all bets are off who would seriously rule out the on deadly ground legend as the ideal us ambassador to think about he has all the relevant the intellectual heft to which trump is naturally and he was straight out of the traps to congratulate the cheering that he was forward to making great i think the various projects in which is involved could prove fairly easy to extricate himself the only notable argue with that epithet to avoid crying into about the victory ford described trump as a practical in a digression chiefly notable for the revelation that the pair had been at the same military school this is now my since learning that roommate was tommy lee twitter how the us election night as far as newly minted major celebrities are you would have to go some way to avoid the trump progeny themselves needless to is being touted as a future because the oval office is now basically the iron and only families can fight for it but for many who watched the family line up on stage alongside trump for his victory all about his now we can only hope does the right thing and names her most fascinating person of i know some people will point to apparent flinch when the guy shouted and suggest he could grow up the in all this a horrified rationalist trapped in a household of emotionally incontinent narcissists but those are people who clearly got it wrong and are still asking the wrong questions god knows all surrounded by the wrong questions i myself have a son who stared at throughout speech and kept asking is that boy i was on hand to correct him on his privileged stating of the and explain that if he and his buddies bothered to look at the electoral data as opposed to acting out their they would see was happy and it was white women who made him so i will not raise a elitist who fails to understand that his debunked narrative is a lie that liberals can no longer tell in shaping up to be a time of intriguing shifts in the celebrity firmament consider your stars in sudden and stockpile emergency supplies in elections

swindling thousands of innocent out of millions of dollars through a scheme known at trump university trump fought us every step of the filing baseless charges and fruitless appeals and refusing to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university that all changes million settlement agreement is a stunning reversal by trump and a major victory for the over victims of his fraudulent am pleased that under the terms of this every victim will receive restitution and that trump will pay up to million in penalties to the state of new for violating state

senator sessions to serve as the next attorney instead of embracing the bigotry that fueled his campaign i urge trump to reverse his apparent decision to nominate senator sessions to be attorney

with just around the corner and early voting already underway we want to hear from the volunteers who will give up their election day to help vote are you acting as a poll worker for the us presidential tell us about your using the form below poll workers are being trained on how to respond to a mass shooting at the voting booths republican nominee trump is encouraging his supporters to monitor polling stations for instances of voter fraud have these reports touched your own or colored your view of acting as a poll this your first time or have you spent more than one election day at a polling if a veteran poll has the training you receive changed over if a poll what prompted you to get your thoughts about volunteering as a poll worker with a selection of your responses will be included in our coverage of election you for your submissions the form is now closed you can see a selection of responses in our elections
the most striking thing about the poll released on is not how close and trump are in how close they are in unpopularity such deep dislike could affect willingness to vote and all the more problematic for campaign given that the latest development in her email scandal could dent her popularity yet further some analysts claim that any such dip will be but with just eight days left until most of the us a decline would need to be very short and trump virtually tied in north and polls read poll showed that the democratic candidate is seen unfavorably by of likely voters while her republican opponent is viewed unfavorably by voting intention was similarly trump which suggests that some voters are holding their noses and picking a president they like the numbers are also mirrored when it comes to dislike of other of trump supporters view unfavorably strongly and of supporters see trump unfavorably say this was conducted before news that the had acquired a warrant to investigate emails found on a laptop used by a are often conducted over multiple days and some of them such as the presidential tracker collected some responses after the latest email news broke that poll also suggested lead had shrunk to just one percentage point in national polling is now only ahead by percentage whereas just two weeks ago the former secretary of state had a seven percentage point a journalist at the new moved the polls but none fundamentally reshaped the that analysis is deeply though the major way that people are making sense of the race is to look at so to claim that news is affecting the polls but not ultimately the race makes little sense especially because barely a week of this election has gone by without some sort of scandal creating a polling or so there is no simple opinion equilibrium that we can measure elections
it is no use pretending presidential election victory is a disaster for the united states and the world it at least in a victory for prejudice and for ignorance and spite it represents the triumph of economic nationalism and introspection over internationalism and the global good it is a victory built on fabrications because of will ultimately confounded by its contradictions and its immorality it will be defeated but correcting this deformation will not be easy it will take time and the damage will be explanations have been offered for defeat last week all have an element of truth for she was an uncharismatic figure the democratic base was uninspired and many stayed at home doubts surrounded her past not least in respect of the foundation in many she represented a discredited political establishment there was about her candidacy an sense of entitlement there was her ambiguous legacy and was a reaching up to a place of power no woman has ever gone a mostly unspoken misogyny undoubtedly played a part in her the complacency of the democratic party and liberal too comfortable after eight safe years of did a great disservice the party and its elected representatives badly misread the mood of the nation for the most did independent pollsters and the us media they initially dismissed trump as a clown and then with to give him too easy a these factors contributed to demise but they are not the whole story trump won because he successfully tapped the alienation and disillusionment of white men and women who comprise of the electorate and turned out for him in large numbers as polling breakdowns the determining factors were not education or not religion or not sexual predations or entanglements they were race and linked to economic distress trump exploited a feeling among whites from all suburban and that inclusive and was not working for were significant numbers of people who felt their grievances were no longer being listened to by a centrist party that had loosed itself from its moorings as frank said in these pages last democrats went from being the party of town in to the party of vineyard of the and they did so at roughly the same time that the republicans were sharpening their deadly image of the of the constituency that switched to trump was railing against a sense of being overlooked during eight years of president race unquestionably played a part when trump shrieked his slogan great what he was really saying was white when he spoke about curbing immigration and building a when he minorities and people from foreign countries he does not know or when he vowed to scrap international trade deals that he claims are destroying jobs in the when he railed against selfish allies who do not pay their the subliminal message was always the fear of the foreigner in conjured the illusion of a return to a society of secure safe and agreed values no wonder and other minorities are frightened no wonder us relations around the globe are in turmoil and populists and hard are celebrating no wonder observers speak of the end of the west and the demise of liberal democracy has stormed the shining city on a betrayed the founding fathers who stood tall for human dignity and universal rights and now presages an isolationist made in image a beacon of discrimination and are the peculiarities of the electoral system to too won a majority of the popular vote but was handsomely beaten in the race for electoral college votes and too little attention was paid to the effect of a decision by the supreme court in when it struck down a key part of the voting rights act of by a five to four vote what this did was allow nine states with long records of voting such as south to no longer seek federal approval to change their laws the effect was seen last week as the what has been happening in north a battleground state with a history of racial discrimination in voting republican lawmakers and officials have gone to remarkable lengths to drive down turnout among black who disproportionately there were numerous other examples across the including stringent voter id rules that the federal government had stated earlier this year had a disproportionate effect on minorities for the leader of the free world to allow voter suppression is beyond supporters and opponents alike are about to discover is that like the billionaire is much of what he promised on the campaign trail will not be delivered or will be so watered down as to make no says he will cut raise public spending and slash the federal deficit impossible all at once trump says he will renegotiate or scrap and other treaties but his conceit that this will help uncompetitive in or in is says he will slap swingeing tariffs on but he knows the geopolitical and commercial realities mean he will not he says he will make strong and its then kowtows to the most formidable strategic and undermines he says he will be best friend but his campaign was not above antisemitic trump voters really believe the border wall they need a reality check the power of us presidents to act unilaterally in or any other domestic is extremely circumscribed trump would face endless legal challenges and he would need agreement and funding from prospect that much of what trump has promised or threatened will not happen is welcome perhaps the responsibilities of office will temper his worst producing a the incoherence and contradictory nature of his economic ideas for boosting growth and jobs and moribund industrial areas suggest his grassroots supporters are destined for disappointment economic performance is what will ultimately define the trump has plenty of other horrors in while volatile personality and inexperience add extreme at home and to a host of other worries trump now has the opportunity to stack the supreme court with conservative reactionaries
how is everyone ready for i was asked to speak about a vision for the next hundred years of reproductive choice and justice such a wonderful frame to think about what a feminist future might look like but i bet like a lot of hard to imagine what the next hundred years will look like when so much of for women will depend on what happens in just is no overstating how important this election is not just about the next four or eight years this decision is about sending a message about who we are as a and setting a very particular course for the women who live here look back on this time as a watershed a moment that in shape the next hundred years of first i want to share a personal story a little over six years i was pregnant with my and when i was weeks i got incredibly ill i developed which some of you might know is dangerously high blood pressure during was admitted to the hospital and within just a few i developed another complication called the short version being my liver was in danger of and i was in danger of dying if my daughter was not had an emergency and was born weighing she stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first two months of her undergoing medical interventions to save and protect her that to this day i try to avoid thinking about but i was and she was and today a wonderful healthy and i feel grateful for that every share this story because this was something in my life that changed me that shaped who i am when i think about this what i think about most often is how fortunate i was that i got sick far enough along in my pregnancy that i faced with the reality of needing an abortion to save my when i think about those days in the hospital the the the the stress the idea that the government could ever become involved in my most pivotal it horrifies one thing i want for the next hundred i want for no to fear that their most personal life choices will be made by someone want for no to be afraid that her scariest life moment will be made even more difficult and traumatic by government the next hundred i want to see every woman be free from the fear that her body is not really her why i want to talk about this election tonight because at before in politics have bodies been so front and center in the national conversation and so at are choosing between a candidate who has spent her political career fighting for reproductive and a candidate who says that women who have abortions need to be punished a candidate who said this week in the final debate unequivocally that she will defend planned and a candidate who promised to choice between a person who has spent her life in public and a businessman who rips off his perhaps most making a decision between a woman who has said that rights are human and a man who says if you want you can just grab women the a feminist rallying cry right now that i like a and it pussy grabs i know that so much has been made of that and the ensuing allegations against trump by multiple women that he did just what he bragged about doing on that while some people may not see the link between sexual assault and reproductive those of us here in this room know know that there is a direct connection between those who think they can touch bodies without permission and those who think they can legislate our bodies reproductive rights and justice has always been about a fundamental respect or in this disrespect of bodily integrity and our bodies are our or make no the conversation that having right now about is not just salacious media fodder the way we come out of this moment the direction our culture shifts because of it will absolutely determine rights in the future we are witnessing a moment where our country could move backwards back to a place where will be and men will make decisions for women or towards a future where our culture and politics understand and respect women as autonomous full human are the two optimistic that on the right one the one that brings us to the feminist future all of us in this room have been waiting for when trump said he wanted to punish women for having there was outrage and he had to walk back those comments but more activists and organizations like planned parenthood were there to point out that while other politicians may not say they want women to be exactly what would happen if abortion were made in what has already happened to women like who was put in prison for inducing her own abortion in feminist future has no place for criminalizing women who decide if and when to trump claimed that what he said on that access tape was just and later when former new city mayor said that all men talk like men across the country came out to is not normal this is not acceptable men are better than this the feminist future that fighting for has men fighting alongside of men who refuse to be insulted by antiquated and sexist ideals about what it means to be a trump claimed that the women who have accused

it is less than a week since trump was elected as the next president of the united states so it is hardly surprising that such an immense shock to the us and to the global political order is still only sinking in to add to the trump himself is now making almost daily statements in some mark changes of direction or few of which can yet be treated as definitive the trump triumph is an immense and immensely but there are still more than two months before his inauguration it is likely that some of the instant response to his however passionately may prove to be ephemeral and in some cases is certainly true in and it is particularly true in where reactions have fallen far short like so many most of leaders were caught on the hop by last result they had expected and wanted to prevail it therefore made sense for union foreign ministers to meet on to discuss the implications of the trump victory there was and is use in such and the foreign secretary was wrong to stay and especially foolish to other for what he dubbed an just because acted it does not follow that is right to get on its high horse about trump has plenty of problems of its own its underlying approach should be that of which is that and are linked by values of democracy and respect which they should cooperate to uphold it made no sense to use the meetings to give the impression that is a place of political virtue and one of political turpitude neither thing is true and saying it to the new however alarming he may be bad reaction in especially on the has been more absurd and still much of it is driven by the triumphalism of the press and the isolationist right in it does not matter whether may was ninth or in the list of heads of government to speak to trump nor does it matter whether and his entourage got to see trump before an elected politician did diversions of this kind only matter to those who live and breathe in the bubble what matters to the rest of is the kind of relationship that will be possible with and with the the rest is froth lets down by treating both the trump danger and the response so may began to bring things back to earth in the prime traditional speech at the lord banquet not for the first she gave an interesting but flawed speech to her may at least understands that election was caused in part by some voters feeling left behind by the unfairnesses of the liberal global order she gets it about the in ways that too few politicians can emulate she sees the need for politicians to understand and respond to that kind of anxiety and she grasps that the overarching public policy question for western countries in the early century is how to give voters the confidence that and liberal values work for them not against questions she posed in speech are important and serious the prime minister is attempting to resolve the tensions that exist between the nation democracy and in the modern age this is more important than speculating over whether may will be thatcher to but problem is that she does not have the answer to her own big public policy especially in the destructive context of the trick is to effectively manage ideally this would be done in as democratic a way as possible it involves responsive controls over goods and within the frame of trading within which governments work together to set rules that businesses must follow but that is not the answer towards which government is groping its way she is right about the goal to manage in ways that preserve liberal values and that work for everyone but she does not know how to get above all because makes that task infinitely elections

soon after his electoral college trump was atypically conciliatory those who have chosen not to support me in the he reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great he can do so will have significant impact on his ability to govern effectively and repair the damage this election has wrought so little reassurance for the scientific as those advising trump have a collective history of attacking scientists and their leading the environmental protection transition much reporting has focused on his extensive ties to climate denial but he was also the silent hand behind the bush efforts to rewrite scientific reports on climate change then an transition team member who has made a career of taking money from the coal industry to harass climate scientists by drowning them in open records a science will become more vulnerable to spin and suppression on the shortlist for energy secretary is oil magnate who pressured the university of to fire researchers who suggested a link between and and then sued someone over a post that criticized his the longer we can expect such threats to multiply echo chambers are likely to get worse net neutrality is in peril media blacklists are becoming a trend abhorrent behaviors that were normalized during the campaign may be to weaken the scientific foundation of laws such as the us clean air act will be more likely to pass president threatened vetoes on bills that would have increased political control of national science foundation upped industry influence over the science advisory and paralyzed the ability to issue public protections we cannot expect the same from his what are scientists to is not time to throw up our hands but to roll up our sleeves jack and roger rightly argued in this last week that scientists must engage with the trump administration we should not vilify those who choose to serve in executive branch science advisory or assume such service is a lost have elected a not a dictator we should that what a candidate says on the campaign trail is often different from how one governs campaigns allow for extraordinary but governing is constrained by the rule of law checks and balances may be but they still and we should take full advantage of them to ensure that science continues to serve the public the answers to policy questions posed by were vague but heading in the right direction what will be his regulatory will inform our decisions on what regulations to or he responded what about preventing political interference in administration will ensure that there will be total transparency and accountability without political he wrote engagement helps hold him to such commitments but engagement is not the same thing as and their institutions should watch closely and hold the trump administration to the same high standards we would expect from any government regardless of whether we agree with policy we should protest loudly if they remove science from the or manipulate or suppress science to try to justify decisions when the bush administration censored scientists and rewrote scientific too many scientific bodies stayed worried about jeopardizing funding this cannot happen and their institutions should defend the ability of agencies to protect public health and the environment thousands of federal government scientists who dedicate their lives to public service are anxious about their future and are more likely to keep up their efforts if the scientific community has their backs we need them now even both to inform agency decisions and to report any attempts at political interference in their work scientists and their institutions should champion and scientists of already face significant barriers to careers in and campaign only made this worse diversity makes science and our country and all should be able to contribute to scientific knowledge and benefit from its and their institutions should hold trump to his pledge to seek guidance from everyone advice can come from chemical company executives but it can also come from those who live nearby chemical facilities and suffer the environmental and from who can quantify public health and economic have heard many reactions to a trump presidency but i have not heard indifference the science is about wrote former television anchor urging scientists to engage creates truths that everyone can early signs indicate we may suffer a attack on the role of science in policymaking our reaction must be equally robust the science community should be ready to but also to provide the scrutiny and criticism necessary to preserve democracy and our scientific enterprise
the nightmare truly began when trump threw out of a press conference in august last year some might argue it was when he called immigrants the month but the beast yet yet been given a clear face or back to trump shouted as was escorted out of the room the familiar syntax was not lost on us who have been told to for as long as been in the united whether we were born here or he was forcibly was criticizing trump for effectively saying he would deport million undocumented people and build a border wall trump skirted those but that was the reality of what he was proposing we were put in a familiar place where we are merely numbers or parasites to the seen not for our worth as human beings but for our worth as an old proverb the bad good when i first delved into the world of i used to hold the saying in contempt it seemed to feed into the bottomless humility of the in the face of the immigrant the who want to make a fuss it painted i as a people who merely stood by while bad things happened to the trump being its first i felt we were in that helpless place where our only option was to endure the slogan make great again encapsulated exactly how we are seen in this country we are the unclean our culture dilutes the purity of white citizens who must be protected from us make great again by kicking us out violence against at trump rallies and across the country xenophobia and racism were whipped into a fever pitch by the his constant attacks on our families and our neighbors them was a phrase i heard more in those months than i ever had in my life have to go became a common response to everything i wrote something had was attack on us district court judge p born in and of that saw our worst fears begin to take shape in reality then the presumptive republican accused who was overseeing a class action lawsuit against trump of being biased simply because of his heritage unauthorized immigration in the us about million people live in the us without legal down from a peak of about million in net unauthorized immigration has been roughly even since according to there are about million unauthorized migrants either working or looking for or of the labor force since more have been leaving the us than likely due to a slow economic recovery since the recession and stricter border has deported more than million more than any other president his executive orders protect at least million people from remember watching the debacle unfold and this is how silence us as all of us for it has never been about immigration been about stoking racism against brown against black against the a member of a club or society very strongly trump said of is all fine but i say got it back to this is what he meant when he said he would make great took a dip into the absurd with the infamous mayo taco bowl tweet smiling and without as if he advocated for the mass deportation of our people and called us criminals and love was beyond many hope that the long nightmare is about to draw to a close but trump could still pull off a win and even if he the trump machine will roll with or without him we have on our hands a significant population of angry white citizens who blame us for all their frustrations things are about to get worse for not happens in cycles last mass deportation of and happened during the great depression approximately million and were rounded up and ejected from the country and leading up to xenophobia in the republican party was already the norm trump merely brought the subtext to the it and added several exclamation points a recipe for used to hate the but now i think of it daily it helps me survive the daily inanities of the election the daily ways we are dehumanized not putting on a smile and pretending the bad times happening it is a radical act of survival it is a resolute affirmation in the face of i will make it through this i will live to see the better elections
say what you like about past presidents and their international but hard to dispute the caliber of their national security henry to from to sandy from rice to the list is a long line in seasoned and strategic now decision to pick gen as his most senior national security aide is a rupture with the past and with sane foreign is a conspiracy theorist and who hangs around the darker corners of the white nationalist he also lost his last job in the intelligence i suspect because he manage his way out of a paper of which would be mildly amusing if about to take on a job that will determine the immediate fate of large parts of the national security adviser plays a unique role inside the west wing unlike almost every other corner of the national security is unquestionably controlled exclusively by the trump and make bush and look like tenured professors of military of declaring war and obtaining a defense the president needs nobody to unleash the most powerful intelligence services and diplomatic is why the national security adviser is normally a wise character who can sift through mountains of maintain a clear sense of strategic priorities in the national and wrangle the sprawling are all qualities that are hardly obvious in has falsely claimed that law is spreading across the united states and that the nation is in the midst of a world war with radical of is he tweeted earlier this previously ran the defense intelligence agency but lost his job after two years because of clashes with officials for his claims he was fired because he opposed the view that terrorists were a fading his new appears very comfortable with the current working with the propaganda network he apparently received classified intelligence briefings while running a lobbying firm for foreign clients he seems to favor working with to combat terrorists while turning a blind eye to designs on and its support for the regime in trusted sitting in on his daily intelligence early record on advising the is shockingly haphazard at best and unethical at the brief time since he won the first call with a world leader was not with a trusted us ally but with the dictator president he sat with prime minister of japan this but his aides told the not to believe every word trump said he met with the populist right wing politician before meeting the prime minister may but he somehow found time to meet with several real estate developers to discuss his property interests with and the trump organization signed a deal on his many interactions with foreign trump is speaking without briefing papers from the state department because his transition team is in such chaos that they have yet to establish meaningful contact with the foreign policy of a are condemned to repeat history if we choose to forget it and voters have chosen to forget the lessons of the last republican eight years of recovery from the catastrophe of w national security we are now staring at the prospect of an even more impetuous set of trump and make bush and look like tenured professors of military history never mind that trump spent most of the presidential campaign pretending he opposed war in when in fact he supported it so far as anyone can fathom his it was to pick the winning position after the outcome was a leader is both boastful and the leadership vacuum is filled by aides who feed into the posturing but compensate for the indecision fills that hole we know where this leads manipulated intelligence reports to build a case for the war in that was the single worst us national security decision in a generation we are still living with its consequences with and a global refugee crisis that is unthinkable without the national security was unable to control the hawks inside the even as she leaned towards the doves need to control any because he is leading the opportunity for to cherry pick intelligence is almost limitless with his public hatred of and his desire to wage a war of the case for military action will be simple inside the trump west may be time to concede that one of the biggest winners of this election is the twisted and murderous distilled by bin laden unlike bush and trump and believe we are engaged in a war with just as and believe they are engaged in a war with and the have infected their enemies with their own sickness to be this infection had been growing for many years before trump started running for office it broke out when congress democrats and republicans voted against the closure of bay it is obvious in much of the refusal to deal with the refugee crisis but now the sickness has given us trump and to escalate a war that is picking as his most powerful national security trump has confirmed what was obvious all along he will govern as he no matter what his aides say to reassure the anxious national

that fake news and misinformation on could have influenced the outcome of the us presidential election is worrying in this is only tinkering around the edges of a major problem the first amendment of the us constitution was designed to protect freedom of the press for the most the supreme court has failed to use it to rule on libel hence tabloids such as the national enquirer can get away with printing pretty much anything they is possible to police the publishing and broadcasting industry if nations are willing to do it sufficient staff need to be employed to before publishing or broadcasting has the power to influence on a macro so it should also come under the same regulation it certainly can afford the cost of editorial teams to manage its publications an easy if in publish the guardian already regulates this problem with the polite comment was removed by a moderator because it abide by our community an open source successfully regulates itself anyone can correct misinformation published on the site and citations are with it being very clear when a citation is missing information is democratically tuned in real in recommending a name suppression regime for suspected sexual in his report on operation supposes it to be unlikely that the government would sanction an anonymity before charge as this enrage the popular press whose circulation would he is unduly pessimistic it is true that some newspapers have raised the false of but in no less a figure than spoke warmly of the need to protect individuals from as home may agreed a significant proportion of arrests on suspicion of having committed serious never lead to charge and the lives of many people have been needlessly blighted in consequence of being named in the media a general ban on publishing the name of a suspect before charge could be lifted in exceptional cases where it was considered likely to encourage other genuine complainants to come but only with advance judicial
the latest furore over alleged misuse of private emails when she was secretary of state in has thrown a tumultuous and unedifying us presidential election into even greater with little more than a week to go before voting unexpected and very public revelation that it is recommencing its investigation into conduct may not be politically but its timing certainly makes it appear that way the row represents yet another hammer blow to a democratic process whose credibility has been repeatedly principally by the unscrupulous republican this new stoked by republicans and it remains likely that voters will deliver a possibly rejection of trump on although opinion polls show the race tightening nationally and nothing is certain as a febrile campaign is ahead almost everywhere that matters and she is the sane and if choice a trump defeat will be richly deserved as we have noted he is not a fit and proper person to serve in the white house his during a raucous and often embarrassingly vulgar campaign made that abundantly consigning to the rubbish bin of electoral history is easier than getting rid of this is likely to take a lot longer platform was based not on policies and careful analysis but on ignorance and spiced with opportunism his unexpected success in winning the despite the republican reflected his close identification with mainly and voters like feel undervalued and

wounds and propensity for public meltdowns had pushed the needle toward according to recent polls that may have changed a little in the aftermath of the renewing of its email probe last week but even the fears of many voters that a trump presidency might become a reality have fears are not unfounded failings as a candidate and a person are and he would be in a position to wreak considerable havoc if elected especially true at the agency with the judiciary and in other arenas where the president can wield executive power the aspect of his personality poses risks that be nor can anyone know the degree to which congress would be inclined to obstruct or approve his most damaging has been lost in the salacious and obsessive media coverage of the republican outrageous bigoted remarks and appeal to the worst instincts of the is a critical examination of what a administration will mean for the nation the information on tangled interests within the evidence of influence peddling and revelations detailing manipulation of media and the democratic signal a plutocratic style of governance that is all too familiar and increasingly dominant at the federal content of what has been revealed in these as well as her lengthy track record in government and policy statements as a candidate yield an inescapable represents the entrenched interests of the status quo her election will expand the excesses of global interventionism and corporate welfare that have characterized us policies for several decades at almost incalculable cost both domestically and the has engaged in the type of one expects of presidential especially democrats who seek to counter the image as weak on defense she has agitated against president on and and reiterated her belief in responsibility to the rationale used to selectively promote the elitist economic agenda that she has so faithfully pursued over the years even as the exercise of that dubious mission has resulted in widespread devastation in the middle south and elsewhere a muddled and hypocritical foreign policy has created bitter enemies across the globe and angered us yet supports the rudderless and demonstrably ineffective efforts of president without a hint of and tragic wars in and continue to extract a heavy and though opposition to those wars helped propel into the focus on ending them and preventing new ones has been blurred by the ongoing the war on terror in reality little more than an extension of other armed conflicts the us has waged around the the deadly manifestations of the war on terror have largely been met with silence approval from much of what passes for the progressive movement self destruction has provided a smoke screen for those on the left and the more moderate elements on the right who might ordinarily question unabashed for a continuation of these modified strategies beyond the historical enthusiasm for but not fair trade even while waffling on the gives credence to the belief that she will sacrifice the welfare of workers here and abroad for the unfettered profits of the business elites whom she has always served in the face of documented inhumane labor practices and other related human rights abuses around the the administration and those preceding it have steadfastly refused to demand changes as conditions of honoring trade agreements as secretary of had an opportunity to honor and promote the rights of working people around the world but failed to do so why would anyone expect her to change the inflammatory rhetoric and actions of both and trump stand in sharp contrast to the platform and orientation of the green which offers the only alternative in this election that will move decisively to draw down us military interventions abroad and reduce the military budget to a sane level while redirecting increasingly scarce resources to rebuild the frayed social safety net and help those most in need here at home this election is about far more than our collective distaste for a and trading the noxious buffoonery and personal insults of trump for the clear and present danger of corporatist logic is no at all elections

contrary to the boasts of vote to leave the union did not beget the result of the us presidential election there are analogous dynamics driving support for and for just as there are comparable weaknesses in the remain proposition and candidacy but the relationship is more metaphorical than causal in any is the sense in which commentary has appropriated the term shorthand for the punishment administered by angry voters to what they perceive as a metropolitan is not a metaphor in the it is government policy the election of trump does very little to make its passage smoother it adds new layers of diplomatic complexity and economic uncertainty the existence of an eager trade partner in the us was axiomatic to the case for quitting the when publicly warned that its seat at various tables in was integral to the strategic power in the he was dismissed by as a meddlesome stooge of interests with spiteful motive informed by his did not anticipate that successor might be a man with no discernible capability in whose dominant trade policy during the campaign was protectionism the foreign secretary once said trump was of his now he invites people to overwhelmingly about the possibilities offered by the like many is subordinating his prior concern about character to the commercial prospects of a bilateral trade deal find encouragement in reported from his first conversation with that is a very special place for he invited the prime minister to visit as soon as possible but if the us election campaign teaches anything it is that the winner wields phrases like this indiscriminately and without any basis in for the alarming turn of politics in the us increases the premium on continental solidarity and collaboration on the basis of shared democratic values the basis that cited as an explicit condition of partnership in her chilly statement of congratulation to trump to and many other governments across the looks much more like a threat to the task of shoring up a stable international order than an this it would be reassuring to believe that may has a understanding of role in the world and a capability for swimming in turbulent geopolitical currents it would be helpful if she gave at least the impression of possessing a strategic plan there is little in her record before entering downing street to indicate an interest in foreign except insofar as it affected her job as home secretary a necessarily parochial view dominated by immigration control and domestic becoming prime her handling of international diplomacy has exuded verging on discomfort she has survived summits without igniting controversy but not stamped any authority on the proceedings her trip to this week was underwhelming it was meant to demonstrate global previewing independent capacity to build trade relations with powerful nations may was rebuked by the prime minister for denying visas to students and skilled migrants the visit did nothing to support the claim that departure from the is economically liberating it instead a future of supplication an isolated country asking for from governments that present of their degree of hesitancy is inevitable given that may is learning the practice and idiom of international relations on the job her style is not to swagger or throw the weight of her office around and that is to her credit it is not surprising that the prime minister chose to play the opening moves in diplomacy with trump by the observing the usual though her liberal audience at home wishes she would show more awareness of the reasons for their alarm politicians have a history of vastly overstating their influence on us presidents and a habit of projecting trends on to domestic contexts in our destiny and security are tied to our geographic and neither trump nor can change that more they will underline the navigate through newly turbulent international may needs an account of ambition that goes beyond the tactics of bilateral deals she must as that successful alliances combine mutual commercial interest and shared values requires the nurturing of trade relations beyond but that imperative must not be the only lens through which the prime minister looks out on the world it is worrying to observe that she appears not to have any
congressional republicans are settling in for what they hope is a long run in the but j trump want them to get too comfortable going to put on term which a lot of people happy but putting on term trump said in an interview with that aired on doing a lot of things to clean up the if one thing could put trump on a collision course with his new allies on capitol it is his embrace of proposals such as term limits and tougher restrictions on allowing lawmakers and top aides to become lobbyists in the lucrative world of influence peddling members of congress like to talk about returning power to the but many would prefer not to vote to limit their own tenure or future employment opportunities bringing up term limits is seen by some as raining on their parade senator republican of and the majority made that quite clear last week when he said the senate outlook for term limits was severely limited would say we have term limits told reporters called elections and it will not be on the agenda in the highlighting of his call for term limits it is no on his list of priorities to up the corruption and special interest collusion in revives an initiative that has been dormant in for years after republicans rode it to the house takeover in but then failed to make it happen trump found a surprising kindred spirit on term limits on when president seemed to endorse the concept think we want to see new voices and new ideas said at a news conference part of the reason why i think term limits are a really useful aides said later that might have been referring more to the limit on presidential and his view that set the right precedent by leaving after two terms but his words could certainly be extended to congress proponents of term limits say position has put new energy behind the campaign to adopt a constitutional amendment restricting house members to three terms and senators to two terms other part of the pressure is going to come from the said nick the executive director of the group term limits they know term limits is an issue on the they will make it very difficult for congress to ignore i think congress is going to be forced to vote on term limits have always been popular with voters and got a surge of momentum in the the bums political atmosphere of the early leading multiple states to adopt them for their legislatures through ballot initiatives and other means as part of the with in republicans led by representative newt of promised the legislature and a vote on term limits to replace career politicians with citizen the mantra helped them topple speaker s of a staunch opponent of term via a who promised to serve just six years he later violated that that term limits vote did come in march and won a majority but fell more than votes short of the majority necessary to advance a constitutional amendment forty many of them committee and subcommittee joined democratic opponents in defeating the proposal the amendment again fell short a year later opponents argued and argue that arbitrary term limits would rob congress of the institutional knowledge and expertise needed to conduct business and that voters had regular opportunities to end the service of their lawmakers they talk about how gerrymandering and the advantages of incumbency make it hard to defeat sitting lawmakers whether the proposal can go anywhere this year will depend on how serious trump and his advisers are about pushing it against the wishes of congressional or whether it was just part of his message to stir up frustrated voters at this it is impossible to but it was a primary element of his call to the that appeared to resonate with the public and term limits are just one issue conservatives also are raising the alarm about a move by house republicans to restore congressional earmarks special spending as long as they are directed to a government agency rather than a private a source of corruption in the past some lawmakers have argued that restoring the ability of individual lawmakers to earmark money would make it easier to pass spending but critics are moving quickly to quash any effort to bring them back with the earmark proposal on the verge of being adopted by republicans on speaker d called off the fearing it would send a bad signal so soon after the election he promised a review of the idea and a vote early next year like other outsiders before trump will discover that draining the swamp is much easier said than done
the election of trump has been welcomed by autocrats and demagogues across the from to the the reaction of democratic especially in has on the contrary been a mixture of anxiety and an effort to put a brave face on an event that might threaten a world order this is the first daunting question raised by choice of a man whose only experience in international relations has been as a real estate and whose presidential campaign was marked by utterances which reflected either ignorance or disdain for what the us has traditionally stood for in the has called he wants to upend free he has fawned over he has suggested japan and south should develop nuclear he has the nuclear he wants a wall on the border with he believes the fight against terrorism can include torture and he cares not one bit about climate change and that is only what is known about foreign policy that if he actually has the very fact that the survival of the international order in which the us has historically played such a key role now seems in speaks volumes about the dimensions of his election the world is stunned because trump has said so little that was coherent on foreign so much that was and because he has kept silent on so many of the complexities of what a us president may be confronted many are now reduced to mere speculation about the future policies of the victory of trump shatters the notion that the us can be counted on by its allies not just for guarantees and economic but even as a defender of liberal rather than a threat to it it calls into question the traditional us role as a protector of a global architecture of no one knows who will be appointed to his although the names of sessions and general have circulated in no reassuring way all these risks are reflected in global reactions those countries and leaders who want to continue to play an essential role in underwriting the international principles and alliances that stand at the heart of global governance are now aghast and scrambling for any reassurances that may be on offer those who want to challenge a global order or see it as well as those who expect that a new dawn of us isolationism will best serve their are rejoicing so the news of the election outcome was greeted with a round of applause in the parliament the will no doubt be hoping that frequent overtures to including his expressions of admiration for the will offer areas of negotiation to benefit this could apply to a move likely to further empower to which could lead to the lifting of or to the wider question of security architecture and the reactions pointed as much to the difficult state of the politics as they do to attitudes towards the us while contemplating a the suggested her cooperation with trump would be conditional on respect for democratic values in and officials scrambled to underscore the importance of transatlantic links but among there was an outflow of glee and celebration in marine pen cheered the the dutch leader gloated that will never be the and news democracy is still across the world there are leaders eagerly anticipating the chance of on an entirely new version of us leadership or absence of in the far right believes the state is over china has been hedging for the perhaps concerned about the risk of a trade politics like business is about he thinks talk with dictators can instantly dissolve and approaches foreign affairs as zero sum game in which making great can mean demeaning its traditional friends his election makes the world a more dangerous place and also a more uncertain for it is too early to say precisely how those dangers will nor how the next us president will face up to elections
no election has a global impact to match a us presidential contest few white house races have been more bitter than the current one between trump and so any public official who intervenes in days before needs to be very sure what they are doing such interventions come bigger than the director announcement that the bureau is reopening its probe of private emails the potential impact is huge until last was looking on course to hand trump a decisive beating it may still happen but that is now all up in the appears to be that justice must be done and that he would be damned if he made the announcement and damned if he it is certainly true that us politics has become so and so riddled with paranoia that the director faced an unenviable choice if he had carried out the new investigation behind closed doors and it had only become public after the whatever the one or both sides would be certain to cry foul conspiracy theorists would have had a field day yet by making it public he makes the investigation itself into a issue in a contest that will shape not just but the world and is precisely why the us justice with which the has an established framework of rules designed to protect its impartiality from allegations of political bias the department puts strict limits on disclosures about ongoing investigations and especially on anything that might be seen as influencing an election a memorandum to this effect has been issued by a succession of us attorneys general every four including in has broken with this former justice department officials from both political parties have denounced him for this over the weekend the current attorney general is believed to have advised against has also compounded the potential abuse of power in two important ways the investigation is at an embryonic stage it may go no further in his announcement he spoke of emails appear to be to the previous investigation he completed concluding then that there was no case to answer in the summer but the emails come from a separate may not even be from at all and the chief has not read them his phrasing was extraordinarily vague has thus launched his missile with minimum facts and maximum innuendo there are echoes of police blunders over child sex allegations even louder are the echoes of fanatics like judicial watch this strikes at the democratic not just should not have deferred to as he did last week the investigation and prosecution processes should be kept rigorously apart from politics especially true at election time and even more necessary in such a and acrimonious polity as the us congress has become one of the recipients of announced even before the move that he intends to begin oversight hearings into as soon as she is if she is incredible though it may seem to the outside world and many impeachment efforts by republicans against are already a serious possibility law enforcement officials have to be completely scrupulous in such a world has not been it is a step towards a lawless is in many respects the author of her own problems on the email row but took exactly the wrong decision if the emails needed he should have one behind closed carried it out reported it to prosecutors and made an if one was in the fullness of time this is called due process and it is a bulwark of the rule of not rule by politicians least of all rule by a potential tyrant like has a venomous contest just when trump was desperate for a just when republican candidates in other races were craving something to their voters and just when some media were becoming bored with the predictability of the white house contest his action was at best naive and at worst an abuse of office it have rather less effect on the election outcome than some suppose yet it is no consolation that has also guaranteed if no charges are he will inevitably be accused of rigging the elections
asserts that vigorous exchange of goods and is the greatest engine of prosperity the world has ever meets the new special had he prefaced his remark with fair and vigorous i might have agreed with him as it his comment is a meaningless mantra prosperity for for a but not for millions of people in former manufacturing and mining or for most people in those countries to which manufacturing and mining jobs have been floats a scare story about hugely escalating costs of goods in the absence of free trade let me ask him would he support the free trade of goods produced by because it would make things even i assume he but does he support those same goods being produced by people effectively in forced paid seemingly because that is the reality of much of current trade should be welcomed it is innovative and efficient but the unfettered free trade we have based largely upon who can pay least to those producing our is not fair trade it has run its course it has failed almost everyone and it is time the left woke up to that fact and grabbed the initiative from the far who have been allowed to benefit from the legitimate anger and frustration of ordinary a key lesson we need to draw from election is that toxic trade deals like the agreement are as unwanted in society as in trump cynically exploited public anger about these deals to win the us presidency but we like that trump is actually in of and putting profit before people his policies will not serve the interests of they will simply divide them and create the sorts of international tensions in previous sparked world was killed off by a movement of ordinary people who believe in an equal and democratic society where diversity is embraced and rights are respected we objected to because it would be bad for ordinary people and will hand power to big money to businessmen like know that politicians are now fearful of opposing deals like the deal which is currently making its way through the parliament this is exactly the wrong lesson to pull from election to defeat the politics of racism and hatred represented by trump and the far right in we call on politicians to support economic policies that will benefit the majority of eradicate create decent jobs and good public services and halt climate change the first step politicians in must take is to vote to stop in the coming mark molly your report bad jokes test fearful sense of referring to the north free trade agreement when it says devised in which impoverished interior and sent millions north seeking but far from being a unilateral imposition by was a devised by the administration and concluded after long and arduous bilateral negotiations while its regional and sectoral impact can be debated migration to the north long antedated the agreement in recent net migration has in fact on benefited in part by codifying the economic relationship and curbing unilateralism which is why trump wants to tear it up and the are justifiably professor how can you claim to be the leading voice for free trade sets out stall for place in if you are proposing to leave the largest free trade area in order to if you a series of more preferential and therefore discriminatory bilateral arrangements with is this global the new economic policy where we will embrace the opportunities of the future is the old smoke and mirrors the prime minister seems to have overlooked the fact that most of the large companies are owned by foreign investors where will their loyalties not with the workers but with their global shareholders wake we are in huge debt to companies take the profits from our car and the sovereign fund owns a large part of regent street in we can take the but it will be to the advantage of global not

another day closer to the presidential another slew of surveys most of them showing that is in the lead but the size of the democratic advantage varies considerably from poll to partly because some questionnaires ask voters to consider the fact that there are more than two presidential nominees green party candidate stein is on the ballot in states and voters in another three states can choose to write her name in and the libertarian candidate is on the ballot in who are feeling turned off by the two most unpopular candidates in might be considering a protest vote for one of these other parties in the sense that candidates have a less than chance of with just four days to go until the they might be wondering who will be hindered more by a protest vote democrat or republican with all of the articles i have written so far about polling the answer is a very the impact of protest votes varies throughout the country in states can probably be viewed as states based on the fact that one of the candidates is leading by at least seven percentage points numbers are polling averages collected by real clear when analysts talk about the electoral map working in they are referring to the fact that of these states the district of look like vote democratic and together worth of the electoral college votes needed to win the presidency based on the same threshold of trump can only count on college votes more there are states in the us that can be viewed as competitive based on the fact that six percentage points or less separate and trump some of these states are unlikely to swing the entire because they have many electoral college votes is one such although trump has a narrow the state is only worth three electoral college votes so has little power in changing the national result twitter how does the us electoral college a quick guide to where voting for a third party could affect which of the two main candidates wins based on a close race places where and trump are close in the and state influence electoral college votes or more but if the race ends up being very the reality will be that every electoral college vote will matter to trump and and states like and new will become for voters who consider a trump win their these are states where choosing a candidate could help secure a republican of electoral college is ahead by percentage trump stein early ballots suggest that turnout has which is good news for nearly one in five eligible voters in is and they typically lean heavily democrat with such razor thin votes in this state for and stein that could have gone to will do real damage to the democrats nationally of electoral college is ahead by three percentage trump stein of electoral college is ahead by percentage trump stein of electoral college is ahead by percentage trump stein of electoral college trump is ahead by percentage trump the black vote is crucial for in this state while of the total us population is black or in that share is according to the census bureau it looks like will lose this not least because early ballots suggest black turnout has fallen considerably in of electoral college is ahead by two percentage trump stein of electoral college is ahead by percentage trump stein of electoral college trump is ahead by four percentage trump stein of electoral college is ahead by percentage trump stein of electoral college is ahead by six percentage trump stein elections
appearing on that most revered of presidential forums called trump released a video this week describing his plans to great again for and i mean learned not to believe magnanimous but others really want told on that we should give trump opportunity to develop the positive objectives that he may and told an audience in that he wants be respectful of the office and give the an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every forgive because about to pop off have you lost all sense of you and talk as if we have no idea who trump is or what he has been saying for months on end but trump has made it abundantly clear opportunistic words of inclusion notwithstanding that his administration will be loyal to the fringes of the united leaving even the republican establishment running behind announced cabinet choices simply leave no room for imagining a gentler at the helm of the those of us concerned about the fate of the undocumented or the environment or reproductive rights see much reason to worry with the selection of mike and general t to inner circle list reads like a roll call to the dick fan among many other troubling all these men also share a deep antipathy to views are as scary and they are well known pick for national security adviser has called a and stated that is a political that behind this notion of it being a that is not talking about the that republicans frequently invoke but about asked about current republican national committee chair and designated chief of staff told news that are some aspects of the faith that are very i realize that was a scholar of or perhaps even a a renewer of the faith according to popular comes to revive the practice of for following generations or maybe he just said an ignorant thing that would sound bigoted if it were about another religion but today sounds like comments are troubling rather than enabling establishment republicans as a moderating influence on the the trump administration is pulling the traditional down its own giving less extreme republicans about as much voice in this new administration as chair actually worse at least the chair had the good sense to stay quiet my worry extends beyond the realm of what this administration says and reaches into what it will do building a wall on the border is a near physical impossibility the immediate deportation of millions of people is much harder to execute than it sounds but the that can and most likely will secretary of state another hardliner who is in the running for homeland security recently met with trump and was photographed holding his strategic plan for first openly in his hands nobody give this man the nuclear plain for the world to see was the of an useless program of the bush administration officially called and more commonly known as i remember vividly the panic and confusion among the of new city when special registration was first enacted in this which required visa holding men from countries and north to register with the was a massive failure even the own auditor found the program to be ineffective and a huge waste of resources the cost to taxpayers was more than a year and the program alienated around the world from the united states families were torn apart because of special and the brilliant program netted a grand total of zero terrorism registration was useful only as a tool to disrupt average lives and to spend a lot of money needlessly it served no security function and trump is considering reviving it we can assume because it will make this government like doing on the backs of ordinary then this justifying a registry on fox trump surrogate positively invoked internment as a legal precedent for the program that heinous comparison led the new times to publish an by a law professor reassuring us even if the legal decision authorizing internment has never been we be worried because the judiciary now sees the legal justification for internment as constitutional that whole exercise is nuts the question is not about the constitutionality of internment the question is why the hell are we talking about internment are we seriously working through the legal likelihood or unlikelihood of holding large numbers of completely innocent people in detention racial hysteria led us down that road once to say that panic lead us down a similarly treacherous with or without a legal precedent beginning to feel like one major terrorist attack from martial law in this and the new administration even taken office yet a fiction in the us that is frequently promoted by the likes of fox news and that had a major impact on this election the notion is that in our multicultural white get theirs while every minority and special interest group gets extra privileges the idea cultivates a mood of bitterness and even if fundamentally untrue many honestly believe that are getting special privileges that some accept will lead to the imposition of sharia law in this country but this is ludicrous want special privileges we just want to be treated the same way that everyone else is treated going to get special registration hardly a fair need more than assurances from trump that thinking about the whole country when he invokes we need to know that equality under the law will be guaranteed under his administration in what we really need to be doing is proving to all that everyone deserves to be treated equally while acknowledging all of our and that the kind of equality that makes for a stronger until that day every one of us needs to be popping off while we because if we there may come a time when popping off is not just useless but illegal pop everywhere you whenever you can pop all afternoon and evening pop all
j trio of selections on served notice that he intends not only to reverse eight years of liberal domestic policies but also to overturn decades of bipartisan consensus on the united proper role in world affairs trump is moving quickly to realize his promise of a nation that relentlessly enforces immigration and drug views with deep war ii and sends suspected terrorists to bay or secret prisons to be interrogated with methods that have been banned as torture at a time when cities have been inflamed by racial police shootings and fears over homegrown trump made no conciliatory gestures toward or residents of all of whom he disparaged during his campaign in his first major national security selections so far senator republican of for attorney representative mike republican of for and gen t for national security adviser trump sent a clear message that he does not intend to use these personnel choices to build bridges to democrats or the moderate and traditionally conservative republicans who opposed the nationalist overtones of his presidential campaign the reaction from democrats was swift and sulfurous senator warren of demanded that trump withdraw while senator booker of new jersey charged that some of choices had and demeaned has created a white house leadership that embodies the most divisive rhetoric of his senator of said trump swept into office promising to dispense with the political correctness of and his choices reflect that president w bush assembled a republican cabinet with a variety of shades of conservative including some members who challenged the president early decisions suggest he favors a cabinet that will echo his opinions the choices also suggest that on the perennially vexing question of how the government should balance security and civil trump will throw his weight firmly behind in matters of both and traditional law enforcement one of the most conservative defended authority to conduct wiretapping without a warrant after the sept attacks
