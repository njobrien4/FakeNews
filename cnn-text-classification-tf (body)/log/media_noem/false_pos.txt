william mcgurn wall street journal lets get this straight calling hillary clinton a bigot has reporters asking every republican in sight if donald trump has gone too far but the clinton campaign releases a video saying mr trump is the candidate of the ku klux klan and its all okey dokey then again mr trump has already been likened to hitler mussolini and stalin small wonder theres a collective ho hum when democratic vice presidential nominee tim kaine says mr trump is peddling kkk values this is what democrats do it didnt start with mr trump either for years democrats have portrayed the gop as one giant hate group each presidential election the drill goes like this after republicans nominate someone he immediately finds himself having to prove hes not a hater of african americans of women of gays etc this year democrats added a twist mr trump they claim represents a break with all those decent and lovable republicans such as mitt romney john mccain and george w bush of course this isnt what they were saying back when these men were running for president in for example an naacp ad recreated the gruesome murder of james byrd to imply that then gov bush was sympathetic to lynching black men over footage of a chain being dragged by a pickup truck mr byrds daughter says so when gov george w bush refused to support hate crimes legislation it was like my father was killed all over again when john mccain ran in barack obama warned that republicans would scare people by saying you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills the mccain campaign fired back accusing mr obama of playing the race card from the bottom of the deck funny thing all those reporters always hearing dog whistles from republicans somehow didnt hear this one in when mitt romney went to the naacp and told them face to face about his opposition to obamacare the stories were all about how he was really just trolling for the racist vote vice president joe biden put it more explicitly telling a largely african american audience that if mr romney were to win hed put yall back in chains the only difference today is that republicans now have a nominee giving as good as he gets

posted on november american renaissance november not even the front national is prepared to act in his classic study democracy in america alexis de tocqueville wrote about southerners attitudes towards the rapidly expanding population of blacks in the states of the south they are quiet they do not speak about the future to foreigners they avoid explaining themselves with their friends everyone is in denial about it even with themselves there is something more frightening about the silence of the south than the noisy fears of the north almost two centuries later there is a similar attitude of denial among french politicians about the steady afro islamization of france conservatives are happy to talk about islamic totalitarianism secularism burkinis etc but not the underlying problem which is continued muslim immigration socialists recognize the problem in private but do nothing either to stop the flood of africans and muslims there is something surreal about the situation the most striking example of awareness combined with inactivity was provided recently by the publication of a book of exclusive interviews with our painfully uncharismatic and ineffectual president the socialist franois hollande among mr hollandes statements one finds on conservative politician nadine moranos saying that france is a country of the white race i am convinced that when one asks the french the majority have her position they think we are for the most part whites there are more whites than others on islamic immigration there are at the same time things which work very well and the accumulation of potential bombs linked to a continuous immigration because it continues on the salience of race in politics the left cannot win on the theme of identity but it can lose on the theme of identity on ethnic segregation and potential civil war how can we avoid partition because that is really what is happening partition mr hollande recognizes that integration let alone assimilation is not happening and that at some point immigration will have to stop and yet during his four years as president he has done nothing to stop it instead his government has radically increased the rate of naturalizations of foreigners providing the flagging socialists with thousands of new voters in time for national elections next spring on the right we have the conservative party now called les rpublicains led by former president nicolas sarkozy he knows racial problems well having made a career from a sort of low level race baiting while as president actually letting more immigrants settle in france than his socialist predecessors mr sarkozy is also well aware of the medium term existential threat to france as he said recently at a political meeting the sahel will in years have million inhabitants there are to children per family on average in the sahel can we continue family reunification in these conditions is the future of the sahels children to end up in our cities neighborhoods even though we have no jobs no housing and we no longer have the means to pay benefits for families who do not pay one cent in taxes well said but can mr sarkozy claim to have been unaware of these facts while he was president from to the end of family reunification would be welcome but in the face of the demographic threat to france and all of europe this is like fending off a rhinoceros with a water pistol other than this mr sarkozy has mainly been trying to win the conservative party primaries by complaining about burkinis and demanding assimilation however as a former adviser patrick buisson a rightist who recently published a book on his disenchantment with mr sarkozyhas said he is ready to say what is needed to get elected and to then do nothing french police ask a woman to remove some of her clothing to comply with a ban on burkinis the gravity of the situation is matched only by the sheer fecklessness of european politicians according to united nations statistics the population of europe will stagnate and decline this century while that of africa is set to quadruple to a whopping billion the most important tragic horrifying ungodly evil question facing western civilization and mankind this century is this will europe turn african books warning against islamization whether by journalists or second rate politicians top the best seller lists but most french people care more about welfare and pay checks than long term considerations even on economic issues they would rather stay in denial vaguely hoping the problems of a heavily state run french economy in an inefficient eurozone monetary union will sort themselves out on their own rather than ask hard questions ethno religious questions are even more inconceivable it is true that diversity is not yet an unmanageable problem in the daily lives of most frenchmen aside from the unpleasant evening news about muslims shooting up hundreds of people at a rock concert running down dozens of people with a truck on bastille day or trying to burn policemen to death incidentally the last time frances religious homogeneity was brokenduring the protestant reformationthis led to a civil war between catholics and protestants we are told that mass government surveillance abrogation of civil liberties and mass murder by the fanatics of a middle eastern religion are the price we pay for enjoying the fruits of diversity and if you dont like it you will join the scores of european patriots who have been fined and even jailed under anti free speech laws for inciting hatred nonetheless the current offering for next springs presidential elections in france is dismal besides mr hollande and mr sarkozy with whom the french are thoroughly disenchanted there is the frontrunner in the conservative primaries alain jupp a felon guilty of misusing public funds who is proud of frances diversity he speaks of frances new happy identity and is being called a steady serious candidatewho will change nothing as mayor of bordeaux he noted that percent of the students in some

trending articles trending articles source the independent fbi director james comey reportedly ignored the advice of attorney general loretta lynch who urged him not to thrust the controversy over hillary clintons emails back into headlines less than a fortnight from election day us department of justice officials democrats and even some republicans were said to be aghast at the timing of the fbis announcement on friday that it was reviewing a fresh cache of emails which mr comey said may be pertinent to the investigation into ms clintons use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state according to a report from the new yorker ms lynch expressed her preference that mr comey uphold the justice department longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election the fbi director however said that he felt compelled to do otherwise writing in the washington post former justice department spokesman matthew miller said mr comeys decision was a troubling violation of long standing justice department rules or precedent conduct that raises serious questions about his judgment and ability to serve as the nations chief investigative official the emails were discovered in connection with an unrelated case the fbi director wrote in a letter to republican congressional committee chairs on friday that separate case it later emerged concerns disgraced former congressman anthony weiner who is under investigation for allegedly sending explicit messages to a year old girl in north carolina mr weiner is the estranged husband of ms clintons closest aide huma abedin and the emails were found on one or more electronic devices belonging to the couple which had been seized as part of the weiner probe the fbi is now investigating whether those emails contained any classified information
trending articles trending articles source michael krieger liberty blitzkrieg yesterday the wall street journal published a fascinating and troubling article detailing how aggressively the department of injustice moved to stymie efforts of fbi agents who wanted to investigate pay to play criminality with regard to the clinton foundation of course none of this should come as a surprise the justice department under president obama never met a powerful person it cared to prosecute indeed under eric holders crony reign its been apparent for a very long time that senior leadership at the doj see the institutions primary role to be the coddling and protection of oligarch criminals especially those in the financial sector the death of the rule of law in america otherwise known as the two tier justice system has been a key topic of mine since the very beginning in fact i think it is the number one cancer plaguing our society at this time as i warned in the post new report the united states sharp drop in economic freedom since driven by decline in rule of law in my opinion the u s is living on borrowed time the entrepreneurial spirit is still very much alive and a lot of innovative things are happening in the tech area but other than that the u s economy looks very much like a third word oligarchy from my perspective we need to reinstate the rule of law at once the bad actors amongst the rich and powerful will continue to feast relentlessly on the productive parts of the economy so long as they they are never held accountable for their crimes simply put the rule of law must be restored immediately when it comes to the restoration of the rule of law there is simply no time to waste the rule of law has not been restored a realization that is consistently reenforced by the lengths to which the department of justice goes to protect the powerful yesterdays wsj article gives us an additional glimpse into how that happens behind the scenes here are a few excerpts from the article fbi in internal feud over hillary clinton probe the surprise disclosure that agents from the federal bureau of investigation are taking a new look at hillary clintons email use lays bare just days before the election tensions inside the bureau and the justice department over how to investigate the democratic presidential nominee the new investigative effort disclosed by fbi director james comey on friday shows a bureau at times in sharp internal disagreement over matters related to the clintons and how to handle those matters fairly and carefully in the middle of a national election campaign even as the probe of mrs clintons email use wound down in july internal disagreements within the bureau and the justice department surrounding the clintons family philanthropy heated up according to people familiar with the matter new details show that senior law enforcement officials repeatedly voiced skepticism of the strength of the evidence in a bureau investigation of the clinton foundation sought to condense what was at times a sprawling cross country effort and according to some people familiar with the matter told agents to limit their pursuit of the case the probe of the foundation began more than a year ago to determine whether financial crimes or influence peddling occurred related to the charity some investigators grew frustrated viewing fbi leadership as uninterested in probing the charity these people said others involved disagreed sharply defending fbi bosses and saying mr mccabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the justice department and fbi agents pursuing the clinton foundation case los angeles agents had picked up information about the clinton foundation from an unrelated public corruption case and had issued some subpoenas for bank records related to the foundation these people said the washington field office was probing financial relationships involving mr mcauliffe before he became a clinton foundation board member these people said mr mcauliffe has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer has said the probe is focused on whether he failed to register as an agent of a foreign entity in february fbi officials made a presentation to the justice department according to these people by all accounts the meeting didnt go well some said that is because the fbi didnt present compelling evidence to justify more aggressive pursuit of the clinton foundation and that the career anticorruption prosecutors in the room simply believed it wasnt a very strong case others said that from the start the justice department officials were stern icy and dismissive of the case that was one of the weirdest meetings ive ever been to one participant told others afterward according to people familiar with the matter anticorruption prosecutors at the justice department told the fbi at the meeting they wouldnt authorize more aggressive investigative techniques such as subpoenas formal witness interviews or grand jury activity but the fbi officials believed they were well within their authority to pursue the leads and methods already under way these people said according to a person familiar with the probes on aug a senior justice department official called mr mccabe to voice his displeasure at finding that new york fbi agents were still openly pursuing the clinton foundation probe during the election season mr mccabe said agents still had the authority to pursue the issue as long as they didnt use overt methods requiring justice department approvals the justice department official was very pissed off according to one person close to mr mccabe and pressed him to explain why the fbi was still chasing a matter the department considered dormant others said the justice department was simply trying to make sure fbi agents were following longstanding policy not to make overt investigative moves that could be seen as trying to influence an election those rules discourage investigators from making any such moves before a primary or general election and at a minimum checking with
email with protests erupting across the country this week and emotions running high american companies are trying to make sense of how to react to a trump presidential election win but one major company has clearly made up its mind and just came down squarely in the anti trump camp in a big way donald trump will be added to disneys hall of presidents but his animatronic figure will be able to feel pain wow disney just showed that it does not pull punches when it comes to what the company believes in check out the press release they put out this morning disney prides itself on promoting inclusivity empathy and non violence which are values that mr trumps presidency threatens thats why when we eventually add him to our hall of presidents exhibit in disney worlds magic kingdom his mechanical replica will bear the capacity to suffer horribly and without limit being a company that caters to diverse families we felt it was a moral responsibility to have mr trumps robotic counterpart be receptive to extreme thirst and burning sensations while also being wired with the knowledge that it can never receive the sweet mercy of death this is the best way for us to uphold the hall of presidents tradition while also voicing our vigorous objection to the trump administration given that disneys software makes the animatronic believe its bones are shattering each time it moves or speaks this company clearly wants people to know its not onboard the trump train park visitors who feel similarly opposed to trumps presidency can rest assured that his hall of presidents double will be designed to experience anxiety so its always aware that more pain is coming although the machine will understand what joy is its programming will never allow it to feel that and disneys not letting trump off the hook there the replicas for abraham lincoln and george washington will even be reprogrammed to slap scratch and pry the fingernails off the animatronic trump which will respond to such painful stimuli by gasping crying screaming vomiting or a mix of all of these if that doesnt send a powerful statement about where disney stands politically we dont know what does its safe to say we wont see the trumps vacationing there anytime soon dont share disneys disdain for a trump presidency you may be better off heading to space mountain instead of the hall of presidents because disney has officially drawn the battle line right there
november for many americans nov was a time of shock at the surprise election of donald trump but the distress was perhaps strongest in new york city which knows trump best writes michael winship i would just as soon forget the morning after my father was nearly killed in a car accident and i heard my sister in her bedroom cry out as our mother told her i would just as soon forget the morning after my fathers store burned to the ground set ablaze after someone living next door to it fell asleep smoking or the morning the pay phone on my college dormitory floor rang and it was my mother telling me my father had died i would just as soon forget the morning after election day i was on the campaign staff of democratic presidential candidate george mcgovern i had spent the last couple of weeks in connecticut they told us we would lose the state by around votes but we put our shoulders to the wheel and managed to lose it by more than a quarter of a million richard nixon beat us everywhere but massachusetts and the district of columbia people knew about watergate by then but didnt yet care very much it was a cold rainy drive back to washington while im at it id like to forget the morning after john lennon was murdered in december another cold rainy day all of manhattan was in shock i took the subway up to street and walked to the dakota the apartment building where lennon lived and died fans stood on the sidewalks soaked holding radios and tape players blasting his music leaving sodden flowers and guttering candles on the doorsteps and windowsills and of course the morning of and the morning after and the morning after that i live a mile and a half from ground zero and saw the towers burn the day after we were sealed off from the rest of the city streets closed to everything but emergency traffic the smells of burning of melted metal and other horrors intermittently filled the air as they would for weeks to come finally i would just as soon forget wednesday morning of this very week nov donald trump made his victory speech around a m a few hours later as daylight broke the sky was overcast with a bit of rain and much of new york had fallen into the pained silence of a deep funk some compared it to the citys mood after but no in there were almost immediate feelings of defiance and resolve mixed with the loss and sadness now there was just bewildered numbness a physical ache rejection in the big apple but a couple of things buoyed me for one donald trump lost new york city and new york state big time here in manhattan he received only percent of the vote sure active democrats outnumber republicans in the borough by more than to but from where i sit percents a number for losers donald trump speaking with supporters in phoenix arizona june i know feeling good about that statistic is a bit of a stretch given the grand scheme of things but that piddling percent is a reminder that people who live in manhattan know donald trump better than the general population of anywhere else in the country and we voted no loudly maybe we should have been more vocal about this during the election sent platoons of manhattanites out into the rest of the country telling people just what its been like to live with this guy for the past four plus decades the bragging and lies the crass excesses and raging misogyny the bankruptcies the high rise real estate developments that have contributed to both our gross income inequality and the staggering property costs that increasingly force everyone but the very wealthiest out of their homes and small businesses we could have told them about and how trump went after five teenagers of color falsely accused of raping a woman jogger in the citys central park how he took out full page newspaper ads calling for a return to the death penalty as punishment how even after the five were exonerated on the basis of solid dna evidence and another mans confession he refused to apologize and continued to insist on their guilt and we could have told them what its really like to live on this island of diverse nationalities and ethnicities of many religions and gender orientations and the resulting incredible variety of food fashion music and art how once youre unavoidably and insistently immersed in our differences more often than not theyre a cause for celebration and not fear and hate a lesson yet to be learned by our resident president elect who lives in a tower high above such things but we can hope i feel good too that by the end of the day on wednesday demonstrators had gathered at the trump international hotel on columbus circle a couple of blocks from our offices that thousands more gathered in union square downtown and that all of them marched toward trump tower on fifth avenue carrying placards and shouting in protest similar actions took place in cities across the nation and continue as i write condemning those marches and sounding more like the sheriff of nottingham than his real job sheriff of milwaukee county wisconsin right wing trump surrogate david a clarke tweeted these temper tantrums from these radical anarchists must be quelled there is no legitimate reason to protest the will of the people sorry sheriff dissent is alive and well get used to it these next four years in my lifetime weve managed to survive richard nixon ronald reagan and two bushes in the white house trump has an excellent chance at being worse than all of them combined well see its going to be challenging and often frightening i fear there will be plenty more terrible mornings ahead
november while there is hope that president trump will end the bloody years of u s adventurism abroad the initial shock from his victory could diminish americas standing in the world says ex cia analyst paul r pillar the impact of the election result on the standing of the united states in the world has too many aspects to encapsulate or even in this early stage of shock to comprehend this is particularly so with a president elect who will have to construct a foreign policy largely unguided by previous thinking on his part that exhibits consistency and coherence beyond a few themes such as discontent with free loading allies admiration for powerful autocrats and conceiving of economic relations in zero sum mercantilist terms president barack obama delivers remarks during his address to the united nations general assembly in new york n y sept but we can already note some aspects of americas global standing that are related to the election itself and the campaign that preceded it these aspects involve damage that already has been done and that the result of the election punctuates and extends some of the damage stems from the xenophobic content of mr trumps campaign with the disparagement or what many overseas will take to be disparagement of major parts of humanity including among others the nearly quarter of the worlds population that is muslim that such a campaign was a winning campaign reveals the underlying views to be held by much more of america than the president elect himself the extent to which those views are held by americans who are deplorable or by americans who are merely discontented and easy prey for such themes matters less to overseas observers than the content of the views themselves this pattern hits the american image hard in a place where it hitherto has looked rather good many polls conducted overseas have yielded results that couple negative views of u s policies with positive feelings toward the american people perhaps the latter part of such results will start to become less pronounced a procedural black eye then there is the presidential selection process itself the election to the most powerful post in the world of someone who is by temperament and experience so manifestly unqualified to hold it will be taken by many as a failure of that process donald trump and mike pence during day three of the republican national convention and mr trump himself provided voluminous rhetoric during the campaign about how the process is rigged how he would not accept an unfavorable outcome and how if he won he would incarcerate his opponent amid references to second amendment solutions and the like a casual foreign observer only needed to listen to mr trump to conclude that americas claim to having an admirable liberal democratic process for choosing its leaders is false a more careful less casual foreign observer might discount mr trumps rhetoric as campaign bombast but would notice other disturbing things about the election it appears that mrs clinton won a plurality of the popular vote making this the second out of the last five u s presidential elections in which the popular vote winner was denied the white house foreign observers might not appreciate the background to why the electoral college exists but the disconnect between votes cast and offices won is even more apparent with the routine and blatant gerrymandering which has served as an incumbent protection device as well as enabling the republican party in recent years to hold a majority of seats in the house of representatives even while losing in total votes to the democrats on top of that are the comparably blatant efforts by one party to gain or hold office not just by winning votes but by suppressing voting by citizens deemed more likely to support the other party and on top of that in this election was the october surprise from the head of the top national law enforcement agency a development that in an election this close could well have made a difference in the outcome all of this is prime material for anyone overseas wanting to disparage american democracy regimes with that motivation have been having a field day iranian propaganda writers have had an easy time merely encouraging people to follow the u s election campaign on television vladimir putin didnt need to interfere in the u s political process to diminish any image advantage it has over his own the fact that the side that benefited from things such as voter suppression and comeys surprise won the u s political contest is what extends into the future the already inflicted damage to the image of american democracy that is in addition to this election demonstrating that in america a xenophobic campaign is a winner a victory by mrs clinton would have been seen overseas both as a repudiation of the xenophobia and as an overcoming by the political process of the irregularities if there is any possible offsetting advantage regarding what american democracy in action displays to others it is that we will be spared seeing republicans doing everything possible to frustrate a president clintons ability to govern the foreshadowing of such a scenario had the election result gone the other way was obvious there was much talk of impeachment which is supposed to be a remedy for high crimes and misdemeanors committed in office before the target even took office or won an election to the office victory for the saboteurs also as columnist richard cohen observed congressman jason chaffetz the chairman of what amounts to the permanent committee to investigate hillary was promising before the election to conduct investigations until the end of time or fox news loses interest whichever comes first sen john mccain r arizona and sen lindsey graham r south carolina appearing on cbsface the nation perhaps most stunning were the promises after republican refusal all year even to consider president obamas nominee to

from a very ancient democracy you see you mean it comes from a world of lizards no said ford who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been having finally had the coffee forced down him nothing so simple nothing anything like so straightforward on its world the people are people the leaders are lizards the people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people odd said arthur i thought you said it was a democracy i did said ford it is so said arthur hoping he wasnt sounding ridiculously obtuse why dont the people get rid of the lizards it honestly doesnt occur to them said ford theyve all got the vote so they all pretty much assume that the government theyve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want you mean they actually vote for the lizards oh yes said ford with a shrug of course but said arthur going for the big one again why because if they didnt vote for a lizard said ford the wrong lizard might get in got any gin what i said said ford with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice have you got any gin ill look tell me about the lizards ford shrugged again some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them he said theyre completely wrong of course completely and utterly wrong but someones got to say it if only this was a joke but here we are on the verge of a contest between the two least respected most distrusted candidates to run for office in modern political history and some people say these lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them if there is any solace at all in this years selection cycle it is that as the report has been pointing out since the very day of its inception there is absolutely nothing at stake here the presidential figureheads are mere puppets false fronts for the shadow government and deep state that commands and controls the military economic and diplomatic machinery of the us led world empire do you really think the oligarchs put their entire system up on the chopping block every four years hoping against hope that the public doesnt use the dreaded ballot box to vote them out of power dashing decades of carefully cultivated enslavement with pencils and touchscreens just in case anyone dislikes rhetorical questions let me answer that one for you no no they do not but dont take my word for it take emma goldman as shes been reputed to have said if voting changed anything theyd make it illegal or take h l mencken who in his usual inimitable fashion quipped the stateor to make the matter more concrete the governmentconsists of a gang of men exactly like you and me they have taking one with another no special talent for the business of government they have only a talent for getting and holding office their principal device to that end is to search out groups who pant and pine for something they cant get and to promise to give it to them nine times out of ten that promise is worth nothing the tenth time it is made good by looting a to satisfy b in other words government is a broker in pillage and every election is a sort of advance auction sale of stolen goods or take lysander spooner who wrote the principle that the majority have a right to rule the minority practically resolves all government into a mere contest between two bodies of men as to which of them shall be masters and which of them slaves a contest that however bloody can in the nature of things never be finally closed so long as man refuses to be a slave or wendy mcelroy who reminds us that voting is not an act of political freedom it is an act of political conformity those who refuse to vote are not expressing silence they are screaming in the politicians ear you do not represent me this is not a process in which my voice matters i do not believe you yes voting is worse than a dead end its less effective than bashing your head against a wall in a vain attempt to cure your headache its more pathetic than allowing the oligarchs into your kitchen and then begging for a scrap of food from your own table it is evil immoral and contemptible it is the act of a slave who has internalized that slavery so thoroughly that he wants to ensure that everyone around him is enslaved too but as i pointed out in yesterdays conversation with larken rose if there is any bright spot in all of this it is that your vote doesnt matter anyway and will not change anything at all it will not even register as a protest as some would like to believe since the elections are rigged and the votes arent counted so if you are so inclined knock yourself out cast a ballot but instead of sitting back and feeling good about yourself for having done this senseless meaningless and immoral act can we at least agree to use the next days to do something actually productive i leave it entirely up to you how to interpret the phrase actually productive but if youd allow me to offer some humble suggestions find join or create a community organization or freedom cell with a
podcast play in new window download embed your vote is statistically meaningless and will not sway the election your vote is strategically meaningless and decides nothing about the future of the country your vote is useless as the election is rigged anyway but as larken rose of larkenrose com reminds us what really matters is that voting is immoral legitimizing a system of authoritarian control and empowering the oligarchs who created the system and control its results happy selection day
email even amidst the bluster lies and anger unleashed by the presidential electionthe last of these captured this morning in a vivid photo essay in germanys leading daily the s ddeutsche zeitung i often hear the calming strains of one of johann sebastian bachs most famous arias sheep may safely graze the first duty of the president we are often told by the candidates is the security of the american people in this piece bach presents a sonic vision of safety secured by enlightened leadership above a pulsing b flat drone whose static harmony conveys contented repose a pair of pastoral recorders waft over an untroubled landscape this is artfully managed nature with no suggestion of the horrors of the wild nowhere the menace of danger there are no armies or terrorists massing beyond the verdant hills when after two bars of instrumental introduction the drone breaks into a gentle gait it is not done to worry the listener but to lift the eyes and ears over welcome fields in just four graceful measures bach has painted an expansive tranquil canvas over these bachian fields floats the soprano voice of pales the roman deity of shepherds sheep may safe graze when watched over by a good shepherd where rulers govern well peaceful calm is to be felt that makes a country happy ruling your subjects well is like animal husbandry manage the flock be concerned competent and watchful let your charges nibble and roam but never too far towards unknown perils we may have the notorious bundy gang getting let off federal conspiracy and weapons charges after its attempt at an armed takeover of huge stretches of the american landscape but bachs aria nonetheless projects a pursuit of happiness that can readily be transposed from its premiere on february rd in a castle banqueting hall set in the green hills of central germany to the land of the free on october little more than a week before election day heard today the aria confirms that what americans want most is a nice lawn a pet or two and to be left in peace in the three centurys since its first performance the aria has proliferating in myriad transcription and arrangements the most famous of them by the visionary italian piano virtuoso f erruccio busoni given the works graceful beauty it is not surprising that in one version or another its a favorite at weddings having played the thing countless times for nuptial proceedings i can assert that its popularity indicates that security and stability not passion are the enduring foundation of the institution of marriage and in turn therefore of american democracy the aria texts praising male rule remains unheard in these instrumental transcriptions and the wedding pairs remain blissful ignorant of it this best of bach track comes from the so called hunt cantata composed for the thirty first birthday of duke christian of saxe weienfels he loved music but even more hunting a proclivity captured by bach in his musical tribute at his own wedding the previous year duke christians distant relative the mighty saxon elector and polish king frederick the strong had had his jewelers the miraculous dinglinger brothers fashion a lavish hunting cup that he presented to the couple and which is now to be marveled at in dresdens famous museum the gr nes gewlbe bachs music was meant to match this level of opulence and artifice one which even minor german princes like christian enjoyed but hunting was not just a topic for artistic representation at the hands of a dinglinger or a bach it was a dangerous pursuit especially since prevailing attitudes towards gun control and safety were almost as primitive as those held in america today musicians were not spared mortal danger the weienfels male alto and writer on music johann beer who was also among the funniest and most prolific of early german novelists got himself killed in a hunting accident with one of the dukes his colleague david heinrich garthoff who must have known bach came to the court as an oboist but got his lower lip shot off while hunting birds garthoff was a versatile musician and became the courts lipless organist lucky for us christian didnt hand bach a blunderbuss and command him into the fields when the composer visited the court for the dukes birthday festivities in otherwise we might have been deprived of hundreds of cantatas the goldberg variations the b minor mass and heaps of other hits and only a few misses both countess clinton and sir donald are all for protecting the gun rights of hunters so this is a movement both could get behind indeed its any gun lovers dream even if he didntor doesnthave a tenth of the arsenal of the duke at the arias start the obligatory horns fill the banqueting with tales of the days daring escapades taking down massive bucks beaten towards the hunting party so that the duke could dispatch these trophies to be at close range then the goddess diana sung by the famed german soprano pauline kellner unleashed her own dazzling vocal firepower shoots off a coloratura melisma on the very first syllable before listeners can even figure out what she was referring to though the hunting horns have left little doubt hunting is the passion of the gods she sings following that blast with a line that would make a fine bumper sticker for a ford f pick up on the back roads of upstate new york hunting is for heroes even if there had been rather too much of the above mentioned collateral damage among weienfels musicians this is bracing bipartisan defense of guns and game while the aria may indeed represent hilarys views on the second amendment she could use more than a little of the panache of bachs diana in getting her message out before we leave this hugely entertaining cantata lets listen quickly to the political lessons to be gleaned from the
email hafnarfjorur iceland the votes are in in a greater than expected turnout election results show that icelands pirate party has not come out in first place as earlier polls indicated might be the case they have however increased their size in the parliament fold but this will not be enough to steer iceland in their direction now its all about coalition building had they maintained those poll numbers from earlier this summer that would have given them the probable first choice to form a coalition government with either the left greens the social democrats or the center leftish bright future as it stands now they will need to band together something they all they agreed to consider during a pre election press conference the largest single party remains the corporate right independence party with or seats and which is now part of the governing coalition along with the center right progressive party this coalition is the same center right configuration which led iceland to financial disaster the flight of skilled doctors and other professionals and whose members were implicated in off shore money scams which led to the resignation earlier this year of their last pm from the progressive party causing these early elections and now to the formal resignation of their present pm just a few hours ago technically these two parties could form a party coalition along with the new regeneration party however regeneration leader benedikt j hanesson has said he wouldnt consider a coalition with the governing parties thus that particular scenario is doubted after years of political stagnation following the collapse of the economy and controversy over the panama papers leaking of wealthy icelanders involvement in tortola this new development reflects a growing widespread disgust at the traditional two party coalition rulers who have alternately or in pairs run the country for most of its years following icelands independence the ship is floundering and the present course is unsustainable the other numbers however are pointing to a change of course the pirates won giving them seats in the seat parliament the althing the left greens received the social democrats and bright future together they represent almost of the electorate these are the groups which began talking about joining forces this past week just before the election if a four party coalition is solidified then iceland becomes the second nation to have a viable pirate party within its government and the first to have it this close to the helm in the countrys governance the kingmakers could very well be regeneration a new center right grouping who won of the votes getting them seats they characterize themselves as liberal though the head was a long time supporter of the independence party before leaving this past year on the of october he said he wouldnt consider joining a coalition with the two headed ruling hydra of the independence and progressive parties were he instead to agree to an alliance with the four roughly left center left groups of which the pirates are a part then that would net a total of seats and a solid majority a five party coalition what does this all mean it means several things in the short run the helm of the icelandic political ship will remain loosely dominated by the independence party as the largest single grouping in the althingi but aside from that approximately of the electorate who arent swayed by anything but their loyalty to the ruling class the rest of the country is moving on they are actively exploring hitherto unheard of politics and considering broad coalition politics this may be the wave of the future or it may simply be a transitional era where loyalties are split and serious discussions about radical ideas like ownership of public resources occur openly as the public coalesces around a new dominant ideology in the long run things are changing and then there is this issue of a new constitution which was voted on and accepted by the public but which the ruling coalition simply ignored and shelved if that was now formally accepted then some serious changes may be in store for the owners of the country but today is only the day after and nothing has been decided yet so whats next well the new presidents job just got more complicated as he is the one who traditionally asks the leading party to form the new government and if they fail in securing a stable majority the next leading party would get a shot this was easier when the totals were generally in favor of one or the other of the two ruling groups now however a new multi party dynamic is at play who knows how the discussions are heading right now and which horses are being traded iceland has always been the most usamerican of the nordic countries but with tugs in both directions much like the island itself rent down the middle by volcanic cracks dividing the european and american tectonic plates these tugs are causing great tension as to which political direction the country should follow with history having taken them this far and a growing unease about the dominant parties corruption and rehashed free market rhetoric it appears iceland is not quite ready to jump ship and hand the wheel over to the pirates but they and their kind are looking better and better as each year passes and iceland drifts without a clear direction to prosperity and fairness in the long run that tectonic split in politics is getting wider and wider just like its geographical counterpart but it is the pirates who at least have captured the imagination of the people if they can convince the rest of the public that they are more seriously interested in governing than in luring edward snowden here and have more relevant meat and potato concerns beyond internet privacy then they may very well be the ultimate winners a few years down the road join the
email webster frequenting the bottom when a right wing cell from its inception at the heart of government now appears to the left of the leading candidate for president one knows that she is fishing on the shoreline of fascism from a democratic standpoint it doesnt get any worse even her challenger matching her stride for stride in vulgarian gut authoritarianism the two the janus faced expression of the class state at least does not demonize putin and russia as preparatory in her case to still wider confrontation including china as dangerously leading up to a catastrophic war or at first the breakdown of the international order the fbi from cops and robbers to reds and fellow subversives as television and popular opinion would have it was a spearhead for mccarthyism and a practical annex of the house un american activities committee those were the days from baby face nelson to the rosenbergs and now hardly chastened from its turbid past still the guardian of american innocence director comey makes one correct move to undo the legacy of j edgar hoover and the american political world falls apart i am not a fan of comeys for his initial exoneration of clinton in her use of a private server at state but surely this is an eye opener about how far the political spectrum has shifted to the far right whomever wins the election america digs itself deeper into the cesspool of hierarchical class differentiation wealth concentration a pervasive ideological atmosphere of solipsistic hatred at home for human difference rancid hegemony abroad for any who seek an alternative path to modernization away from the example of us petrifying capitalism this election reveals that america like a broken record is stuck playing over and over again the themes of domestic repression and foreign counterrevolution the ideal synthesis for the unilateral assertion of world power neither candidate nor major party distances itself from the latter goal comey perhaps against his will and ideological proclivities achieves standing here merely as he should by doing his duty the bipartisan consensus maneuvering in place to chastise him reveals the dark reality of a nation so devoted to denial and untruth possibly to cover over its sins of commission and omission that it has lost its way and falsified its original promised constitutional existence america is presently normless and has been since capitalism inaugurated its take off stage following the civil war and before that with institutionalized slavery internal genocidal expansion and cap in hand deference to political ideologues not adverse to compromise with if not actually representing vested interests scratch america from the democratic column transposed now to an enlarged banana republic wherein one can expect from either party and successful candidate enhanced features of an already ripening police state surveillance proscription total exclusion of viable methods measures and structural changes pointed toward democratization america will formally become what it already is a panicked response to the self realization of its nihilistic core of moral values and systemic attributesa nuclear armed goliath lacking soul and conscience and for that reason a menace to world peace and self renewal at home no comey by his actions is not the enemy but one who for the first time has put on his spectacles and looked around him there are some things that even an ardent patriot cannot stomach i recall how in the e g mississippi freedom summer the fbi would interrogate us try to sow doubts in the hearts of the demonstrators act as intimidators pure and simple combined with its undercover role in breaking up antiwar protests throughout the decade so i hardly have much hope that things have changed yet my hat is off to comey even if only to anger clinton force democrats into self protective mode and raise questions about the rotten stinking fish used to fertilize her and the partys position on war and peace capitalism and the clintons own mind boggling accumulation of personal wealthall of which is instinctively known by the public but unable to extricate from the mental prison of submerged guilt for totalitarian ways and practices we await the election a studied exercise in un freedom where tyranny of false consciousness defines the psychological mental set of america what adorno writing sixty six years ago called authoritarian submission a framework where the leadership principle comes to the foreground if it has not already parallels to the incipient stages of nazism are not an exaggeration and it is not a loud mouthed trump who is necessarily the greatest danger he is predominantly all surface it is clinton who plumbs the depths of arrogance ambition congealed militarism america r i p my new york times comment to its editorial james comeys big mistake follows comey acted honorably unlike hoover he is here depoliticizing the fbi the times has demonstrated such partiality to clinton in news selection as well as editorial opinion that it is hard to take its criticism seriously endorsement is one thing blind siding the other side quite different are not emails a legitimate area of investigation does not the public have the right to know especially in an election if there is no smoking gun this will redound to clintons benefit if there is yes it might change minds but what is wrong with that clinton invariably is treated with kid gloves even the initial issue the use of a private server to transact government business is forgotten rather than jump on comey why not revisit the whole questionwhich comey had originally dismissedof clintons valuing of transparency and from there her whole foreign policy framework and hostility in particular to putin and russia to criticize clinton does not necessarily make one an apologist for trump call the shots with equal endeavor responsible journalism requires no less
home world by mr charrington london england the high court decision today to deny the eu referendum result is a sign that we are not living in a democracy or a sovereign country today is a very sad day for democracy within the uk and theresa may a remain supporter is instrumental in denying the will of the british people to leave the eu dithering and delaying tactics through numerous delaying tactics and the installation of key government posts of remain campaign mps the brexit referendum was thwarted if the government had repealed the european communities act immediately the eu referendum result would be well on the way to materialising the total nonchalance and denial of the eu referendum result is firmly on theresa mays head and her appointment of hammond as chancellor of the exchequer was a further sign that may was not serious about the eu referendum result injustice the high court ruling today which is intrusive and false as well as being undemocratic is a further signal that we are currently not living in a sovereign nation and it is totally controlled by brussels during the eu referendum mps had their say mps campaigned and when it came to vote in the referendum they voted therefore parliament has already had a say in the eu referendum and by going to the high court these traitors have sought to annul a democratic vote which was held on june this ruling is a shameful reminder that britain has lost all sovereign status to the eu entity it is a sad day for democracy for the will of the people and ultimately for the country million people will vote on election day in these circumstances we must as a people show our displeasure at being circumvented by not voting during the next election for any mp or party who is eu centric this is not over

what donald trump just did is going to have social conservatives in a state of complete shock this is not what most social conservatives were expecting like millions of other americans i greatly celebrated when donald trump pulled off a miracle on election night but within a week of his stunning election victory many social conservatives already feel like they are being stabbed in the back on sunday minutes aired a post election interview with trump in which he explained that his stance on gay marriage is that it is settled and that he has no plans to try to overturn the supreme court decision legalizing it according to cnn this answer could leave conservatives worried for the first time since winning the election donald trump has weighed in on two of the most controversial social issues the supreme court has taken on ever gay marriage and abortion his answers could leave conservatives worried trump indicated hes fine with the high courts opinion legalizing same sex marriage and called it settled but committed to appointing justices who want to change the roe v wade ruling affirming abortion rights cnns article didnt fully capture the flavor of what trump actually said a mediaite article contained more extended quotes its irrelevant because it was already settled its law it was settled in the supreme court trump said bluntly on minutes i mean its done he continued these cases have gone to the supreme court theyve been settled and im fine with that you can see trump making these comments for yourself right here it is simply not accurate for trump to say that gay marriage is settled while roe v wade is not in the legal world nothing is ever really settled just like roe v wade trump could publicly commit to appointing supreme court justices that would overturn the legalization of gay marriage and without a doubt the people that elected him were counting on him to do something about it but the truth is that he doesnt want to do something about it donald trump is fine with gay marriage and so that political battle is now officially over for social conservatives gay marriage is one of the big three abortion and israel are the other two red line issues and since the election donald trump has also had some extremely disturbing remarks about israel in fact trump just told the wall street journal that a peace agreement that would permanently divide the land of israel into two states would be the ultimate deal and that he is very interested in trying to make that happen for humanitys sake could it be possible that social conservatives have been betrayed again could it be possible that donald trump was just another politician that was willing to say anything to get elected so far trump has not appointed any prominent evangelical christians to any important posts but it is being reported that trump is considering an openly gay man to represent the us at the united nations is considering a woman to run the republican party and an openly gay man to represent the us at the united nations moves that would inject diversity into a trump team the incoming president is considering richard grenell as united states ambassador to the united nations if picked and ultimately confirmed by the senate he would be the first openly gay person to fill a cabinet level foreign policy post grenell previously served as us spokesman at the u n under former president george w bushs administration and let us not forget that trump has already publicly sided with the transgender community in the bathroom warstrump who has spent his life in liberal new york city referred to lgbt republicans at the republican national convention and said during his campaign that transgender people should use whatever bathroom they feel comfortable using so did trump just use social conservatives to get elected just like george w bush did now that the election is over trump is even calling the clintons good peopleclinton did some bad things he said but added that ultimately the clintons are good people i dont want to hurt them i dont want to hurt them he said theyre theyre good people i dont want to hurt them and i will give you a very very good and definitive answer the next time we do minutes together is he serious that is like calling the nazis good people hillary clinton is the most corrupt politician that seen and no politician in america has done more to promote abortion than she has perhaps he has a different definition of good than the rest of us do of course a whole lot of social conservatives will get really upset when they read this article and at least a few will post comments staunchly defending donald trump and his positions on these issues i dont care who it is when our politicians come out in favor of gay marriage men using womens restrooms or permanently dividing the land of israel they deserve to be rebuked lets see if all of donald trumps new evangelical friends are willing to challenge him on these things my guess is that they will not be this is yet another sign that social conservatives and evangelical christians have fallen into great apostasy these days people just believe whatever they want to believe and they are doing whatever is right in their own eyes on monday we learned that one of the most popular christian bloggers in the entire country has come out as a lesbian doyle meltons brand new book is an oprah book club selection and she separated from her husband not too long ago and of course it turns out that there was a very good reason for separating from her husband she has decided that she is no longer a heterosexual at all and she has just announced that she is now dating female soccer star abby wambacha

donate noam chomsky speaks in buenos aires argentina on march by c j polychroniou truth out org on november donald trump managed to pull the biggest upset in us politics by tapping successfully into the anger of white voters and appealing to the lowest inclinations of people in a manner that would have probably impressed nazi propagandist joseph goebbels himself but what exactly does trump victory mean and what can one expect from this megalomaniac when he takes over the reins of power on january what is trump political ideology if any and is trumpism a movement will us foreign policy be any different under a trump administration some years ago public intellectual noam chomsky warned that the political climate in the us was ripe for the rise of an authoritarian figure now he shares his thoughts on the aftermath of this election the moribund state of the us political system and why trump is a real threat to the world and the planet in general c j polychroniou for truthout noam the unthinkable has happened in contrast to all forecasts donald trump scored a decisive victory over hillary clinton and the man that michael moore described as a wretched ignorant dangerous part time clown and full time sociopath will be the next president of the united states in your view what were the deciding factors that led american voters to produce the biggest upset in the history of us politics noam chomsky before turning to this question i think it is important to spend a few moments pondering just what happened on november a date that might turn out to be one of the most important in human history depending on how we react no exaggeration the most important news of november was barely noted a fact of some significance in itself on november the world meteorological organization delivered a report at the international conference on climate change in morocco which was called in order to carry forward the paris agreement of the wmo reported that the past five years were the hottest on record it reported rising sea levels soon to increase as a result of the unexpectedly rapid melting of polar ice most ominously the huge antarctic glaciers already arctic sea ice over the past five years is percent below the average of the previous years not only raising sea levels but also reducing the cooling effect of polar ice reflection of solar rays thereby accelerating the grim effects of global warming the wmo reported further that temperatures are approaching dangerously close to the goal established by along with other dire reports and forecasts another event took place on november which also may turn out to be of unusual historical significance for reasons that once again were barely noted on november the most powerful country in world history which will set its stamp on what comes next had an election the outcome placed total control of the government executive congress the supreme court in the hands of the republican party which has become the most dangerous organization in world history apart from the last phrase all of this is uncontroversial the last phrase may seem outlandish even outrageous but is it the facts suggest otherwise the party is dedicated to racing as rapidly as possible to destruction of organized human life there is no historical precedent for such a stand is this an exaggeration consider what we have just been witnessing during the republican primaries every candidate denied that what is happening is happening with the exception of the sensible moderates like jeb bush who said it all uncertain but we do have to do anything because we producing more natural gas thanks to fracking or john kasich who agreed that global warming is taking place but added that we are going to burn coal in ohio and we are not going to apologize for it the winning candidate now the president elect calls for rapid increase in use of fossil fuels including coal dismantling of regulations rejection of help to developing countries that are seeking to move to sustainable energy and in general racing to the cliff as fast as possible trump has already taken steps to dismantle the environmental protection agency by placing in charge of the epa transition a notorious climate change denier myron ebell trump top adviser on energy billionaire oil executive harold hamm announced his expectations which were predictable dismantling regulations tax cuts for the industry more fossil fuel production lifting obama temporary block on the dakota access pipeline the market reacted quickly shares in energy corporations boomed including the world largest coal miner peabody energy which had filed for bankruptcy but after trump victory registered a percent gain the effects of republican denialism had already been felt there had been hopes that the paris agreement would lead to a verifiable treaty but any such thoughts were abandoned because the republican congress would not accept any binding commitments so what emerged was a voluntary agreement evidently much weaker effects may soon become even more vividly apparent than they already are in bangladesh alone tens of millions are expected to have to flee from low lying plains in coming years because of sea level rise and more severe weather creating a migrant crisis that will make today pale in significance with considerable justice bangladesh leading climate scientist says that these migrants should have the right to move to the countries from which all these greenhouse gases are coming millions should be able to go to the united states and to the other rich countries that have grown wealthy while bringing about a new geological era the anthropocene marked by radical human transformation of the environment these catastrophic consequences can only increase not just in bangladesh but in all of south asia as temperatures already intolerable for the poor inexorably rise and the himalayan glaciers melt threatening the entire water supply already in

part what we make them by pushing blocking pressuring encouraging fighting reframing emphasizing organizing by rebecca solnit guardian co uk presidential elections are a form of madness that comes over us once every four years they fit the great man or woman narrative of history seducing us into forgetting how powerful we are they erase our memory of grassroots power direct democracy and civil society leaders beget followers people pin their hopes on one person and with that they seem to shed responsibility for anything beyond getting that one person into office or they wash their hands of any further involvement if its not their one person and so it is this time around with the election a matter of days away and the media engrossed in a fight to end all fights it sometimes seems as though weve lost sight of the powers that belong to us and not them and the responsibilities and possibilities that go with our power the intensely personal nature of this campaign and the particular danger of donald trump has created a kind of tunnel vision we forget our own influence the innumerable times weve swayed outcome which is not to say that the outcome is unimportant far from it many clinton supporters seem quietly confident of a win i am less complacent weve had enough surprises this year in britain in colombia to know that voters have a way of confounding those who observe them a trump presidency would be a terrible thing but a clinton victory would be far from an occasion to sigh with relief sit back and resume life as though the last few months had been a bad dream a clinton victory in fact would be just a starting point for a new kind of campaign a politician is not a given each one is in part what we make them by pushing blocking pressuring encouraging fighting reframing emphasizing organizing every election season we pretend that one person will have all the power and that whatever they promise up front is exactly who theyll be for better or worse we forget our own influence the innumerable times weve swayed outcomes such as the decision to veto the keystone xl pipeline we forget the way culture and activism set the norms for political decisions on matters such as same sex marriage rights election seasons erase the memory of movements that worked for years or decades outside and around below and above electoral politics they drown out the histories that matter how women got the vote how the civil rights movement progressed how the free trade area of the americas trade deal withered and died how the world trade organization was hobbled and its poorer member nations inspired to revolt by the great shutdown in seattle how fracking got banned in new york state how rape law has been radically revised in many ways and places thanks to feminist action and discourse in all these cases the people who we mislabel leaders only followed the will of the people to reiterate it matters who is president but what a president does has everything to do with what the people demand or refuse or do themselves and what the house and senate send them or sabotage mitt romney promised to build the keystone xl pipeline himself if elected republicans for the foreseeable future will be puppets of the fossil fuel industry democrats are not necessarily our friends or allies but they are sometimes politicians who can be pushed obama wavered on that pipeline for several years when he vetoed it it was not because of who he is but because of who we are we the members of a climate movement that organized educated campaigned blockaded and demonstrated for years building a powerful movement that the president has become so much more engaged with climate is a result what the movement did it educated us on the science made the case for the urgency and importance of action built global coalitions shed light on the ways climate is an economic and racial justice issue started innumerable campaigns to block pipelines divest implement efficiency and good design and shift to renewable resources a lot of other changes that matter have happened at the local level as cities regions and states have done great work on climate led by community organizers small groups and minor politicians youll never hear about the obama administration could have done much more if more of the people who elected him stuck around to push back against the corporations well organized conservatives and big money interests which is not to even raise the question of that administrations principles its more useful to ask what are our own if most of us do little or nothing about policies we deplore or ideals we praise the same will be true of a clinton administration if thats the one voters choose on tuesday the extent to which it serves the interests of people and our planet depends in part on the extent to which citizens apply pressure to it you may feel exhausted right now tired of a bruising cycle which has left no personal stone unturned but the truth is were at the beginning either of a period of sustained resistance against a racist misogynist deranged climate denier or a period of sustained action to push the first female president to deliver a genuinely progressive climate conscious agenda if we end up with a democrat a lot is up to us thats a gift and a responsibility ill take it i hope youll join me guardian news

november fort russ news berliner morgenpost the complete interview translated by tom winter in merzig sahra wagenknecht loves the idyllic nature of saarland this is the opposite to hectic berlin ideal for relaxing she says with oskar lafontaine her husband she often gets on her bike when we have time we bicycle a good kilometers a day merzig a small town on the border with france has become the new home of the year old who was born in jena has her constituency in d sseldorf and leads the left wing fraction in the bundestag in a caf at the town hall wagenknecht sketched out her goals for the election year ms wagenknecht you and your co chairman dietmar bartsch were for a long time like tom and jerry could you be a successful candidate for the bundestag election sahra wagenknecht we have been successfully running the bundestag campaign for more than a year now the left is now highr in all surveys than in despite the strength of the afd the climate in the faction has also improved there is a relationship of trust between dietmar bartsch and myself we work well together this is the prerequisite for a successful election campaign what is the purpose of the linkspartei wagenknecht my wish for the bundestag election is a clear signal that the same old same old of the grand coalition will be voted out and the social question finally comes to the agenda for years inequality has grown in germany many people can no longer live by their labor and more and more the elderly are humiliated with poverty but voting afd does change this because afd also advocates a weak social state and privatization a good double digit result for the left would put the other parties especially the spd under pressure to finally take care of the social interests of the majority you again rely on tax increases what must happen before the left thinks about the relief of citizens and businesses wagenknecht we demand tax reductions for the majority namely middle income and low income earners it is scandalous that an income tax rate of percent will be payable from an income of euro while companies like apple amazon or starbucks in europe will be hit with tax rates of percent it is perfectly understandable that people feel they over a barrel by such a policy we want the large companies and super rich people to pay appropriate taxes we demand among other things a tax and the regular taxation of large inheritances spd has been making policies against its own voters for years in the polls even enough a red green green triple bundle wo go what power perspective do you see wagenknecht it not enough because the spd has been doing politicies against its own voters for years why should workers and retirees choose a party that has created a huge low wage sector and destroyed the statutory pension sigmar gabriel has recently fought like a lion for the cte group protection agreement in the inheritance tax he was undisturbed by horst seehofer as long as the spd does not signal that it wants something else than a more of the same the voters are running away under what conditions would you be willing to co ordinate with the spd and greens wagenknecht the basic direction of politics must change the spd and the greens have been part of the inglorious party cartel that has destroyed the welfare state we want to restore the welfare state we do not need a riester schwachsinn which makes only the financial industry rich but a sufficient legal pension everyone must pay for this including self employed persons civil servants and politicians we need decent unemployment insurance again in addition the bargaining with temps and out contracting has to end in foreign policy germany should return to the tradition of a back off policy by which you mean wagenknecht balancing interests instead of escalating conflicts through rearmament and war the so called war against terror did not make this world more peaceful instead it ultimately strengthened terrorism and brought it to germany taking the bundeswehr out of afghanistan and syria would be the best thing we could do for our security it does sound like you going to govern wagenknecht what for more than years the federal republic did well to keep its soldiers home for willy brandt war was the ultima irratio thus no road for politics if the spd today characgerizes such positions as non governmental this is a sad testimony to their own decline germany is not defended in afghanistan should the termination of all foreign operations of the bundeswehr be agreed upon before signing a coalition agreement wagenknecht if we help poor countries after catastrophes drill wells or build schools this is welcome but it does not call for a bundeswehr the technical aid organization better equipped would suffice the left will never support the military effort of the bundeswehr they are also contrary to the basic law the task of the bundeswehr is to defend germany germany is not defended either in mali afghanistan or syria would sigmar gabriel as an spd chancellor candidate be an argument for or rather against red red green wagenknecht if i were a leading spd politician i would give a thought to the result of the us election the democrats hindered the left profiled bernie sanders only to suffer with an unbelievable hillary clinton shipwreck clinton stood for arbitrariness venality and indifference to the social division of the country many have chosen trump because they wanted to deselect this more of the same i think the spd should take this seriously who is the spd bernie sanders wagenknecht well if mr gabriel keep looking in a large party like the spd there must be genuine social democrats who are credible in the eyes of voters sigmar gabriel on the other hand stands for the politics since the
legal insurrection by leslie eastman about one year ago gov jerry brown signed the states assisted suicide bill into law it fully went into effect this june with the opening of the first clinic while there is no data on the number of california assisted suicides oregon recorded over last year as part of their legalized physician assisted death program now one young mother says her insurance company denied her coverage for chemotherapy treatment after originally agreeing to provide the fiscal support for it but indicated it would be willing to pay for assisted suicide instead stephanie packer a wife and mother of four who was diagnosed with a terminal form of scleroderma said her insurance company initially indicated it would pay for her to switch to a different chemotherapy drug at the recommendation of her doctors but shortly after californias end of life option act which authorizes physicians to diagnose a life ending dose of medication to patients with a prognosis of six months or less to live went into effect ms packers insurance company had a change of heart and when the law was passed it was a week later i received a letter in the mail saying they were going to deny coverage for the chemotherapy that we were asking for ms packer said she said she called her insurance company to find out why her coverage had been denied on the call she also asked whether suicide pills were covered under her plan and she says yes we do provide that to our patients and you would only have to pay for the medication ms packer said packer attends meetings with others suffering from terminal illnesses she indicates that the tone of those meetings have changed since the california assisted suicide law was enacted as soon as this law was passed and you see it everywhere when these laws are passed patients fighting for a longer life end up getting denied treatment because this will always be the cheapest option packer attends a support group for terminally ill patients she said legally sanctioned suicide has changed the tone of the meetings which used to be positive and encouraging with patients under new societal pressure to kill themselves she said meetings became negative and it started consuming people and then they said you know what i wish i could just end it concerned about the enormous potential for abuse a the national organization patients rights action fund has created a website for patients like packer the online resource offers a place for patients family members concerned friends to report possible coercion failure to identify depression or other patient mental health concerns and complications that arise from the overdose prescription or other aspects of the assisted suicide process were you or someone you know pressured to use assisted suicide misleadingly known as death with dignity or aid in dying did you or a loved one have a chronic life threatening illness and personal circumstances where you they felt like suicide or assisted suicide was your only option did a doctor advise you or someone you know of a prognosis of months or less that was wrong by months years or even decades were you or a loved one denied coverage for a life sustaining treatment or medication by your hmo or insurance company during his gettysburg address describing the first days in office if he is elected president donald trump indicated he would work to replace obamcare with health savings accounts remove barriers to purchasing health insurance across state lines allow states to manage medicaid funds and speed up drug approval inside the food and drug administration however his election would be too late help many terminally ill californians who are now experiencing the unintended but quite predictable consequence of yet another feel good progressive policy
oregon live juror vigorously defends the across the board acquittals of ammon bundy and his six co defendants calling the rulings a statement about the prosecutions failure to prove the fundamental elements of a conspiracy charge the full time marylhurst university business administration student was the juror who had sent a note to the judge on the fourth day of the initial jurys deliberations in the case questioning the impartiality of a fellow juror no who the judge bounced from the jury a day later it should be known that all jurors felt that this verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution to prove conspiracy in the count itself and not any form of affirmation of the defenses various beliefs actions or aspirations juror wrote friday in a lengthy email to the oregonian oregonlive he expressed relief that he can now speak out freely but he wasnt ready as of friday morning to drop his anonymity he said his studies have suffered since the trial started and hes not ready for the attention revealing his identity would bring but felt it was important to defend the verdict the judge withheld jurors names during the jury selection process and trial instead referring to each by number the jury closely followed u s district judge anna j browns instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence and testimony heard during the five week trial he said the jury returned unanimous verdicts of not guilty to conspiracy charges against all seven defendants each was accused of conspiring to prevent employees of the u s fish and wildlife service and bureau of land management from carrying out their official work through intimidation threat or force during the day occupation juror noted the panel couldnt simply rely on the defendantsdefining actions to convict all agreed that impeding existed even if as an effect of the occupation he wrote but we were not asked to judge on bullets and hurt feelings rather to decide if any agreement was made with an illegal object in mind the marylhurst student wrote it seemed this basic high standard of proof was lost upon the prosecution throughout prosecutors had argued that the case at its core was about the illegal taking of anothers property the heavily armed guards that manned the front gate and watchtower during the day takeover in and of itself was intimidating and prevented officers from the u s fish and wildlife service and u s bureau of land management from carrying out their work they said they argued that the alleged conspiracy began nov when ammon bundy and ally ryan payne met with harney county sheriff dave ward and promised there would be extreme civil unrest in the community if he didnt step in and block harney county ranchers dwight hammond jr and steven hammond the hammonds were slated to return to federal prison on jan and serve out a mandatory minimum five year sentence for arson on federal land defense lawyers urged jurors in closing arguments not to mix up the effect of the occupation which undoubtedly kept federal employees from doing their jobs from the intent of the occupiers five of the seven defendants including ammon bundy testified many said that they were there to protest in support of the hammonds and federal government overreach because they received absolutely no response from state or local government officials to their previous efforts to spur change the defense lawyers arguments coupled with the jury instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence resonated with jurors juror noted inference while possibly compelling proved to be insulting or inadequate to diversely situated people as a means to convict the juror wrote the air of triumphalism that the prosecution brought was not lost on any of us nor was it warranted given their burden of proof juror plainly stated that fellow juror during the initial round of deliberations had zero business being on this jury in the first place juror had worked for the u s bureau of land management as a ranch tech and firefighter more than years ago he had said during jury selection asked by the judge during voir dire if that experience would impede his ability to be a fair and impartial judge of the facts he said not really juror explained why he didnt alert the court immediately after he had heard juror on day one of deliberations reportedly say i am very biased it wasnt until the fourth day into deliberations that juror sent a note to the court asking if a juror who had worked previously for the federal land management agency and outright told the panel he was very biased could be an impartial judge the court flummoxed by the development a day later dismissed juror for good cause after the prosecution and defense teams agreed to the dismissal at the time parties to the case werent sure which way juror alleged bias fell juror said he resisted the impulse to send the question sooner in an effort to give his fellow juror a chance to explain himself in his email to the oregonian oregonlive juror for the first time also contended that juror violated the judges explicit orders by hearkening to evidence that was never admitted in this case refused to consider the defendants state of mind and used imaginative theories to explain key actions juror said though he wishes that he had sent the letter on day one since it would have alleviated much stress for all of us the maryville business student said he is baffled by what he described as observersflippant sentiments in the wake of the jurys acquittals dont they know that not guilty does not mean innocent he wrote it was not lost on us that our verdict might inspire future actions that are regrettable but that sort of thinking was not permitted when considering the charges before us the jury he said met with judge brown
mysterious universe do other realities brush up against our own are there parallel dimensions lying just beyond through some thin untraceable veil separating us the idea of parallel realities beyond our own is not new yet what if this phenomenon were to come bursting forth from the realm of theory and speculation and come crashing down into the now are there perhaps some people who have stepped over that barrier into domains we have not yet to see and which we may indeed not even be meant to see i have covered such alleged excursions into the horizon beyond our known reality here at mysterious universe before and here i will revisit this topic with a selection of other cases that seem to imply the possibility that not only are parallel dimensions real but that they are destinations to which we can be whisked away whether intentional or not in the september issue of fate magazine there was the curious story of a woman who apparently shifted into another parallel universe in according to the report in the fall of that year a woman by the name of miriam golding had a profoundly unusual experience while riding an elevator with her fiancee in chicago the elevator was crowded and when miriam made a mistake and got off at the wrong floor she found that she could not push her way back in past the throng of people and resigned herself to waiting for the next one that was when she looked around and was startled to realize that she was no longer in the store at all but rather an expansive train station the enormous railway station she found herself in was allegedly bustling with fevered activity with throngs of travelers rushing to their trains and booming announcements of arrivals and departures echoing through the air there seemed to be no way this busy place could have any connection whatsoever to the music store she had been in moments before the confused miriam made her way to an information booth to ask where she was but found that the woman working there completely ignored her as if she werent there at all perplexed miriam followed a series of signs pointing the way to the street outside and she emerged out into a mild sunny afternoon that seemed to be in the midst of summer rather than fall in a place that was most certainly not chicago she wandered about in confusion and noticed that everyone around her seemed to completely ignore her and walk on by as if they did not even see her at some point she claims that she saw a confused looking boy standing in the sidewalk similarly being passed on by people who seemed to have no idea he was even there and miriam approached him wondering what was going on the boy was able to actually see and respond to her and looked in her direction the first time anyone had acknowledged her presence in this strange surreal place as she approached the boy seemed equally relieved that he was visible to miriam smiled slightly and purportedly saying i guess they let you off at the wrong stop too the two lost people walked together down the street in confusion the whole time completely ignored by those around them and the boy told miriam of what had happened to him he claimed that he had been playing tennis in lincoln nebraska in the united states and had gone to the locker room to change his shoes when he had gone back to the courts to play some more he had found that the tennis courts that had been there moments before were now gone and in their place was a huge train terminal which had turned out to be the exact same station into which miriam had enigmatically entered from the elevator the two allegedly kept on walking until they reached an open area that led to water and over the waves they could apparently make out a sand bar with several women upon it chatting and seeming to act as if nothing was beyond the ordinary to miriams astonishment one of the women was oddly her fiancees sister the women out on the sandbar seemed to notice them and began waving and shouting to miriam and her companion this encouraged the boy to try and make a swim out to the sandbar which did not seem so far and which he was confident he could reach yet even though he was a good swimmer it seemed that no matter how much he tried and pushed against the waves he was unable to draw any closer to the mysterious sandbar and he returned to shore in frustration it was then that the sandbar supposedly suddenly vanished into thin air miriam closed her eyes in exasperation disappointment and exhaustion and then was overcome by the sensation of floating through space after some time of this odd feeling of hovering in darkness she claimed that she suddenly opened her eyes to find herself sitting atop a stool in the music store in chicago which seemed to be in the process of closing for the night suggesting that she had been there for at least several hours disoriented miriam looked around for her fiancee but could not find him and decided to head back to his home when she arrived her fiancee was noticeably relieved and explained that he had lost her in the store and had waited for her to come to the right floor for a few hours before deciding to go back home bizarrely the fiancees sister whom miriam had seen on the mysterious sandbar earlier claimed that she had seen miriam in town and had even called out to her but that she had been too absorbed in talking to a young boy to notice her where did miriam go during that time why should she see her fiancees sister on a sandbar while

dispatches from eric zuesse o n november the intercept headlined heres the problem with the story connecting russia to donald trumps email server and the reporting team of sam biddle lee fang micah lee and morgan marquis boire revealed that slates franklin foer published a story thats been circulating through the dark web and various newsrooms since summertime an enormous eyebrow raising claim that donald trump uses a secret server to communicate with russia that claim resulted in an explosive night of twitter confusion and misinformation the gist of the slate article is dramatic incredible even cybersecurity researchers found that the trump organization used a secret box configured to communicate exclusively with alfa bank russias largest commercial bank this is a story that any reporter in our election cycle would drool over and drool foer did the intercept team concluded their detailed analysis of the evidence by saying franklin foer is an american warmonger and p r agent a democrat and former editor of the scurrilous neocon new republic foer was a bernard l schwartz fellow at the new america foundation could it be that donald trump used one of his shoddy empires spam marketing machines one with his last name built right into the domain name to secretly collaborate with a moscow bank sure at this moment theres literally no way to disprove that but theres also literally no way to prove it and such a grand claim carries a high burden of proof without more evidence it would be safer to assume that this is exactly what it looks like a company that trump has used since to outsource his hotel spam is doing exactly that otherwise were all making the exact same speculation about the unknown thats caused untold millions of voters to believe hillarys deleted emails might have contained benghazi cover up pdfs given equal evidence for both go with the less wacky story however they failed to dig deeper to explain what could have motivated this smear of trump was it just sloppiness on the part of slate and of foer hardly it was anything but unintentional a core part of the democratic partys campaign for hillary clinton consists of her claim that donald trump is secretly a russian agent this is an updated version of the republican joseph r mccarthys campaign to root communists out of the federal government and of the john birch societys accusation even against the republican president dwight eisenhower that with regard to eisenhower it is difficult to avoid raising the question of deliberate treason neoconservatives in both parties are the heirs of the republican partys hard right which now even decades after the end of communism and the soviet union hate russia above all of their other passions neoconservatism has emerged as todays republican partys establishment and theyve always viewed russia to be americas chief enemy and they have favored the overthrow of any nations leader who is friendly toward russia such as saddam hussein muammar gaddafi viktor yanukovych and bashar al assad hatred and demonization of russia is the common core of neoconservatism the post cold war extension of joseph r mccarthy and the john birch society neoconservatives in both parties are the heirs of the republican partys hard right which now even decades after the end of communism and the soviet union hate russia above all of their other passions both slate and especially foer have long pedigrees as democratic party neoconservatives champions of u s invasions otherwise called pr agents promoting the products and services that a few giant and exclusive military corporations such as raytheon lockheed martin dyncorp and the carlyle group offer to the u s federal government ill deal here only with foer not with his latest employer foer wrote in the new york times on october against isolationist republicans who regretted having supported george w bushs invasion of iraq and he headlined about them there once again america first equating non neoconservative republicans with essentially the pro fascist isolationists of the he concluded that they would come to regret their regret conservatives could soon find themselves retracing buckleys steps wrestling all over again with their isolationist instincts thats how far right franklin foer is hes to the right of those republicans on june foer in a tediously long badly written and argued article in new york magazine the source of the trouble described the downfall of the new york timess leading stenographer for george w bushs lies to invade iraq their reporter judith miller he closed by concluding that the source of the trouble was that miller was simply too earnest and tried too hard not that she was a stenographer to power people like miller with her outsize journalistic temperament of ambition obsession and competitive fervor relying on people like ahmad chalabi with his smooth affable exterior retailing false information for his own motives for the benefit of people reading a newspaper trying to get at the truth of whats what o n december when the question of whether to bomb iran was being debated by neoconservatives foer who then was the editor of the leading democratic party neoconservative magazine the new republic headlined in his magazine identity crisis neocon v neocon on iran and he introduced a supposed non neocon from the supposedly non neocon brookings institution kenneth pollack to comment upon the conflict among neocons in part the lack of neocon consensus on whether to as john mccain was to so poetically put it bomb bomb bomb iran can be attributed to the nature of the problem nobody not the council on foreign relations not john kerrys brain trust has designed a plausible policy to walk iran back from the nuclear brink or as kenneth m pollack concludes in his new book the persian puzzle this is a problem from hell with no good solution but actually both pollack and brookings are democratic party neocons themselves and among the leading proponents of invading iraq had been not only pollack
on wednesday nov republican lawmakers arranged to meet with president elect donald trumps advisors to talk about another less expensive option to his mighty wall the president elect also consistently told his supporters he would dismantle obama care but now he says that he is open to keeping the affordable care act this recent waffling could be an indicator that he will not deliver on his campaign promises the day after he won the election he was given his first test by his own party according to top aides for trump there is a compromise that would include more federal border patrol officers and extend the border fence the idea is to extend parts of the border with a double layered fence an official from the department of homeland security and a republican from the house of representatives said trumps wall is improbable it would have to be built through rivers and lakes rough terrain and private property it would also block the view of border agents this wall would make it difficult to watch the border according to the house aid the meeting will take place as soon as his transition team is set the spokesperson would not offer any comment on the meeting or compromise plan from the lawmakers mexico again said the day after the election they would not pay for his wall the wall has never been mentioned officially but if congress takes a stand against trump it will be an extension of the fence once proposed by secretary clinton according to the house aide the meeting will take place as soon as the transition team is set the spokesperson would not comment on the meeting or the compromise from lawmakers mexico again stated the day after the election they will not pay for his wall this boundary has not been mentioned officially but if congress takes a stand against trump it will be an extension of the fence once proposed by secretary of state hillary clinton another key focus of the presidential campaign was immigration it was stated that illegal immigrants are stealing american jobs and pose a security risk to the nation chairman of the house homeland security committee michael mccaul called the idea of the wall an emotional unthinking reaction to a highly sensitive issue or a knee jerk reaction another indication that the president elect will not deliver on his campaign promises the day after the election marie keating a first grade teacher in california asked her students what they wanted to ask new president elect trump one student said she did not want her family to be sent back to mexico this statement prompted keating to have her class write letters telling trump what was on their mind little nicole asked him to be kind and to always tell the truth and not to incite violence between people of color another little girl asked him to allow people of different races to be friends a little boy asked him not to say that people who do not have white skin are all robbers another little girl said simply that she hoped he did not start a war and another asked that he not send them back to mexico keating posted the letters on facebook for everyone to see she was proud of her students because they asked for things that were necessary for them in a respectful way anthony scaramucci the creator of hedge fund skybridge capital and one of trumps top advisors says americans should take president elect trump at his word he believes he will build a wall if he says he will when new york magazine asked him how it would be possible to have mexico pay for the wall he responded that the u s could charge an excise tax on goods coming into the country from mexico however he also said the american people did the right thing by electing trump the interviewer corrected him stating that americans voted for clinton not trump scaramucci replied he did not see that way if president elect trump wants to build a wall he will have to convince congress using a cost efficient plan the affordable care act has provided millions of people with health insurance at an affordable premium the average cost of health insurance within the marketplace after the percent rise will be a month the newly elected president elect has changed his mind on repealing the health coverage he states that he is willing to keep the affordable care act and instead make the needed changes therefore it is entirely possible trump will not deliver on some of his campaign promises reuters house republicans test trump on his u s mexico wallnymag com read letters written by first grade students to donald trumpnymag com hedge funder and trump advisor anthony scaramucci on team trumps economic plan and getting mexico to pay for the walltop courtesy of gage skidmores flickr page creative commons licensefeature image courtesy of denise krebs flickr page creative commons license first graders immigration spot trump wall

propaganda alert by sky the man who led the west most powerful alliance through most of the obama administration has told sky news that the president has not done enough to prevent conflict former nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen says america next commander in chief must do more to lead the world in an interview he explained i think president obama has been too reluctant to use military force or threaten to use military force to prevent conflicts in the world we need america as the world policeman we need determined american global leadership his criticism carries more weight in the closing days of the us election campaign and reveals the frustration of a man tasked with running the north atlantic treaty organisation during the obama years regardless of who wins the presidency in less than a week time mr rasmussen said the us has no choice but to return to the path of greater interventionism superpowers do get to retire look around you will see a world on fire syria torn by war and conflict iraq on the brink of collapse libya a failed state in north africa russia attacking ukraine and destabilising eastern europe china flexing its muscles the rogue state north korea threatening nuclear attacks all that requires a world policeman to restore international law and order mr rasmussen also expressed deep concerns about what donald trump might do to the world should he win the presidency it might be very dangerous of course he said we do know what will be the concrete policies of a trump administration but if his statements were to be taken at face value i consider it could be very dangerous for the world the danish politician aspirations for greater us global leadership are not shared by millions of americans it seems they have supported a candidate who has advocated that the us intervenes less in foreign affairs and withdraws more on the campaign trail mr trump has said america cannot carry on being the world policeman whether or not mr obama could have done more to prevent conflicts is the focus of intense debate in washington some blame him for the turmoil roiling the middle east others say he has skilfully managed its fallout and greater us involvement would only have made matters worse aaron david miller who has advised both republican and democratic administrations on foreign policy says even superpowers are limited in what they can achieve as america next president will discover he said the notion that mrs clinton or mr trump will somehow be able to come up with comprehensive fixes for the world problems or america is an illusion our constitution talks about creating a more perfect union nowhere in the document does it say it is the objective of the american policy to create a more perfect world that does not mean we need to abandon the world we ca but it does mean particularly in the wake of iraq and afghanistan we need to take a very hard look at what american interests are and figure out the most effective and smart way of protecting them
trump in the white house by november cj polychroniou noam the unthinkable has happened in contrast to all forecasts donald trump scored a decisive victory over hillary clinton and the man that michael moore described as wretched ignorant dangerous part time clown and full time sociopath is the next president of the united states in your view what were the deciding factors that led american voters produce the biggest upset in the history of us politics before turning to this question i think it is important to spend a few moments pondering just what happened on november a date that might turn out to be one of the most important in human history depending on how we react no exaggeration the most important news of november was barely noted a fact of some significance in itself on november the world meteorological organization delivered a report at the international conference on climate change in morocco which was called in order to carry forward the paris agreements of the wmo reported that the past five years were the hottest on record it reported rising sea levels soon to increase as a result of the unexpectedly rapid melting of polar ice most ominously the huge antarctic glaciers already arctic sea ice over the past five years is percent below the average of the previous years not only raising sea levels but also reducing the cooling effect of polar ice reflection of solar rays thereby accelerating the grim effects of global warming the wmo reported further that temperatures are approaching dangerously close to the goal established by along with other dire reports and forecasts another event took place on november which also may turn out to be of unusual historical significance for reasons that once again were barely noted on november the most powerful country in world history which will set its stamp on what comes next had an election the outcome placed total control of the government the executive congress the supreme court in the hands of the republican party the most dangerous organization in world history apart from the last phrase all of this is uncontroversial the last phrase may seem outlandish even outrageous but is it the facts suggest otherwise the party is dedicated to racing as rapidly as possible to destruction of organized human life there is no historical precedent for such a stand is this an exaggeration consider what we have just been witnessing during the republican primaries every candidate denied that what is happening is happening with the exception of the sensible moderates like jeb bush who said its all uncertain but we dont have to do anything because were producing more natural gas thanks to fracking or john kasich who agreed that global warming is taking place but added that we are going to burn coal in ohio and we are not going to apologize for it the winning candidate now the president elect calls for rapid increase in use of fossil fuels including coal dismantling of regulations rejection of help to developing countries that are seeking to move to sustainable energy and in general racing to the cliff as fast as possible trump has already taken steps to dismantle the environmental protection agency by placing in charge of the epa transition a notorious climate change denier myron ebell trumps top adviser on energy billionaire oil executive harold hamm announced his expectations which were predictable dismantling regulations tax cuts for the industry more fossil fuel production lifting obamas temporary block on the dakota access pipeline the market reacted quickly shares in energy corporations boomed including the worlds largest coal miner peabody energy which had filed for bankruptcy but after trumps victory registered a gain the effects of republican denialism had already been felt there had been hopes that the paris agreement would lead to a verifiable treaty but any such thoughts were abandoned because the republican congress would not accept any binding commitments so what emerged was a voluntary agreement evidently much weaker effects may soon become even more vividly apparent than they already are in bangladesh alone tens of millions are expected to have to flee from low lying plains in coming years because of sea level rise and more severe weather creating a migrant crisis that will make todays pale into insignificance with considerable justice bangladeshs leading climate scientist says that these migrants should have the right to move to the countries from which all these greenhouse gases are coming millions should be able to go to the united states and to the other rich countries that have grown wealthy while bringing about a new geological era the anthropocene marked by radical human transformation of the environment these catastrophic consequences can only increase not just in bangladesh but in all of south asia as temperatures already intolerable for the poor inexorably rise and the himalayan glaciers melt threatening the entire water supply already in india some million people are reported to lack drinking water and the effects will reach far beyond it is hard to find words to capture the fact that humans are facing the most important question in their history whether organized human life will survive in anything like the form we know and are answering it by accelerating the race to disaster similar observations hold for the other huge issue concerning human survival the threat of nuclear destruction that has been looming over our heads for years and is now increasing it is no less difficult to find words to capture the utterly astonishing fact that in all of the massive coverage of the electoral extravaganza none of this receives more than passing mention at least i am at a loss to find appropriate words turning finally to the question raised to be precise it appears that clinton received a slight majority of the vote the apparent decisive victory has to do with curious features of american politics among other factors the electoral college residue of the founding of the country as
region southeast asia two years remain until the parliamentary elections in cambodia this is a really rather short period considering that the position of the current political regime of the cambodian peoples party remains in doubt despite the partys success at the municipal elections in there is no confidence that it may win and retain power at the parliamentary elections the cpp is overloaded with a host of problems primarily everyone is talking about corruption in the party its nepotism detachment from the people who analysts state have long tired of seeing one and the same governing figures at the top of cambodias political hierarchy there is even the feeling that the leadership of the party wont plan to renew its policy and introduce new leaders even if it recognizes its problems in january at an emergency session of the cpp it was noted that the corruption nepotism abuse of powers violation of the laws spread among the partys members had undermined the confidence of the people and raised doubts about its right to rule the country the introduction of reforms inside the party and society was named as a life and death issue for the cpps future at the session however almost two years have passed since the session and the party has not even started to solve its acute problems there are no new young and attractive leaders in its leadership yet the provincial level has rather competent and authoritative governors of provinces cpp members that might change the image of the ruling party if they became members of its leadership despite the fact that the number of members of the central committee has doubled it is still dominated by the same veterans of the peoples revolutionary party who together with hun sen and supported by vietnam and the soviet union built the peoples republic of kampuchea over this period they went from being comrade to mr and became even more detached from real life the style of the political leadership was supposed to be corrected and the session would promote steps aimed at a symbolic detachment from the personal leadership of hun sen these expectations were not met soon after the session he took up the position of cpp chairman and consolidated both administrative and party powers into his own hands the relations of the authorities and the opposition have been developing in a complicated and ambiguous way at first the cambodia national rescue party headed by openly pro western and anti vietnam policy maker sam rainsy which obtained only seats fewer than the ruling party at the elections in boycotted the national parliament in protest against the alleged falsification of the figures and violations that prevented their victory then pro western nationalists agreed with hun sen to return to the parliament and started active work aimed at spreading their influence in the rural areas by opening its branches in the traditional cpp territories and carrying out protests in their interest this activity led by the opposition clearly frightened the ruling regime and sam rainsy emigrated while the other leader kim socha and his supporters were brought to justice for the organization of illegal anti governmental protests at the same time cambodias leader initiated propaganda attacks on the opposition leaders organised protests demanding the resignation of its representatives from public offices a number of opposition members were even beaten which was followed by the initiation of criminal cases against them the situation became so serious that the deputies of the european parliament threatened the authorities of cambodia with suspending the provision of economic assistance this is a serious warning for hun sen as the european union is one of the leading donors to cambodias economy as for the tactics of the opposition it is now refraining from mass protest campaigns in order not to give the authorities reason to expand repressions at the same time using non commercial organisations related to it and gaining western subsidies the opposition is generating the conviction in society that the ruling regime is against the people and its leaders should be judged and their property should be confiscated it also proposes a social and economic program that presupposes an increase in the minimum wage and retirement benefits and a reduction in fuel and electricity prices though the program is purely populist and unreal it is attracting people who have started to perceive the cnrp as a political force able to change the situation in the country while assessing the situation in cambodia and its prospects it becomes clear that the peoples party has no clear pre election strategy and it is not mobilizing party members for successful elections the elaboration and presentation of a pre election strategy might influence those who have doubts about their preferences and those who have not decided how to vote in in september i had a chance to talk with the delegation from cambodia at the eastern economic forum in vladivostok i was interested in the mood in the peoples party in the run up to the elections one of the high ranking members of the delegation answered we are very scared which just confirmed that our conclusions were correct dmitry mosyakov professor doctor of historical sciences director of the centre for southeast asia australia and

videos big money corporate lobbying has reached into one of the most obscure corners of state government the offices of secretaries of state the people charged with running elections impartially barbara cegavske the nevada secretary of state during a debate the republican secretaries of state committee a fundraising group invited her to participate by phone in may meetings with tobacco restaurant and gun industry representatives to discuss ballot initiatives the targeting of secretaries of state with campaign donations corporate funded weekend outings and secret meetings with industry lobbyists reflects an intense focus on often overlooked ballot questions which the secretaries frequently help write the ballot initiatives are meant to give voters a direct voice on policy issues such as the minimum wage and the environment but corporate and other special interests are doing their best to build close ties with the secretaries because a difference of even a few words on a ballot measure can have an enormous impact on the outcome the influence campaign has intensified with more citizen driven ballot initiatives to be decided on election day this year than at any time in the past decade secretaries of state from washington ohio colorado and nevada all republicans participated in closed door meetings in may with representatives from reynolds american the nations second largest tobacco company the national restaurant association and the national rifle association while ballot initiative signatures in those states were still being collected documents obtained through open records requests show at a weekend retreat last month at a hunting lodge in kansas republican secretaries of state mingled with donors including a representative from koch industries as they shot pheasant and clay pigeons the owners of koch industries charles g and david h koch have funded groups involved in several ballot initiative fights this year including over a solar energy measure in florida the koch brothers out with the republican secretaries of state thats a news story i dont need allen richardson a koch lobbyist joked unaware that a reporter was in attendance groups aligned with democrats have also targeted secretaries of state mobilizing during the campaign to try to elect more officials sympathetic to their causes with so many important issues being decided through ballot initiatives increasing our involvement in electing secretaries of state who will stand with working families is vital said a strategy memo co written by steve rosenthal a veteran political strategist for labor unions the may meetings between industry officials and the republican secretaries of state committee a fundraising group were set up to give the industry players a chance to weigh in on ballot initiatives that the secretaries were overseeing emails show in an email with the subject line ballot initiative private meetings in dc emily keech the committees executive director invited barbara cegavske the nevada secretary of state to join the sessions by phone noting that the others were flying in i know that the national rifle association has some concerns in nv so it would be helpful to get your insights keech wrote referring to a nevada initiative that would more broadly require background checks for gun sales a measure opposed by the nra she assured cegavske that the meetings would be kept confidential i dont want that listed anywhere since it is a sensitive topic for some secretaries keech wrote in the email in briefing papers she later sent she detailed the ballot initiatives the industry groups were concerned with and just how much the groups had donated for republican election efforts some former secretaries of state said the new fundraising tactics could hurt the image of the offices as impartial referees of state elections it is extremely important that the public trust their elections and have confidence they are going to be handled in a fair and impartial way said sam reed a former republican secretary of state in washington and ballot issues in particular are very sensitive twenty six states allow citizens to enact or repeal laws through a popular vote the initiative process began over a century ago as a way to circumvent state legislatures considered at the time to be dominated by powerful corporate interests there are citizen initiatives this year according to ballotpedia a nonprofit group that tracks state elections and spending on those initiatives has reached at least million with billions at stake major corporations routinely hire consulting firms to help them influence ballot initiatives the key to any ballot measure is the right language nathan sproul the managing partner at lincoln strategy group whose client list has included walmart philip morris international and wynn resorts told a roomful of lobbyists in september at a closed door strategy session in alexandria va in arizona you write the concept and then the secretary of state writes the language another lincoln executive ulrico izaguirre told attendees as he ran through a long list of election day items before voters this year the clouds of ballot measures threaten business on a daily basis thunderous clouds republicans have turned to initiatives to push their agenda as a counter to liberal activists according to an internal party memo ballot initiatives will not be the lefts mechanism for gaining power and advancing their agenda when voters have already rejected them said the memo from the republican state leadership committee in february as the group prepared fundraising efforts its time for conservatives to take back that power by rejecting their efforts and promoting our own the republican organization that hosted the closed door meetings in washington is an arm of the republican state leadership committee a political group dedicated to electing candidates to state government posts in a july memo the leadership group said the diverse set of responsibilities held by republican secretaries across the country presents previously unidentified opportunities for significant growth and expansion and then discussed the importance of ballot initiatives as a fundraising tool and money has poured in reynolds american has contributed in the past two years to the republican state leadership committee and
by the biggest story on indian television yesterday wasnt the election of donald trump for on tuesday night indian prime minister narendra modi in a surprise speech declared that currency notes of rupees and rs the highest two denominations in circulation would be invalid as of midnight that same night the withdrawn notes could no longer be used for transacting business or as a store of value for future usage from modis speech there is a need for a decisive war against the menace of corruption black money and terrorism corruption black money and terrorism are festering wounds which make the country hollow from within he said adding such activities hold back the nations progress describing illegal financial activities as the biggest blot modi said that despite several steps taken by his government over the last two and a half years indias global ranking on corruption had moved only to position from earlier this shows the extent of the web of corruption in the country the disease of corruption is the domain of some veted people who are flourishing some people have misused their positions and benefitted on the other hand honest people are suffering he said the reserve bank of india the indian central bank as reported by the times of india elaborated the incidence of fake indian currency notes in higher denomination has increased for ordinary persons the fake notes look similar to genuine notes even though no security feature has been copied the fake notes are used for antinational and illegal activities high denomination notes have been misused by terrorists and for hoarding black money india remains a cash based economy hence the circulation of fake indian currency notes continues to be a menace in order to contain the rising incidence of fake notes and black money the scheme to withdraw has been introduced chaos ensues india remains a cash based economy especially for low value transactions and the move has caused widespread chaos as i write this from kolkata where i am currently visiting the move was accompanied by a temporary shut down of all banks and atms with banks reopening earlier today and atms due to reopen tomorrow initially after the announcement the highest denomination legal tender note in circulation was the rs note new legally tender rs and rs notes have been made available today according to tushar roy chief manager of a nationalized bank central bank of india not all banks have yet received the new notes but roy says that this problem is expected to be resolved soon the government also expects to re introduce rs notes soon to include advanced security features when atms open tomorrow withdrawals will be limited to a maximum of rs per transaction as compared to the rs and in some cases rs limits that previously applied starting today after producing appropriate identification people are allowed to exchange old notes for new at any of the rbi offices any bank branch or at any head post office or sub post office they will have until december to complete their transactions individuals receive full value for the entire volume of bank notes tendered at any of these venues but heres the kicker at the moment each person is limited to receiving only rs per person in cash irrespective of the size of tender anything over and above that amount can only be credited to a bank account this allows the government to track whether the sums tendered have been legitimately acquired withdrawals from bank accounts will be limited to rs a day and rs a week the government has announced this part of the policy may be relaxed in future says roy in order for employers for example to meet payrolls currently made in cash does the policy make sense its beyond the scope of this post to speculate on the impact the new policy will have on individuals of various occupations and with myriad reasons for transacting in large amounts of cash for more on this point interested readers might wish to look at this article in the wire some have criticized the policy for focusing on currency alone and have noted that black money is typically not held by indians in stacks of rs and rs notes but in one of two alternative ways the very rich store black assets in offshore accounts but tax evasion and corruption is not limited to the very richest alone in india many doctors and other professionals members of the business community and small traders also underreport their taxable income they tend to hold their black assets on shore within india in the form of real estate art work gold bullion jewellery or securities unlike other current policy areas border incursions into pakistan for example the political opposition has has not contested the objective of the modi move there is virtually unanimous concurrence at least publicly on cracking down on black money yet as the hindu reported former finance minister palaniappan chidambaram has criticized the modi governments method for achieving its objective we support the objective of the government to stamp out black money but the method they have adopted raises questions the move has come as a bolt from the blue for the common man the real test for the government would begin thursday mr chidambaram said how efficiently and how quickly the money is exchanged if there is harassment or inconvenience and all kinds of questions are asked then i think that will be completely counterproductive a similar move had been contemplated by the previous congress led upa government he recalled but the idea was dropped as the economic gains were not too great mr chidambaram said the introduction of the new series of notes was estimated to cost rs crores to rs crores jerri lynn here a crore is in the indian numbering system the economic gains of demonetisation should be at least equal to that amount if the additional tax revenue pulled in by the modi
by by silvia merler an affiliate fellow at bruegel who formerly worked as economic analyst in dg economic and financial affairs of the european commission originally published at bruegel tim duy s fed watch says that as expected the federal reserve left policy unchanged this month and the statement itself was largely unchanged as well the near term inflation outlook improved from september to november and with the year over year impacts of oil prices falling out of the data headline inflation will track back upwards which is not a big surprise with regards to the timing of the next move duy argues that the language suggests conditions are moving in the right direction but the fed is still waiting for some further evidence a continuation of recent trends will likely be sufficient as the further evidence needed to justify a rate hike in december would a trump victory derail a hike in december duy does not think this is likely at this juncture and we should rather be focusing on the labour market a slowdown in hiring to something closer to a month would probably end the downward pressure on the unemployment rate and raise questions about the feds basic forecast that the unemployment rate will continue to decline in the absence of additional rate hikes we get two employment reports before the december meeting for the fed to stay on the sidelines yet again we probably need to see both reports come in weak the bottom line is that the fed is looking past the election to the december meeting for its second move in this rate hike cycle and probably it would take some unlikely softer numbers to hold them back again greg ip on the other hand writes in the wall street journal that tuesdays election matters typically the fed is guided by the economic data and elections are just transitory nuisances with little significance for the outlook but this is no typical election as one of the candidates represents a dramatic break with economic orthodoxy with promises of protectionism and tax cuts but few details trumps election would dramatically raise uncertainty which is the reason why the stock market has tended to go down when his odds of winning go up for the fed lower stock prices translate into less wealth which is negative for the outlook in its own right additionally the fed will assume that uncertainty in the rest of the economy will mirror what happens in the markets all of this reduces the odds it would actually raise interest rates in december ip argues that the fed can take politics into consideration without being motivated by politics when political decisions can potentially change the course of the economy the fed has to incorporate that into its decisions thus a trump victory would probably cast enough of a pall over the outlook to give the fed reason to delay its next rate increase into next year ironically mr trump may discover that he not mr obama is the reason the fed hasnt tightened richard clarida commenting the fomc statement over at pimcos blog says that there was little expectation that the fed would announce a hike in november the committee members said nothing in their public remarks since the september meeting to suggest that a rate hike was under serious consideration this week indeed the odds of a november hike as priced by the fed funds futures market were only and for at least the past years the fed has never moved when the market has priced less than a chance of a move as for the balance of risks the language remained in the statement after making its first appearance this year in the september fed statement this is relevant because it would be difficult for the fed to justify a hike if it believed that risks were tilted to the downside or if the outlook were so uncertain it could not even characterise the risks clarida does not think that the fed is trying to signal that the odds for a december hike have diminished a year ago the fed wanted to boost market odds of a hike when it thought those odds were too low going into today with those odds at the fed appeared to be content to make minimal changes to the statement only six days before the us election whereas in september three fomc members dissented at this months meeting dissenters were only two so this fed statement seems aimed at making as few waves as possible it is a placeholder until the fed next meets and a rate hike in december continues to be likely if not a done deal natixis philippe waechter argues that the fed is ready for december under the assumption that clinton wins the election he argues that the language on inflation is the only noticeable change in the language of this statement as compared to the previous one together with the remarks on consumption that appears less strong than in september the fed wants to recover room for manoeuver in its monetary policy and this is the reason why it is by now ready to accept an increase in the rates nevertheless it is also acting in a context where it needs to signal that it remains vigilant in an asymmetric approach to monetary policy the fed prefers to act too late than too early tiffany wilding again on pimcos blog looks at one indicator on which feds officials have recently trained a lens the labour force participation rate the participation rate has risen percentage point over the past year and the rise has occurred despite demographic and other secular trends implying that it should have declined about ppt during the news conference following the federal reserves september meeting chair yellen highlighted this development as a reason to believe there is more slack in the labour market than previously thought wilding argues that the rise is not primarily the result of
by this unprecedented election season is finally coming to a close join us for commentary and discussion as the results roll in lambert will kick off the election night live blog at pm tomorrow evening with the presidency and the senate majority in play theres a lot to watch the presidential and vice presidential live blogs were lively so we expect another evening of incisive and often humorous conversation
corrente days until comment on polling election calls have never seemed very interesting to me were it my place to make them in the same way that predicting when a flood will crest is a lot less interesting than understanding a watershed that doesnt mean predictions are not fun madison asked in the federalist but what is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature by the same token what is the horse race but the greatest of all the performing arts that said putting past water coolers into the call frame the method i used didnt yield bad results rather than tracking the very noisy individual polls i decided to use the realclearpolitics polling averages every monday once a week for sanitys sake and plug those averages into a reasonable list of swing states provided by the new york times whose interactive tool then enabled me to game out scenarios in the electoral college in all the weeks i did this but one trump had a plausible path to victory depending on reasonable scenarios in individual states in other words still in the call frame i beat most of the paid pollsters in the political class who were er trumpeting clintons victory and as we saw in yesterdays water cooler i tied the trump teams internal polling they thought they were going to lose though they qualified their views by pointing out the same plausible paths to victory that i did why did i not get the scale of trumps victory i mean in and and maybe farther back the republican candiate always made a show of putting pennsylvania in play and it never came to anything trump won it along with michigan and wisconsin it is clear to any objective observer that the affordable care act which has resulted in rapidly rising premiums and deductibles narrow networks and health insurance has not been a success a trump administration will work with congress to repeal the aca and replace it with a solution that includes health savings accounts and returns the historic role in regulating health insurance to the states the administrations goal will be to create a patient centered healthcare system that promotes choice quality and affordability with health insurance and healthcare and take any needed action to alleviate the burdens imposed on american families and businesses by the law president elect let us know how that works out and to maximize choice and create a dynamic market for health insurance the administration will work with congress to enable people to purchase insurance across state lines the administration also will work with both congress and the states to re establish high risk pools a proven approach to ensuring access to health insurance coverage for individuals who have significant medical expenses and who have not maintained continuous coverage and modernize medicare so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the baby boom generation and beyond maximize flexibility for states in administering medicaid to enable states to experiment with innovative methods to deliver healthcare to our low income citizens hmm donald trump has said he wants to repeal obamacare and we hope that wasnt an empty campaign promise said twila brase president and co founder of cchf it will take more than a promise to make american health care great again and to restore health care freedom to patients and doctors republicans need to advance visionary ideas for health care ideas that are bigger than buying across state lines ideas that put patients and doctors back together again without the costly interference and intrusions of profiteering outsiders the high cost of health care comes primarily from the middlemen including managed care and citizens council for health freedom cchf is a good conservative site on health care policy i dont agree with them on policy but cchf is relentless and above all they dont make stuff up obamacare replacement might look familiar kaiser health news could be obamacare was after all originally a republican plan so it should be possible to rebrand it it gets into a questions of semantics said mark rouck an insurance analyst for fitch ratings are they really repealing the act if they replace it with new legislation that has some of the same characteristics topping the list of aca provisions likely to survive under trump is the requirement that employers cover workers children up to the age of analysts said the measure is widely popular and not especially expensive a health law crafted by republicans might also retain the acas protections for people with preexisting illness seeking coverage said glenn melnick a health economist at the university of southern california the acas biggest coverage expansion came through the medicaid program for the poor and disabled which added more than million people trump has suggested giving states fixed federal grants for medicaid which could lead to a substantial reduction in coverage or benefits then donald

comments democratic rep elijah cummings was the ranking minority member on the house benghazi committee so he knows firsthand how republican witch hunts work from up close personal experience on cnns new day this morning he revealed the real motivation behind the fbi directors stunningly improper memo to congress last week i dont think the american people have a clue how hard the republicans particularly on my committee have been on the fbi this is a man director comey who they loved they said he was the greatest thing in the world very honorable when he came out with the decision in july to not prosecute mrs clinton they suddenly turned against him he knows that if he makes any misstep the republicans are going to be all over him and theyre going to try and bring harm to him the thing that he did say in our hearing and it stuck with me is that there should not be a double standard to the disadvantage of mrs clinton thats right it is heavily implied that the fbi director was so intimidated by congressional republicans and their innuendo machines that he caved in and fed them the kind of vaguely worded red meat memo the trump campaign desperately needed to keep their failing campaign on life support even comey himself admitted that his memo was going to be widely misinterpreted which is probably why cnns host began her interview with congressman cummings by saying trump is lying about the email probe it hasnt taken long for the roof to cave in on comeys career anyway as his obvious meddling in the election has drawn bipartisan complaints about illegal electioneering by the fbi director his former boss to condemn his actions and for the senate minority leader harry reid to demand answers from the fbi about the republican candidates love affair with russian dictator vladimir putin reids point was not lost on the congressman from maryland who told cnn there has been a lot of information out there about mr trump mr manafort and the russian government and alleged attempts to take over our election members of congress have asked for months for the fbi to provide us with information if mr trump mr manafort and any elements of the russian government have any coordination or connection with each other they have not given us one syllable so the question here is do we have a double standard here of course theres a double standard the fbi has a responsibility to keep certain things secret and when it comes to partisan elections that responsibility is key to the ability of our electoral democracys basic functioning newsweeks kurt eichenwald pointed out cogently that republican george w bush was investigated by the fbi in prior to running for president yet the clinton white house didnt grab his fbi file and air all of the dirty laundry claiming a very partisan need for transparency during an election otherwise the fbi could decide to influence every election in america and over time the fbi would pick the elected officials to their liking nothing can un ring the bell that fbi director comey struck by letting loose his vague memo but everyone can understand there is a sexist partisan and blatant double standard at play by republicans celebrating a vague memo which only happened because an official sworn to be non partisan decided he valued his political career more than the integrity of our electoral system watch it here
comments in this amusing but alarming musical number famed songstress rachel bloom joins a star studded crew to pen a parody of we are the world as a last ditch attempt to remind american voters of just what exactly is at stake in this election pleading with the american people to please please not vote for donald trump joined by such star studded names like zach reino jack dolgen moby mayim bialik adam scott adam pally melissa rauch jane lynch jesse tyler ferguson bloom has a simple statement for everyone holy sh t get out and vote i cant believe ive had to stoop so low but an orange talking std has driven me to this recording studio and now moby is on the drums while elizabeth banks plays bass so we can try to convince the usa not to shoot itself in the face at this point in the game if you havent accepted that donald trump is a serial sexual predator who has made his entire business career off the backs of others and his entire political career off of appalling and un american ethnonationalism who would destroy our economy and leave the world at the mercy of the predatory ambitions of dictators like vladimir putin this song isnt going to convince you but its a fun little diversion that still hits home just how critical the result of this election is going to be watch it here
by on fri oct at pm as megyn kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her share on twitter print this post earlier this week friday fox follies under the assumption the explosive and bizarre battle between megyn kelly and newt gingrich would be this weeks lede i had already tricked up an opening paragraph in case you missed it thats when he got personal accused her of being obsessed by sex and she told him that he should work on his anger issues this weeks column would have been about how the fox audience continues to splinter as they take sides in the presidential election the nyt calls em megyn moments i call them fissures in what had been assumed to be the bedrock foundation of the fox news channel its unthinking audience then came word that rupert murdoch was playing hardball as kellys contract negotiations break out into the open that paragraph lovingly crafted went out the window but lets see what this fight was about because heat is always better than light for ratings as trump congratulates newt gingrich for getting his butt kicked by megyn kelly watch as kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her her contract expires next year and rupie opened up to the wall street journal of which he is owner to partially cajole kelly and partially to threaten her into extending her contract million in contract talks with fox news if they are going to make a network that is going to be a post ailes post trump it will be around megyn kelly chris wallace and shep smith and they are going to have to throw hannity and oreilly overboard said andrew tyndall a television news consultant of other hosts at the network that isnt going to happen promised mr murdoch were not changing direction that would be business suicide he said mr oreillys contract is also up at the end of next year and mr murdoch said were going to want bill to stay with us mr hannitys contract isnt up until ms kelly has forged close ties to mr murdochs sons particularly lachlan murdoch who is co executive chairman of fox and has taken an active role in contract talks people close to the situation said fox would like to settle this before the election and before kellys book is released both of which could only strengthen her position in the negotiations if all goes well from the the power of megyn kellys feminismeven if she doesnt call it that by the daily beasts tim teeman imagine then her mix of satisfaction and maybe ennui as she scrolled across some of the praise ridden screeds out today how megyn kelly became an improbable feminist icon megyn kelly has become the biggest example of white feminism at work and aw crapheres proof that megyn kelly is kind of a feminist role model now note the grudging headlines because of kellys employer and because she has not fought the good feminist fight in a conventional left wing context throughout her career to date the f word mantle is being conferred upon her with something of a scowl this in itself reveals a kind of blinkeredness on the part of kellys critics it is perfectly possible to work for a right facing institution and not be percent right wing yourself or spout the prevailing dogma of the tv station you work for aside from the fact that when she tilts right she tends to tilt alt right the biggest knock on kelly is that shes too hard edged marshall mcluhan spoke of the medium cool of tee vee but kelly comes across as the opposite of warm and fuzzy this makes her less attractive to other networks shes hoping to change that impression when she co hosts live with kelly ripa the morning after the election think of her as a designated hitter trying to knock murdochs hardball right out of the park still watters still a few weeks back fff reported on a racist watters world in which the white privileged pencil necked geek made fun of asians this week asian american groups meet with fox news personnel over awful jesse watters segment paul cheung president of aaja told the erik wemple blog that the meeting was productive i think they heard what the communitys reactions are he said of the session at new yorks museum of chinese in america approximately asian american groups and allies have signed an open letter to fox news regarding the unfortunate episode said cheung ron kim a new york state assemblyman in attendance told this blog that a representative from the oreilly factor and a senior representative from the news side of the channel attended the meeting together they played a good cop bad cop routine said kim the gentleman from oreillys show was defending what they were doing and trying to explain that this is a part of the opinion section of fox news and sometimes edgy humor can go too far said kim once again the specter of fox newss vaunted news opinion divide presents itself as weve noted before this is a convention borrowed from the newspaper industry to justify fox news hosts such as sean hannity openly campaigning for donald trump steve doocy of the morning show fox friends spreading harmful innuendo into the public square and oreilly allowing his protege to spread racist stereotypes all about chinatown
by am the voter suppression tactic is right out of the gop election rigging playbook to suppress the black vote in north carolina the following is an opinion column by r muse some americans are likely aware of the psychological term projecting that roughly means a person attributes their own faults and actions onto someone else as an unconscious form of transferring guilt for ones own actions as soon as the republican primaries concluded donald trump projected republicans guilt for election rigging either through vote obstruction or suppression onto democrats and his opponent hillary clinton republicans have been actively suppressing votes since the election of barack obama in and they have only ramped up their election rigging activities over the past eight years and yet trump accuses democrats of election rigging as frequently as most human beings draw breath yesterday the north carolina conference of the national association for the advancement of colored people filed a lawsuit against north carolina republicans and demanded they put an immediate stop to the coordinated effort to suppress the black vote in the state what the naacp rightly said was that the voter suppression tactic was right out of the gop election rigging playbook to suppress the black vote in the state the election rigging amounts to three counties in north carolina canceling voter registration of thousands of mostly african american democratic residents a week before the presidential election the lawsuit charged election officials in beaufort moore and cumberland counties of denying primarily african american voters eligibility to participate in democracy because their voter registration documents mysteriously were bounced back as undeliverable most of the voters whose eligibility to vote was denied and flagged for purging such as james edward arthur sr had moved within the same county and were still legally allowed to cast ballots many of the purged voters lived at their original registration address and were victims of a simple postal service error mr arthur is an african american who lives in a nursing home and has voted in at least the last elections in the same county he was born and raised in without issue arthur testified that he like thousands of other african american democratic voters never received any state or county election documents informing him that his eligibility was denied or that if he didnt attend an appeal hearing to maintain his right to vote he would be denied the right to participate in democracy mr arthur said if i knew my right to vote was in jeopardy i would do whatever i could to protect it i want and plan to vote in the upcoming election but i am concerned that since my registration has been canceled i will not be able to cast a ballot or it will not be counted it is what any sane human being would consider election rigging simply because the tri county ploy targeted primarily african americans who typically vote for democrats it is also something north carolina republicans have been guilty of for the past six years according to the naacp lawsuit north carolina republicans are in violation of the national voter registration act which bans the systemic removal of voters from the rolls in the final days before an election republican election officials state officials defended their election rigging and said they were justified in purging tens of thousands of mainly african american democratic voters eligibility the definition of systemic on an individual basis however the naacp also accused republicans of conducting a coordinated mailing campaign for the sole purpose of challenging the eligibility of thousands of mainly african american voters eligibility who did not receive the mailing one republican who ran for a local office last year shane hubers challenged the registration of voters the majority who are them democrats in beaufort county in one of the other counties charged in the lawsuit cumberland county one individual used returned mail to challenge the registrations of mostly democratic voters in moore county the secretary of the local republican party n carol wheeldon challenged approximately mainly african american registered voters likely because they do not vote for republicans the lead attorney for the naacps lawsuit penda hair said that although she cannot yet prove there is a concerted republican election rigging conspiracy we know that in two of the counties the people who brought the challenges had connections to the local republican party we also know that the pattern of these challenges is very similar across the counties ms hair also noted that in moore county the return address of a right wing group called the voter integrity project appeared on the mail that was used to challenge voters this is a very pernicious treatment of voters she said it is also a deliberate act of election rigging by republicans the president of the north carolina naacp reverend dr william barber said we are seeing the worst attempts of voter suppression here in north carolina that weve seen since the days of jim crow the tar heel state is ground zero in the intentional surgical efforts to suppress the voice of voters these attempts are a direct affront to our constitution the naacp lawsuit is demanding the state reinstate all voters challenged since using this election rigging process back on the rolls immediately the organization also demands that the state notifies the voters that they have been reinstated as eligible voters and allow them to cast regular ballots early or on election day they have already put in a request for an emergency hearing this week to decide the case it might be the case that the naacps request for a hearing may be granted especially in light of these new charges arising just days after a federal court ruled that north carolina republicans violated the national voter registration act in yet another manner failing to add tens of thousands of voters to the rolls who registered at a dmv office over the past few years last thursday u s
by pm if the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half i think its going to be just catastroph ic the following is an opinion column by r muse it may be the understatement of the year to say the republican party is on the verge of a full on civil war and it may be obvious to many americans that the blame for the inter party discord is its standard bearer donald j trump however much trumps candidacy has contributed to the tensions between establishment types terrified of trumps reckless disregard for the longevity of the party and rebellion minded trump supporters the real instigators are the koch brothers although the oil magnates were never on the trump bandwagon they are responsible for the trump loyalists within the gop who were part of the teabagger movement intent on disrupting the nations political system and indeed the workings of government itself the tea party caucus an extremist sect that succeeded in chasing former house speaker john a boehner out of congress morphed into the inaptly named freedom caucus that has embraced trump are set to set fire to the party establishment and it isnt solely to put current speaker paul ryan out of a job although that is high on the trump supporters to do list as noted in wednesdays new york times mr trumps supporters said they were determined to harness the anti establishment energy that mr trump had catalyzed and to refocus it on the republican leadership in congress a target many of them seem eager to take down the right wing extremist that actually took down former house majority leader eric cantor conservative extremist and house freedom caucus member david brat issued a warning to establishment republicans theres a huge chunk of people who want to see a fight taken to d c leadership comes and smacks our guy thats where youre going to put down a marker really and the american people are just scratching their head saying really thats rich brat has been a thorn in the establishments side since paul ryan became speaker and he joins a dangerous number of real conservatives who cannot understand or comport with ryan and establishment leaders who dared criticize trump instead of using their majority advantage to go after hillary clinton donald trump and a few of his senior aides are prodding extremist conservatives to revolt against the establishment leadership after the election for not defending trump in fact besides assailing ryan for not sticking by trump it is reported that trump said privately that ryan should be made to pay a heavy price for disloyalty to the trump candidacy and during an interview with reuters he complained that the people are very angry with the leadership of this party because this is an election that we will win percent if we had support from the top win or lose there is going to be a major blood letting after the election and the establishment although powerful may face a herculean task to save the party this impending conflict within the gop has been brewing longer than donald trump has been a candidate and it may be why he brought on an experienced anti establishment devotee to run his campaign the chairman of breitbart news stephen bannon had made it one of his primary goals to get paul ryan out as house speaker because he is not a true conservative intent on tearing government down to restructure it into an uber conservative paradise and uber conservative is just a different way of saying a non government according to the koch brothers vision of american libertarianism dont believe it two groups closely aligned with the koch brothers heritage action for america and freedomworks have been pushing republicans as a party to adopt more extremist positions and see the civil war as a stellar opportunity to have greater influence over the partys decisions something establishment types are resisting over the past few days leaders of both koch groups joined extremist conservatives in calling to delay a vote on selecting a candidate to be the next or new speaker of the house something typically occurring directly after the general election in november regardless the outcome according to the chief executive of heritage action michael needham there is going to be hell to pay for establishment republicans if they dont bend to the will of the extremist wing created by the kochs and heavily courted by donald trump mr needham said if the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half i think its going to be just catastrophe another conservative extremist house freedom caucus member and ardent donald trump supporter echoed needhams sentiment and said you cant ignore what millions and millions of people have expressed in this election cycle the dilemma for republicans after the election no matter the outcome is maintaining a semblance of stability as a political party that doesnt seem likely because if trump loses big or small the extremists will unleash whatever level of hell they can muster on the establishment for daring to criticize any of trumps more outrageous and dangerous comments on the stump if trump wins the extremists will be emboldened to purge the party of any disloyal establishment types and it appears that no matter what happens on november it will not be the end of hostilities among republicans the republican party establishment is in for a reckoning with an extremist wing that was once content threatening the full faith and credit of the united states or shutting down the government as a show of anger after four years of internal bickering over what it means to be a true conservative and the past year and a half of incitement by donald trump the republican party faces a serious threat to its long term survival it is a threat that began
by on sun oct at pm the f b i has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters the faintest appearance of using the agency to influence our election is deeply troubling share on twitter print this post the following is an opinion column by r muse as a nation of laws the american people should and most likely do demand that law enforcement officials hew as closely to the law as humanly possible and that goes double for the countrys largest investigative agency one thing every american who has ever watched a law enforcement press conference after a crime has occurred understands is that the public never really knows the details of an investigation regardless the severity of the crime or who the suspect is as an occasional print journalist this author can attest that asking a police spokesman for details during a press conference about what the police are doing or who they are investigating never fails to get a stern scolding about expecting law enforcement to reveal any facts during an investigation for glaringly obvious reasons the scold always includes referral to the agency responsible for charging and prosecuting a crime after the investigation is complete and the results are handed over to the local district attorney apparently the federal bureau of investigation director james comey never got the memo that discussing an investigation publicly is verboten if for no other reason than to maintain the integrity of said investigation and not hamper a possible prosecution however as it turns out mr comey did get a memo from the department of justice in the form of a warning but because he is a law unto himself and his allegiance is to house republicans and not the department of justice he ignored the doj counsel to do a solid for the gop less than two weeks before a presidential election since mr comey cant keep it in his pants or follow long standing law enforcement and investigative rules or take heed to justice department warnings it is incumbent on president barack obama to summarily fire f b i director james comey on the morning of wednesday november why should president obama wait until the day after a general election to fire the partisan director of the f b i so as not to give the appearance of any impropriety or partisanship during a campaign or just prior a presidential election something fbi director james comey is apparently incapable of comprehending this incident just like the one in july when comey broke precedent and convened a press conference in july and then publicly testified before congress to discuss the bureaus ongoing investigation is more than just a breach of precedent it smacks of partisanship for more than one reason first as mentioned above not only did the department of justice warn mr comey that it was inappropriate to discuss an ongoing investigation at all much less so close to an election that warning came after the f b i contacted the doj about going public with information the bureau admitted it had not yet even reviewed that was precisely what comey told his republican buddies in a letter to congress in the letter comey told congressional republicans that the f b i really had no clue whether any of the emails were related to hillary clintons private email server but what he did know for sure was that they appeared to be pertinent even though his agency the f b i had not yet examined them so the real pertinent question is why did mr comey publicly inform congress about emails the agency had not yet examined if he wasnt attempting to inject some partisan drama into the election that might have deleterious impact on the outcome it is just as pertinent a question as demanding to know from mr comey precisely what his motivation was in holding a press conference back in july to discuss the agencys finding on an investigation before the doj weighed in or discuss that investigation in public and before a viciously partisan republican committee in congress and no it was not to defend the bureaus decision not to bring criminal charges against clinton only a brain dead moronic imbecile or partisan republican hack would begin to think that the f b i c i a local sheriff or any police investigative agency has the ability to bring charges to prosecute a violation for dogs sake even the fictional sheriff andy griffiths hapless deputy barney fife was competent enough to comprehend that a district attorneys office or department of justice is tasked with prosecution any violation of the law according to mr comey who was stung by criticism from both democrats and republicans as well as former prosecutors and appeared to be on the defensive he felt obligated to inform republicans in congress even though the bureau really didnt know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails likely because he knew they did not come from hillary clinton as an aside sarah jones has a nifty summary of the email caper the f b i uncovered while investigating serial sexter anthony weiners laptop computer ipad and cellphone and no anthony weiner was not sexting nasty pictures to presidential candidate hillary clinton it doesnt matter what kind of pathetic excuse comey gave for publicly commenting on an ongoing investigation it is virtually impossible to believe he didnt have partisan intents and purposes in publicly alerting house republicans as interim chairwoman of the democratic national committee donna brazile said the f b i has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters even the faintest appearance of using the agencys power to influence our election is deeply troubling ms brazile demanded more information from comey and didnt conceal her concern over comey interfering with the election mr comey claimed very conveniently one might add that as a died in the wool republican he contributed to john mccain and willard romneys presidential

a determined young man with a strong sense of his destiny to save his country from postmodern collapse october culture the global population in was about one billion people today it stands at over seven times that amount with the rapidly growing populations of india and africa expected to increase that to at least nine billion over the coming years readers today are well used to the idea that the global south is densely populated relative to its economic size and area but this was not always the case prior to the collapse of empire europe having undergone thorough industrialization was the most densely populated continent in the world source the world at six billion united nations un dept of economic and social affairs population division europe was also where the worlds social justice movementsliberalism communism and feminismbegan overthrowing the old order of kings castes and courtship with the vulgar and degenerate world we suffer today but why did this happen why did the immense increase of wealth and prosperity not correspond to an increase of human happiness but instead lead to the emasculation of men the breakdown of the family and the disappearance of religion and morality in these series of articles i examine the root causes of this paradox what one can do about it on an individual dietary level and what one can do about it on an individual environmental level i am a strong believer in social change through individual growth and having experienced a dramatic turnaround in the quality of my own personality and success of my outcomes as a result of following these strategies i hope that others can benefit from my knowledge and similarly make themselves into solid men popular mainstream theories for social degeneration many authors have postulated economic reasons for this degenerationindustrialization having deprived men of their primary roles as the masters of nature reduced their worth and attractivenessor utilityin the eyes of women relatedly others argue that technological progress which increased independence and ability for all allowed women to go their own way another popular argument is that increased prosperity leads to reduced incentive for discipliner selection versus k selectionand so prosperous disciplined societies create a generation of lazy youngsters fat off the success of their parents who cause so much havoc with their short sighted policies that their civilization collapses leading to a new generation of disciplined youngsters who again create greatness one example of a short sighted policy would be the feminist political movement which artificially separated woman from man by giving her through affirmative action socially harmful economic independence while all these explanations bear some truth none of them delve into the deeply emotional spiritual human and thus fundamentally biological causes of social degeneration why the mainstream theories are flawed to begin with a healthy man and a healthy woman even with modern technology at their disposal should not so substantially less love and cherish each other as seems to be the case today the proof of this can be seen by examining what it is women do with that technology a modern loose woman uses technology to go to places where men can ravish her even if it gives woman the ability to go it alone technology does not diminish her emotional and biological need for man further the availability of technology does not always translate into its adoptionthe failure of google glass is the emblematic example it does not have to be the case that smartphones are automatically adopted for slut culturethey do not have to automatically lead to female promiscuity anyone familiar with russian or japanese women who have the same technology at hand but a vastly greater sense of restraint and self worth can attest to this fact therefore the technological argument is not sufficient to explain modern degeneracy although it is certainly a necessary condition credit ninaras credit moguphotos to briefly examine the argument that men no longer have utility in the eyes of women a man is not necessarily attractive to a woman if he actually breaks rocks or actually kills other peopleinstead being able to is sufficient therefore the emotional and spiritual inseparability of a healthy woman from her evolved master man remains and will remain eternally true the change in technology and the nature of mens work is not the causal factorinstead the change in preferences of both men and women explains modern degeneracy men hardly today want to lead and possess their woman and women do not respond to weakling men let us examine the r k selection argument if it were the case that wealth and ease begat indiscipline automatically it would be true that the rich produce weak and undisciplined progeny this may seem like a truism today viewed through the lens of the post industrial overpopulated paris hilton west but in societies of the past it was certainly not the caserather historically the opposite has been true the weak were poor because they were undisciplined and the strong were rich because they were disciplined the poor raised weak and hence undisciplined children while the rich raised strong and disciplined ones so the cycle continued and over time aristocracies formed an extreme version of this disciplined rich mentality can be seen in modern british farmers many of whom financially wealthy and prosperous drive old beaten suvs reuse clothes and generally minimize expenditures while it cannot be denied that even the modern rich have in general become mostly degenerate this is in my opinion a symptom of a deeper malaise that affects society across the board therefore i do not rely on the technological or economic explanations for societal degeneration i view these theories as descriptive of passing symptoms or trends and not timelessly causal truths int the population growth nutritional depletion and environmental pollution theory of societal degeneration having outlined and accounted for the above theories i argue instead that the degeneration of society is caused mostly by the biological degeneration of the human being that

prominent opposition figure and anti corruption campaigner alexei navalny has announced he plans to run for the presidency with criminal charges against him suspended however russias experts are divided in their assessments of his chances in the presidential elections prominent opposition figure and anti corruption campaigner alexei navalny has announced he plans to run for the presidency with criminal charges against him suspended however russias experts are divided in their assessments of his chances in the presidential elections russian opposition activist alexei navalny during an interview to the associated press in moscow photo ap last week russias supreme court suspended the criminal charges against russias well known opposition activist and anti corruption campaigner alexei navalny who was accused of embezzlement of assets belonging to the state run timber company kirovles the decision came after the european court of human rights reviewed and endorsed navalnys complaint about the trial which the defendant found unfair and politically motivated the russian authorities are to reassess their decision in light of the february ruling which called for navalny to be fully acquitted and for russia to pay each to him and his co defendant pyotr ofitserov plus legal costs also read khodorkovsky drums up support in europe for an alternative to putin all this means that the criminal charges against navalny are at least suspended if not canceled the accused is rehabilitated and has chances to stand for russias presidency in navalny confirmed his presidential bid last week and has left his intention to run as an alternative candidate in no doubt russian oligarch and opposition activist mikhail khodorkovsky who now lives in london has approved navalnys candidacy meanwhile the kremlin is reticent about the anti corruption campaigners intentions to run for the presidency this question is not on our agenda now said kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov the presidential elections will take place in too early for forecasts meanwhile experts argue that it is too early to talk about the presidential elections and the chances of their candidates for example democratic activist and politician leonid gozman believes that navalny has enough political heft but the fact that he is associated with the opposition will hinder his chances alexei navalny is a celebrity he said he is a well known figure with an interesting history which has its own flaws and advantages gozman argues that t he opposition candidates major disadvantage is an unfavorable political environment within the country and people distrust of opposition with him fighting against those at the helm however navalny might be able to turn this disadvantage into an advantage and earn political credentials not only inside but also outside russia according to gozman navalnys anti corruption political platform is a valuable and very meaningful asset which he will be able to use in his favor likewise mikhail vinogradov the chairman of the petersburg politics foundation argues that navalny has enough political heft and can be compared with russian president vladimir putin to a certain extent navalny is the no politician in russias public politics he told russia direct thats why hes more effective and interesting than the leaders of the parliamentary parties which have been competing with each other for so long he has well developed political instincts in addition he has much better chances in the elections than those retirees who head the parliamentary parties from the point of view of populist potential putin and navalny are comparably equal vinogradov is sure that navalny is capable of recruiting a large number of supporters in a short period of time as indicated by the results of the moscow mayoral elections when he won more than percent of the vote however at that time he focused primarily on the protest electorate today there are a lot of people who are not satisfied with the current situation in the country and navalny is capable of winning their votes as well as the votes of those who support the authorities vinogradov speculates however it remains to be seen if the opposition activist will be able to use his tactics to help win nationwide support this is one of the major intrigues said vinogradov a dose of legitimacy for russias elections at the same time gozman argues that the participation of navalny in the presidential elections will make them more interesting and less artificial his bid is useful for the elections themselves he said this means that a campaign with navalny will look more real than one without him also read hawks vs doves who will dominate in the kremlin before the elections gozman gives an example of the mayoral campaign which he sees as more natural because navalny challenged sergei sobyanin and encouraged him to change his tactics in contrast alexei mukhin the general director of the center for political information a moscow based think tank argues that the participation of navalny will be a bigger disadvantage for regional campaigns rather than an advantage according to him the opposition figure will bring instability and disorder while pursuing a sole goal self promotion navalny is a professional troublemaker he told russia direct he is likely to look for a trade off with the authorities for example he will withdraw his bid if the kremlin offers him some political privileges it is a matter of a pure political calculation he is not a populist he is a political strategist mukhin added he is a sort of dealer within politics and he can use skills to earn political points moreover a refusal to register navalny as a presidential candidate will be a big asset for him because it will give him a reason to claim that the authorities are afraid of him it may strengthen his political heft populist or not unlike mukhin gozman sees navalny as a potential populist in the upcoming presidential campaign however it is too early to talk about specific positions or a platform he is going to stick since it is unclear what kind of environment the elections will be held
on november the intercept headlined here the problem with the story connecting russia to donald trump email server and the reporting team of sam biddle lee fang micah lee and morgan marquis boire revealed that slates franklin foer published a story thats been circulating through the dark web and various newsrooms since summertime an enormous eyebrow raising claim that donald trump uses a secret server to communicate with russia that claim resulted in an explosive night of twitter confusion and misinformation the gist of the slate article is dramatic incredible even cybersecurity researchers found that the trump organization used a secret box configured to communicate exclusively with alfa bank russias largest commercial bank this is a story that any reporter in our election cycle would drool over and drool foer did the intercept team concluded their detailed analysis of the evidence by saying could it be that donald trump used one of his shoddy empires spam marketing machines one with his last name built right into the domain name to secretly collaborate with a moscow bank sure at this moment theres literally no way to disprove that but theres also literally no way to prove it and such a grand claim carries a high burden of proof without more evidence it would be safer to assume that this is exactly what it looks like a company that trump has used since to outsource his hotel spam is doing exactly that otherwise were all making the exact same speculation about the unknown thats caused untold millions of voters to believe hillarys deleted emails might have contained benghazi cover up pdfs given equal evidence for both go with the less wacky story however they failed to dig deeper to explain what could have motivated this smear of trump was it just sloppiness on the part of slate and of foer hardly it was anything but unintentional a core part of the democratic partys campaign for hillary clinton consists of her claim that donald trump is secretly a russian agent this is an updated version of the republican joseph r mccarthys campaign to root communists out of the federal government and of the john birch societys accusation even against the republican president dwight eisenhower that with regard to eisenhower it is difficult to avoid raising the question of deliberate treason neoconservatives in both parties are the heirs of the republican partys hard right which now even decades after the end of communism and the soviet union hate russia above all of their other passions neoconservatism has emerged as todays republican partys establishment and theyve always viewed russia to be americas chief enemy and they have favored the overthrow of any nations leader who is friendly toward russia such as saddam hussein muammar gaddafi viktor yanukovych and bashar al assad hatred and demonization of russia is the common core of neoconservatism the post cold war extension of joseph r mccarthy and the john birch society both slate and especially foer have long pedigrees as democratic party neoconservatives champions of u s invasions otherwise called pr agents promoting the products and services that a few giant and exclusive military corporations such as raytheon lockheed martin dyncorp and the carlyle group offer to the u s federal government ill deal here only with foer not with his latest employer foer wrote in the new york times on october against isolationist republicans who regretted having supported george w bushs invasion of iraq and he headlined about them there once again america first equating non neoconservative republicans with essentially the pro fascist isolationists of the he concluded that they would come to regret their regret conservatives could soon find themselves retracing buckley steps wrestling all over again with their isolationist instincts thats how far right franklin foer is hes to the right of those republicans on june foer in a tediously long badly written and argued article in new york magazine the source of the trouble described the downfall of the new york timess leading stenographer for george w bushs lies to invade iraq their reporter judith miller he closed by concluding that the source of the trouble was that miller was simply too earnest and tried too hard not that she was a stenographer to power people like miller with her outsize journalistic temperament of ambition obsession and competitive fervor relying on people like ahmad chalabi with his smooth affable exterior retailing false information for his own motives for the benefit of people reading a newspaper trying to get at the truth of whats what on december when the question of whether to bomb iran was being debated by neoconservatives foer who then was the editor of the leading democratic party neoconservative magazine the new republic headlined in his magazine identity crisis neocon v neocon on iran and he introduced a supposed non neocon from the supposedly non neocon brookings institution kenneth pollack to comment upon the conflict among neocons in part the lack of neocon consensus on whether to as john mccain was to so poetically put it bomb bomb bomb iran can be attributed to the nature of the problem nobody not the council on foreign relations not john kerrys brain trust has designed a plausible policy to walk iran back from the nuclear brink or as kenneth m pollack concludes in his new book the persian puzzle this is a problem from hell with no good solution but actually both pollack and brookings are democratic party neocons themselves and among the leading proponents of invading iraq had been not only pollack but brookingss michael ohanlon brookings had no prominent opponent of invading iraq the real reason why neocons wanted to conquer both iraq and iran was that both countries leaders were friendly towards russia and were opposed by the saud family who own saudi arabia which family quietly worked not only with the u s government but with israels government against both iraq and iran as well as against syria those three nations all
chicago cubs first baseman anthony rizzo stepped up to the microphone during the world series rally in grant park and choked up as he spoke about what it meant to be able to be on a team with the year old catcher david ross who was a mentor to him rizzo ross and center fielder dexter fowler stood shoulder to shoulder singing that silly jingle the one that goes go cubs go go cubs go hey chicago whaddya say cubs are gonna win today it all really hit home for me as a cubs fan life is full of things that bring us joy but carry unsavory aspects to them the cubs team is owned by tom ricketts a man who donated million to donald trump and bears a frightening resemblance to ted cruz so much that one might think ricketts was his brother the cubs also signed aroldis chapman a closer who served a game suspension this year for domestic abuse cubs executives and city officials are responsible for some pretty rapid gentrification in the area of wrigleyville with that said almost all of the cubs players had fun with each other and never let the pressures of fan fueled folklore around curses defeat them that made the postseason truly blissful this is where i wrote thomas g my fathers name on the wall i had to squeeze it in near the brick sidewalk i live about seven blocks from wrigley field i went down there multiple times in the past week the day after they won i went down to wrigley field to write my fathers name on the stadium wall and join thousands of other cubs fans in paying tribute to family who died before they could see the cubs win a world series in the immediate hours after their sweet victory i took my life into my own hands and went down to the area around clark and addison to snap a photo of the stadium sign with world series champions emblazoned on it on sunday right before game down in the series i stood outside the friendly confines and said to myselfand to my father even though i dont really believe in this kind of stuff this was going to be the game where they turned it all around that they could still come back also i bought a copy of the chicago sun times after each game even the editions with the devastating headlines on game and game because it was important to have the full story i can now put those papers side by side and forever see the journey the chicago cubs took and relive the heart wrenching and euphoric moments that took place this seismic sports eventending the longest championship drought in american sports historygripped me like so many other americans it taught me once again the importance of slowing down life and reveling in these kind of experiences which i know is easy for me to say i did not have a boss who told me i had to work a night shift or else i would be fired i did not have to worry about what i was going to do to feed my children or prevent my home from being foreclosed i did not have to be concerned about an array of disadvantages people should not have to confront on a daily basis but all too often we just go go go and lose sight of those little things that can make us feel a bit more content in life or we reject slowing down to appreciate something amazing that magnificently disrupts our routine additionally during an election that has smothered and shaken many of us the perfect antidote was watching this team play baseball players like rizzo let their guard down and made themselves vulnerable in front of us they were on a world stage where they perhaps may have thought they needed to maintain a level of toughness or masculinity rizzo on the other hand as he now famously told ross during game was an emotional wreck and he did not seem to be ashamed of making that confession many of us were emotional wrecks everyone watching this series felt like emotional wrecks at some point not everyone watched all moments of the games unless you happened to be in the select group of people that possibly had tickets to all the games ill never forget how ross told rizzo it was only going to get worse in the inning he was right the cleveland indians tied the game in the acrobatic second baseman javier baez had a mishap with a bunt that could have been costly in the and fans had to bow their heads and hope chapman would not make a mistake even though manager joe maddon clearly overworked him the past few games statue outside wrigley field of ernie banks the weather went from great to pouring rain there was a delay that delay gave the team a kind of gift a bit of a halftime to find their composure to go out and win in the inning so rizzo the emotional wreck stepped up to the microphone during the rally and gave this very real and human tribute to a mentor grandpa ross who played his last game on november gramps and i sat down a few years ago in an offseason before his last season with boston he was a free agent and we just talked rizzo shared we had the same agent were talking and i say to my agent man this is what the chicago cubs need he is exactly what we need to bring everything together obviously a lot of pieces came through with that but he taught myself personally how to become a real winner hes like a brother to me fighting back tears rizzo continued hes taught me a lot in lifeon the field off the field how to be a better person im forever grateful
it was rare for poet and singer songwriter leonard cohen to venture into the realm of politics however quite a few of his songs including some of his love songs were infused with a bleakness that confronted morality and the darkness of humanity he also wrote a song of hope and possibility about the experiment of democracy in the united states that perhaps takes on a new kind of resonance in the wake of the election of donald trump cohen was asked in if songs can offer solutions to political problems he replied i think the song itself is a kind of solution and so to pay tribute to a troubadour who died at and whose artistic work only seemed to get better as he aged and his voice grew deeper here is a retrospective on some of the more philosophical and sociopolitical songs he composed joan of arc cohen declared in an interview for rolling stone in women are really strong you notice how strong they are well let them take over let us be what were supposed to be gossips musicians wrestlers the premise being there can be no free men unless there are free women he believed it was just for women to gain control of the world with that context this elegiac narrative takes on greater gravitas it consists of a dialogue between joan of arc and the fire as she is burnt at the stake the womens movement was flourishing at the time and cohen saw joan of arc as a symbol of courage yet he also recognized she may have been lonely because she had to disguise herself as a male soldier and he imagined what it was like to fight english domination of france and in her final moments face down the fact that she would never return to what could be considered an ordinary life dance me to the end of love during a cbc radio interview in cohen said the song came from hearing and reading or knowing that in the death camps during the holocaust beside the crematoria the string quartet would be pressed into performance while this horror unfolded cohen sings in the opening dance me to your beauty with a burning violin dance me through the panic til im gathered safely in lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove the song represents an embrace of passionate acts in the face of atrocities and death if it be your will this is a truly grim song in which cohen is probably using the specter of a benevolent oppressor or fascism as a metaphor for the next stage of a relationship and yet the lyrics are subtle enough that cohen may be addressing morality and how easy it is to convince men to carry out heinous acts he sings all your children here in their rags of light in our rags of light all dressed to kill and end this night if it be your will first we take manhattan the song is about terrorism or militant extremism it is told from the perspective of an individual who tried to work within the system in order to change it that failed now the individual has taken solace in the beauty of his weapons and turned to manhattan and to berlin to make his or her mark in a interview for xm radio he said theres something about terrorism that ive always admired the fact that there are no alibis or no compromises that position is always very attractive i dont like it when its manifested on the physical plane i dont really enjoy the terrorist activities but psychic terrorism i remember there was a great poem by irving layton that i once read ill give you a paraphrase of it it was well you guys blow up an occasional airline and kill a few children here and there he says but our terrorists jesus freud marx einstein the whole world is still quaking cohen meant albeit in a very cynical way is the philosophies of these people have such a history of being used to justify horrible acts he never engages with the subject fully but cohens song clearly approaches the issue of state sponsored political violence versus political violence of the individual everybody knows it is one of the most well known songs he ever recorded the wry cynicism diagnoses the realities of a cruel world in the neoliberal age of austerity the opening lyrics are exceptionally appropriate everybody knows that the dice are loaded everybody rolls with their fingers crossed everybody knows that the war is over everybody knows the good guys lost everybody knows the fight was fixed the poor stay poor the rich get rich thats how it goes everybody knows cohen sings everybody knows that youre in trouble those in charge of the social order are indifferent to the pain and suffering of the masses but are the owners and politicians capable of maintaining control because everybody also knows that it is coming apart democracy cohen described in an interview with paul zollo that he wrote the song after the berlin wall came down everyone was saying democracy is coming to the east and i was like that gloomy fellow who always turns up at a party to ruin the orgy or something and i said i dont think its going to happen that way i dont think this is such a good idea i think a lot of suffering will be the consequence of this wall coming down seems strikingly backward but it motivated cohen to ask where is democracy really coming he thought there may be more democracy coming to the united states from a love of america he wrote a song that is really about the irony of america a song of deep intimacy and affirmation of the experiment of democracy in this country he added this is really where the experiment is unfolding this is really where
ok theoretically everything will go according to plan and donald trump will be the next president but technically the election hasnt really taken place yet presidential electors of the mystified electoral college must still actually vote for the president and there isnt anything to keep them from voting their conscience and choosing someone other than donald trump moreover it appears that there is an active effort to flip the electoral college to deny trump the presidency and toss the white house to either hillary or a gop loyalist the nevertrump crowd and plenty of bitter hillary supporters are still hoping for a coup though even they admit it is a long shot completely unprecedented and anything but likely according to the blaze donald trump may have won the electoral votes necessary to win the white house but he hes likely going to lose the popular vote to democratic candidate hillary clinton and now two electors have launched a last minute effort to convince their colleagues to abandon the president elect this is a long shot its a hail mary bret chiafolo a washington state elector who previously pledged not to vote for clinton told politico monday however i do see situations where when weve already had two or three republican electors state publicly they didnt want to vote for trump how many of them have real issues with donald trump in private chiafolo along with colorado elector micheal baca have launched what they call a moral electors movement in hopes of convincing of their republican colleagues to deny trump their votes should they succeed in their radical effort the presidential decision would be thrown to the republican controlled house of representatives the electoral college consists of members who are expected to convene in their respective state capitals on dec to formally vote for the next president baca said he hopes the move launches a serious national discussion about abolishing the electoral college which would require either a constitutional amendment or legislation in several states the speculation is that if this maneuver were to be successful the gop led congress could be persuaded not to choose hillary but to write in a selection for a party loyalist like mitt romney or john kasich maybe even a bush of course there have also been reports that team hillary has been hard at work attempting to persuade electors to switch their votes in the hope however desperate that they can still flip the election and take the white house we are calling on the electors to ignore their states votes and cast their ballots for secretary clinton why mr trump is unfit to serve the larger issue here is that the system is badly broken the people are harshly divided along demographic and political lines and the future is gambling on extreme versions of itself larger than life candidates and bizarre back door maneuvers in attempt to hack the system and bend it in one direction or another trump has taken his place on the stage in a thunderous revolt of the people but his legacy will be tested out the gates by the heavy pressures of washington lobbyists intrigue on the part of political insiders and the cults of opposition that are springing up in response to his controversial journey to the white house the entire political establishment have been knocked off their perch though their hold on power has not necessarily been loosened a whole new era is born and it remains to be seen how it will play out its not over yet they are probably still trying to steal the election calls for electoral college to ignore will of people clinton insider confesses trump protests are just more pre paid soros riots to stir unrest beware of the shadow government ron paul advises president elect trump surrounded by bankers wall st insiders banging on the door to get in draining the swamp violent revolution if trump lets them down people remain poised for angry revolt roberts
november more than a few preppers feel that as long as they can provide food shelter water and basic medical needs for themselves and their families nothing more is required other preppers may feel that self defense power generation education and machine repair are skills that will be required in the post crisis world sadly many preppers and also off gridders tend to ignore or underestimate the need to have a computer that can be used to help make it easier to survive in all likelihood these are also the people most likely to have serious problems in the post crisis world because they do not have a computer available to help meet a range of goals computers and prepping can get along a computer cannot hunt a deer for you boil water or make a pair of shoes obviously on the other hand any computer with a connection to the internet can help you find out how to do these things and much more when you find good information it is also very easy to store those files on your computer so that you can read them and work with them whenever you want and if you are in a situation where internet access is still available you can use your computer to contact friends and loved ones as well as people that might be able to help you get through a crisis then you can certainly relate to the quandary of many preppers that are finding out it is becoming impossible to make or obtain raw materials that would be needed in a major crisis scenario on the other side of the equation many of the items you need for basic prepping can still be purchased online all you really need is a prepaid debit card and an internet connection so that you can find websites where you can place your orders not only will you be able to get the supplies you need you will also have a much wider selection of other goods to choose from regardless of whether you are interested in the best quality gun cleaning kits need a certain type of fishing reel or need good quality vintage hand tools you can find them all online in fact even if you are disabled you may be able to find customized materials and tools that have been modified to meet your needs most people dont realize just how important it is to network with preppers from diverse geographic regions and make plans for bugging out that include those friends and connections consider what would happen if an earthquake or hurricane strikes your area if you only have friends and family in a local or small area chances are everyone will be affected if you have friends in other states that might be able to offer temporary shelter or help you make a new start then you will be well ahead of the game in these times and beyond both money and barter systems are vital for exchanging needed goods and services a computer is very important for expanding your trade and marketing options it is also very important for securing alternative currencies that may play a vital role in remaining solvent in the face of currency collapse most people would be truly amazed at how easy it is for the average consumer to secure foreign currencies keep a good supply of them and even use them as down and dirty form of currency trading or flipping the tough choice on the best device obsolete devices may still be very useful because certain older technologies are easier to work with and may be safer than newer devices that are routinely overclocked or are based on unstable hardware platforms if you are interested in newer devices here are some categories brands and models that you can start off with for each category of device desktops if you are primarily interested in a conventional desktop computer my own experience leads me to believe the best option is to build the computer yourself so that you know exactly what parts are being used and how best to optimize the bios settings since modern computer chips tend to run hot it is very important to provide plenty of ventilation and cooling options inside the case if your cpu and motherboard kit come with sub par heat conducting gel do not hesitate to find the best on the market it is also very useful to add extra fans and other cooling devices right inside the case always remember the cooler you can keep the chips during operation the lower your chances of erratic freeze ups or even ruining the chips insofar as other vital parts such as hard drives cd dvd drives and video cards it truly depends on your personal tastes you will need a dedicated video card to gain access to these specialized chips that will reduce wear on the cpu and enhance computer performance at the same time be sure to study gamer forums and video editing forums to find out which video cards work best with specific cpu and motherboard combinations a bad fit between these parts can truly be a disaster memory cards are yet another tricky yet vital area of the computer that you will need to think about this is also one area where only the best will do it is better to go with the fastest cards that the motherboard will take and also from the best rated vendor laptops unlike desktop computers you will have far less control over what parts are found inside the case before purchasing a laptop be sure to find out the model number of the cpu and motherboard from there you will need to look up the chipsets to find out what the optimal clock speeds are i have seen more than one laptop burn up at around the year mark because a sub part mother board with a slower timing chip was paired with a

editors note disgusting this country just gets more and more corrupt by the day its insane pretty soon it will collapse of its own weight under so much disgusting corruption the pennsylvania legislature has passed a law prohibiting the release of officers names for up to days after a police related death has occurred it was backed by philadelphia police unions and will become law if signed by democratic governor tom wolf the measure passed thursday after the republican controlled legislature voted along party lines if the bill becomes law it will prevent public officials from releasing the names of officers involved in shootings which cause death or serious bodily injury for up to days after the incident or until the conclusion of an official investigation the bill hb was sponsored by state rep martina white and is a direct contradiction of the philadelphia police departments policy of releasing names within hours of a shooting the hour rule was created by the department of justice and put into place by former police commissioner charles h ramsey in after it was recommended speaking in support of the rule at the time ramsey said i dont think you can reasonably expect to shoot people and remain anonymous however the influential philadelphia police union has defended hb were just asking to put a lid on the boiling pot until things calm down especially if its an investigation that could lead to protests in the community john mcnesby president of the strong union told the pittsburgh post gazette white claims the bill is needed due to the dangers faced by police officers i was watching the television and just saw how officers are being gunned down and other officers in different states had been subjected to harassment and the very things that they are trying to protect citizens like ourselves from experiencing and to me the hour rule is really just an arbitrary number white told the post gazette however neither mcnesby nor white could identify any instances of officers or their families being harmed due to being publicly identified mcnesby told the post gazette that he was unaware of any direct threats that had taken place but said thats what were looking to stop before it becomes a reality the american civil liberties union of pennsylvania has criticized the bill calling it a policy that will heighten tensions between the police and the communities they serve and accusing it of being completely tone deaf to the needs of communities that are impacted by police brutality rep margo davidson has also spoken out against the bill saying it undermines the bridges that have been built between law enforcement and communities of color she added that this legislation will do nothing but breed suspicion davidson along with many other philadelphia democrats opposed the bill in the vote governor wolf has yet to comment on whether or not he will sign the bill which passed the senate and house with a veto proof majority if wolf still decides to veto an override of that veto would only be able to take place after the next election read also war on cops debunked more cops died by accident than violence in contributed by of

yesterday we reported that the fbi has found tens of thousands of emails belonging to huma adein on anthony weiners computer raising questions how practical it is that any conclusive finding will be available or made by the fbi in the few days left before the elections as the wsj adds the review will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are work related emails between huma abedin a close clinton aide and the estranged wife of mr weiner and state department officials how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the federal bureau of investigation and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the clinton email probe which fbi officials call midyear those emails stretched back years these people said and were on a laptop that both mr weiner and ms abedin used and that hadnt previously come up in the clinton email probe ms abedin said in late august that the couple were separating the fbi had searched the computer while looking for child pornography people familiar with the matter said but the warrant they used didnt give them authority to search for matters related to mrs clintons email arrangement at the state department mr weiner has denied sending explicit or indecent messages to the teenager as reported yesterday it appears that there are potentially tens of thousands of abedin linked emails on weiners computer in their initial review of the laptop the metadata showed many messages apparently in the thousands that were either sent to or from the private email server at mrs clintons home that had been the focus of so much investigative effort for the fbi senior fbi officials decided to let the weiner investigators proceed with a closer examination of the metadata on the computer and report back to them the wsj then connects the dots between how the weiner emails were linked to the clinton reopening of the clinton probe despite loretta lynchs and the dojs vocal urges not to do so mr comey was given an update decided to go forward with the case and notified congress on friday with explosive results senior justice department officials had warned mr comey that telling congress would violate well established policies against overt actions that could affect an election and some within the fbi have been unhappy at mr comeys repeated public statements on the probe going back to his first press conference on the subject in july but wait it gets better mr mcauliffe had supported dr mccabe in the hopes she and a handful of other democrats might help win a majority in the state senate giving mr mcauliffe more sway in the state capitol dr mccabe lost her race last november and democrats failed to win their majority fbi officials have said mr mccabe had no role in the clinton email probe until he became deputy director and there was no conflict of interest because by then his wifes campaign was over which brings us to the second big topic the clinton foundation and how the doj made sure that particular probe never made the light of day at the same time as the clinton server was being investigated other clinton related investigations were under way within the fbi and they have been the subject of internal debate for months early this year four fbi field officesnew york los angeles washington and little rock ark were collecting information about the clinton foundation to see if there was evidence of financial crimes or influence peddling according to people familiar with the matter the wsj touches on something fascinating los angeles agents had picked up information about the clinton foundation from an unrelated public corruption case and had issued some subpoenas for bank records related to the foundation these people said so where did that trail go apparently nowhere the washington field office was probing financial relationships involving mr mcauliffe before he became a clinton foundation board member these people said mr mcauliffe has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer has said the probe is focused on whether he failed to register as an agent of a foreign entity the fbi field office in new york had done the most work on the clinton foundation case and received help from the fbi field office in little rock the people familiar with the matter said in february fbi officials made a presentation to the justice department according to these people by all accounts the meeting didnt go well that was one of the weirdest meetings ive ever been to one participant told others afterward according to people familiar with the matter needless to say the probe into the foundation faded but back to the clinton probe according to a person familiar with the probes on aug a senior justice department official called mr mccabe to voice his displeasure at finding that new york fbi agents were still openly pursuing the clinton foundation probe despite the departments refusal to allow more aggressive investigative methods in the case mr mccabe said agents still had the authority to pursue the issue as long as they didnt use those methods at this point a question emerges did mccabe seek to defend or press on with a clinton probe mr mccabes defenders in the agency said that following the call he repeated the instruction that he had given earlier in the clinton foundation investigation agents were to keep pursuing the work within the authority they had others further down the fbi chain of command however said agents were given a much starker instruction on the case stand down when agents questioned why they werent allowed to take more aggressive steps they said they were told the order had come from the deputy directormr mccabe others familiar with the matter deny mr mccabe or any other senior fbi official gave such a stand down instruction at this point the two probes into hillarys email and the clinton foundation converged for agents who already

poll after poll shows hillary clinton leading clinton up by four points hillary up by six points clinton leads by points is the latest headline from the washington post but these polls most of them have huge problems theyre oversampling democrats this happened a couple of days ago in arizona a state that has more republicans than democrats but whose poll had many many more democrats polled the story for the poll starts out pretending that everything is perfectly legitimate with days to go hillary clinton holds a six point edge over donald trump among an electorate fixated on the campaign and nervous about their candidate losing according to a new washington post abc news tracking poll then it shows a graphic showing just how far ahead hillary is see hillarys line is in orange and trumps is in gray she must be winning but theres a problem with the poll like with so many other polls that have come out recently theyre conveniently asking many more democrats than republicans heres a link to their methodology if you look at page youll see exactly who theyre polling of the people they polled percent identify as democrats and just percent as republicans this is bad enough but they also have percent self declared independents answering the poll how do independents vote gee who knows the pollsters do now they have to justify the fact that there are so many more democrats than republicans at the polls and of course there are simply not percent of independents going to the polls theyre going to choose a republican or a democrat except for the tiny percent who will choose a third party candidate so heres the paragraph justifying their methodology this survey uses statistical weighting procedures to account for deviations in the survey sample from known population characteristics which helps correct for differential survey participation and random variation in samples the overall adult sample is weighted to correct for differential probabilities of selection among individuals who are landline only cell phone only or dual users results are also weighted match the demographic makeup of the population by sex region age education and race ethnicity according to the latest current population survey march social and economic supplement by age race ethnicity sex and education party id was weighted to the average of the most recent post abc surveys did you understand that thats okay because they do and they want you to trust them the only poll that counts is the one that you are going to participate in on nov and they dont get to over sample or account for deviations they count the votes so make sure your vote is counted

july comments a former virginia police officer and u s navy veteran whose trial for murder begins this week told a witness this is my second one after killing an unarmed year old black man in april while unclear whether or not the jarring statement amounted to a boast the camera on ex portsmouth officer stephen rankins taser recorded him saying this to a walmart employee mere seconds after he fatally shot unarmed teen and alleged shoplifter william chapman in the stores parking lot in april rankin had indeed killed another unarmed man kirill denyakin under circumstances similarly and sufficiently questionable to earn three years administrative leave just four years prior to the shooting for which he now stands accused of first degree murder during the final pretrial hearing on tuesday the guardian reported rankins lead defense attorney james broccoletti argued the former officers statement is not probative of anything in an unsuccessful attempt to have it suppressed prosecutors countered to judge johnny e morrison they should not have to sanitize the evidence surrounding the fatal shooting the defendant made the comment not just in the presence and earshot of a witness but to the witness argued commonwealths attorney stephanie n morales who heads the case against rankin although morrison had previously disallowed direct statements to jurors concerning rankins fatal shooting of denyakin as the guardian noted it now appears the officers prior use of deadly force will play an albeit limited role in the prosecutions case troubling details about the killing of unarmed year old kazakhstani cook kirill denyakin on april would seem to suggest a glib tone in the officers later statement to the walmart employee rankin responded to a call about denyakin drunkenly pounding on the door of a residence where he had been staying with friends alleging the cook reached for his waistband and then charged toward him rankin shot denyakin times in the chest and limbs as the free thought project reported no weapons were recovered on denyakins body or at the scene but when the mans family filed a million civil suit against the officer the situation took a dark turn defending his use of deadly force rankin who had chosen a photograph of a dead serb who had been lynched by the nazis in as his facebook profile picture took to a local newspapers website posting roughly comments derisively attacking denyakins character and insulting his familys attempt to seek compensation writing mil wont buy your boy back let alone a habitual drunk working as a hotel cook weeks prior to that deadly interaction one of the officers supervisors cautioned senior commanders rankin was dangerous and likely to harm someone further revelations included facebook posts in which the cop referred to his firearms case as rankins box of vengeance a grand jury refused to indict rankin for the denyakins killing and though the department placed him on administrative leave for nearly three years it took just over a year after his return to active duty for rankin to fatally shoot chapman under circumstances suspicious enough to now stand accused of murder on the morning of april portsmouth walmart employees summoned police to report a shoplifter rankin responded and confronted year old chapman in the stores parking lot several witnesses reported seeing rankin attempting to handcuff the teen but their observations of what happened next differ to some degree two construction workers said chapman broke free from the officer knocking his taser to the ground but in speaking to separate reporters afterward one described the man whaling on the officer the other noted the pairs subsequent interaction was a tussle in which the teen had not been close enough to physically strike rankin in a report pathologists noted rankin would have been at least inches away from chapman when he was shot and the medical examiner did not find gunpowder burns or residue suggestive of a point blank or near point blank shooting no stolen items were listed among the victims personal effects further body cam footage recorded rankin holding his taser but abruptly and perhaps conveniently if not outright suspiciously stopped for the seconds surrounding the shooting only to pick up after the deadly interaction with the taser on the ground chapmans familys attorney jon babineau recounting what he was told for pilot online said in december the video was operational up until just before the shooting and then it was not operational for about seconds though an unnamed source told him the gap had been caused by a power source issue and did not necessarily believe the tape had been edited in september a grand jury indicted rankin for murder and the illegal use of a firearm rankin has since been terminated from the portsmouth force and continues to maintain his innocence jury selection for the murder trial is slated to begin this morning share google fred ziffel anytime the calculated death of a human being is forced by another knowing these actions are not absolutely necessary and there was no other immediate threat to life the act of taking or ending said life becomes murder who the perpetrator is or what his her occupational profession is is totally irrelevant murder is not justifiable i hope they prosecute this vigorously and relentlessly bill allyn justice system reform list america has a serious institutionalized systemic law enforcement problem over the last decades our law enforcement has become increasingly militarized putting every citizen at risk of being shot and killed for nothing more than reaching for their wallet as instructed or less this may increase safety for police officers but at the expense of making american citizens far less safe which is the exact opposite of the goals of law enforcement we need to create systems that bring back accountability within every
email the arizona market is the poster child for the problems the obamacare exchanges are experiencing nationally milliman inc actuary tom snook told the wall street journal it would be difficult to argue with snooks contention while individual insurance premiums are rising by an average of percent across the country next year arizonas premiums are set to grow by double or triple that with some locales experiencing rate hikes topping percent meanwhile for all intents and purposes arizonans have but one insurance carrier from whom to purchase coverage and one county nearly ended up with no carriers at all it wasnt supposed to turn out like this arizona was originally the poster child for the affordable care acts success the first year the aca exchanges opened for business the state had eight insurers offering a wide variety of plans at low prices in part because of an expectation that the federal government would bail them out if they suffered losses a society of actuaries report suggested that the arizona individual insurance market could more than double growing to consumers with more than of them buying through the exchange wrote the journal the health care costs of the newer customer base would be around higher than the old one it suggested instead as has been the case throughout the nation americans made health insurance decisions based on their own needs rather than following the best laid plans of politicians and bureaucrats those with pre existing conditions took advantage of the acas mandates that insurers cover them at rates comparable to those of their healthy neighbors while those neighbors balked at buying coverage that was more expensive and less generous than they desired the result enrollment fell well below expectations with only people buying exchange plans this year while the cost of covering those enrollees was vastly greater than expected around higher on average than individual members before the health law jeff stelnik senior vice president of blue cross blue shield of arizona told the journal to make matters worse the bailouts never came through the federal risk corridor program was supposed to transfer profits from successful insurers to unsuccessful ones but so few insurers made money on the exchanges that the program could only cover percent of losses congress refused to make up the difference from general revenues in arizona as elsewhere this could only have one outcome fewer insurers and higher premiums although the number of insurers increased to in it returned to eight last year insurers were forced to raise rates each year blue cross blue shield hiked premiums by percent in but it still wasnt enough to break even let alone turn a profit the states obamacare co op went under in and major insurers began pulling out of the state en masse this year unitedhealth group and aetna left entirely blue cross blue shield and health net both announced they would exit the exchanges in maricopa county home of phoenix and pinal county that in turn would have left pinal county without a single exchange insurer but after state and federal regulators expressed their concern for pinal residents blue cross decided to remain in pinal county after all stelnik told the journal for every arizona county will have only one insurer on its exchange save for pima county home to tucson which will have two however according to the new york times only health net is offering a full range of plans in pima county while blue cross is solely selling catastrophic plans for people under considering that the aca also allows people to remain on their parents insurance until age it seems likely that few will take advantage of blue crosss offer there are no choices really for anybody in maricopa county phoenix resident ken hoag told the arizona republic the lack of choice is like having empty shelves no food in a third world country do i live in cuba of course with mounting losses and no competition its hardly surprising that premiums for individual plans are skyrocketing blue cross blue shield is raising its rates by an average of percent health net an average of percent in phoenix premiums are going up a whopping percent republic columnist laurie roberts notes that a typical year old arizonan buying the second lowest silver plan will see premiums soar by percent if that year old makes a year hell pay nearly percent of his gross income for insurance even with an obamacare subsidy if he makes over hell pay a jaw dropping a month for insurance up from this year that subsidy as usual is the ace obamacare supporters always have up their sleeve the rate hikes while huge arent so bad because the subsidies will cover most of the extra cost they argue that may be so roberts observed but how sustainable is a system in which insurance premiums rise by percent in a year or even percent a year besides subsidies dont cover all the added expense hoags wife had to buy a new plan for because her old one is being discontinued while her new plans benefits are comparable to those of her old plan she is going to be stuck for an extra a month in premiums despite her subsidy and what of arizonans who earn too much money to qualify for subsidies for them the times admits the price increases will be excruciating the paper cites one example leslie rycroft of scottsdale who works in human resources is paying a month this year for a united healthcare plan that has a deductible for her family of four their income was a little too high to qualify for a subsidy she said when she looked at her options on healthcare gov last week she said she was absolutely horrified to see only one insurer health net offering plans that started at a month its beyond ridiculous she said all of a sudden you are paying a year ms rycroft said just for catastrophic

this post was originally published on this site having soared to fresh year highs in a quiet overnight session on thin liquidity due to the us thanksgiving holiday which sent the usdjpy just shy of and the yuan to the dollar pared back its weekly advance with modest profit taking after traders wondered if the rally has gotten too stretched european shares were fractionally higher with asian stocks and us equity futures rising and both the dow jones and the s p set for new all time highs oil followed the usd lower down fractionally ahead of next weeks opec meeting where negotiations now focus on whether non opec led by russia nations will cut or freeze with the us offline yesterday american markets are set for another early close on black friday u s equity markets close at bond

lows on thursday u s equity index futures signaled stocks will edge higher as trading resumes following the thanksgiving holiday european shares were little changed oil pared a weekly gain and treasuries fell the recurring story every day since trumps election is that as a result of the upcoming debt funded fiscal stimulus inflation is poised to jump which in turn has fueled a surge in bets on federal reserve rate hikes propelling the greenback higher against all but two of it peers this month traders see an increase in borrowing costs in december as a certainty while the odds of additional moves by june have risen to more than percent according to futures data tracked by bloomberg as shown virtually every day on these pages the trumpflation bet on global reflation has sent the usd soaring while slamming em currencies fading the prospect of future rate cuts by these economies while industrial metals like copper continue to soar expectations of rises in u s inflation and interest rates have driven the greenback to a gain of more than percent in october and november combined its strongest performance over a similar period since its rally in early most investors expect those gains to continue but a combination of the thanksgiving break in the united states market participants need to process corporate flows at the end of the month and a raft of risks in the first half of december all speak for cashing in some of those gains now the dollar bull run had perhaps become a little stretched said lee hardman a currency strategist at bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj ltd in london weve had a very strong run since the election and its just a bit of a pull back it is black friday in the us and the national retail federation projects that about million consumers will make purchases in stores or online over the four day weekend that starts on thanksgiving marking the kickoff to the holiday shopping season u s retail spending is expected to rise to billion in

of holiday spending according to the trade group however the amount americans have spent has declined in the last three years slipping percent from to an average of per person last year according to the trade group so there are risks this holiday season is expected be better for retailers with unemployment gasoline prices and inflation low while wages home values and the stock market continue to

victory in this months u s presidential election it looks as if the market is taking a breather after a good run the market view is that trump is going to spend more and will shield the u s more so that we get higher inflation and higher domestic growth ronny claeys senior strategist at kbc asset management said the market has reacted positively on trump but this could change as his policies are

gobbles addresses an angry crowd in a shock election result turkeys have voted in favour of christmas for the first time since they gained the right to hold elections in in every year since then turkeys have voted firmly against the yuletide feast however this year a populist right wing turkey called steve paxo has managed the impossible and persuaded turkeys to vote for christmas during the campaign paxo was helped by his sinister propaganda adviser gobbles and made a series of promises to the other turkeys he said that he would take back control of christmas and make it great again he promised to ban the eating of turkeys at christmas although he has no power to enforce this he also said that all the money spent on killing turkeys at christmas could instead be used to provide free chocolate and hdtv to all turkeys the win seems to have surprised even gobbles and paxo and they began to backtrack on their pledges almost immediately of course when we said we would take back control of christmas we meant in a non literal sense said gobbles it is likely that many turkeys will be slaughtered this year anyway some turkeys were disappointed with the result mr clucky voted for christmas but is beginning to regret it i had a rough year he said my cage is a mess and i thought voting for christmas would fix it all they promised so much no turkey farmers are thought to be considering taking the result seriously in any case the turkeys voted in favour of christmas so there is actually less controversy this year than when the birds have voted against it farmer arse of norwich said them turkeys is as dumb as chickens they deserve everything they get make sir geoffroy cockface
by on october ben jacobs sabrina siddiqui and spencer ackerman the guardian oct the fbi is investigating newly discovered emails related to hillary clintons personal server its director has announced the fbi had announced in july that its investigation into the democratic presidential candidates private email server had concluded with a recommendation of no criminal charges in the matter although james comey the fbis director criticised clinton as careless but in a letter sent to members of congress on friday comey said new emails had been discovered in an unrelated case in connection with an unrelated case the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation comey wrote i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation comey added although the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant and i cannot predict how long it will take to complete this additional work i believe it is important to update your committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony the system might not be as rigged as i thought remarked donald trump at a rally on friday afternoon a us security source firmly ruled out that the unrelated case comey referred to in his letter was the investigation into the digital penetration of the democratic national committee earlier this year us intelligence officials have blamed russia for hacking the dnc and releasing its internal communications online the source who would not speak on the record said neither that inquiry nor its adjuncts were related to the new investigative developments related to clinton nor is the recent criminal investigation into a national security agency contractor accused of hoarding highly classified intelligence data later the associated press citing an unnamed official claimed the newly discovered emails did not come from her private server the letter from comey comes days before the presidential election and nearly four months after the fbi director announced the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against clinton for what it dubbed extremely careless use of a private email server while secretary of state the fbi director said then although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case it was not immediately clear if clinton would address the matter publicly she ignored shouted questions from reporters waiting on the tarmac about the fbis announcement and did not raise the issue after taking the stage in cedar rapids iowa sticking with her routine stump speech

here something interesting from the unz review recipient name screenwriter aaron sorkin is happy credit vdare com st thomas aquinas told us that one of the pleasures enjoyed by the blessed in heaven was to contemplate the sufferings of the damned in hell apparently if you get to heaven there is a sort of balcony you have access to where you can stand and watch the sinners down below being prodded scorched and flayed far be it from me to bandy theology with the angelic doctor but ive always thought that divine justice should have a bit more charity in it than that whatever down here in the terrestrial sphere theres no doubt that one of the pleasures of winning an election is seeing the torments of the losers one of the first losers out of the gate on wednesday morning was the curiously named steven thrasher of buzzfeed its not the steven that excites my curiosity its the thrasher mr thrasher is a homosexual indeed he basks in the glory of having received the journalist of the year award from the national lesbian gay journalists association i know its neanderthal of me but i cant help wondering whether thrasher is an assumed name meant to signal something to those in the know but thats idle speculation on my part so here was mr thrasher on wednesday morning this is a terrifying moment for america hold your loved ones close people of color women muslims queer people the sick immigrants all are threatened by donald trump they need your love your warmth your support hold tight to the ones you love america hold tight to the ones you love living in black and brown and yellow and native skin hold tight to us because we will have to face white people who think we are rapists we will have to face a nation that wants to stop and frisk us hold tight to us because mass incarceration is actually going to get worse and more of our brothers and sisters are going to be disappeared this is a terrifying moment for america hold your loved ones close guardian november it goes onor thrashes onfor another six hundred words in the same vein homosexualists were very much to the fore in this kind of hysteria although i cant recall anything donald trump has said on the subject and i doubt on a priori grounds that homosex bothers him in any way for another example here was lesbian writer cathy renna at huffington post november get yer hankies out this election was a hate crime not physical but psychological and one that may well lead to legal and physical manifestations that would very much be categorized as hate crimes i saw and heard about such pain and fear on social media and personally as we realized trump would take the election and it has not let up i checked on several people who were expressing a level of fear that seem like it could lead to self harm a vote for trump was a hate crime november that one also continues for over words screenwriter aaron sorkin is not homosexual although he does have eccentric tastes according to wikipedia he once dated maureen dowd im afraid that brings to my mind a limerick the late robert conquest wrote about ms dowds approximate u k equivalent brigid brophy the limerick is much too vulgar for a family website so ill leave you to look it up for yourselves mr sorkin unbosomed his feelings about the trump victory in the form of a letter to his year old daughter the trumpsters want to see people like us sobbing and wailing and talking about moving to canada i wont give them that and neither will you read the letter aaron sorkin wrote his daughter after donald trump was elected president vanity fair november ms sorkin can of course make up her own mind about moving to canada its not actually an option for her dad though hes a convicted drug felon aaron sorkin says he used drugs ap august and canada doesnt give settlement visas to felons casting around for targets on which to vent their spleen the cultmarx crowd didnt even spare the celebrity fluff magazines heres a gal named l v anderson an associate editor at slate previously known as an expert on ziploc bags breaking a butterfly on the wheel the actual butterfly in this case being people magazine amoral people magazine is already fawning over how cute trumps family is november order it now amoral people you see has done what they habitually do when someone gets elected president theyve posted pictures of trumps familyactually

ms anderson sputtering trump and kushner both played key roles in the most hate filled presidential campaign in modern history they worked tirelessly to elect a demagoguetrump and kushner more than anyone else normalized donalds patent unfitness for the presidency and now people is normalizing their moral bankruptcy by pretending that they are just average celebrities as harmless as the kardashians end sputter are the kardashians really harmless though discuss among yourselves and then of course there was the hitlery hitlery hitlery hitler brigade british lefty historian simon schama

here something interesting from the unz review recipient name recipient email i was born on july the day of the failed officers plot against adolf hitler that means i preceded the official dawning of the nuclear age by exactly days which makes me part of the last generation to do so im speaking not of the obliteration of two japanese cities by americas new wonder weapon on august and but of the trinity test of the first atomic bomb in the new mexican desert near alamogordo on july of that year when physicist robert oppenheimer the father of the atomic bomb witnessed that explosion the line from the hindu holy book the bhagavad gita that famously came into his head was i am become death the destroyer of worlds how apt it still remains more than seven decades later at a moment when nine countries possess such weapons more than of them in their arsenals most of which are now staggeringly more destructive than that first devastating bomb and as tomdispatch regular michael klare points out today some of which are closer to possible use than at any point in at least a couple of decades for those of us who lived through the years of bomb shelters atomic movie monsters the cuban missile crisis the rise and fall of antinuclear movements and nuclear nightmares of a sort i still remember vividly from my youth in a way i no longer recall the dreams of last night its a horror to imagine that nuclear war is still with us even more so because in election we have a presidential candidate who is not only ignorant about those weapons in hard to believe ways but who wonders why we cant use them and who might months from now have his finger on that nuclear button dont tell me that this isnt a living nightmare of the first order i find it eerie in the extreme and unnervingly apt that the clinton campaign has brought back a living icon of our nuclear fears the little girl from the election who appeared in the famous daisy ad president lyndon johnson ran against republican contender barry goldwater she was then seen counting to as she plucked petals off a daisy just before an ominous echoing male voice began the countdown to an atomic explosion that filled the screen now that girl monique luiz a grown woman is shown saying the fear of nuclear war we had as children i never thought our children would ever have to deal with that again and to see that coming forward in this election is really scary shes now years old and however the clinton campaign may be using her theres still something deeply unnerving for those of us who had hoped to outlast the nuclear age simply to see her there more than five decades later and if you think thats unnerving on the eve of the most bizarre presidential election in memory then read todays piece by michael klare and imagine just how unsettling in nuclear terms the years ahead may prove to be
november amthe new york times has done the usual guilt by association thing in blaming trump for us here at vdare com people like us and people we dont even know for his part mr trump has not expressed support for the white nationalist groups that have rallied to his candidacy but neither has he distanced himself from them with the exception of david duke the former klansman who is running for senate and whom mr trump disavowed after some initial wavering last winter its nonsense to say he wavered on thissee ann coulters ann coulter trump wins disavowal game then super tuesday white nationalists are now beginning to grapple with how to best harness the energy that his campaign has stirred up mr spencers group the national policy institute which says it is dedicated to the heritage identity and future of people of european descent in the united states and around the world is organizing a valedictory conference in the ronald reagan building in washington shortly after the election the aim is to take stock of the presidential campaign when our ideas began invading the mainstream and figure out whats next in addition to mr spencer the speakers will include peter brimelow the founder of vdare com an anti immigration website named for virginia dare the first white baby born in the english colonies donald trumps extremist supporters feel like winners either way by jonathan mahler and julie turkewitz the new york times november thats better than the way they frequently get it wrong when they say she was the first white child born in america but the way we put it is this the first english child to be born in the new world that by the way is the way a lot of historians put it however a pre multicultural poem by rosemary and stephen vincent benet put it better peregrine white were the first real americans anywhere
cnns jake tapper hit the nail on the head last night as he was speaking about why people voted for trump tapper said that most americans are sick of the income inequality globalization and politics as usual that the status quo have given us he even pointed out that only a handful of people have gotten rich off of globalization and a lot of people have been left behind indeed exit polls last night showed that the economy was the number concern for voters the guardian reports its the economy stupid was a phrase coined by her husbands adviser james carville in the election and in many ways it ought to have helped democrats again in barack obama helped rescue the us from the financial crash and presided over a record series of consecutive quarters of job growth unfortunately for clinton many americans simply did not feel as positive stagnant wage levels and soaring inequality were symptoms of the malaise felt by many voters trump successfully convinced them to believe this was caused by bad trade deals and a rigged economy despite being pushed in this direction by sanders in the democratic primary clinton never really found a satisfactory response her volte face on trade sounded and was later proved by leaked emails unconvincing at best deeply cynical at worst similarly brexit the other recent vote which went against all political forecasts was largely a vote by those who lost out on the benefits of globalization that only a handful of fatcats really profited from leaders of the brexit campaign noted the confluence of the two votes jeremy corbyn described mr trumps victory as an unmistakable rejection of political establishment ukip leader nigel farage who went to the us to appear at a trump campaign rally said he was handing over his mantle as the creator of political earthquakes to the new president saying that was the year of two great political revolutions adding i thought brexit was big but boy this looks like its going to be even bigger n igel farage has issued this statement following donald trumps victory today the establishment is in deep shock even more so than after brexit what we are witnessing is the end of a period of big business and big politics controlling our lives voters across the western world want nation state democracy proper border controls and to be in charge of their own lives i commend donald trump for the courage with which he has fought this campaign and i look forward to a closer relationship between the usa and the uk we now have a president who likes our country and understands our post brexit values prepare for further political shocks in the years to come voters in the uk and the worlds strongest nation the u s have both rebuked the status quo including neoliberal trade and economic policies whats next the rebellion will spreadfor example its so probable that merkels christian democratic union party will be thrown out on its ear that merkel is already trying to distract with silly claims that the russians will hack the german election postscript there are of course other reasons that trump won but the economy is the main one
by nov a new york elementary school has cancelled their mock presidential election after some of the students began to chant the republican nominees name mock debates and elections have long been a staple of childrens schooling i personally have fond memories of campaigning for ross perot in second grade the free exchange of ideas and arguing your beliefs has traditionally been an important and fun part of growing up sadly that tradition appears to be coming to an end at least at jericho elementary school in centereach where students will now be holding a mock election to choose their favorite school lunch instead the cancellation of the mock election came after some students were reportedly chanting trump and repeating negative rhetoric about minorities some of the students had reportedly stated that they did not want muslims here while some may find that offensive this is an issue in the world and in the news perhaps a better way to handle it would have been to have a discussion or a debate and allowed students to argue their feelings on the issue instead of shutting down discussions entirely the schools principal said in a statement that he decided to toss the learning experience aside to prevent minority students from feeling uncomfortable i mean kids often repeat what they hear on the tv or the news but it doesnt mean its ok school principal glen rogers said we have a diverse community here we want all our students to feel valued comfortable or not immigration is an issue in this election which students should be free to explore and discuss some people were getting angry because some people like trump and some people like clinton miranda waters a fifth grader at the school told abc news some people think clintons not good some think trumps not good so theres a lot of arguments going on and i dont like that the discouragement and shaming for discussing political beliefs and attempting to silence voices which may stray away from what the left deems acceptable has lead to a generation of college students who believe that they have a right to never be offended and who are willing to trade free speech to ensure it is a dc based writer and political commentator who has been published in a range of outlets including sputnik news teen vogue telesur and bipartisan report join we are change

sasha polakow suransky guardian november in april jean marie le pen stunned all of europe by defeating the socialist candidate lionel jospin in the first round of the french presidential election and advancing to the final round between the top two candidates terrified by the prospect of a far right victory the french leftincluding communists greens and the socialist partythrew their support behind the incumbent president jacques chirac a pillar of the centre right establishment who had served as mayor of paris for years before becoming president in this electoral strategy effectively isolated le pens front national depicting it as a cancerous force in the french body politic two weeks later on may chirac won the election with an astronomical of the vote trouncing le pen by the biggest margin in a french presidential election since raucous celebrations spilled into the streets of paris we have gone through a time of serious anxiety for the countrybut tonight france has reaffirmed its attachment to the values of the republic chirac declared in his victory speech then speaking to the joyous crowds in the place de la rpublique he lauded them for rejecting intolerance and demagoguery but may was not in fact a moment of triumph rather it was the dying gasp of an old order in which the fate of european nations was controlled by large establishment parties jean marie le pen was an easy target for the left and for establishment figures such as chirac he was a political provocateur who appealed as much to antisemites and homophobes as to voters upset about immigration drawing his support largely from the most reactionary elements of the old catholic right in other words he was a familiar villainand his ideology represented an archaic france a defeated past moreover he did not seriously aim for power and never really came close to acquiring it his role was to be a rabble rouser and to inject his ideas into the national debate europes new far right is different from denmark to the netherlands to germany a new wave of rightwing parties has emerged over the past decade and a half and they are casting a much wider net than jean marie le pen ever attempted to and by deftly appealing to fear nostalgia and resentment of elites they are rapidly broadening their base le pens own daughter is a prime example of the new ambitions of the right unlike her incendiary father marine le pen is running a disciplined political operation and has already proven that her party can win upwards of of the vote in regions from calais in the north to the cte dazur in the south she and her danish and dutch counterparts are notas some on the left would like to believeneo nazis or inconsequential extremists with fringe ideas lacking popular appeal these parties have built a coherent ideology and steadily chipped away at the establishment parties hold on power by pursuing a new and devastatingly effective electoral strategy they have made a very public break with the symbols of the old rights past distancing themselves from skinheads neo nazis and homophobes they have also deftly co opted the causes policies and rhetoric of their opponents they have sought to outflank the left when it comes to defending a strong welfare state and protecting social benefits that they claim are threatened by an influx of freeloading migrants they have effectively claimed the progressive causes of the leftfrom gay rights to womens equality and protecting jews from antisemitismas their own by depicting muslim immigrants as the primary threat to all three groups as fear of islam has spread with their encouragement they have presented themselves as the only true defenders of western identity and western libertiesthe last bulwark protecting a besieged judeo christian civilisation from the barbarians at the gates these parties have steadily filled an electoral vacuum left open by social democratic and centre right parties who ignored voters growing anger over immigrationsome of it legitimate some of it bigotedor simply waited too long to address it they have shed some of the rights most unsavoury baggage while responding to both economic anxiety and fear of terrorism by blending a nativist economic policymore welfare but only for us and tough anti immigration and border security measures their message is beginning to resonate widely with a fearful population that believes the liberal governing elite no longer listens to them brexit was just the start europes new far right is poised to transform the continents political landscapeeither by winning elections or simply by pulling a besieged political centre so far in its direction that its ideas become the new normal and when that happens groups that would never have contemplated voting for a far right party years agothe young gay people jews feministsmay join the working class voters who have already abandoned parties of the left to become the new backbone of the populist right on may one day after revellers filled the streets of paris to celebrate chiracs historic victory the flamboyant and iconoclastic leader of the dutch far right pim fortuyn was gunned down by a radical animal rights activist as he emerged from a radio interview his assassin later claimed that he had killed fortuyn to stop him from using muslims as scapegoats in national elections nine days later fortuyns eponymous partythe pim fortuyn list became the second largest in the netherlands with of the vote fortuyn a former communist and openly gay man who boasted of sleeping with muslim immigrants while calling for a ban on muslim immigration was an electrifying figure in a country known for its staid politics his time in the limelight was short but transformative it was fortuyn who blazed the trail for the new generation of far right leaders across europe he may not have intended to be a pioneer but his brand of plain spoken political incorrectness and his depiction of islamic culture as a backwards and reactionary threat to the hard
