william mcgurn wall street journal lets get this straight calling hillary clinton a bigot has reporters asking every republican in sight if donald trump has gone too far but the clinton campaign releases a video saying mr trump is the candidate of the ku klux klan , and its all okey dokey \? then again , mr trump has already been likened to hitler , mussolini and stalin small wonder theres a collective ho hum when democratic vice presidential nominee tim kaine says mr trump is peddling kkk values this is what democrats do it didnt start with mr trump , either for years democrats have portrayed the gop as one giant hate group each presidential election , the drill goes like this after republicans nominate someone , he immediately finds himself having to prove hes not a hater of african americans , of women , of gays , etc this year democrats added a twist mr trump , they claim , represents a break with all those decent and lovable republicans such as mitt romney , john mccain and george w bush of course , this isnt what they were saying back when these men were running for president in 2000 , for example , an naacp ad recreated the gruesome murder of james byrd to imply that then gov bush was sympathetic to lynching black men over footage of a chain being dragged by a pickup truck , mr byrds daughter says , so when gov george w bush refused to support hate crimes legislation , it was like my father was killed all over again when john mccain ran in 2008 , barack obama warned that republicans would scare people by saying , you know , he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills the mccain campaign fired back , accusing mr obama of playing the race card from the bottom of the deck funny thing all those reporters always hearing dog whistles from republicans somehow didnt hear this one in 2012 , when mitt romney went to the naacp and told them face to face about his opposition to obamacare , the stories were all about how he was really just trolling for the racist vote vice president joe biden put it more explicitly , telling a largely african american audience that if mr romney were to win , hed put yall back in chains the only difference today is that republicans now have a nominee giving as good as he gets

trending articles trending articles source the independent fbi director james comey reportedly ignored the advice of attorney general loretta lynch , who urged him not to thrust the controversy over hillary clintons emails back into headlines less than a fortnight from election day us department of justice officials , democrats and even some republicans were said to be aghast at the timing of the fbis announcement , on friday , that it was reviewing a fresh cache of emails , which mr comey said may be pertinent to the investigation into ms clintons use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state according to a report from the new yorker , ms lynch expressed her preference that mr comey uphold the justice department 's longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations , and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election the fbi director , however , said that he felt compelled to do otherwise writing in the washington post , former justice department spokesman matthew miller said mr comeys decision was a troubling violation of long standing justice department rules or precedent , conduct that raises serious questions about his judgment and ability to serve as the nations chief investigative official the emails were discovered in connection with an unrelated case , the fbi director wrote in a letter to republican congressional committee chairs on friday that separate case , it later emerged , concerns disgraced former congressman anthony weiner , who is under investigation for allegedly sending explicit messages to a 15 year old girl in north carolina mr weiner is the estranged husband of ms clintons closest aide , huma abedin , and the emails were found on one or more electronic devices belonging to the couple , which had been seized as part of the weiner probe the fbi is now investigating whether those emails contained any classified information
email with protests erupting across the country this week and emotions running high , american companies are trying to make sense of how to react to a trump presidential election win but one major company has clearly made up its mind and just came down squarely in the anti trump camp in a big way donald trump will be added to disneys hall of presidents , but his animatronic figure will be able to feel pain wow disney just showed that it does not pull punches when it comes to what the company believes in check out the press release they put out this morning disney prides itself on promoting inclusivity , empathy , and non violence , which are values that mr trumps presidency threatens thats why when we eventually add him to our hall of presidents exhibit in disney worlds magic kingdom , his mechanical replica will bear the capacity to suffer horribly , and without limit being a company that caters to diverse families , we felt it was a moral responsibility to have mr trumps robotic counterpart be receptive to extreme thirst and burning sensations , while also being wired with the knowledge that it can never receive the sweet mercy of death this is the best way for us to uphold the hall of presidents tradition while also voicing our vigorous objection to the trump administration given that disneys software makes the animatronic believe its bones are shattering each time it moves or speaks , this company clearly wants people to know its not onboard the trump train park visitors who feel similarly opposed to trumps presidency can rest assured that his hall of presidents double will be designed to experience anxiety , so its always aware that more pain is coming although the machine will understand what joy is , its programming will never allow it to feel that and disneys not letting trump off the hook there the replicas for abraham lincoln and george washington will even be reprogrammed to slap , scratch , and pry the fingernails off the animatronic trump , which will respond to such painful stimuli by gasping , crying , screaming , vomiting , or a mix of all of these if that doesnt send a powerful statement about where disney stands politically , we dont know what does its safe to say we wont see the trumps vacationing there anytime soon dont share disneys disdain for a trump presidency \? you may be better off heading to space mountain instead of the hall of presidents , because disney has officially drawn the battle line right there
november 17 , 2016 after donald trumps victory , democrats and progressives have traded accusations as to what was at fault , the establishments insistence on hillary clinton or the insurgent challenges from bernie sanders and jill stein , reports nat parry by nat parry as the reality of donald j trumps victory in the nov 8 presidential election sets in , democrats and progressives have been trading accusations over who or what may have led to this historic electoral defeat for progressives who backed vermonts independent sen bernie sanders in the primaries , the culprit is clearly the democratic party establishment , led by the likes of former democratic national committee chairwoman debbie wasserman shultz and current interim dnc chair donna brazile , who they blame for stacking the deck against their candidate and ensuring hillary clintons nomination despite her considerable baggage heading into the election republican presidential nominee donald trump and democratic nominee hillary clinton \( photos by gage skidmore and derivative by krassotkin , wikipedia \) these progressives point to clintons historically low favorability ratings in national polls , and the fact that in a hypothetical one one one match up between trump and sanders , polling data showed early on that sanders would have likely defeated trump easily trump himself seemed to understand the advantage sanders had over him in a possible general election contest , tweeting in may 2016 that he would rather run against crooked hillary clinton than bernie sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against bernie ! among democrats and democratic leaning independents , sanders was clearly more liked , even as clinton wrapped up the nomination last summer gallup polling found in june 2016 that sanders held 70 percent favorable and 18 percent unfavorable ratings among democratic voters , while clinton was seen favorably by 67 percent and unfavorably by 28 percent in the aftermath of trumps victory assisted by the lowest voter turnout in 20 years some have argued that enthusiasm for sanders could have pushed the democrats to victory in key swing states that ultimately went to trump to back up these claims , the progressive website usuncut pointed out on nov 10 that in five states that sanders won in the primaries indiana , michigan , oklahoma , west virginia , and wisconsin the exit polling data indicated that the demographic groups that helped trump reach 270 electoral college votes were also sanderss key demographics assuming that sanders won white , rural rust belt voters in the traditionally blue states that hillary clinton lost , sanders would have won the electoral college with a 303 235 advantage , according to this analysis yet , while progressives blame the democratic establishment for pushing an unpopular nominee who was saddled by a federal investigation into her use of a private email server while secretary of state , questions related to the ethics of her collecting sizable speaking fees from wall street firms , and suspicions over the clinton foundations dealings with foreign governments establishment democrats have been largely placing the blame on progressives for failing to unite behind clinton some commentators have pointed fingers at voters who decided to buck the two party system and cast a ballot for the green partys jill stein or the libertarian partys gary johnson while others have assigned blame to sanders for daring to mount a primary challenge against clinton in the first place this was the argument of prof gil troy , who wrote at time magazine on nov 14 that senator bernie sanders earned the 2016 ralph nader award for the leftist most responsible for helping republicans win the presidency while acknowledging that trump cleverly exploited voters frustrations and that clintons campaign in 2016 was as rigid and empty as it was when she lost in 2008 , troy nevertheless argues that sanders insurgent primary campaign pushed her too far left to prevent an effective re centering in the fall troy offers few facts or polling data to back up these claims , instead making broad based assertions such as just as ralph nader siphoned tens of thousands of votes on election day 2000 in florida from al gore , causing the deadlock and george w bushs victory , bernie sanders similar vampire effect enfeebled hillary clinton according to this view , even running a progressive primary election challenge much less a third party campaign is dangerously unacceptable , creating a so called vampire effect that siphons votes that rightfully belong to someone else the spoiler effect while sanders remains the target of some criticism for costing the democrats the election , the real vitriol is leveled at third parties and their supporters rep debbie wasserman schultz , d florida typical was the reaction of newsweek senior writer kurt eichenwald , who published an account of an encounter he had with a fan in the philadelphia international airport following the election the individual had approached eichenwald to praise his work but nearly ended up the victim of a physical assault according to eichenwald , the man , who had recognized the pundit from his television appearances , thanked him for his reporting on trump and expressed disgust that trump had won eichenwald then asked the fan who he had voted for the man stated that he voted for green party nominee jill stein , to which eichenwald replied youre lucky its illegal for me to punch you in the face according to his account of the interaction , eichenwald then told his fan to go have sex with himself as anyone who has ever voted for a party other than the democrats or republicans can attest , this is a pretty familiar reaction in the united states winner take all electoral system , a vote for anyone outside of the two main parties is seen as a wasted vote that could spoil the election , and those who make this decision risk professional and social ostracism in this system , third party voters are vilified to an extent not seen for any other voting demographic including nonvoters who in fact account for a far greater share of the electorate , and therefore have a much bigger effect in swinging the election yet , this has not stopped many pundits and social media users from piling blame onto supporters of stein or johnson , who are deemed reckless and irresponsible for so frivolously casting a ballot for candidates who had no chance of winning or worse yet , as personally culpable for trumps victory and all the disastrous policies that might follow if you vote for somebody who cant win for president , it means that you dont care who wins for president , opined msnbcs rachel maddow on election night she later elaborated on this wasted vote theory , tweeting about a fanciful scenario in which every stein vote and half of johnsons votes would have gone to clinton , who might have then claimed enough states from trump to eke out an electoral college win , a story repeated by cnn in a similar vein , columnist paul krugman weighed in by tweeting in the early morning hours of nov 9 that jill stein has managed to play ralph nader , referring to the spoiler effect that the 2000 green party nominee allegedly had on the election 16 years ago without her florida might have been saved flawed analysis setting aside rehashed arguments from 2000 , when it comes to election 2016 independent evaluations of third party voting have concluded that the effect of this voting bloc was statistically negligible , and cannot seriously be attributed to clintons defeat sen bernie sanders of vermont a wall street journal analysis , for example , found that clinton would have needed to win 70 percent of the vote share that went to both the libertarian and green parties across eight swing states to claim victory a highly unlikely scenario considering that the libertarian party champions a brand of fiscal conservatism and limited government that traditionally appeals to right leaning , republican voters \( indeed , the 2016 libertarian party ticket was headed by two former republican governors gary johnson of new mexico and bill weld of massachusetts \) in another analysis , the washington post concluded that in the five states trump won by a margin smaller than the combined johnson stein vote , some of them could have been flipped if the entire stein vote was added to clintons total in this scenario , the post notes , the outcome might have changed in michigan and wisconsin , still however leaving her short of an electoral college victory the paper pointed out however that this projection rests on the unrealistic assumption that all stein voters would have voted for clinton , conceding that it is impossible to know how johnson and stein backers would have voted if forced to choose between clinton , trump and staying home more realistically , many would have skipped the presidential race or voted for another candidate besides the lack of hard statistical data to back up the wasted vote spoiler effect claims , they also rest on a flawed assumption that anyones votes whether clintons , trumps , johnsons or steins actually belong to anyone else in fact , many third party voters are simply fed up with the system itself , and hope that by voting for other options , it might be possible to someday build up viable alternatives to the two party system this was especially the case this year , in which the numbers of disaffected voters reached historic proportions by the time the primaries had been decided last summer , in fact , the two front runners were the most unpopular candidates seen in a generation , which should have been seen as a warning sign to democrats who traditionally rely on high voter turnout for electoral success according to a quinnipiac poll released in june , clinton had a 57 percent unfavorability rating , while trump received a 59 percent unfavorability rating moreover , according to a survey by data targeting , 55 percent of americans favored having an independent or third party presidential candidate to consider among millennials a key demographic for barack obamas victories in 2008 and 2012 91 percent expressed support for additional choices this year another poll , released in september just before the trump clinton debates began , found that 76 percent of americans favored johnson and stein sharing the stage with the two main party candidates in the debates this , of course , did not happen , with the commission on presidential debates sticking to its strict criteria that independents and third parties need to reach 15 percent in national polling before they are allowed into the debates this is perhaps one reason why americans remained largely ignorant of steins and johnsons campaigns , with gallup finding that 63 percent were unfamiliar with johnson heading into the general election , and 68 percent were unfamiliar with stein voter boycotts and voter suppression regardless of the impacts of third party alternatives which only ended up receiving a total of 4 percent of the popular vote the deep disaffection among american voters that was seen in earlier polling seemed to manifest itself in other voting trends on election day this disaffection can be seen in the high number of down ballot voters who opted not to cast a ballot for president this year green party presidential candidate jill stein one telling analysis found that in 14 states , down ballot candidates received more votes than presidential candidates in north carolina , for instance , about 30 , 000 more people cast ballots for incumbent gov pat mccrory and roy cooper than for any of the presidential nominees in vermont , about 314 , 000 voters cast ballots in the governors race , and 313 , 000 for the senate , while just 291 , 000 voted for president a difference of almost 8 percent in oregon , where democrats sen ron wyden and gov kate brown easily won re election , their races drew about 75 , 000 more votes than the presidential contest other states in which down ballot voters essentially boycotted the presidential election included indiana , missouri , north dakota , wisconsin , and west virginia besides nonvoters , another factor that should be receiving at least as much attention as third party spoilers are the would be voters who could not cast a ballot due to systematic disenfranchisement , possible voter suppression or other all too familiar problems at polling places as the brennan center for justice noted on nov 14 , too many voters had to contend with long lines , malfunctioning voting machines , confusion over voting restrictions , voter intimidation , and voter registration problems the nonpartisan law and policy institute , which has been documenting flaws in u s election administration for years , notes that 2016 was not the first election in which these problems have occurred and that itself is a problem describing numerous instances of voting problems across the country , the group concluded that the ways in which elections are administered , including how well they are resourced , can have a negative impact on citizens ability to cast a ballot and the confidence the public has in the system investigative reporter greg palast went further than that , contending that before a single vote was cast , the election was fixed by gop and trump operatives he noted in a nov 11 blog post that in 2013 , just as the supreme court overturned key sections of the voting rights act , republican operatives created a system called crosscheck to purge 1 1 million americans from the voter rolls of republican controlled states according to his count , in michigan , the crosscheck purge list eliminated 449 , 922 voters from the rolls , while trump claimed victory in that state by just 13 , 107 votes in arizona , the trump victory margin was 85 , 257 votes , while a total of 270 , 824 voters were eliminated by crosscheck the trump victory margin in north carolina was 177 , 008 , while the crosscheck purge list accounted for 589 , 393 voters knocked off the rolls palast notes that the electoral putsch was aided by nine other methods of attacking the right to vote of black , latino and asian american voters including caging , purging , blocking legitimate registrations , and wrongly shunting millions to provisional ballots that will never be counted he also points to the discrepancies between the exit polling data and the final results in several battleground states , noting that exit polling is historically deadly accurate despite this , palast notes that in 2016 , the exit polling was off the mark in at least four key swing states according to the exit polls , clinton should have won florida , north carolina , pennsylvania and wisconsin , but at the end of the day all of these states went to trump accounting for a total of 74 electoral college votes , these four states would have been more than enough for clinton to have flipped the election and of course , this all assumes that the electoral college is legitimate in the first place the fact remains that hillary clinton received more than one million more votes nationwide than donald trump , and the only reason he is assuming the white house is due to the arcane and controversial system of allocating votes through the electoral college this has led to increasing calls to abolish the electoral college altogether based on the idea that elections should be determined on the principle of one person , one vote needed reforms libertarian party presidential nominee gary johnson needless to say , to many around the world not to mention many within the united states these elections are looking less like free expressions of the peoples will than they do down and dirty slug fests in which either side is willing to claim a victory at any cost this election was observed by two international organizations in fact , and while their final reports vary to considerable degrees , both the organization of american states and the organization for security and cooperation in europe both criticized the tone of the election and highlighted numerous structural deficiencies in the way the united states chooses its leaders the oas final report identified the following issues as representing key areas for improvement in the u s electoral system taking measures to avoid long lines at polling places , broadening cooperation between states to compare information and avoid possible duplications in voter registries , expanding the practice of redistricting through nonpartisan commissions , addressing the impacts of the supreme courts decision to eliminate parts of the 1965 voting rights act , establishing better campaign finance rules , and jettisoning the divisive campaign rhetoric that has turned off so many voters from the process the oas also noted the unusual practice in the united states of simultaneously mandating voter identification while not providing this required identification to eligible voters practically all countries in the region provide at least one free form of national identification to their citizens , which is used for electoral purposes , said the oas in the u s , 32 states currently have laws in force that require voters to show some form of prescribed identification to verify their identity before casting a vote however , these states do not make this identification readily available to citizens , contrary to good electoral practice this is also a weakness that the osce pointed out in its report , noting voter identification rules are politically divisive and vary across the states , with 32 states requiring photo identification a high volume of litigation regarding voter identification continued up to election day , generating confusion among voters and election officials regarding the application of rules efforts to ensure the integrity of the vote are important , but should not lead to the disenfranchisement of eligible voters the 57 country organization also noted the undue obstacles faced by minor parties and independents trying to compete in u s elections the number of signatures required and the signature submission deadlines vary from state to state , which made it cumbersome for third party or independent candidates to register across all states for presidential elections , the osce pointed out both the green party and libertarian party challenged ballot access requirements in several states , with success in a few instances the organization , which has been monitoring elections in the united states since 2004 , regretted that since previous election observation missions , a number of its priority recommendations remain unaddressed it pointed out that deficiencies in the legal framework persist , such as the disenfranchisement of citizens living in various territories , restrictions on the voting rights of convicted criminals and infringements on secrecy of the ballot rather than focusing on who is to blame for trumps victory in election 2016 , democrats , republicans , progressives , independent conservatives , third party supporters , minorities , and good government groups might be better served coming together and finally taking seriously the task of electoral reform , beginning with addressing some of the key recommendations of impartial international observers perhaps then , this perennial debate and the endless exchange of recriminations might finally come to an end nat parry is the co author of neck deep the disastrous presidency of george w bush this story originally appeared at

november 13 , 2016 while there is hope that president trump will end the bloody years of u s adventurism abroad , the initial shock from his victory could diminish americas standing in the world , says ex cia analyst paul r pillar the impact of the election result on the standing of the united states in the world has too many aspects to encapsulate or even , in this early stage of shock , to comprehend this is particularly so with a president elect who will have to construct a foreign policy largely unguided by previous thinking on his part that exhibits consistency and coherence beyond a few themes such as discontent with free loading allies , admiration for powerful autocrats , and conceiving of economic relations in zero sum mercantilist terms president barack obama delivers remarks during his address to the united nations general assembly in new york , n y , sept 23 , 2013 \( official white house photo by amanda lucidon \) but we can already note some aspects of americas global standing that are related to the election itself and the campaign that preceded it these aspects involve damage that already has been done , and that the result of the election punctuates and extends some of the damage stems from the xenophobic content of mr trumps campaign , with the disparagement , or what many overseas will take to be disparagement , of major parts of humanity , including among others the nearly quarter of the worlds population that is muslim that such a campaign was a winning campaign reveals the underlying views to be held by much more of america than the president elect himself the extent to which those views are held by americans who are deplorable or by americans who are merely discontented and easy prey for such themes matters less to overseas observers than the content of the views themselves this pattern hits the american image hard in a place where it hitherto has looked rather good many polls conducted overseas have yielded results that couple negative views of u s policies with positive feelings toward the american people perhaps the latter part of such results will start to become less pronounced a procedural black eye then there is the presidential selection process itself the election to the most powerful post in the world of someone who is , by temperament and experience , so manifestly unqualified to hold it will be taken by many as a failure of that process donald trump and mike pence during day three of the republican national convention \( photo credit grant miller rnc \) and mr trump himself provided voluminous rhetoric during the campaign about how the process is rigged , how he would not accept an unfavorable outcome , and how if he won he would incarcerate his opponent , amid references to second amendment solutions and the like a casual foreign observer only needed to listen to mr trump to conclude that americas claim to having an admirable liberal democratic process for choosing its leaders is false a more careful , less casual , foreign observer might discount mr trumps rhetoric as campaign bombast but would notice other disturbing things about the election it appears that mrs clinton won a plurality of the popular vote , making this the second out of the last five u s presidential elections in which the popular vote winner was denied the white house foreign observers might not appreciate the background to why the electoral college exists , but the disconnect between votes cast and offices won is even more apparent with the routine and blatant gerrymandering , which has served as an incumbent protection device as well as enabling the republican party in recent years to hold a majority of seats in the house of representatives even while losing in total votes to the democrats on top of that are the comparably blatant efforts by one party to gain or hold office not just by winning votes but by suppressing voting by citizens deemed more likely to support the other party and on top of that in this election was the october surprise from the head of the top national law enforcement agency , a development that in an election this close could well have made a difference in the outcome all of this is prime material for anyone overseas wanting to disparage american democracy regimes with that motivation have been having a field day iranian propaganda writers have had an easy time , merely encouraging people to follow the u s election campaign on television vladimir putin didnt need to interfere in the u s political process to diminish any image advantage it has over his own the fact that the side that benefited from things such as voter suppression and comeys surprise won the u s political contest is what extends into the future the already inflicted damage to the image of american democracy that is in addition to this election demonstrating that in america , a xenophobic campaign is a winner a victory by mrs clinton would have been seen overseas both as a repudiation of the xenophobia and as an overcoming by the political process of the irregularities if there is any possible offsetting advantage regarding what american democracy in action displays to others , it is that we will be spared seeing republicans doing everything possible to frustrate a president clintons ability to govern the foreshadowing of such a scenario , had the election result gone the other way , was obvious there was much talk of impeachment , which is supposed to be a remedy for high crimes and misdemeanors committed in office , before the target even took office or won an election to the office victory for the saboteurs also , as columnist richard cohen observed , congressman jason chaffetz , the chairman of what amounts to the permanent committee to investigate hillary \( actually , the house oversight committee \) , was promising before the election to conduct investigations until the end of time or fox news loses interest , whichever comes first sen john mccain , r arizona , and sen lindsey graham , r south carolina , appearing on cbsface the nation perhaps most stunning were the promises , after republican refusal all year even to consider president obamas nominee to fill a vacancy on the supreme court , to block anyone a president clinton nominated to the court during an entire four year term such a position not only would have represented a new depth in governmental dysfunction but also a direct assault on the concept of an independent judiciary , which is one of the most important things that separate stable liberal democracies that operate with the rule of law from a lot of other less admirable countries that dont and this talk was coming not from donald trump but from the principal runner up for the republican nomination \( ted cruz \) and a previous \( john mccain \) of course , being spared sabotage and obstruction probably should not be considered an advantage when the alternative is to have the saboteurs running the whole show the defacement of american democracy , as well as the xenophobia , both of which are already unavoidably associated with donald trumps presidency before he even takes the oath of office , have multiple and significant consequences for u s overseas interests , however difficult it may be to limn precise effects that will appear over the next four years the consequences will include degradation of any claim by the united states to leadership of inclusive , liberal democracies they also will include weakening of political advantages especially among disparaged or excluded populations and the governments that lead them that the united states has traditionally enjoyed as an object of admiration and emulation they include a reduction of confidence in , and support for , democracy itself anything that weakens , or threatens to weaken , americans own stable , inclusive democracy ought to be a source of dismay regardless of the repercussions overseas but those repercussions are an added reason for the dismay paul r pillar , in his 28 years at the central intelligence agency , rose to be one of the agencys top analysts he is author most

email hafnarfjorur , iceland the votes are in in a greater than expected 79 turnout , election results show that icelands pirate party has not come out in first place as earlier polls indicated might be the case they have , however , increased their size in the parliament 3 fold \( from 3 seats to 10 \) but this will not be enough to steer iceland in their direction now its all about coalition building had they maintained those poll numbers from earlier this summer \( at a one time high of 35 \) , that would have given them the probable first choice to form a coalition government with either the left greens , the social democrats , or the center leftish bright future as it stands now , they will need to band together , something they all they agreed to consider during a pre election press conference the largest single party remains the corporate right independence party with 29 or 21 seats and which is now part of the governing coalition along with the center right progressive party \( who suffered a humiliating loss of 11 seats , now down to 8 \) this coalition is the same center right configuration which led iceland to financial disaster , the flight of skilled doctors and other professionals , and whose members were implicated in off shore money scams which led to the resignation earlier this year of their last pm from the progressive party , causing these early elections , and now to the formal resignation of their present pm just a few hours ago technically these two parties could form a 3 party coalition along with the new regeneration party however , regeneration leader benedikt j hanesson has said he wouldnt consider a coalition with the governing parties thus that particular scenario is doubted after years of political stagnation following the collapse of the economy , and controversy over the panama papers leaking of wealthy icelanders involvement in tortola , this new development reflects a growing , widespread disgust at the traditional two party coalition rulers who have alternately or in pairs run the country for most of its years following icelands independence the ship is floundering and the present course is unsustainable the other numbers however , are pointing to a change of course the pirates won 14 5 giving them 10 seats in the 63 seat parliament , the althing the left greens received 15 9 \( for 10 seats \) the social democrats 5 7 \( 3 seats \) and bright future 7 2 \( winning 4 seats \) together they represent almost 30 of the electorate these are the groups which began talking about joining forces this past week , just before the election if a four party coalition is solidified , then iceland becomes the second nation to have a viable pirate party within its government \( germany is the first \) and the first to have it this close to the helm in the countrys governance the kingmakers could very well be regeneration , a new , center right grouping who won 10 5 of the votes getting them 7 seats they characterize themselves as liberal , though the head was a long time supporter of the independence party before leaving this past year on the 18th of october he said he wouldnt consider joining a coalition with the two headed ruling hydra of the independence and progressive parties were he instead to agree to an alliance with the four roughly left , center left groups of which the pirates are a part \( something he declared he was open to the morning after the election \) , then that would net a total of 34 seats \( 27 their 7 \) and a solid majority a five party coalition what does this all mean \? it means several things in the short run , the helm of the icelandic political ship will remain loosely dominated by the independence party as the largest single grouping in the althingi \( parliament \) but aside from that approximately 30 of the electorate who arent swayed by anything but their loyalty to the ruling class , the rest of the country is moving on they are actively exploring hitherto unheard of politics \( with the pirates \) and considering broad coalition politics \( 5 groups trying to control the direction of the country \) this may be the wave of the future or it may simply be a transitional era where loyalties are split and serious discussions about radical ideas like ownership of public resources \( and actually and clearly defining such \) occur openly as the public coalesces around a new , dominant ideology in the long run , things are changing and then there is this issue of a new constitution which was voted on and accepted by the public but which the ruling coalition simply ignored and shelved if that was now formally accepted , then some serious changes may be in store for the owners of the country but today is only the day after , and nothing has been decided yet so whats next \? well , the new presidents job just got more complicated as he is the one who traditionally asks the leading party to form the new government and , if they fail in securing a stable majority , the next leading party would get a shot this was easier when the totals were generally in favor of one or the other of the two ruling groups now , however , a new multi party dynamic is at play who knows how the discussions are heading right now , and which horses are being traded \? iceland has always been the most usamerican of the nordic countries but with tugs in both directions much like the island itself , rent down the middle by volcanic cracks dividing the european and american tectonic plates , these tugs are causing great tension as to which political direction the country should follow with history having taken them this far and a growing unease about the dominant parties corruption and rehashed free market rhetoric , it appears iceland is not quite ready to jump ship and hand the wheel over to the pirates but they and their kind are looking better and better as each year passes and iceland drifts without a clear direction to prosperity and fairness in the long run , that tectonic split in politics is getting wider and wider , just like its geographical counterpart but it is the pirates who at least have captured the imagination of the people \( and , in particular the young \) if they can convince the rest of the public that they are more seriously interested in governing than in luring edward snowden here \( a publicity stunt at best \) and have more relevant meat and potato concerns beyond internet privacy , then they may very well be the ultimate winners a few years down the road join the debate on facebook jos m tirado is a puertorican poet , buddhist priest and political writer living in hafnarfjorur , iceland , known for its elves , hidden people and lava fields his articles and poetry have been featured in counterpunch , cyranos journal , the galway review , dissident voice , la respuesta , op ed news , among others he can be reached at

what donald trump just did is going to have social conservatives in a state of complete shock 14th , 2016 this is not what most social conservatives were expecting like millions of other americans , i greatly celebrated when donald trump pulled off a miracle on election night but within a week of his stunning election victory , many social conservatives already feel like they are being stabbed in the back on sunday , 60 minutes aired a post election interview with trump in which he explained that his stance on gay marriage is that it is settled and that he has no plans to try to overturn the supreme court decision legalizing it according to cnn , this answer could leave conservatives worried for the first time since winning the election , donald trump has weighed in on two of the most controversial social issues the supreme court has taken on ever gay marriage , and abortion his answers could leave conservatives worried trump indicated hes fine with the high courts opinion legalizing same sex marriage and called it settled , but committed to appointing justices who want to change the 1973 roe v wade ruling affirming abortion rights cnns article didnt fully capture the flavor of what trump actually said a mediaite article contained more extended quotes its irrelevant because it was already settled its law it was settled in the supreme court , trump said bluntly on 60 minutes i mean , its done he continued these cases have gone to the supreme court theyve been settled , and im fine with that you can see trump making these comments for yourself right here it is simply not accurate for trump to say that gay marriage is settled while roe v wade is not in the legal world , nothing is ever really settled just like roe v wade , trump could publicly commit to appointing supreme court justices that would overturn the legalization of gay marriage and without a doubt , the people that elected him were counting on him to do something about it but the truth is that he doesnt want to do something about it donald trump is fine with gay marriage , and so that political battle is now officially over for social conservatives , gay marriage is one of the big three abortion and israel are the other two red line issues , and since the election donald trump has also had some extremely disturbing remarks about israel in fact , trump just told the wall street journal that a peace agreement that would permanently divide the land of israel into two states would be the ultimate deal and that he is very interested in trying to make that happen for humanitys sake could it be possible that social conservatives have been betrayed again \? could it be possible that donald trump was just another politician that was willing to say anything to get elected \? so far trump has not appointed any prominent evangelical christians to any important posts , but it is being reported that trump is considering an openly gay man to represent the us at the united nations is considering a woman to run the republican party and an openly gay man to represent the us at the united nations , moves that would inject diversity into a trump team the incoming president is considering richard grenell as united states ambassador to the united nations if picked and ultimately confirmed by the senate , he would be the first openly gay person to fill a cabinet level foreign policy post grenell previously served as us spokesman at the u n under former president george w bushs administration and let us not forget that trump has already publicly sided with the transgender community in the bathroom warstrump , who has spent his life in liberal new york city , referred to lgbt republicans at the republican national convention and said during his campaign that transgender people should use whatever bathroom they feel comfortable using so did trump just use social conservatives to get elected just like george w bush did \? now that the election is over , trump is even calling the clintons good peopleclinton did some bad things , he said , but added that ultimately the clintons are good people i dont want to hurt them , i dont want to hurt them , he said theyre , theyre good people i dont want to hurt them and i will give you a very , very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 minutes together is he serious \? that is like calling the nazis good people hillary clinton is the most corrupt politician that seen , and no politician in america has done more to promote abortion than she has perhaps he has a different definition of good than the rest of us do of course a whole lot of social conservatives will get really upset when they read this article and at least a few will post comments staunchly defending donald trump and his positions on these issues i dont care who it is when our politicians come out in favor of gay marriage , men using womens restrooms or permanently dividing the land of israel , they deserve to be rebuked lets see if all of donald trumps new evangelical friends are willing to challenge him on these things my guess is that they will not be this is yet another sign that social conservatives and evangelical christians have fallen into great apostasy these days people just believe whatever they want to believe , and they are doing whatever is right in their own eyes on monday , we learned that one of the most popular christian bloggers in the entire country has come out as a lesbian doyle meltons brand new book is an oprah book club selection , and she separated from her husband not too long ago and of course it turns out that there was a very good reason for separating from her husband she has decided that she is no longer a heterosexual at all , and she has just announced that she is now dating female soccer star abby wambacha christian mommy blogger has announced she is dating retired soccer star abby wambach glennon doyle melton posted a smiling picture of herself and wambach on sunday , with the caption oh my god , she is so good to me she loves me for all the things ive always wanted to be loved for shes just my favorite my person both are newly single but of course donald trump is fine with that , and so is much of the evangelical christian world in my new book , i warned about the great apostasy that is coming , and the election of donald trump is not going to change that in fact , there is no possible way that america will ever be great again until we turn from our evil ways if we continue to murder millions of babies in our abortion mills , judgment will come to america if two thirds of all christian men continue to look at pornography on a regular basis , judgment will come to america if we continue to greatly celebrate things that god says are an abomination , judgment will come to america if divorce rates in the church continue to be about the same as they are in the world , judgment will come to america if we continue to have 20 million new cases of sexually transmitted disease every year , judgment will come to america the name of god is blasphemed in almost all of our movies and television shows , and yet christians still sit there and watch them every night america is among the world leaders in adultery , drug addiction , alcoholism , registered sex offenders and teen pregnancy , and we produce more pornography than the rest of the planet combined america is not great right now , and it never will be again unless we get our hearts right with god and at this moment , there are very serious doubts about whether donald trump is going to take us in the right direction as a nation

donate noam chomsky speaks in buenos aires , argentina , on march 12 , 2015 \( photo ministerio de cultura de la naci n argentina \) by c j polychroniou truth out org on november 8 , 2016 , donald trump managed to pull the biggest upset in us politics by tapping successfully into the anger of white voters and appealing to the lowest inclinations of people in a manner that would have probably impressed nazi propagandist joseph goebbels himself but what exactly does trump 's victory mean , and what can one expect from this megalomaniac when he takes over the reins of power on january 20 , 2017 \? what is trump 's political ideology , if any , and is trumpism a movement \? will us foreign policy be any different under a trump administration \? some years ago , public intellectual noam chomsky warned that the political climate in the us was ripe for the rise of an authoritarian figure now , he shares his thoughts on the aftermath of this election , the moribund state of the us political system and why trump is a real threat to the world and the planet in general c j polychroniou for truthout noam , the unthinkable has happened in contrast to all forecasts , donald trump scored a decisive victory over hillary clinton , and the man that michael moore described as a wretched , ignorant , dangerous part time clown and full time sociopath will be the next president of the united states in your view , what were the deciding factors that led american voters to produce the biggest upset in the history of us politics \? noam chomsky before turning to this question , i think it is important to spend a few moments pondering just what happened on november 8 , a date that might turn out to be one of the most important in human history , depending on how we react no exaggeration the most important news of november 8 was barely noted , a fact of some significance in itself on november 8 , the world meteorological organization \( wmo \) delivered a report at the international conference on climate change in morocco \( cop22 \) which was called in order to carry forward the paris agreement of cop21 the wmo reported that the past five years were the hottest on record it reported rising sea levels , soon to increase as a result of the unexpectedly rapid melting of polar ice , most ominously the huge antarctic glaciers already , arctic sea ice over the past five years is 28 percent below the average of the previous 29 years , not only raising sea levels , but also reducing the cooling effect of polar ice reflection of solar rays , thereby accelerating the grim effects of global warming the wmo reported further that temperatures are approaching dangerously close to the goal established by cop21 , along with other dire reports and forecasts another event took place on november 8 , which also may turn out to be of unusual historical significance for reasons that , once again , were barely noted on november 8 , the most powerful country in world history , which will set its stamp on what comes next , had an election the outcome placed total control of the government executive , congress , the supreme court in the hands of the republican party , which has become the most dangerous organization in world history apart from the last phrase , all of this is uncontroversial the last phrase may seem outlandish , even outrageous but is it \? the facts suggest otherwise the party is dedicated to racing as rapidly as possible to destruction of organized human life there is no historical precedent for such a stand is this an exaggeration \? consider what we have just been witnessing during the republican primaries , every candidate denied that what is happening is happening with the exception of the sensible moderates , like jeb bush , who said it 's all uncertain , but we do n't have to do anything because we 're producing more natural gas , thanks to fracking or john kasich , who agreed that global warming is taking place , but added that we are going to burn coal in ohio and we are not going to apologize for it the winning candidate , now the president elect , calls for rapid increase in use of fossil fuels , including coal dismantling of regulations rejection of help to developing countries that are seeking to move to sustainable energy and in general , racing to the cliff as fast as possible trump has already taken steps to dismantle the environmental protection agency \( epa \) by placing in charge of the epa transition a notorious \( and proud \) climate change denier , myron ebell trump 's top adviser on energy , billionaire oil executive harold hamm , announced his expectations , which were predictable dismantling regulations , tax cuts for the industry \( and the wealthy and corporate sector generally \) , more fossil fuel production , lifting obama 's temporary block on the dakota access pipeline the market reacted quickly shares in energy corporations boomed , including the world 's largest coal miner , peabody energy , which had filed for bankruptcy , but after trump 's victory , registered a 50 percent gain the effects of republican denialism had already been felt there had been hopes that the cop21 paris agreement would lead to a verifiable treaty , but any such thoughts were abandoned because the republican congress would not accept any binding commitments , so what emerged was a voluntary agreement , evidently much weaker effects may soon become even more vividly apparent than they already are in bangladesh alone , tens of millions are expected to have to flee from low lying plains in coming years because of sea level rise and more severe weather , creating a migrant crisis that will make today 's pale in significance with considerable justice , bangladesh 's leading climate scientist says that these migrants should have the right to move to the countries from which all these greenhouse gases are coming millions should be able to go to the united states and to the other rich countries that have grown wealthy while bringing about a new geological era , the anthropocene , marked by radical human transformation of the environment these catastrophic consequences can only increase , not just in bangladesh , but in all of south asia as temperatures , already intolerable for the poor , inexorably rise and the himalayan glaciers melt , threatening the entire water supply already in india , some 300 million people are reported to lack adequate drinking water and the effects will reach far beyond it is hard to find words to capture the fact that humans are facing the most important question in their history whether organized human life will survive in anything like the form we know and are answering it by accelerating the race to disaster similar observations hold for the other huge issue concerning human survival the threat of nuclear destruction , which has been looming over our heads for 70 years and is now increasing it is no less difficult to find words to capture the utterly astonishing fact that in all of the massive coverage of the electoral extravaganza , none of this receives more than passing mention at least i am at a loss to find appropriate words turning finally to the question raised , to be precise , it appears that clinton received a slight majority of the vote the apparent decisive victory has to do with curious features of american politics among other factors , the electoral college residue of the founding of the country as an alliance of separate states the winner take all system in each state the arrangement of congressional districts \( sometimes by gerrymandering \) to provide greater weight to rural votes \( in past elections , and probably this one too , democrats have had a comfortable margin of victory in the popular vote for the house , but hold a minority of seats \) the very high rate of abstention \( usually close to half in presidential elections , this one included \) of some significance for the future is the fact that in the age 18 25 range , clinton won handily , and sanders had an even higher level of support how much this matters depends on what kind of future humanity will face according to current information , trump broke all records in the support he received from white voters , working class and lower middle class , particularly in the 50 , 000 to 90 , 000 income range , rural and suburban , primarily those without college education these groups share the anger throughout the west at the centrist establishment , revealed as well in the unanticipated brexit vote and the collapse of centrist parties in continental europe many of the angry and disaffected are victims of the neoliberal policies of the past generation , the policies described in congressional testimony by fed chair alan greenspan st alan , as he was called reverentially by the economics profession and other admirers until the miraculous economy he was supervising crashed in 2007 2008 , threatening to bring the whole world economy down with it as greenspan explained during his glory days , his successes in economic management were based substantially on growing worker insecurity intimidated working people would not ask for higher wages , benefits and security , but would be satisfied with the stagnating wages and reduced benefits that signal a healthy economy by neoliberal standards working people , who have been the subjects of these experiments in economic theory , are not particularly happy about the outcome they are not , for example , overjoyed at the fact that in 2007 , at the peak of the neoliberal miracle , real wages for nonsupervisory workers were lower than they had been years earlier , or that real wages for male workers are about at 1960s levels while spectacular gains have gone to the pockets of a very few at the top , disproportionately a fraction of 1 not the result of market forces , achievement or merit , but rather of definite policy decisions , matters reviewed carefully by economist dean baker in recently published work the fate of the minimum wage illustrates what has been happening through the periods of high and egalitarian growth in the '50s and '60s , the minimum wage which sets a floor for other wages tracked productivity that ended with the onset of neoliberal doctrine since then , the minimum wage has stagnated \( in real value \) had it continued as before , it would probably be close to 20 per hour today , it is considered a political revolution to raise it to 15 with all the talk of near full employment today , labor force participation remains below the earlier norm and for working people , there is a great difference between a steady job in manufacturing with union wages and benefits , as in earlier years , and a temporary job with little security in some service profession apart from wages , benefits and security , there is a loss of dignity , of hope for the future , of a sense that this is a world in which i belong and play a worthwhile role the impact is captured well in arlie hochschild 's sensitive and illuminating portrayal of a trump stronghold in louisiana , where she lived and worked for many years she uses the image of a line in which residents are standing , expecting to move forward steadily as they work hard and keep to all the conventional values but their position in the line has stalled ahead of them , they see people leaping forward , but that does not cause much distress , because it is the american way for \( alleged \) merit to be rewarded what does cause real distress is what is happening behind them they believe that undeserving people who do not follow the rules are being moved in front of them by federal government programs they erroneously see as designed to benefit african americans , immigrants and others they often regard with contempt all of this is exacerbated by ronald reagan 's racist fabrications about welfare queens \( by implication black \) stealing white people 's hard earned money and other fantasies sometimes failure to explain , itself a form of contempt , plays a role in fostering hatred of government i once met a house painter in boston who had turned bitterly against the evil government after a washington bureaucrat who knew nothing about painting organized a meeting of painting contractors to inform them that they could no longer use lead paint the only kind that works as they all knew , but the suit did n't understand that destroyed his small business , compelling him to paint houses on his own with substandard stuff forced on him by government elites sometimes there are also some real reasons for these attitudes toward government bureaucracies hochschild describes a man whose family and friends are suffering bitterly from the lethal effects of chemical pollution but who despises the government and the liberal elites , because for him , the epa means some ignorant guy who tells him he ca n't fish , but does nothing about the chemical plants these are just samples of the real lives of trump supporters , who are led to believe that trump will do something to remedy their plight , though the merest look at his fiscal and other proposals demonstrates the opposite posing a task for activists who hope to fend off the worst and to advance desperately needed changes exit polls reveal that the passionate support for trump was inspired primarily by the belief that he represented change , while clinton was perceived as the candidate who would perpetuate their distress the change that trump is likely to bring will be harmful or worse , but it is understandable that the consequences are not clear to isolated people in an atomized society lacking the kinds of associations \( like unions \) that can educate and organize that is a crucial difference between today 's despair and the generally hopeful attitudes of many working people under much greater economic duress during the great depression of the 1930s there are other factors in trump 's success comparative studies show that doctrines of white supremacy have had an even more powerful grip on american culture than in south africa , and it 's no secret that the white population is declining in a decade or two , whites are projected to be a minority of the work force , and not too much later , a minority of the population the traditional conservative culture is also perceived as under attack by the successes of identity politics , regarded as the province of elites who have only contempt for the ''hard working , patriotic , church going white americans with real family values'' who see their familiar country as disappearing before their eyes one of the difficulties in raising public concern over the very severe threats of global warming is that 40 percent of the us population does not see why it is a problem , since christ is returning in a few decades about the same percentage believe that the world was created a few thousand years ago if science conflicts with the bible , so much the worse for science it would be hard to find an analogue in other societies the democratic party abandoned any real concern for working people by the 1970s , and they have therefore been drawn to the ranks of their bitter class enemies , who at least pretend to speak their language reagan 's folksy style of making little jokes while eating jelly beans , george w bush 's carefully cultivated image of a regular guy you could meet in a bar who loved to cut brush on the ranch in 100 degree heat and his probably faked mispronunciations \( it 's unlikely that he talked like that at yale \) , and now trump , who gives voice to people with legitimate grievances people who have lost not just jobs , but also a sense of personal self worth and who rails against the government that they perceive as having undermined their lives \( not without reason \) one of the great achievements of the doctrinal system has been to divert anger from the corporate sector to the government that implements the programs that the corporate sector designs , such as the highly protectionist corporate investor rights agreements that are uniformly mis described as free trade agreements in the media and commentary with all its flaws , the government is , to some extent , under popular influence and control , unlike the corporate sector it is highly advantageous for the business world to foster hatred for pointy headed government bureaucrats and to drive out of people 's minds the subversive idea that the government might become an instrument of popular will , a government of , by and for the people is trump representing a new movement in american politics , or was the outcome of this election primarily a rejection of hillary clinton by voters who hate the clintons and are fed up with politics as usual \? it 's by no means new both political parties have moved to the right during the neoliberal period today 's new democrats are pretty much what used to be called moderate republicans the political revolution that bernie sanders called for , rightly , would not have greatly surprised dwight eisenhower the republicans have moved so far toward a dedication to the wealthy and the corporate sector that they cannot hope to get votes on their actual programs , and have turned to mobilizing sectors of the population that have always been there , but not as an organized coalitional political force evangelicals , nativists , racists and the victims of the forms of globalization designed to set working people around the world in competition with one another while protecting the privileged and undermining the legal and other measures that provided working people with some protection , and with ways to influence decision making in the closely linked public and private sectors , notably with effective labor unions the consequences have been evident in recent republican primaries every candidate that has emerged from the base such as michele bachmann , herman cain or rick santorum has been so extreme that the republican establishment had to use its ample resources to beat them down the difference in 2016 is that the establishment failed , much to its chagrin , as we have seen deservedly or not , clinton represented the policies that were feared and hated , while trump was seen as the symbol of change change of what kind requires a careful look at his actual proposals , something largely missing in what reached the public the campaign itself was remarkable in its avoidance of issues , and media commentary generally complied , keeping to the concept that true objectivity means reporting accurately what is within the beltway , but not venturing beyond trump said following the outcome of the election that he will represent all americans how is he going to do that when the nation is so divided and he has already expressed deep hatred for many groups in the united states , including women and minorities \? do you see any resemblance between brexit and donald trump 's victory \? there are definite similarities to brexit , and also to the rise of the ultranationalist far right parties in europe whose leaders were quick to congratulate trump on his victory , perceiving him as one of their own nigel farage , marine le pen , viktor orban and others like them and these developments are quite frightening a look at the polls in austria and germany austria and germany cannot fail to evoke unpleasant memories for those familiar with the 1930s , even more so for those who watched directly , as i did as a child i can still recall listening to hitler 's speeches , not understanding the words , though the tone and audience reaction were chilling enough the first article that i remember writing was in february 1939 , after the fall of barcelona , on the seemingly inexorable spread of the fascist plague and by strange coincidence , it was from barcelona that my wife and i watched the results of the 2016 us presidential election unfold as to how trump will handle what he has brought forth not created , but brought forth we cannot say perhaps his most striking characteristic is unpredictability a lot will depend on the reactions of those appalled by his performance and the visions he has projected , such as they are trump has no identifiable political ideology guiding his stance on economic , social and political issues , yet there are clear authoritarian tendencies in his behavior therefore , do you find any validity behind the claims that trump may represent the emergence of fascism with a friendly face \? in the united states \? for many years , i have been writing and speaking about the danger of the rise of an honest and charismatic ideologue in the united states , someone who could exploit the fear and anger that has long been boiling in much of the society , and who could direct it away from the actual agents of malaise to vulnerable targets that could indeed lead to what sociologist bertram gross called friendly fascism in a perceptive study 35 years ago but that requires an honest ideologue , a hitler type , not someone whose only detectable ideology is me the dangers , however , have been real for many years , perhaps even more so in the light of the forces that trump has unleashed with the republicans in the white house , but also controlling both houses and the future shape of the supreme court , what will the us look like for at least the next four years \? a good deal depends on his appointments and circle of advisers early indications are unattractive , to put it mildly the supreme court will be in the hands of reactionaries for many years , with predictable consequences if trump follows through on his paul ryan style fiscal programs , there will be huge benefits for the very rich estimated by the tax policy center as a tax cut of over 14 percent for the top 0 1 percent and a substantial cut more generally at the upper end of the income scale , but with virtually no tax relief for others , who will also face major new burdens the respected economics correspondent of the financial times , martin wolf , writes that , the tax proposals would shower huge benefits on already rich americans such as mr trump , while leaving others in the lurch , including , of course , his constituency the immediate reaction of the business world reveals that big pharma , wall street , the military industry , energy industries and other such wonderful institutions expect a very bright future one positive development might be the infrastructure program that trump has promised while \( along with much reporting and commentary \) concealing the fact that it is essentially the obama stimulus program that would have been of great benefit to the economy and to the society generally , but was killed by the republican congress on the pretext that it would explode the deficit while that charge was spurious at the time , given the very low interest rates , it holds in spades for trump 's program , now accompanied by radical tax cuts for the rich and corporate sector and increased pentagon spending there is , however , an escape , provided by dick cheney when he explained to bush 's treasury secretary paul o'neill that reagan proved that deficits do n't matter meaning deficits that we republicans create in order to gain popular support , leaving it to someone else , preferably democrats , to somehow clean up the mess the technique might work , for a while at least there are also many questions about foreign policy consequences , mostly unanswered there is mutual admiration between trump and putin how likely is it therefore that we may see a new era in us russia relations \? one hopeful prospect is that there might be reduction of the very dangerous and mounting tensions at the russian border note the russian border , not the mexican border thereby lies a tale that we cannot go into here it is also possible that europe might distance itself from trump 's america , as already suggested by german chancellor angela merkel and other european leaders and from the british voice of american power , after brexit that might possibly lead to european efforts to defuse the tensions , and perhaps even efforts to move towards something like mikhail gorbachev 's vision of an integrated eurasian security system without military alliances , rejected by the us in favor of nato expansion , a vision revived recently by putin , whether seriously or not , we do not know , since the gesture was dismissed is us foreign policy under a trump administration likely to be more or less militaristic than what we have seen under the obama administration , or even the george w bush administration \? i do n't think one can answer with any confidence trump is too unpredictable there are too many open questions what we can say is that popular mobilization and activism , properly organized and conducted , can make a large difference and we should bear in mind that the stakes are very large copyright , truthout reprinted with

presidential elections are a form of madness that comes over us once every four years they fit the great man or woman narrative of history , seducing us into forgetting how powerful we are they erase our memory of grassroots power , direct democracy and civil society leaders beget followers people pin their hopes on one person , and with that they seem to shed responsibility for anything beyond getting that one person into office or , they wash their hands of any further involvement if its not their one person and so it is this time around with the election a matter of days away and the media engrossed in a fight to end all fights , it sometimes seems as though weve lost sight of the powers that belong to us and not them , and the responsibilities and possibilities that go with our power the intensely personal nature of this campaign and the particular danger of donald trump has created a kind of tunnel vision we forget our own influence , the innumerable times weve swayed outcome which is not to say that the outcome is unimportant far from it many clinton supporters seem quietly confident of a win i am less complacent weve had enough surprises this year in britain , in colombia to know that voters have a way of confounding those who observe them a trump presidency would be a terrible thing but a clinton victory would be far from an occasion to sigh with relief , sit back and resume life as though the last few months had been a bad dream a clinton victory , in fact , would be just a starting point for a new kind of campaign a politician is not a given each one is

for years or decades , outside and around , below and above electoral politics they drown out the histories that matter how women got the vote , how the civil rights movement progressed , how the free trade area of the americas trade deal withered and died , how the world trade organization was hobbled and its poorer member nations inspired to revolt by the great 1999 shutdown in seattle , how fracking got banned in new york state , how rape law has been radically revised in many ways and places thanks to feminist action and discourse in all these cases , the people who we mislabel leaders only followed the will of the people to reiterate it matters who is president , but what a president does has everything to do with what the people demand or refuse or do themselves , and what the house and senate send them or sabotage mitt romney promised to build the keystone xl pipeline himself if elected republicans for the foreseeable future will be puppets of the fossil fuel industry democrats are not necessarily our friends or allies , but they are sometimes politicians who can be pushed obama wavered on that pipeline for several years when he vetoed it , it was not because of who he is , but because of who we are , we the members of a climate movement that organized , educated , campaigned , blockaded and demonstrated for years , building a powerful movement that the president has become so much more engaged with climate is a result what the movement did it educated us on the science , made the case for the urgency and importance of action , built global coalitions , shed light on the ways climate is an economic and racial justice issue , started innumerable campaigns to block pipelines , divest , implement efficiency and good design , and shift to renewable resources a lot of other changes that matter have happened at the local level as cities , regions and states have done great work on climate , led by community organizers , small groups and minor politicians youll never hear about the obama administration could have done much more if more of the people who elected him stuck around to push back against the corporations , well organized

oregon live juror 4 vigorously defends the across the board acquittals of ammon bundy and his six co defendants , calling the rulings a statement about the prosecutions failure to prove the fundamental elements of a conspiracy charge the full time marylhurst university business administration student was the juror who had sent a note to the judge on the fourth day of the initial jurys deliberations in the case , questioning the impartiality of a fellow juror , no 11 , who the judge bounced from the jury a day later it should be known that all 12 jurors felt that this verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution to prove conspiracy in the count itself and not any form of affirmation of the defenses various beliefs , actions or aspirations , juror 4 wrote friday in a lengthy email to the oregonian oregonlive he expressed relief that he can now speak out freely , but he wasnt ready as of friday morning to drop his anonymity he said his studies have suffered since the trial started , and hes not ready for the attention revealing his identity would bring but felt it was important to defend the verdict the judge withheld jurors names during the jury selection process and trial , instead referring to each by number the jury closely followed u s district judge anna j browns instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence and testimony heard during the five week trial , he said the jury returned unanimous verdicts of not guilty to conspiracy charges against all seven defendants each was accused of conspiring to prevent employees of the u s fish and wildlife service and bureau of land management from carrying out their official work through intimidation , threat or force during the 41 day occupation juror 4 noted the panel couldnt simply rely on the defendantsdefining actions to convict all 12 agreed that impeding existed , even if as an effect of the occupation , he wrote but we were not asked to judge on bullets and hurt feelings , rather to decide if any agreement was made with an illegal object in mind , the marylhurst student wrote it seemed this basic , high standard of proof was lost upon the prosecution throughout prosecutors had argued that the case , at its core , was about the illegal taking of anothers property the heavily armed guards that manned the front gate and watchtower during the 41 day takeover , in and of itself , was intimidating , and prevented officers from the u s fish and wildlife service and u s bureau of land management from carrying out their work , they said they argued that the alleged conspiracy began nov 5 , when ammon bundy and ally ryan payne met with harney county sheriff dave ward and promised there would be extreme civil unrest in the community if he didnt step in and block harney county ranchers dwight hammond jr and steven hammond the hammonds were slated to return to federal prison on jan 4 and serve out a mandatory minimum five year sentence for arson on federal land defense lawyers urged jurors in closing arguments not to mix up the effect of the occupation which undoubtedly kept federal employees from doing their jobs from the intent of the occupiers five of the seven defendants , including ammon bundy , testified many said that they were there to protest in support of the hammonds and federal government overreach because they received absolutely no response from state or local government officials to their previous efforts to spur change the defense lawyers arguments , coupled with the jury instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence , resonated with jurors , juror 4 noted inference , while possibly compelling , proved to be insulting or inadequate to 12 diversely situated people as a means to convict , the juror wrote the air of triumphalism that the prosecution brought was not lost on any of us , nor was it warranted given their burden of proof juror 4 plainly stated that fellow juror 11 , during the initial round of deliberations , had zero business being on this jury in the first place juror 11 had worked for the u s bureau of land management as a ranch tech and firefighter more than 20 years ago , he had said during jury selection asked by the judge during voir dire if that experience would impede his ability to be a fair and impartial judge of the facts , he said , not really juror 4 explained why he didnt alert the court immediately after he had heard juror 11 , on day one of deliberations reportedly say , i am very biased it wasnt until the fourth day into deliberations that juror 4 sent a note to the court , asking if a juror who had worked previously for the federal land management agency and outright told the panel he was very biased could be an impartial judge the court , flummoxed by the development , a day later dismissed juror 11 for good cause , after the prosecution and defense teams agreed to the dismissal at the time , parties to the case werent sure which way juror 11s alleged bias fell juror 4 said he resisted the impulse to send the question sooner in an effort to give his fellow juror a chance to explain himself in his email to the oregonian oregonlive , juror 4 , for the first time , also contended that juror 11 violated the judges explicit orders by hearkening to evidence that was never admitted in this case , refused to consider the defendants state of mind and used imaginative theories to explain key actions ' juror 4 said , though , he wishes that he had sent the letter on day one , since it would have alleviated much stress for all of us the maryville business student said he is baffled by what he described as observersflippant sentiments in the wake of the jurys acquittals dont they know that not guilty does not mean innocent \? he wrote it was not lost on us that our verdict \( s \) might inspire future actions that are regrettable , but that sort of thinking was not permitted when considering the charges before us the jury , he said , met with judge brown after the verdicts were announced and after the u s marshals physical confrontation and arrest of bundy lawyer marcus mumford he said many of the jurors questioned the judge about why the federal government chose the conspiracy charge he said he learned that a potential alternate charge , such as criminal trespass , wouldnt have brought as significant a penalty the charge of conspiring to impede federal employees from carrying out their official work through intimidation , threat or force brings a maximum sentence of six years in prison we all queried about alternative charges that could stick and were amazed that this conspiracy charge seemed the best possible option , juror 4 said maxine bernstein
mysterious universe do other realities brush up against our own \? are there parallel dimensions lying just beyond through some thin , untraceable veil separating us \? the idea of parallel realities beyond our own is not new , yet what if this phenomenon were to come bursting forth from the realm of theory and speculation and come crashing down into the now \? are there perhaps some people who have stepped over that barrier into domains we have not yet to see and which we may indeed not even be meant to see \? i have covered such alleged excursions into the horizon beyond our known reality here at mysterious universe before , and here i will revisit this topic with a selection of other cases that seem to imply the possibility that not only are parallel dimensions real , but that they are destinations to which we can be whisked away , whether intentional or not in the september , 1956 issue of fate magazine there was the curious story of a woman who apparently shifted into another parallel universe in 1934 according to the report , in the fall of that year a woman by the name of miriam golding had a profoundly unusual experience while riding an elevator with her fiancee in chicago the elevator was crowded , and when miriam made a mistake and got off at the wrong floor she found that she could not push her way back in past the throng of people and resigned herself to waiting for the next one that was when she looked around and was startled to realize that she was no longer in the store at all , but rather an expansive train station the enormous railway station she found herself in was allegedly bustling with fevered activity , with throngs of travelers rushing to their trains and booming announcements of arrivals and departures echoing through the air there seemed to be no way this busy place could have any connection whatsoever to the music store she had been in moments before the confused miriam made her way to an information booth to ask where she was , but found that the woman working there completely ignored her , as if she werent there at all perplexed , miriam followed a series of signs pointing the way to the street outside , and she emerged out into a mild , sunny afternoon that seemed to be in the midst of summer rather than fall , in a place that was most certainly not chicago she wandered about in confusion and noticed that everyone around her seemed to completely ignore her and walk on by as if they did not even see her at some point she claims that she saw a confused looking boy standing in the sidewalk similarly being passed on by people who seemed to have no idea he was even there , and miriam approached him wondering what was going on the boy was able to actually see and respond to her , and looked in her direction , the first time anyone had acknowledged her presence in this strange , surreal place as she approached , the boy seemed equally relieved that he was visible to miriam , smiled slightly and purportedly saying i guess they let you off at the wrong stop , too the two lost people walked together down the street in confusion , the whole time completely ignored by those around them , and the boy told miriam of what had happened to him he claimed that he had been playing tennis in lincoln , nebraska , in the united states , and had gone to the locker room to change his shoes when he had gone back to the courts to play some more he had found that the tennis courts that had been there moments before were now gone and in their place was a huge train terminal , which had turned out to be the exact same station into which miriam had enigmatically entered from the elevator the two allegedly kept on walking until they reached an open area that led to water , and over the waves they could apparently make out a sand bar with several women upon it chatting and seeming to act as if nothing was beyond the ordinary to miriams astonishment , one of the women was oddly her fiancees sister the women out on the sandbar seemed to notice them and began waving and shouting to miriam and her companion this encouraged the boy to try and make a swim out to the sandbar , which did not seem so far and which he was confident he could reach yet even though he was a good swimmer it seemed that no matter how much he tried and pushed against the waves , he was unable to draw any closer to the mysterious sandbar and he returned to shore in frustration it was then that the sandbar supposedly suddenly vanished into thin air miriam closed her eyes in exasperation , disappointment , and exhaustion , and then was overcome by the sensation of floating through space after some time of this odd feeling of hovering in darkness she claimed that she suddenly opened her eyes to find herself sitting atop a stool in the music store in chicago , which seemed to be in the process of closing for the night , suggesting that she had been there for at least several hours disoriented , miriam looked around for her fiancee but could not find him and decided to head back to his home when she arrived , her fiancee was noticeably relieved and explained that he had lost her in the store and had waited for her to come to the right floor for a few hours before deciding to go back home bizarrely , the fiancees sister , whom miriam had seen on the mysterious sandbar earlier , claimed that she had seen miriam in town and had even called out to her , but that she had been too absorbed in talking to a young boy to notice her where did miriam go during that time \? why should she see her fiancees sister on a sandbar while the sister had seen her in town , all while they could not reach across to communicate \? were they separated by strange barriers we do not and may not ever understand \? it is a mystery another strange article in the april , 1959 issue of fate magazine tells of the weird experience of a frances e peterson of keokuk , iowa , who in 1935 was traveling home with her husband and four children from a weekend trip to missouri on the way they noticed what looked like a quaint , scenic detour in the area of st patrick and they whimsically took it , driving along the rustic , quiet scenery until they reached the rim of an expansive valley in addition to the picturesque scenery was the rather odd sight of several women in old fashioned sun bonnets and long skirts and aprons busily pulling water from a well into simple wooden buckets and carrying them off on wooden poles balanced across their shoulders there were men here as well , who all had beards and wore similarly old fashioned clothes such as smocks and large black hats , and who were tending flocks of sheep and goats or collecting firewood enamored with the quaint , charming scene , they later asked locals what the settlement was , yet were told that no such place had ever existed convinced that it did indeed exist , peterson and her husband returned to the area several times afterwards , but could find no sign of the valley they had seen or its unusual inhabitants , suggesting that either the family or the place they had visited had been temporarily transported over some little understood thin spot between realities in another similarly strange road story from 1962 , a mr r w balcom and his wife were driving to lake tahoe from their home in live oak , california the couple stopped at a quaint restaurant nestled away off of highway 50 a few miles from placerville they had never noticed the restaurant there before in all of their years of traveling along the same route , even though it seemed from its weathered , rustic look to have been there for years , and they decided to stop there for a bite to eat the food was described as being surprisingly good and the service was cordial and friendly , so they decided that they would visit again on their return trip from lake tahoe they attempted to seek out the charming little restaurant to eat there again , but when they arrived at the location it was reportedly gone as if it had never been there at all perplexed , the couple supposedly spent three more weekends traveling through the area in an effort to find the restaurant that they were convinced was there , but never found it again did balcom and his wife travel to a parallel universe for lunch \? no one knows an intriguing case of a mysterious doorway to another dimension and perhaps even through time itself occurred in 1956 , when a treasure hunter by the name of ron quinn ventured with his brother chuck and some friends into the remote and rugged mountains of southeastern arizona looking for mysterious lost spanish treasures and gold mines the case begins with high strangeness and only gets more bizarre as it goes on three weeks into their adventure , the treasure hunters set up camp one night , and that evening they were surprised to see two large balls of bluish green light floating about in the darkened , starry sky the bewildered campers determined that these were not flares of any kind , nor any sort of known aircraft the weird balls of light hovered about for several minutes before vanishing behind some mountain peaks the next evening , the same phenomenon was witnessed again when they mentioned the strange lights to a local cowboy named louie romero , he informed them that the unexplained lights were a recurring phenomenon in the area , and had been seen as far back as 1939 the group would spot the strange lights several more times over the course of their excursion ron and chuck quinn at one point during their travels , the group passed by what looked like a stone archway , which stood out as something of an anomaly upon the landscape , looking decidedly out of place , yet they didnt think much of it until later , when they spoke to a native local named john , who claimed that the archway had long been surrounded by strange stories and rumors that anyone who entered the doorway never came out , and that objects thrown in would not emerge from the other side , earning the structure the name doorway of the gods there were also stories of the archway shimmering , and of strange figures lurking around it dressed in old fashioned clothing that did not seem to be ghosts , as they disturbed the gravel where they stepped and cast shadows , yet they would suddenly vanish there were also tales of camps near the archway that had been mysteriously abandoned and of prospectors who had never returned from the area john relayed his own tale of strangeness concerning the archway , claiming that one dark and stormy day he had visited it and peered through it to see that , although the scenery was the same , the sky was oddly clear and blue on the other side when he looked around the edge of the doorway , the clouds were once again dark and thick , hanging menacingly over the scene , and the bizarre sight with its contrasting views frightened him enthralled with these odd stories , quinn and his group went back through the perilous rocky terrain to find the mysterious archway and investigate it they managed to locate the strange looking structure once again , and upon closer inspection it proved to be surrounded with an unusually large deposit of geodes , some of which were broken open with their interiors glittering in the sun the archway itself was measured as being around 7 feet high and 5 feet wide , with columns of andesite 15 inches diameter and it stood beside a steep , rocky slope after checking it out , the team went to work testing out the weird stories by throwing various rocks through the opening , but the rocks all mundanely fell to the ground on the other side and there was no sign of anything remotely mysterious whatsoever increasingly skeptical , some of the members of the team boldly put their arms through without incident , although no one was willing to try stepping all the way through after around an hour of this , they departed no closer to understanding the supposed mystery of this location however , a weird series of events would unfold in the coming days that would make them think that something strange was going on chuck quinn with some of the geodes from the site one day as they were checking out the portal yet again and collect some of the geodes , roy and another member of the team , walt , noticed that the stone portal seemed to be shimmering as if simmering in intense heat , even though it was a cold january day the odd shimmering allegedly lasted a few minutes , during which time both men claimed that they could feel a building pressure within their ears , before the shimmering and the weird physical sensation slowly ebbed away the inexplicable event spooked both of them , especially roy , who vowed never to go anywhere near the archway again on another occasion , the group came across another group of three treasure hunters who claimed that they had also camped out near the mysterious stone portal the group claimed that that evening their camp had been hit by what sounded like rain hitting their tents , even though it was a clear night looking out of their tents , they were met with the sight of small , reddish brown pebbles around the size of a pea falling in great numbers from above the pebbles were found to be warm to the touch and there was no explanation for where they came from they had seemed to be made of some king of iron ore all of these escalating odd occurrences would point to something decidedly strange going on at the archway , but the most bizarre incident would happen years after the expedition was over four years after that fateful treasure hunt , on october 14 , 1973 , chuck quinn was compelled to make a personal trip to the site of the stone portal that had eluded their understanding , and arrived at the canyon that led up to the slopes that would lead up to the site chuck went about climbing up the steep , rocky slopes towards the archway , stopping for a breather about halfway up the harrowing climb it was here as he looked out west over the majestic scenery all around him that he noticed that there was a canyon that should not have been there baffled , he made his way back down the slope to enter from the east , and it was here that he realized that in fact he was in the same canyon he had been in before , only he had somehow been transported 250 yards down the canyon he had hiked along , and to another slope that was facing south rather than west the strange event convinced him that indeed there was something strange going on here , and hastily left the scene was this some sort of doorway to another dimension or merely tall tales \? one wonders if perhaps some of the more bizarre vanishings and reappearances of people also have some form of interdimensional shift at their core at about 7 00 p m on august 15 , 1960 , 6 year old kathy cramer , of woods hole , massachusetts simply vanished from her room in her home her parents had checked on her when she was sleeping one minute , and the next she was gone without a trace when authorities arrived the house was searched top to bottom , and no signs of forced entry or a struggle could be found cathys bed seemed to be in a peaceful state , with no sign of being disturbed in any kind of confrontation the window to the room was also closed and showed no signs of anyone coming in or going out that way an intensive search was immediately launched , composed of hundreds of people including police , firemen , volunteers , airmen from nearby otis air force base , and bloodhounds , as well as the coast guard scouring the nearby coast , yet absolutely no evidence of the missing girl could be found anywhere she had simply vanished off the face of the earth then later , at 3am on that same evening , cathys very worried parents went into to her room to be startled by the sight of their missing daughter sleeping peacefully in her bed as if she had never been gone when she was asked about where she had been , the girl gave the cryptic response of im not telling what in the world happened to this little girl \? how could a 6 year old disappear from her bed , elude an intensive search by various professionals , and then reappear fast asleep exactly where she had vanished \? is this also perhaps an example of someone crossing through the veil between realities to pass temporarily into some parallel world or dimension \? the only person who knows the answer to that is cathy cramer herself , and shes not telling so are any of these accounts somehow anchored in any way to reality as we know it \? are these the realm of the lost mind untethered , spinning fantastical tales either out of hallucination , insanity , or an irrational attempt to make sense of distorted perceptions \? can this all simply be explained away somehow or is there a genuine phenomenon hinting at forces of the universe we have yet to comprehend buried within these disparate accounts \? are we perhaps just one of many alternate realities stacked upon one another and which between slips , shifting and travel are possible \? the answers are elusive , and we may continue to pour over and debate them forever however as long as there is the probability and possibility of worlds beyond our own there will always be those who look out into our universe , or perhaps inward , to seek to try to grasp just what this all might mean in the meantime , cases like this will remain a tantalizing peek into what just may be out there beyond our grasp to conceive of it

trump in the white house by november 14 , cj polychroniou noam , the unthinkable has happened in contrast to all forecasts , donald trump scored a decisive victory over hillary clinton and the man that michael moore described as wretched , ignorant , dangerous part time clown and full time sociopath is the next president of the united states in your view , what were the deciding factors that led american voters produce the biggest upset in the history of us politics \? before turning to this question , i think it is important to spend a few moments pondering just what happened on november 8 , a date that might turn out to be one of the most important in human history , depending on how we react no exaggeration the most important news of november 8 was barely noted , a fact of some significance in itself on november 8 , the world meteorological organization delivered a report at the international conference on climate change in morocco , cop22 , which was called in order to carry forward the paris agreements of cop21 the wmo reported that the past five years were the hottest on record it reported rising sea levels , soon to increase as a result of the unexpectedly rapid melting of polar ice , most ominously the huge antarctic glaciers already arctic sea ice over the past five years is 28 percent below the average of the previous 29 years , not only raising sea levels but also reducing the cooling effect of polar ice reflection of solar rays , thereby accelerating the grim effects of global warming the wmo reported further that temperatures are approaching dangerously close to the goal established by cop21 , along with other dire reports and forecasts another event took place on november 8 , which also may turn out to be of unusual historical significance for reasons that , once again , were barely noted on november 8 , the most powerful country in world history , which will set its stamp on what comes next , had an election the outcome placed total control of the government the executive , congress , the supreme court in the hands of the republican party , the most dangerous organization in world history apart from the last phrase , all of this is uncontroversial the last phrase may seem outlandish , even outrageous but is it \? the facts suggest otherwise the party is dedicated to racing as rapidly as possible to destruction of organized human life there is no historical precedent for such a stand is this an exaggeration \? consider what we have just been witnessing during the republican primaries , every candidate denied that what is happening is happening with the exception of the sensible moderates , like jeb bush , who said its all uncertain but we dont have to do anything because were producing more natural gas , thanks to fracking or john kasich , who agreed that global warming is taking place but added that we are going to burn coal in ohio and we are not going to apologize for it the winning candidate , now the president elect , calls for rapid increase in use of fossil fuels , including coal dismantling of regulations rejection of help to developing countries that are seeking to move to sustainable energy and in general racing to the cliff as fast as possible trump has already taken steps to dismantle the environmental protection agency by placing in charge of the epa transition a notorious \( and proud \) climate change denier , myron ebell trumps top adviser on energy , billionaire oil executive harold hamm , announced his expectations , which were predictable dismantling regulations , tax cuts for the industry \( and the wealthy and corporate sector generally \) , more fossil fuel production , lifting obamas temporary block on the dakota access pipeline the market reacted quickly shares in energy corporations boomed , including the worlds largest coal miner , peabody energy , which had filed for bankruptcy , but after trumps victory registered a 50 gain the effects of republican denialism had already been felt there had been hopes that the cop21 paris agreement would lead to a verifiable treaty , but any such thoughts were abandoned because the republican congress would not accept any binding commitments , so what emerged was a voluntary agreement , evidently much weaker effects may soon become even more vividly apparent than they already are in bangladesh alone , tens of millions are expected to have to flee from low lying plains in coming years because of sea level rise and more severe weather , creating a migrant crisis that will make todays pale into insignificance with considerable justice , bangladeshs leading climate scientist says that these migrants should have the right to move to the countries from which all these greenhouse gases are coming millions should be able to go to the united states and to the other rich countries that have grown wealthy while bringing about a new geological era , the anthropocene , marked by radical human transformation of the environment these catastrophic consequences can only increase , not just in bangladesh but in all of south asia as temperatures , already intolerable for the poor , inexorably rise and the himalayan glaciers melt , threatening the entire water supply already in india some 300 million people are reported to lack drinking water and the effects will reach far beyond it is hard to find words to capture the fact that humans are facing the most important question in their history whether organized human life will survive in anything like the form we know and are answering it by accelerating the race to disaster similar observations hold for the other huge issue concerning human survival , the threat of nuclear destruction that has been looming over our heads for 70 years , and is now increasing it is no less difficult to find words to capture the utterly astonishing fact that in all of the massive coverage of the electoral extravaganza , none of this receives more than passing mention at least i am at a loss to find appropriate words turning finally to the question raised , to be precise it appears that clinton received a slight majority of the vote the apparent decisive victory has to do with curious features of american politics among other factors , the electoral college residue of the founding of the country as an alliance of separate states the winner take all system in each state arrangement of congressional districts \( sometimes by gerrymandering \) to provide greater weight to rural votes \( in past elections , probably this one too , democrats have had a comfortable margin of victory in popular vote for the house but hold a minority of seats \) the very high rate of abstention \( usually close to half in presidential elections , this one too \) of some significance for the future is the fact that in the 18 25 range , clinton won handily , and sanders had an even higher level of support how much this matters depends on what kind of future humanity will face according to current information , trump broke all records in the support he received from white voters , working class and lower middle class , particularly in the 50 , 000 to 90 , 000 income range , rural and suburban , primarily those without college education these groups share the anger throughout the west at the centrist establishment , revealed as well in the unanticipated brexit vote and the collapse of centrist parties in continental europe the angry and disaffected are victims of the neoliberal policies of the past generation , the policies described in congressional testimony by fed chair alan greenspan st alan as he was called reverentially by the economics profession and other admirers until the miraculous economy he was supervising crashed in 2007 8 , threatening to bring the whole world economy down with it as greenspan explained during his glory days , his successes in economic management were based substantially on growing worker insecurity intimidated working people would not ask for higher wages , benefits , and security but would be satisfied with the stagnating wages and reduced benefits that signal a healthy economy by neoliberal standards working people who have been the subjects of these experiments in economic theory are , oddly , not particularly happy about the outcome they are not , for example , overjoyed at the fact that in 2007 , at the peak of the neoliberal miracle , real wages for non supervisory workers were lower than they had been years earlier , or that real wages for male workers are about at 1960s levels while spectacular gains have gone to the pockets of a very few at the top , disproportionately a fraction of 1 not the result of market forces , achievement , or merit , but rather of definite policy decisions , matters reviewed carefully by economist dean baker in recently published work the fate of the minimum wage illustrates what has been happening through the periods of high and egalitarian growth in the 50s and 60s , the minimum wage which sets a floor for other wages tracked productivity that ended with the onset of neoliberal doctrine since then the minimum wage has stagnated \( in real value \) had it continued as before , it would probably be close to 20 per hour today it is considered a political revolution to raise it to 15 with all the talk of near full employment today , labor force participation remains below the earlier norm and for a working man , there is a great difference between a steady job in manufacturing with union wages and benefits , as in earlier years , and a temporary job with little security in some service profession apart from wages , benefits , and security , there is a loss of dignity , of hope for the future , of a sense that this is a world in which i belong and play a worthwhile role the impact is captured well in arlie hochschilds sensitive and illuminating portrayal of a trump stronghold in louisiana , where she lived and worked for many years she uses the image of a line in which these people are standing , expecting to move forward steadily as they work hard and keep to all the conventional values but their position in the line has stalled ahead of them , they see people leaping forward , but that does not cause much distress , because it is the american way for \( alleged \) merit to be rewarded what does cause real distress is what is happening behind them undeserving people who do not follow the rules are being moved in front of them by federal government programs designed to benefit african americans , immigrants , and others they often regard with contempt all of this is exacerbated by reagans racist fabrications about strapping young bucks and welfare queens \( by implication black \) stealing your hard earned money , and other fantasies which are sometimes tinged with shreds of reality , as is usually the case with ugly and dangerous concoctions designed to deflect attention from the real agents of distress to easy scapegoats sometimes failure to explain , itself a form of contempt , plays a role i once met a house painter in boston who had turned bitterly against the evil government after a washington bureaucrat who knew nothing about painting organized a meeting of painting contractors to inform them that they could no longer use lead paint , the only kind that works , as they all knew but the suit didnt understand that destroyed his small business , compelling him to paint houses on his own with substandard stuff forced on him by government elites sometimes there are also some reasons hochschild describes a man whose family and friends are suffering bitterly from the lethal effects of chemical pollution but who despises the government , and the liberal elites , because for him , the epa means some ignorant guy who tells him he cant fish but does nothing about the chemical plants these are just samples of the real lives of trump supporters , who are deluded to believe that trump will do something to remedy their plight , though the merest look at his fiscal and other proposals demonstrates the opposite posing a task for activists who hope to fend off the worst and to advance desperately needed changes exit polls reveal that the passionate support for trump was inspired primarily by the belief that he represented change , while clinton was perceived as the candidate who would perpetuate their distress the change that trump is likely to bring will be harmful or worse , but it is understandable that the consequences are not clear to isolated people in an atomized society lacking the kinds of associations \( like unions \) that can educate and organize that is a crucial difference between todays despair and the generally hopeful attitudes of many working people under much greater duress during the great depression of the 1930s there are other factors in trumps success comparative studies show that doctrines of white supremacy have had an even more powerful grip on american culture than in south africa , and its no secret that the white population is declining in a decade or two whites are projected to be a minority of the work force , and not too much later a minority of the population the traditional conservative culture is also perceived as under attack by the successes of identity politics , regarded as the province of elites who have only contempt for hard working patriotic church going americans with real family values whose country is disappearing before their eyes it is worth remembering that before world war ii , though it had long been the richest country in the world , the us was not a major player in global affairs and was also something of a cultural backwater someone who wanted to study physics would go to germany an aspiring writer or artist would go to paris that changed radically with world war ii , for obvious reasons , but only for part of the population much remained culturally traditional to mention one example of great significance , one of the difficulties in raising public concern over the very severe threats of global warming is that 40 of the population do not see why it is a problem , since christ is returning in a few decades about the same percentage believe that the world was created a few thousand years ago if science conflicts with the bible , so much the worse for science it would be hard to find an analogue in other societies the democratic party abandoned any real concern for working people by the 1970s , and they have therefore been drawn to the ranks of their bitter class enemies , who at least pretend to speak their language reagans folksy style with little jokes while eating jelly beans , w bushs carefully cultivated image of a regular guy you could meet in a bar who loved to cut brush on the ranch in 100 degree heat and his probably faked mispronunciations \( its unlikely that he talked like that at yale \) , and now trump , who gives voice to people with legitimate grievances who have lost not just jobs but also a sense of personal self worth and who rails against the government that they perceive as having undermined their lives \( not without reason \) one of the great achievements of the doctrinal system has been to divert anger from the corporate sector to the government that implements the programs it designs , such as the highly protectionist corporate investor rights agreements that are uniformly mis described as free trade agreements in the media and commentary with all its flaws , the government is to some extent under popular influence and control , unlike the corporate sector it is highly advantageous for the business world to foster hatred for pointy headed government bureaucrats and to drive out of peoples minds the subversive idea that the government might become an instrument of popular will , a government of , by , and for the people is trump representing a new movement in american politics , or was the outcome of this election primarily a rejection of hillary clinton by voters who hate the clintons and are fed up with politics as usual \? its by no means new both political parties have moved to the right during the neoliberal period todays new democrats are pretty much what used to be called moderate republicans the political revolution that bernie sanders called for , rightly , would not have greatly surprised dwight eisenhower the republicans have moved so far to dedication to the wealthy and the corporate sector that they cannot hope to get votes on their actual programs , and have turned to mobilizing sectors of the population that have always been there but not as an organized political force evangelicals , nativists , racists , and the victims of the forms of globalization designed to set working people around the world in competition with one another while protecting the privileged and undermining the legal and other measures that provided working people with some protection and with ways to influence decision making in the closely linked public and private sectors , notably with effective labor unions the consequences have been evident in recent republican primaries every candidate that has emerged from the base bachmann , cain , santorum , has been so extreme that the republican establishment had to use its ample resources to beat them down the difference in 2016 is that the establishment failed , much to its chagrin , as we have seen deservedly or not , clinton represented the policies that were feared and hated while trump was seen as the symbol of change change of what kind requires a careful look at his actual proposals , something largely missing in what reached the public the campaign itself was remarkable in its avoidance of issues , and media commentary generally complied , keeping to the concept that true objectivity means reporting accurately what is within the beltway but not venturing beyond trump said following the outcome of the election that he will represent all americans how is be going to do that when the nation is so divided and he has already expressed deep hatred for many groups in the united states , including women and minorities \? do you see any resemblance between brexit and donald trumps victory \? there are definite similarities to brexit , and also to the rise of the ultranationalist far right parties in europe whose leaders were quick to congratulate trump on his victory , perceiving him as one of their own farrage , le pen , orban , and others like them and these developments are quite frightening a look at the polls in austria and germany austria and germany cannot fail to evoke unpleasant memories for those familiar with the 1930s , even more so for those who watched directly , as i did as a child i can still recall listening to hitlers speeches , not understanding the words though the tone and audience reaction were chilling enough the first article that i remember writing was in february 1939 , after the fall of barcelona , on the seemingly inexorable spread of the fascist plague and by strange coincidence , it was in barcelona that my wife and i watched tuesdays events as to how trump will handle what he has brought forth not created , but brought forth we cannot say perhaps his most striking characteristic is unpredictability a lot will depend on the reactions of those appalled by his performance and the visions he has projected , such as they are trump has no identifiable political ideology guiding his stance on economic , social , and political issues , yet there are clear authoritarian tendencies in his behavior therefore , do you find any validity behind the claims that trump may represent the emergence of fascism with a friendly face \? in the united states \? for many years i have been writing and speaking about the danger of the rise of an honest and charismatic ideologue in the united states , someone who could exploit the fear and anger that has long been boiling in much of the society , and who could direct it away from the actual agents of malaise to vulnerable targets that could indeed lead to what sociologist bertram gross called friendly fascism in a perceptive study 35 years ago but that requires an honest ideologue , a hitler type , not someone whose only detectable ideology is me the dangers however have been real for many years , perhaps even more so in the light of the forces that trump has unleashed with the republicans in the white house , but also controlling both houses and the future shape of the supreme court , what will america look like for at least the next four years \? a good deal depends on his appointments and circle of advisers early indications are unattractive , to put it mildly the supreme court will be in the hands of reactionaries for many years , with predictable consequences if trump follows through on his paul ryan style fiscal programs , there will be huge benefits for the very rich estimated by the tax policy center as a tax cut of over 14 for the top 0 1 and a substantial cut more generally at the upper end of the income scale , but with virtually no tax relief for others , who will also face major new burdens the respected economics correspondent of the financial times , martin wolf , writes that the tax proposals would shower huge benefits on already rich americans such as mr trump , while leaving others in the lurch , including of course his popular constituency the immediate reaction of the business world reveals that big pharma , wall street , military industry , energy industries , and other such wonderful institutions expect a very bright future one positive development might be the infrastructure program that trump has promised while \( along with much reporting and commentary \) concealing the fact that it is essentially the obama stimulus program that would have been of great benefit to the economy and to the society generally , but was killed by the republican congress on the pretext that it would explode the deficit while that charge was spurious at the time , given the very low interest rates , it holds in spades for trumps program , now accompanied by radical tax cuts for the rich and corporate sector and increased pentagon spending there is , however , an escape , provided by dick cheney when he explained to bushs treasury secretary paul oneill that reagan proved that deficits dont matter meaning deficits that we republicans create in order to gain popular support , leaving it to someone else , preferably democrats , to somehow clean up the mess the technique might work , for a while at least there are also many questions about foreign policy consequences , mostly unanswered there is mutual admiration between trump and putin how likely is it therefore that we may see a new era in us russia relations \? one hopeful prospect is that there might be reduction of the very dangerous and mounting tensions at the russian border note the russian border , not the mexican border thereby lies a tale that we cannot go into here it is also possible that europe might distance itself from trumps america , as already suggested by chancellor merkel and other european leaders and from the british voice of american power , after brexit that might possibly lead to european efforts to defuse the tensions , and perhaps even efforts to move towards something like mikhail gorbachevs vision of an integrated eurasian security system without military alliances , rejected by the us in favor of nato expansion , a vision revived recently by putin , whether seriously or not we do not know since the gesture was dismissed is us foreign policy under a trump administration likely to be more or less militaristic than what we have seen under the obama or even the g w bush administrations \? i dont think one can answer with any confidence trump is too unpredictable there are too many open questions what we can say is that popular mobilization and activism , properly organized and conducted , can make a large difference and we should bear in mind that the stakes are very large , as i remarked at the outset
region southeast asia two years remain until the parliamentary elections in cambodia this is a really rather short period considering that the position of the current political regime of the cambodian peoples party \( cpp \) remains in doubt despite the partys success at the municipal elections in 2015 , there is no confidence that it may win and retain power at the parliamentary elections the cpp is overloaded with a host of problems primarily , everyone is talking about corruption in the party , its nepotism , detachment from the people , who analysts state have long tired of seeing one and the same governing figures at the top of cambodias political hierarchy there is even the feeling that the leadership of the party wont plan to renew its policy and introduce new leaders even if it recognizes its problems in january 2015 , at an emergency session of the cpp , it was noted that the corruption , nepotism , abuse of powers , violation of the laws spread among the partys members had undermined the confidence of the people and raised doubts about its right to rule the country the introduction of reforms inside the party and society was named as a life and death issue for the cpps future at the session however , almost two years have passed since the session and the party has not even started to solve its acute problems there are no new young and attractive leaders in its leadership , yet the provincial level has rather competent and authoritative governors of provinces cpp members that might change the image of the ruling party if they became members of its leadership despite the fact that the number of members of the central committee has doubled , it is still dominated by the same veterans of the peoples revolutionary party who together with hun sen and supported by vietnam and the soviet union built the peoples republic of kampuchea \( 1979 1991 \) over this period , they went from being comrade to mr and became even more detached from real life the style of the political leadership was supposed to be corrected , and the session would promote steps aimed at a symbolic detachment from the personal leadership of hun sen these expectations were not met soon after the session , he took up the position of cpp chairman and consolidated both administrative and party powers into his own hands the relations of the authorities and the opposition have been developing in a complicated and ambiguous way at first , the cambodia national rescue party \( cnrp \) headed by openly pro western and anti vietnam policy maker sam rainsy , which obtained only 12 seats fewer than the ruling party at the elections in 2013 , boycotted the national parliament in protest against the alleged falsification of the figures and violations that prevented their victory then , pro western nationalists agreed with hun sen to return to the parliament and started active work aimed at spreading their influence in the rural areas by opening its branches in the traditional cpp territories and carrying out protests in their interest this activity led by the opposition clearly frightened the ruling regime and sam rainsy emigrated while the other leader kim socha and his supporters were brought to justice for the organization of illegal anti governmental protests at the same time , cambodias leader initiated propaganda attacks on the opposition leaders , organised protests demanding the resignation of its representatives from public offices a number of opposition members were even beaten , which was followed by the initiation of criminal cases against them the situation became so serious that the deputies of the european parliament threatened the authorities of cambodia with suspending the provision of economic assistance this is a serious warning for hun sen , as the european union is one of the leading donors to cambodias economy as for the tactics of the opposition , it is now refraining from mass protest campaigns in order not to give the authorities reason to expand repressions at the same time , using non commercial organisations related to it and gaining western subsidies , the opposition is generating the conviction in society that the ruling regime is against the people , and its leaders should be judged and their property should be confiscated it also proposes a social and economic program that presupposes an increase in the minimum wage and retirement benefits , and a reduction in fuel and electricity prices though the program is purely populist and unreal , it is attracting people who have started to perceive the cnrp as a political force able to change the situation in the country while assessing the situation in cambodia and its prospects , it becomes clear that the peoples party has no clear pre election strategy and it is not mobilizing party members for successful elections the elaboration and presentation of a pre election strategy might influence those who have doubts about their preferences and those who have not decided how to vote in 2018 in september , i had a chance to talk with the delegation from cambodia at the eastern economic forum in vladivostok i was interested in the mood in the peoples party in the run up to the elections one of the high ranking members of the delegation answered , we are very scared , which just confirmed that our conclusions were correct dmitry mosyakov , professor , doctor of historical sciences , director of the centre for southeast asia , australia and oceania and the institute of oriental studies of the russian academy of sciences , exclusively for the online magazine new eastern outlook
by the biggest story on indian television yesterday wasnt the election of donald trump for on tuesday night \( ist \) , indian prime minister narendra modi in a surprise speech declared that currency notes of rupees \( rs \) 500 and rs 1000 the highest two denominations in circulation would be invalid as of midnight that same night the withdrawn notes could no longer be used for transacting business or as a store of value for future usage \( with some limited exceptions , but even these were only allowed for a short transition period \) from modis speech there is a need for a decisive war against the menace of corruption , black money and terrorism corruption , black money and terrorism are festering wounds which make the country hollow from within , he said , adding such activities hold back the nations progress describing illegal financial activities as the biggest blot , modi said that despite several steps taken by his government over the last two and a half years , indias global ranking on corruption had moved only to 76th position from 100th earlier this shows the extent of the web of corruption in the country the disease of corruption is the domain of some veted people who are flourishing some people have misused their positions and benefitted on the other hand , honest people are suffering , he said the reserve bank of india \( rbi \) the indian central bank as reported by the times of india , elaborated the incidence of fake indian currency notes in higher denomination has increased for ordinary persons , the fake notes look similar to genuine notes , even though no security feature has been copied the fake notes are used for antinational and illegal activities high denomination notes have been misused by terrorists and for hoarding black money india remains a cash based economy hence the circulation of fake indian currency notes continues to be a menace in order to contain the rising incidence of fake notes and black money , the scheme to withdraw has been introduced chaos ensues india remains a cash based economy , especially for low value transactions , and the move has caused widespread chaos , as i write this from kolkata where i am currently visiting the move was accompanied by a temporary shut down of all banks and atms , with banks reopening earlier today and atms due to reopen tomorrow initially , after the announcement , the highest denomination legal tender note in circulation was the rs 100 note new legally tender rs 500 and rs 2000 notes have been made available today , according to tushar roy , chief manager of a nationalized bank , central bank of india not all banks have yet received the new notes , but roy says that this problem is expected to be resolved soon the government also expects to re introduce rs 1000 notes soon , to include advanced security features when atms open tomorrow , withdrawals will be limited to a maximum of rs 2000 per transaction , as compared to the rs 10 , 000 and in some cases , rs 15 , 000 limits , that previously applied starting today , after producing appropriate identification , people are allowed to exchange old notes for new at any of the 19 rbi offices , any bank branch , or at any head post office or sub post office they will have until december 30 to complete their transactions individuals receive full value for the entire volume of bank notes tendered at any of these venues , but heres the kicker at the moment , each person is limited to receiving only rs 4000 per person in cash irrespective of the size of tender anything over and above that amount can only be credited to a bank account this allows the government to track whether the sums tendered have been legitimately acquired withdrawals from bank accounts will be limited to rs 10 , 000 a day and rs 20 , 000 a week the government has announced this part of the policy may be relaxed in future , says roy , in order for employers , for example , to meet payrolls currently made in cash \( ultimately the government wants more transactions to be paid via bank accounts , so that they can be tracked and taxed appropriately \) does the policy make sense \? its beyond the scope of this post to speculate on the impact the new policy will have on individuals of various occupations and with myriad reasons for transacting in large amounts of cash for more on this point , interested readers might wish to look at this article in the wire some have criticized the policy for focusing on currency alone , and have noted that black money is typically not held by indians in stacks of rs 500 and rs 1000 notes , but in one of two alternative ways the very rich store black assets in offshore accounts \( as detailed in , among other sources , the panama papers \) but tax evasion and corruption is not limited to the very richest alone in india , many doctors and other professionals , members of the business community , and small traders also underreport their taxable income they tend to hold their black assets on shore , within india , in the form of real estate , art work , gold bullion , jewellery , or securities unlike other current policy areas border incursions into pakistan , for example the political opposition has has not contested the objective of the modi move there is virtually unanimous concurrence at least publicly on cracking down on black money yet as the hindu reported , former finance minister palaniappan chidambaram has criticized the modi governments method for achieving its objective we support the objective of the government to stamp out black money but the method they have adopted raises questions the move has come as a bolt from the blue for the common man the real test for the government would begin thursday , mr chidambaram said how efficiently and how quickly the money is exchanged if there is harassment or inconvenience and all kinds of questions are asked , then i think that will be completely counterproductive a similar move had been contemplated by the previous congress led upa government , he recalled but the idea was dropped as the economic gains were not too great mr chidambaram said the introduction of the new series of notes was estimated to cost rs 15 , 000 crores to rs 20 , 000 crores jerri lynn here a crore is 10 , 000 , 000 in the indian numbering system the economic gains of demonetisation should be at least equal to that amount if the additional tax revenue pulled in by the modi move is less than that amount , the new policy will actually have ended up costing the government money rather than increasing government revenues as chidambaram summarized \( again from the hindu article quoted above \) the economic wisdom of the governments decision , mr chidambaram said , would be tested on three parameters a \) the present cash to gdp ratio is 12 per cent will it come down to the world average of about 4 per cent \? b \) the value of the high denomination notes currently in circulation is about 15 lakh crore rupees jerri lynn here a lakh is 100 , 000 , a crore , 10 , 000 , 000 , so a lakh crore is 1 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 will that value come down significantly \? c \) will gold imports surge , indicating that unaccounted income wealth is seeking refuge in bullion and gold jewellery \? various economists have also presented other criticisms of the governments move , as reported by the wire requiring a switch to new bank notes means indians must take time to switch their existing rs 500 and rs 1000 notes into the new bank notes if new notes are not freely and widely available , this will freeze trade and the normal functioning of an exchange economy further , many indians receive salaries in cash and do not have bank accounts at present , so requiring transactions to pass through the banking system will cause them considerable immediate inconvenience impact on economic activity but there is a wider reason for critiquing the policy black money and not paying taxes these are bad things in a society , says suvojit bagchi , kolkata bureau chief for the hindu not surprisingly , everyone including the opposition agrees on the objective of cracking down on black money increasing the tax base is the prime objective here but will the demonetization policy produce substantial tax revenue \? bagchi noted that chidambaram questioned whether taxes raised would be sufficient to recoup the cost of printing new bank notes another objective , bagchi added , is to move india away from its reliance on cash , toward a more american or european plastic system , where its easier to track and tax money and finally , at least half of indian economic activity occurs in the informal sector , which is not tightly controlled bagchi gave the example of a building promoter , whose building activity produces both black and white revenues indeed , perhaps 40 of the promoters overall activity , he estimated , might be black activity but that black activity also generates employment , as well as other knock on effects while the government hopes that its policy will increase the tax base , its also possible that demonetization might instead lead to the shut down of at least some black activity so , the governments latest move may actually slow economic activity considerably , bagchi says , but for how long , and to what extent , no one knows he further added , at the moment , the indian economy is somewhat insulated from the world economy , in part due to its reliance on cash and the existence of considerable black activity once india moves to a plastic system , and cuts back on that black activity , it will lose some of this insulation as reported in the wire , abhijit sen , former member of the planning commission , is also concerned about contraction in the informal sector the sudden decision to demonetise currency notes of rs 500 and rs 1 , 000 is targeted to reduce illicit stocks of black money and fake currency this has a clear rationale if such notes are used mainly to stock undisclosed wealth , rather than for transactions however , rbi data show that currency notes of these two denominations make up over 80 of the total currency in circulation therefore , unless a very large proportion of money in circulation lies permanently as stocks , the demonetisation can also be expected to have a significant immediate effect on that part of the economy which relies mainly on cash transactions the size of indias cash economy is not exactly known but , given the large proportion of workers in informal sectors , it is unlikely to be less than half the total economy we can , therefore , expect an immediate contraction of this part of the economy in the next two days and with the effect stretching over a longer period of time , although diminishing over time whatever its long term positive effects , those depending on cash whether for daily wages or as payments for goods or services they sell are likely to be in for tough times in the coming days in the long term as well , all that this does is partially eliminate some black money stocks without undoing the processes that lead to black money creation
by by silvia merler , an affiliate fellow at bruegel who formerly worked as economic analyst in dg economic and financial affairs of the european commission originally published at bruegel tim duy s fed watch says that , as expected , the federal reserve left policy unchanged this month and the statement itself was largely unchanged as well the near term inflation outlook improved from september to november , and with the year over year impacts of oil prices falling out of the data , headline inflation will track back upwards , which is not a big surprise with regards to the timing of the next move , duy argues that the language suggests conditions are moving in the right direction , but the fed is still waiting for some further evidence a continuation of recent trends will likely be sufficient as the further evidence needed to justify a rate hike in december would a trump victory derail a hike in december \? duy does not think this is likely at this juncture , and we should rather be focusing on the labour market a slowdown in hiring to something closer to 100k a month would probably end the downward pressure on the unemployment rate and raise questions about the feds basic forecast that the unemployment rate will continue to decline in the absence of additional rate hikes we get two employment reports before the december meeting for the fed to stay on the sidelines yet again , we probably need to see both reports come in weak the bottom line is that the fed is looking past the election to the december meeting for its second move in this rate hike cycle and probably it would take some unlikely softer numbers to hold them back again greg ip , on the other hand , writes in the wall street journal that tuesdays election matters typically , the fed is guided by the economic data and elections are just transitory nuisances with little significance for the outlook but this is no typical election , as one of the candidates represents a dramatic break with economic orthodoxy with promises of protectionism and tax cuts but few details trumps election would dramatically raise uncertainty , which is the reason why the stock market has tended to go down when his odds of winning go up for the fed , lower stock prices translate into less wealth , which is negative for the outlook in its own right additionally , the fed will assume that uncertainty in the rest of the economy will mirror what happens in the markets all of this reduces the odds it would actually raise interest rates in december ip argues that the fed can take politics into consideration without being motivated by politics when political decisions can potentially change the course of the economy , the fed has to incorporate that into its decisions thus , a trump victory would probably cast enough of a pall over the outlook to give the fed reason to delay its next rate increase into next year ironically , mr trump may discover that he , not mr obama , is the reason the fed hasnt tightened richard clarida , commenting the fomc statement over at pimcos blog , says that there was little expectation that the fed would announce a hike in november the committee members said nothing in their public remarks since the september meeting to suggest that a rate hike was under serious consideration this week indeed , the odds of a november hike as priced by the fed funds futures market were only 16 , and for at least the past 20 years the fed has never moved when the market has priced less than a 50 chance of a move as for the balance of risks , the language remained in the statement after making its first appearance this year in the september fed statement this is relevant because it would be difficult for the fed to justify a hike if it believed that risks were tilted to the downside , or if the outlook were so uncertain it could not even characterise the risks clarida does not think that the fed is trying to signal that the odds for a december hike have diminished a year ago , the fed wanted to boost market odds of a hike when it thought those odds were too low going into today with those odds at 70 the fed appeared to be content to make minimal changes to the statement only six days before the us election whereas in september 2016 three fomc members dissented , at this months meeting dissenters were only two so this fed statement seems aimed at making as few waves as possible it is a placeholder until the fed next meets and a rate hike in december continues to be likely , if not a done deal natixis philippe waechter argues that the fed is ready for december , under the assumption that clinton wins the election he argues that the language on inflation is the only noticeable change in the language of this statement as compared to the previous one together with the remarks on consumption that appears less strong than in september the fed wants to recover room for manoeuver in its monetary policy and this is the reason why it is by now ready to accept an increase in the rates nevertheless , it is also acting in a context where it needs to signal that it remains vigilant in an asymmetric approach to monetary policy , the fed prefers to act too late \( at the risk of inflation \) than too early \( at the risk of a slowdown in economic activity \) tiffany wilding , again on pimcos blog , looks at one indicator on which feds officials have recently trained a lens the labour force participation rate the participation rate has risen 0 5 percentage point over the past year , and the rise has occurred despite demographic and other secular trends implying that it should have declined about 0 3 ppt during the news conference following the federal reserves september meeting , chair yellen highlighted this development as a reason to believe there is more slack in the labour market than previously thought wilding argues that the rise is not primarily the result of previously discouraged workers reentering the labour force , but stems largely from a decline in the number of long term unemployed individuals \( 25 to 54 year olds \) dropping out notably , the decline comes on the heels of a very elevated pace of dropouts in 2014 and 2015 , suggesting only limited scope for additional improvement on the surface , its a good sign that people are now looking for a job longer however , the cps data suggest the number of marginally attached and underemployed individuals as a percentage of the working age population hasnt declined significantly since the participation rate started to increase last year taken together , these developments could indicate declining and more limited labor market slack with respect to the participation rate , wilding believes that the demographic and other secular forces which have driven trend declines in the participation rate will likely take over again she views participation rate trends as a downside risk to the case for two to three hikes in the federal funds rate by the end of 2017 meanwhile , kenneth rogoff says markets nowadays are fixated on how high the federal reserve will raise interest rates in the next 12 months this is dangerously shortsighted the real concern ought to be how far it could cut rates in the next deep recession given that the fed may struggle just to get its base interest rate up to 2 over the coming year , there will be very little room to cut if a recession hits the two best ideas for dealing with the zero bound \( negative rates and higher inflation target \) are off limits for the moment of course , there is always fiscal policy to provide economic stimulus but it is extremely undesirable for government spending to have to be as volatile as it would be if it had to cover for the ineffectiveness of monetary policy there may not be enough time before the next deep recession to lay the groundwork for effective negative interest rate policy or to phase in a higher inflation target but that is no excuse for not starting to look hard at these options , especially if the alternatives are likely to be far more problematic the economists free exchange argues that not every argument for keeping interest rates low is a good one central bankers may be too keen to spot inflation in the data , but if monetary policy operates with a lag , it makes sense to raise rates before you hit the target , to prevent overshoot when doves reject this logic , they are implicitly criticising the feds 2 inflation target , not its strategy for achieving its goal inflation targets do not call for making up for past mistakes , and central banks should try to do what they say they are trying to do this also means that in an equal and opposite situation where the fed must bring inflation down after an upward shock , it should loosen policy while inflation still exceeds 2 it is easy to dismiss these points as academic , given that inflation has been below target for too long at present , the biggest threat to central bank credibility is clearly on the downside but when doves deny the logic of changing policy in advance of achieving the inflation target , they overreach the data show plenty to be dovish about doves should simply point that out and , if they want a price level target , say as much 0 0 0 0 0 0

corrente days until 3 comment on polling election calls have never seemed very interesting to me were it my place to make them in the same way that predicting when a flood will crest is a lot less interesting than understanding \( and perhaps managing \) a watershed that doesnt mean predictions are not fun ! madison asked in the federalist 51 but what is government itself , but the greatest of all reflections on human nature \? by the same token what is the horse race , but the greatest of all the performing arts \? that said , putting past water coolers into the call frame , the method i used didnt yield bad results rather than tracking the very noisy individual polls , i decided to use the realclearpolitics polling averages every monday once a week , for sanitys sake and plug those averages into a reasonable list of swing states provided by the new york times , whose interactive tool then enabled me to game out scenarios in the electoral college in all the weeks i did this but one , trump had a plausible path to victory , depending on reasonable scenarios in individual states in other words , still in the call frame , i beat most of the paid pollsters in the political class who were , er , trumpeting clintons victory and as we saw in yesterdays water cooler , i tied the trump teams internal polling they thought they were going to lose , though they qualified their views by pointing out the same plausible paths to victory that i did why did i not get the scale of trumps victory \? i mean , in 2008 and 2012 , and maybe farther back , the republican candiate always made a show of putting pennsylvania in play , and it never came to anything trump won it ! along with michigan and wisconsin \( where sanders , interestingly , defeated clinton as well \) it is clear to any objective observer that the affordable care act \( aca \) , which has resulted in rapidly rising premiums and deductibles , narrow networks , and health insurance , has not been a success a trump administration will work with congress to repeal the aca and replace it with a solution that includes health savings accounts \( hsas \) , and returns the historic role in regulating health insurance to the states the administrations goal will be to create a patient centered healthcare system that promotes choice , quality and affordability with health insurance and healthcare , and take any needed action to alleviate the burdens imposed on american families and businesses by the law president elect let us know how that works out and to maximize choice and create a dynamic market for health insurance , the administration will work with congress to enable people to purchase insurance across state lines the administration also will work with both congress and the states to re establish high risk pools a proven approach to ensuring access to health insurance coverage for individuals who have significant medical expenses and who have not maintained continuous coverage and modernize medicare , so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the baby boom generation and beyond maximize flexibility for states in administering medicaid , to enable states to experiment with innovative methods to deliver healthcare to our low income citizens hmm donald trump has said he wants to repeal obamacare , and we hope that wasnt an empty campaign promise , said twila brase , president and co founder of cchf it will take more than a promise to make american health care great again and to restore health care freedom to patients and doctors republicans need to advance visionary ideas for health care , ideas that are bigger than buying across state lines ideas that put patients and doctors back together again without the costly interference and intrusions of profiteering outsiders the high cost of health care comes primarily from the middlemen , including managed care and government' citizens council for health freedom cchf is a good conservative site on health care policy i dont agree with them on policy , but cchf is relentless and above all they dont make stuff up obamacare replacement might look familiar kaiser health news could be obamacare was , after all , originally a republican plan , so it should be possible to rebrand it it gets into a questions of semantics , said mark rouck , an insurance analyst for fitch ratings are they really repealing the act if they replace it with new legislation that has some of the same characteristics \? topping the list of aca provisions likely to survive under trump is the requirement that employers cover workers children up to the age of 26 , analysts said the measure is widely popular and not especially expensive a health law crafted by republicans might also retain the acas protections for people with preexisting illness seeking coverage , said glenn melnick , a health economist at the university of southern california the acas biggest coverage expansion came through the medicaid program for the poor and disabled , which added more than 15 million people trump has suggested giving states fixed federal grants for medicaid , which could lead to a substantial reduction in coverage or benefits then donald trump was elected president , and now the tables may have turned again trump has on several occasions expressed his opposition to net neutrality , once calling it another top down power grab marketwatch whos advising president elect trump on heatlh care \?

by 10 00 am the voter suppression tactic is right out of the gop election rigging playbook to suppress the black vote in north carolina the following is an opinion column by r muse some americans are likely aware of the psychological term projecting that roughly means a person attributes their own faults and actions onto someone else as an unconscious form of transferring guilt for ones own actions as soon as the republican primaries concluded , donald trump projected republicans guilt for election rigging , either through vote obstruction or suppression , onto democrats and his opponent hillary clinton republicans have been actively suppressing votes since the election of barack obama in 2008 , and they have only ramped up their election rigging activities over the past eight years and yet trump accuses democrats of election rigging as frequently as most human beings draw breath yesterday , the north carolina conference of the national association for the advancement of colored people \( naacp \) filed a lawsuit against north carolina republicans and demanded they put an immediate stop to the coordinated effort to suppress the black vote in the state what the naacp rightly said was that the voter suppression tactic was right out of the gop election rigging playbook to suppress the black vote in the state the election rigging amounts to three counties in north carolina canceling voter registration of thousands of , mostly african american , democratic residents a week before the presidential election the lawsuit charged election officials in beaufort , moore , and cumberland counties of denying primarily african american voters eligibility to participate in democracy because their voter registration documents mysteriously were bounced back as undeliverable most of the voters whose eligibility to vote was denied and flagged for purging , such as james edward arthur sr had moved within the same county and were still legally allowed to cast ballots many of the purged voters lived at their original registration address and were victims of a simple postal service error mr arthur is an african american who lives in a nursing home and has voted in at least the last 14 elections in the same county he was born and raised in without issue arthur testified that he , like thousands of other african american democratic voters , never received any state or county election documents informing him that his eligibility was denied , or that if he didnt attend an appeal hearing to maintain his right to vote he would be denied the right to participate in democracy mr arthur said , if i knew my right to vote was in jeopardy , i would do whatever i could to protect it i want and plan to vote in the upcoming election , but i am concerned that since my registration has been canceled i will not be able to cast a ballot or it will not be counted it is what any sane human being would consider election rigging simply because the tri county ploy targeted primarily african americans who typically vote for democrats it is also something north carolina republicans have been guilty of for the past six years according to the naacp lawsuit , north carolina republicans are in violation of the national voter registration act which bans the systemic removal of voters from the rolls in the final 90 days before an election republican election officials state officials defended their election rigging and said they were justified in purging tens of thousands of mainly african american democratic voters eligibility , the definition of systemic , on an individual basis however , the naacp also accused republicans of conducting a coordinated mailing campaign for the sole purpose of challenging the eligibility of thousands of mainly african american voters eligibility who did not receive the mailing one republican who ran for a local office last year , shane hubers , challenged the registration of voters , the majority who are them democrats , in beaufort county in one of the other counties charged in the lawsuit , cumberland county , one individual used returned mail to challenge the registrations of 3 , 951 mostly democratic voters in moore county , the secretary of the local republican party , n carol wheeldon , challenged approximately 400 mainly african american registered voters likely because they do not vote for republicans the lead attorney for the naacps lawsuit , penda hair , said that although she cannot yet prove there is a concerted republican election rigging conspiracy we know that in two of the counties , the people who brought the challenges had connections to the local republican party we also know that the pattern of these challenges is very similar across the counties ms hair also noted that , in moore county the return address of a right wing group called the voter integrity project appeared on the mail that was used to challenge voters this is a very pernicious treatment of voters , she said it is also a deliberate act of election rigging by republicans the president of the north carolina naacp , reverend dr william barber said , we are seeing the worst attempts of voter suppression here in north carolina that weve seen since the days of jim crow the tar heel state is ground zero in the intentional , surgical efforts to suppress the voice of voters these attempts are a direct affront to our constitution the naacp lawsuit is demanding the state reinstate all voters challenged since 2012 using this election rigging process back on the rolls immediately the organization also demands that the state notifies the voters that they have been reinstated as eligible voters , and allow them to cast regular ballots early or on election day they have already put in a request for an emergency hearing this week to decide the case it might be the case that the naacps request for a hearing may be granted especially in light of these new charges arising just days after a federal court ruled that north carolina republicans violated the national voter registration act in yet another manner failing to add tens of thousands of voters to the rolls who registered at a dmv office over the past few years last thursday u s district court judge loretta biggs ordered north carolina republicans to permit those tens of thousands of voters to cast provisional ballots it is highly doubtful that north carolina republicans will obey the federal judges orders because they have been the recipients of several court orders over their election rigging actions that have had no effect whatsoever or the republicans would not continue disenfranchising voters republicans have been on a tear to rig elections since the american people first elected barack obama as president , and the conservatives on the supreme court are ultimately guilty of conspiring with republicans to suppress , or obstruct , the voting rights of primarily people of color because they dont support republicans to be perfectly clear , it is irrelevant if it is called voter suppression , obstruction , or disenfranchisement it is a deliberate attempt to rig elections and it is only republicans and the koch brothers outfit the american legislative exchange council \( alec \) , who are behind each and every attempt in republican controlled states to kill democracy by doing what the republican party standard bearer donald trump is guilty of projecting rig elections
by 7 57 pm if the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half , i think its going to be just catastroph ic the following is an opinion column by r muse it may be the understatement of the year to say the republican party is on the verge of a full on civil war , and it may be obvious to many americans that the blame for the inter party discord is its standard bearer donald j trump however much trumps candidacy has contributed to the tensions between establishment types terrified of trumps reckless disregard for the longevity of the party and rebellion minded trump supporters , the real instigators are the koch brothers although the oil magnates were never on the trump bandwagon , they are responsible for the trump loyalists within the gop who were part of the teabagger movement intent on disrupting the nations political system and indeed , the workings of government itself the tea party caucus , an extremist sect that succeeded in chasing former house speaker john a boehner out of congress , morphed into the inaptly named freedom caucus that has embraced trump are set to set fire to the party establishment and it isnt solely to put current speaker paul ryan out of a job , although that is high on the trump supporters to do list as noted in wednesdays new york times , mr trumps supporters said they were determined to harness the anti establishment energy that mr trump had catalyzed and to refocus it on the republican leadership in congress a target many of them seem eager to take down the right wing extremist that actually took down former house majority leader eric cantor , conservative extremist and house freedom caucus member david brat , issued a warning to establishment republicans theres a huge chunk of people who want to see a fight taken to d c leadership comes and smacks our guy \? thats where youre going to put down a marker \? really \? and the american people are just scratching their head saying , really \? thats rich brat has been a thorn in the establishments side since paul ryan became speaker and he joins a dangerous number of real conservatives who cannot understand or comport with ryan and establishment leaders who dared criticize trump instead of using their majority advantage to go after hillary clinton donald trump and a few of his senior aides are prodding extremist conservatives to revolt against the establishment leadership after the election for not defending trump in fact , besides assailing ryan for not sticking by trump , it is reported that trump said privately that ryan should be made to pay a heavy price for disloyalty to the trump candidacy and , during an interview with reuters he complained that the people are very angry with the leadership of this party , because this is an election that we will win , 100 percent , if we had support from the top win or lose , there is going to be a major blood letting after the election and the establishment , although powerful , may face a herculean task to save the party this impending conflict within the gop has been brewing longer than donald trump has been a candidate and it may be why he brought on an experienced anti establishment devotee to run his campaign the chairman of breitbart news , stephen bannon , had made it one of his primary goals to get paul ryan out as house speaker because he is not a true conservative intent on tearing government down to restructure it into an uber conservative paradise and uber conservative is just a different way of saying a non government according to the koch brothers vision of american libertarianism dont believe it \? two groups closely aligned with the koch brothers , heritage action for america and freedomworks , have been pushing republicans as a party to adopt more extremist positions and see the civil war as a stellar opportunity to have greater influence over the partys decisions something establishment types are resisting over the past few days , leaders of both koch groups joined extremist conservatives in calling to delay a vote on selecting a candidate to be the next , or new , speaker of the house something typically occurring directly after the general election in november regardless the outcome according to the chief executive of heritage action , michael needham , there is going to be hell to pay for establishment republicans if they dont bend to the will of the extremist wing created by the kochs and heavily courted by donald trump mr needham said , if the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half , i think its going to be just catastrophe another conservative extremist , house freedom caucus member and ardent donald trump supporter echoed needhams sentiment and said , you cant ignore what millions and millions of people have expressed in this election cycle the dilemma for republicans after the election , no matter the outcome , is maintaining a semblance of stability as a political party that doesnt seem likely because if trump loses , big or small , the extremists will unleash whatever level of hell they can muster on the establishment for daring to criticize any of trumps more outrageous and dangerous comments on the stump if trump wins , the extremists will be emboldened to purge the party of any disloyal establishment types and it appears that no matter what happens on november 8 , it will not be the end of hostilities among republicans the republican party establishment is in for a reckoning with an extremist wing that was once content threatening the full faith and credit of the united states or shutting down the government as a show of anger after four years of internal bickering over what it means to be a true conservative , and the past year and a half of incitement by donald trump , the republican party faces a serious threat to its long term survival it is a threat that began about six years ago when the koch brothers ushered in an age of extremist conservatives that donald trump took advantage of to seize control of the republican party
prominent opposition figure and anti corruption campaigner alexei navalny has announced he plans to run for the presidency , with criminal charges against him suspended however , russias experts are divided in their assessments of his chances in the 2018 presidential elections prominent opposition figure and anti corruption campaigner alexei navalny has announced he plans to run for the presidency , with criminal charges against him suspended however , russias experts are divided in their assessments of his chances in the 2018 presidential elections russian opposition activist alexei navalny during an interview to the associated press in moscow photo ap last week russias supreme court suspended the criminal charges against russias well known opposition activist and anti corruption campaigner alexei navalny , who was accused of embezzlement of assets belonging to the state run timber company kirovles the decision came after the european court of human rights reviewed and endorsed navalnys complaint about the trial , which the defendant found unfair and politically motivated the russian authorities are to reassess their decision in light of the february ruling , which called for navalny to be fully acquitted and for russia to pay 8 , 000 each to him and his co defendant pyotr ofitserov plus legal costs also read khodorkovsky drums up support in europe for an alternative to putin all this means that the criminal charges against navalny are at least suspended , if not canceled the accused is rehabilitated and has chances to stand for russias presidency in 2018 navalny confirmed his presidential bid last week and has left his intention to run as an alternative candidate in no doubt russian oligarch and opposition activist mikhail khodorkovsky , who now lives in london , has approved navalnys candidacy meanwhile , the kremlin is reticent about the anti corruption campaigners intentions to run for the presidency this question is not on our agenda now , said kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov the presidential elections will take place in 2018 too early for forecasts meanwhile , experts argue that it is too early to talk about the 2018 presidential elections and the chances of their candidates for example , democratic activist and politician leonid gozman believes that navalny has enough political heft , but the fact that he is associated with the opposition will hinder his chances alexei navalny is a celebrity , he said he is a well known figure with an interesting history , which has its own flaws and advantages gozman argues that t he opposition candidates major disadvantage is an unfavorable political environment within the country and people 's distrust of opposition , with him fighting against those at the helm however , navalny might be able to turn this disadvantage into an advantage and earn political credentials not only inside , but also outside russia according to gozman , navalnys anti corruption political platform is a valuable and very meaningful asset , which he will be able to use in his favor likewise , mikhail vinogradov , the chairman of the petersburg politics foundation , argues that navalny has enough political heft and can be compared with russian president vladimir putin to a certain extent navalny is the no 2 politician in russias public politics , he told russia direct thats why hes more effective and interesting than the leaders of the parliamentary parties , which have been competing with each other for so long he has well developed political instincts in addition , he has much better chances in the elections than those retirees who head the parliamentary parties from the point of view of populist potential , putin and navalny are comparably equal vinogradov is sure that navalny is capable of recruiting a large number of supporters in a short period of time , as indicated by the results of the 2013 moscow mayoral elections , when he won more than 27 percent of the vote however , at that time he focused primarily on the protest electorate today , there are a lot of people who are not satisfied with the current situation in the country and navalny is capable of winning their votes as well as the votes of those who support the authorities , vinogradov speculates however , it remains to be seen if the opposition activist will be able to use his tactics to help win nationwide support this is one of the major intrigues , said vinogradov a dose of legitimacy for russias elections at the same time , gozman argues that the participation of navalny in the presidential elections will make them more interesting and less artificial his bid is useful for the elections themselves , he said this means that a campaign with navalny will look more real than one without him also read hawks vs doves who will dominate in the kremlin before the 2018 elections \? gozman gives an example of the 2013 mayoral campaign , which he sees as more natural because navalny challenged sergei sobyanin and encouraged him to change his tactics in contrast , alexei mukhin , the general director of the center for political information , a moscow based think tank , argues that the participation of navalny will be a bigger disadvantage for regional campaigns rather than an advantage according to him , the opposition figure will bring instability and disorder , while pursuing a sole goal self promotion navalny is a professional troublemaker , he told russia direct he is likely to look for a trade off with the authorities for example , he will withdraw his bid if the kremlin offers him some political privileges it is a matter of a pure political calculation he is not a populist he is a political strategist , mukhin added he is a sort of dealer within politics and he can use skills to earn political points moreover , a refusal to register navalny as a presidential candidate will be a big asset for him , because it will give him a reason to claim that the authorities are afraid of him it may strengthen his political heft populist or not \? unlike mukhin , gozman sees navalny as a potential populist in the upcoming presidential campaign however , it is too early to talk about specific positions or a platform he is going to stick since it is unclear what kind of environment the 2018 elections will be held in a populist is easy to recognize only in a specific environment , he said most importantly , it is necessary to know what position his opponents will take it is a matter of debates youre inclined to take a tougher position in a dispute than under other circumstances , at least because you need to prove your point of view when discussing populism in presidential campaigns , most russian experts give the example of vladimir zhirinovsky , the firebrand leader of russias liberal democratic party \( ldpr \) throughout his political career , he has garnered about 10 percent of the vote for instance , the results of the recent parliamentary elections showed that his party even improved its record in comparison with previous years this indicates that russians are easy to manipulate and they are ready to support a populist candidate however , the populism of zhirinovsky is not taken very seriously recommended inside the anti corruption campaign against russia 's liberals if a new populist like u s president elect donald trump , who would avoid zhirinovskys buffoonish style , emerges in russias political arena , the rest of the politicians , including navalny himself , are likely to take a more moderate position if such a populist doesnt appear , somebody else will fill his shoes , says gozman mukhin doesnt agree he argues that russias political system prevents such populists from coming to power the most obvious example is zhirinovsky himself , who is seen as something of a clown what most pundits agree on is that navalnys odds of winning in the 2018 elections are slim it will be extremely challenging for him to launch a presidential bid and win enough support from voters , partly because putin , who still enjoys high approval rankings and wields political heft , doesnt support his candidacy , according to vinogradov and gozman this is the very logic of russias current political system , in which elections are not a game changer their results are always predictable
chicago cubs first baseman anthony rizzo stepped up to the microphone during the world series rally in grant park and choked up , as he spoke about what it meant to be able to be on a team with the 38 year old catcher david ross , who was a mentor to him rizzo , ross , and center fielder dexter fowler stood shoulder to shoulder singing that silly jingle , the one that goes , go cubs go ! go cubs go ! hey , chicago , whaddya say \? cubs are gonna win today it all really hit home for me as a cubs fan life is full of things that bring us joy but carry unsavory aspects to them the cubs team is owned by tom ricketts , a man who donated 1 million to donald trump and bears a frightening resemblance to ted cruz so much that one might think ricketts was his brother the cubs also signed aroldis chapman , a closer , who served a 30 game suspension this year for domestic abuse cubs executives and city officials are responsible for some pretty rapid gentrification in the area of wrigleyville with that said , almost all of the cubs players had fun with each other and never let the pressures of fan fueled folklore around curses defeat them that made the postseason truly blissful this is where i wrote , thomas g , my fathers name on the wall i had to squeeze it in near the brick sidewalk i live about seven blocks from wrigley field i went down there multiple times in the past week the day after they won , i went down to wrigley field to write my fathers name on the stadium wall and join thousands of other cubs fans in paying tribute to family , who died before they could see the cubs win a world series in the immediate hours after their sweet victory , i took my life into my own hands and went down to the area around clark and addison to snap a photo of the stadium sign with world series champions emblazoned on it on sunday , right before game 5 , down 3 1 in the series , i stood outside the friendly confines and said to myselfand to my father , even though i dont really believe in this kind of stuff , this was going to be the game where they turned it all around that they could still come back also , i bought a copy of the chicago sun times after each game , even the editions with the devastating headlines on game 3 and game 4 , because it was important to have the full story i can now put those papers side by side and forever see the journey the chicago cubs took and relive the heart wrenching and euphoric moments that took place this seismic sports eventending the longest championship drought in american sports historygripped me like so many other americans it taught me , once again , the importance of slowing down life and reveling in these kind of experiences which i know is easy for me to say i did not have a boss , who told me i had to work a night shift or else i would be fired i did not have to worry about what i was going to do to feed my children or prevent my home from being foreclosed i did not have to be concerned about an array of disadvantages people should not have to confront on a daily basis , but all too often we just go , go , go , and lose sight of those little things that can make us feel a bit more content in life or we reject slowing down to appreciate something amazing that magnificently disrupts our routine additionally , during an election that has smothered and shaken many of us , the perfect antidote was watching this team play baseball players like rizzo let their guard down and made themselves vulnerable in front of us they were on a world stage , where they perhaps may have thought they needed to maintain a level of toughness or masculinity rizzo , on the other hand , as he now famously told ross during game 7 , was an emotional wreck , and he did not seem to be ashamed of making that confession many of us were emotional wrecks everyone watching this series felt like emotional wrecks at some point not everyone watched all moments of the games , unless you happened to be in the select group of people that possibly had tickets to all the games ill never forget how ross told rizzo it was only going to get worse in the 9th inning he was right the cleveland indians tied the game in the 8th , acrobatic second baseman javier baez had a mishap with a bunt that could have been costly in the 9th , and fans had to bow their heads and hope chapman would not make a mistake , even though manager joe maddon clearly overworked him the past few games statue outside wrigley field of ernie banks \( photo by \) the weather went from great to pouring rain there was a delay that delay gave the team a kind of gift , a bit of a halftime to find their composure to go out and win in the 10th inning \( it was suggested during the rally that this may have been a gift from legendary shortstop and first baseman , ernie banks , who was mr cub or , legendary third baseman ron santo , who later became a wgn radio broadcaster \) so , rizzo , the emotional wreck , stepped up to the microphone during the rally and gave this very real and human tribute to a mentor , grandpa ross , who played his last game on november 2 gramps and i sat down a few years ago in an offseason before his last season with boston he was a free agent , and we just talked , rizzo shared we had the same agent were talking , and i say to my agent , man , this is what the chicago cubs need he is exactly what we need to bring everything together obviously , a lot of pieces came through with that , but he taught myself personally how to become a real winner hes like a brother to me fighting back tears , rizzo continued , hes taught me a lot in lifeon the field , off the field , how to be a better person im forever grateful for him hes going out a champion forever for the rest of his life , he can say the last game that he played hes a world champion that to me is what has made these past moments special the fact that it took so very long for the team to finally win a baseball championship means all three to four generations were brought together sons and daughters know their parents longed for this , and many of them have parents , who longed to see what happened if those parents are still alive , their parents were ecstatic to have lived to see a cubs world series families shared stories about their first games , games they remembered , games they want to forget , and games they saw with their fathers or mothers they shared stories of players they remembered or recalled when they first put on a cubs baseball hat or wore a jersey with their favorite players name on the back i dug out a photo of me when i was a toddler wearing my cubs shirt i am 28 years old i waited 13 years for this because 2003 was the first postseason , where i really got into watching the cubs play and experienced what it meant to fail to end the drought when they lost to the florida marlins in the national league championship series that is a rather short time span when compared to legions of fans maddon said , its a players game indeed , but for the cubs , its unique cubs baseball was essentially a fans game , much more so than other ball clubs the last two years of decisions by business executives were made for the fans the scouts , who went out and found these all star players , did it for the fans they recognized there were so many aging chicago cubs fans , who kept asking them on the street if they were going to live to see the cubs win a world series theo epstein , one of the executives who enabled this team , did not want to have to tell any more fans to take their vitamins when asked if this would be the year even with 103 wins in the regular season and the status of number one team in baseball , all too many fans were aware of the record for teams , who came in to the postseason on top and did not make it to the world series we also took note of the statistics for comebacks in the world series when teams were down 3 1 so few ever win not only three games in a row but three games in a row , including two on the road that put tremendous pressure on the cubs players they clearly felt it , and we thank them for putting up with millions of emotional wrecks as fans process and revel in the fact that it happened \( as maddon would say , how we did not suck \) , i think about what this means for next year for the first time , it is possible to watch the cubs without bringing a legacy of doubt and negativity to games there are no more goats there is no more steve bartman there are no more distractions that are not typically part of baseball everyones favorite punchlines dont really work anymore they all are part of the past , and the immediate future is baseball with a team that will have some of the players , who won this championship and who will undoubtedly find ways to dazzle us again as they attempt to repeat as champions in 2017 for a coda , chicago cubs fan caitlin swieca pledged a day after chapman signed with the team in july to donate 10 to a chicago domestic violence organization every time he got a save her campaign managed to raise over 31 , 000 , especially when it took off after she shared it on twitter swieca told espn she thought during game 7 , we all compromised what we believed in to root for this guy , and hes gonna blow it then , it shifted to a celebration cubs pitcher mike montgomery got his first career save ever , and it was in game 7 of the world series she was happy chapman did not get the glory and said it couldnt have been scripted better oh , and at the parade , some of us fans looked up to see a plane with a banner that read , chinese americans for trump go cubs i stood next to a filipino american family , who had some chinese heritage in their ancestry she thought it must be a joke then , someone told her it was real they read something about this group of chinese americans instantly , she said she was insulted were not all trump fans because ricketts owns our team only a small segment are , and they are the same kind of white men and women disconnected from reality , who you will find in the fandom of just about every american sports team they would probably support trump whether ricketts was a cubs executive or not illinois governor bruce rauner and chicago mayor rahm emanuel were at the rally , but they are both hot garbage neither took the stage to speak , and i view that as some kind of small political victory that sweetens the victory over a baseball team with a racist colonialist sports mascot , which should be replaced immediately in fact , lets conjure the curse of the racist mascot and say the cubs passed it on to them and thatll prolong their championship drought until they replace chief wahoo maybe then the indians will get rid of him the post appeared

it was rare for poet and singer songwriter leonard cohen to venture into the realm of politics , however , quite a few of his songs , including some of his love songs , were infused with a bleakness that confronted morality and the darkness of humanity he also wrote a song of hope and possibility about the experiment of democracy in the united states that , perhaps , takes on a new kind of resonance in the wake of the election of donald trump cohen was asked in 2014 if songs can offer solutions to political problems he replied , i think the song itself is a kind of solution and so , to pay tribute to a troubadour who died at 82 and whose artistic work only seemed to get better as he aged and his voice grew deeper , here is a retrospective on some of the more philosophical and sociopolitical songs he composed joan of arc \( 1971 \) cohen declared in an interview for rolling stone in 1971 , women are really strong you notice how strong they are \? well , let them take over let us be what were supposed to be gossips , musicians , wrestlers the premise being , there can be no free men unless there are free women he believed it was just for women to gain control of the world with that context , this elegiac narrative takes on greater gravitas it consists of a dialogue between joan of arc and the fire , as she is burnt at the stake the womens movement was flourishing at the time , and cohen saw joan of arc as a symbol of courage yet , he also recognized she may have been lonely because she had to disguise herself as a male soldier , and he imagined what it was like to fight english domination of france and in her final moments face down the fact that she would never return to what could be considered an ordinary life dance me to the end of love \( 1984 \) during a cbc radio interview in 1995 , cohen said the song came from hearing and reading or knowing that in the death camps during the holocaust beside the crematoria the string quartet would be pressed into performance while this horror unfolded cohen sings in the opening , dance me to your beauty with a burning violin dance me through the panic til im gathered safely in lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove the song represents an embrace of passionate acts in the face of atrocities and death if it be your will \( 1984 \) this is a truly grim song in which cohen is probably using the specter of a benevolent oppressor or fascism as a metaphor for the next stage of a relationship and yet , the lyrics are subtle enough that cohen may be addressing morality and how easy it is to convince men to carry out heinous acts he sings , all your children here in their rags of light in our rags of light all dressed to kill and end this night if it be your will first we take manhattan \( 1987 \) the song is about terrorism or militant extremism it is told from the perspective of an individual who tried to work within the system in order to change it that failed now the individual has taken solace in the beauty of his weapons and turned to manhattan and to berlin to make his or her mark in a 2007 interview for xm radio , he said , theres something about terrorism that ive always admired the fact that there are no alibis or no compromises that position is always very attractive i dont like it when its manifested on the physical plane i dont really enjoy the terrorist activities , but psychic terrorism i remember there was a great poem by irving layton that i once read , ill give you a paraphrase of it it was well , you guys blow up an occasional airline and kill a few children here and there , he says but our terrorists , jesus , freud , marx , einstein the whole world is still quaking 'what cohen meant , albeit in a very cynical way , is the philosophies of these people have such a history of being used to justify horrible acts he never engages with the subject fully \( and probably never wanted to do so \) , but cohens song clearly approaches the issue of state sponsored political violence versus political violence of the individual everybody knows \( 1988 \) it is one of the most well known songs he ever recorded the wry cynicism diagnoses the realities of a cruel world in the neoliberal age of austerity , the opening lyrics are exceptionally appropriate , everybody knows that the dice are loaded everybody rolls with their fingers crossed everybody knows that the war is over everybody knows the good guys lost everybody knows the fight was fixed the poor stay poor , the rich get rich thats how it goes everybody knows cohen sings , everybody knows that youre in trouble those in charge of the social order are indifferent to the pain and suffering of the masses but are the owners and politicians capable of maintaining control \? because everybody also knows that it is coming apart democracy \( 1990 \) cohen described in an interview with paul zollo that he wrote the song after the berlin wall came down everyone was saying democracy is coming to the east , and i was like that gloomy fellow who always turns up at a party to ruin the orgy or something and i said , i dont think its going to happen that way i dont think this is such a good idea i think a lot of suffering will be the consequence of this wall coming down 'that seems strikingly backward but it motivated cohen to ask , where is democracy really coming \? he thought there may be more democracy coming to the united states from a love of america , he wrote a song that is really about the irony of america , a song of deep intimacy and affirmation of the experiment of democracy in this country he added , this is really where the experiment is unfolding this is really where the races confront one another , where the classes , where the genders , where even the sexual orientations confront one another this is the real laboratory of democracy given the american exceptionalism of cohens statement , he could have easily produced something with lyrics lee greenwood would have proudly belted out on stage however , each time cohen sings , democracy is coming to the usa , there is a raw irony it , like he does not believe the forces running this nation are capable of democracy then , theres the inimitable line , im sentimental , if you know what i mean i love the country but i cant stand the scene it makes it clear cohen was a disappointed idealist like so many , he liked the idea of america but seeing it play out on that hopeless little screen was never quite what he had in mind the future \( 1990 \) for this song , cohens character looks into the future , and it is not good at all it is so frightening , in fact , that he thinks he would be willing to see fascist society restored give me back the berlin wall give me stalin and st paul give me christ or give me hiroshima the song hurdles onward into more nostalgia for familiar horror , destroy another fetus now we dont like children anyhow ive seen the future , baby it is murder he has no hope that humanity can right itself civilization can try and erect a social order with a tyrant or it can unravel tyranny and push for something more just yet , inevitably , to cohens character , there will be murder in which case , what really is the right thing to do \? on that day \( 2004 \) cohen wrote this as a response to the september 11th attacks it is an artifact that represents reactions to what happened he sings , some people say its what we deserve for sins against god , for crimes in the world there are others who blame it on the fact that women live unveiled or because the country has its fortunes as well as people who are subjugated whatever the case may be , cohen does not seek to settle the discussion rather , he seems more interested in whether those who survived were able to press onward so he poses a rhetorical question did you go crazy or did you report on that day \? then the song abruptly ends amen \( 2012 \) this song comes from the latter era of cohens life , where the sultry nature of his music took on a much more wistful and brooding characteristic he wrote about love but love in a time of war or love with inescapable horror all around in amen , the character cohen channels desperately wants to love he must first see through the terror around him he does not think he can love until the victims are singing and laws of remorse are restored he does not think he can love until the day has been ransomed and night has no right to begin he awaits some kind of redemption and only then will he be able to feel wanted again , but there is too much despair and destruction right now for the character to indulge in pleasure almost like the blues \( 2014 \) we live in a world of permanent war , and so , in this gorgeously layered piece of music , cohen grapples with atrocities he witnessed i saw some people starving there was murder , there was rape their villages were burning they were trying to escape i couldnt meet their glances i was staring at my shoes it was acid it was tragic it was almost like the blues few of cohens songs are as profound the song , which appears on popular problems , could easily be grappling with what goes through the minds of war criminals he sings , i have to die a little between each murderous thought , and when im finished thinking , i have to die a lot the soldier witnesses torture or is party to it he witnesses killing or is party to it and theres all my bad reviews it seems his superiors are unhappy with his performance maybe , they do not think he is killing enough whatever the case may be , he has lost his grip on morality entirely and finds himself confronting the scope of his sins a street \( 2014 \) to cohen , popular problems was all about dealing with defeat he told the telegraph the lyrics were about facing down failure , disappointment , bewildermentespecially the dark forces that modify our lives what is a person to do \? recognize that your struggle and your suffering is the same as everyone elses , cohen suggested i think thats the beginning of a responsible life otherwise , we are in a continual savage battle with each other with no possible solution , political , social , or spiritual while referring to a street , which is about a faltering romance during war , he added , when i say the partys over but ive landed on my feet im standing on this corner where there used to be a street , i think thats probably the theme of the whole album yeah , the scene is blown up , but you just cant keep lamenting the fact there is another position you have to stand in that place where there used to be a street and conduct yourself as if there still is a street in a very basic sense , the master of romantic despair , the high priest of pathos , has now gone up to that tower of song , meant people have to find ways to keep living they have to exist , and by existing , that is in and of itself an act of resistance to all the depravity that unfolds around them the post appeared first on shadowproof
ok , theoretically , everything will go according to plan , and donald trump will be the next president but technically , the \( s \) election hasnt really taken place yet presidential electors of the mystified electoral college must still actually vote for the president , and there isnt anything to keep them from voting their conscience and choosing someone other than donald trump moreover , it appears that there is an active effort to flip the electoral college to deny trump the presidency , and toss the white house to either hillary or a gop loyalist the nevertrump crowd and plenty of bitter hillary supporters are still hoping for a coup , though even they admit it is a long shot completely unprecedented and anything but likely according to the blaze donald trump may have won the electoral votes necessary to win the white house , but he hes likely going to lose the popular vote to democratic candidate hillary clinton and now two electors have launched a last minute effort to convince their colleagues to abandon the president elect this is a long shot its a hail mary , bret chiafolo , a washington state elector who previously pledged not to vote for clinton , told politico monday however , i do see situations where when weve already had two or three republican electors state publicly they didnt want to vote for trump how many of them have real issues with donald trump in private \? chiafolo along with colorado elector micheal baca have launched what they call a moral electors movement in hopes of convincing 37 of their republican colleagues to deny trump their votes should they succeed in their radical effort , the presidential decision would be thrown to the republican controlled house of representatives the electoral college consists of 538 members who are expected to convene in their respective state capitals on dec 19 to formally vote for the next president baca said he hopes the move launches a serious national discussion about abolishing the electoral college , which would require either a constitutional amendment or legislation in several states the speculation is that if this maneuver were to be successful , the gop led congress could be persuaded not to choose hillary , but to write in a selection for a party loyalist like mitt romney or john kasich maybe even a bush of course , there have also been reports that team hillary has been hard at work attempting to persuade electors to switch their votes in the hope , however desperate , that they can still flip the election and take the white house we are calling on the electors to ignore their states votes and cast their ballots for secretary clinton why \? mr trump is unfit to serve the larger issue here is that the system is badly broken , the people are harshly divided along demographic and political lines , and the future is gambling on extreme versions of itself larger than life candidates , and bizarre back door maneuvers in attempt to hack the system and bend it in one direction or another trump has taken his place on the stage in a thunderous revolt of the people , but his legacy will be tested out the gates by the heavy pressures of washington lobbyists , intrigue on the part of political insiders and the cults of opposition that are springing up in response to his controversial journey to the white house the entire political establishment have been knocked off their perch , though their hold on power has not necessarily been loosened a whole new era is born , and it remains to be seen how it will play out its not over yet they are probably still trying to steal the election calls for electoral college to ignore will of people clinton insider confesses trump protests are just more pre paid soros riots to stir unrest beware of the shadow government ron paul advises president elect trump surrounded by bankers , wall st insiders banging on the door to get in draining the swamp \? violent revolution if trump lets them down people remain poised for angry revolt roberts

editors note disgusting this country just gets more and more corrupt by the day its insane pretty soon it will collapse of its own weight under so much disgusting corruption the pennsylvania legislature has passed a law prohibiting the release of officers names for up to 30 days after a police related death has occurred it was backed by philadelphia police unions and will become law if signed by democratic governor tom wolf the measure passed thursday after the republican controlled legislature voted along party lines if the bill becomes law , it will prevent public officials from releasing the names of officers involved in shootings which cause death or serious bodily injury for up to 30 days after the incident , or until the conclusion of an official investigation the bill , hb 1538 , was sponsored by state rep martina white \( r philadelphia \) and is a direct contradiction of the philadelphia police departments policy of releasing names within 72 hours of a shooting the 72 hour rule was created by the department of justice and put into place by former police commissioner charles h ramsey in 2014 , after it was recommended speaking in support of the rule at the time , ramsey said i dont think you can reasonably expect to shoot people and remain anonymous however , the influential philadelphia police union has defended hb 1538 were just asking to put a lid on the boiling pot until things calm down , especially if its an investigation that could lead to protests in the community , john mcnesby , president of the 14 , 500 strong union , told the pittsburgh post gazette white claims the bill is needed , due to the dangers faced by police officers i was watching the television and just saw how officers are being gunned down and other officers in different states had been subjected to harassment and the very things that they are trying to protect citizens like ourselves from experiencing , and to me the 72 hour rule is really just an arbitrary number , white told the post gazette however , neither mcnesby nor white could identify any instances of officers or their families being harmed due to being publicly identified mcnesby told the post gazette that he was unaware of any direct threats that had taken place , but said thats what were looking to stop before it becomes a reality the american civil liberties union of pennsylvania has criticized the bill , calling it a policy that will heighten tensions between the police and the communities they serve and accusing it of being completely tone deaf to the needs of communities that are impacted by police brutality rep margo davidson \( d delaware county \) has also spoken out against the bill , saying it undermines the bridges that have been built between law enforcement and communities of color she added that this legislation will do nothing but breed suspicion davidson , along with many other philadelphia democrats , opposed the bill in the 151 32 vote governor wolf has yet to comment on whether or not he will sign the bill , which passed the senate and house with a veto proof majority if wolf still decides to veto , an override of that veto would only be able to take place after the next election read also war on cops debunked more cops died by accident than violence in 2015 contributed by of

yesterday , we reported that the fbi has found tens of thousands of emails belonging to huma adein on anthony weiners computer , raising questions how practical it is that any conclusive finding will be available or made by the fbi in the few days left before the elections as the wsj adds , the review will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are work related emails between huma abedin , a close clinton aide and the estranged wife of mr weiner , and state department officials how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the federal bureau of investigation and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the clinton email probe , which fbi officials call midyear those emails stretched back years , these people said , and were on a laptop that both mr weiner and ms abedin used and that hadnt previously come up in the clinton email probe ms abedin said in late august that the couple were separating the fbi had searched the computer while looking for child pornography , people familiar with the matter said , but the warrant they used didnt give them authority to search for matters related to mrs clintons email arrangement at the state department mr weiner has denied sending explicit or indecent messages to the teenager as reported yesterday , it appears that there are potentially tens of thousands of abedin linked emails on weiners computer in their initial review of the laptop , the metadata showed many messages , apparently in the thousands , that were either sent to or from the private email server at mrs clintons home that had been the focus of so much investigative effort for the fbi senior fbi officials decided to let the weiner investigators proceed with a closer examination of the metadata on the computer , and report back to them the wsj then connects the dots between how the weiner emails were linked to the clinton reopening of the clinton probe , despite loretta lynchs and the dojs vocal urges not to do so mr comey was given an update , decided to go forward with the case and notified congress on friday , with explosive results senior justice department officials had warned mr comey that telling congress would violate well established policies against overt actions that could affect an election , and some within the fbi have been unhappy at mr comeys repeated public statements on the probe , going back to his first press conference on the subject in july but wait it gets better mr mcauliffe had supported dr mccabe in the hopes she and a handful of other democrats might help win a majority in the state senate , giving mr mcauliffe more sway in the state capitol dr mccabe lost her race last november , and democrats failed to win their majority fbi officials have said mr mccabe had no role in the clinton email probe until he became deputy director , and there was no conflict of interest because by then his wifes campaign was over which brings us to the second big topic the clinton foundation , and how the doj made sure that particular probe never made the light of day at the same time as the clinton server was being investigated , other clinton related investigations were under way within the fbi , and they have been the subject of internal debate for months early this year , four fbi field officesnew york , los angeles , washington and little rock , ark were collecting information about the clinton foundation to see if there was evidence of financial crimes or influence peddling , according to people familiar with the matter the wsj touches on something fascinating los angeles agents had picked up information about the clinton foundation from an unrelated public corruption case and had issued some subpoenas for bank records related to the foundation , these people said so where did that trail go \? apparently nowhere the washington field office was probing financial relationships involving mr mcauliffe before he became a clinton foundation board member , these people said mr mcauliffe has denied any wrongdoing , and his lawyer has said the probe is focused on whether he failed to register as an agent of a foreign entity the fbi field office in new york had done the most work on the clinton foundation case and received help from the fbi field office in little rock , the people familiar with the matter said in february , fbi officials made a presentation to the justice department , according to these people by all accounts , the meeting didnt go well that was one of the weirdest meetings ive ever been to , one participant told others afterward , according to people familiar with the matter needless to say , the probe into the foundation faded but back to the clinton probe , according to a person familiar with the probes , on aug 12 , a senior justice department official called mr mccabe to voice his displeasure at finding that new york fbi agents were still openly pursuing the clinton foundation probe , despite the departments refusal to allow more aggressive investigative methods in the case mr mccabe said agents still had the authority to pursue the issue as long as they didnt use those methods at this point a question emerges did mccabe seek to defend or press on with a clinton probe mr mccabes defenders in the agency said that following the call , he repeated the instruction that he had given earlier in the clinton foundation investigation agents were to keep pursuing the work within the authority they had others further down the fbi chain of command , however , said agents were given a much starker instruction on the case stand down when agents questioned why they werent allowed to take more aggressive steps , they said they were told the order had come from the deputy directormr mccabe others familiar with the matter deny mr mccabe or any other senior fbi official gave such a stand down instruction at this point the two probes , into hillarys email and the clinton foundation converged for agents who already felt uneasy about fbi leaderships handling of the clinton foundation case , the moment only deepened their concerns , these people said for those who felt the probe hadnt yet found significant evidence of criminal conduct , the leaderships approach was the right response to the facts on the ground things accelerated over the past two months , when in september , agents on the foundation case asked to see the emails contained on non government laptops that had been searched as part of the clinton email case , but that request was rejected by prosecutors at the eastern district of new york , in brooklyn those emails were given to the fbi based on grants of partial immunity and limited use agreements , meaning agents could only use them for the purpose of investigating possible mishandling of classified information some fbi agents were dissatisfied with that answer , and asked for permission to make a similar request to federal prosecutors in manhattan , according to people familiar with the matter mr mccabe , these people said , told them no and added that they could not go prosecutor shopping not long after that discussion , fbi agents informed the bureaus leaders about the weiner laptop , prompting mr comeys disclosure to congress and setting of the furor that promises to consume the final days of a tumultuous campaign while much of the latest developments are known , or could have been inferred assuming more corruption within government agencies , the punchline is that the weeks if not months of upcoming work means that if clinton wins the white house , she will likely do so amid at least one ongoing investigation into her inner circle being handled by law enforcement officials who are deeply divided over how to manage such cases it also means that trump will be hounding hillary for the remainder of the campaign as being the only presidential candidate to seek election with a recently reopened criminal probe hanging over her head delivered by the daily sheeple contributed by of www zerohedge com

home badge abuse this is my second one virginia cop caught bragging about killing two unarmed people this is my second one virginia cop caught bragging about killing two unarmed people claire bernish july 27 , 2016 7 comments a former virginia police officer and u s navy veteran , whose trial for murder begins this week , told a witness , this is my second one , after killing an unarmed 18 year old black man in april 2015 while unclear whether or not the jarring statement amounted to a boast , the camera on ex portsmouth officer stephen rankins taser recorded him saying this to a walmart employee mere seconds after he fatally shot unarmed teen and alleged shoplifter william chapman in the stores parking lot in april 2015 rankin had , indeed , killed another unarmed man , kirill denyakin under circumstances similarly and sufficiently questionable to earn three years administrative leave just four years prior to the shooting for which he now stands accused of first degree murder during the final pretrial hearing on tuesday , the guardian reported , rankins lead defense attorney , james broccoletti , argued the former officers statement is not probative of anything , in an unsuccessful attempt to have it suppressed prosecutors countered to judge johnny e morrison they should not have to sanitize the evidence surrounding the fatal shooting the defendant made the comment , not just in the presence and earshot of a witness , but to the witness , argued commonwealths attorney stephanie n morales , who heads the case against rankin although morrison had previously disallowed direct statements to jurors concerning rankins fatal shooting of denyakin , as the guardian noted , it now appears the officers prior use of deadly force will play an albeit limited role in the prosecutions case troubling details about the killing of unarmed 26 year old kazakhstani cook , kirill denyakin , on april 23 , 2011 , would seem to suggest a glib tone in the officers later statement to the walmart employee rankin responded to a call about denyakin drunkenly pounding on the door of a residence where he had been staying with friends alleging the cook reached for his waistband and then charged toward him , rankin shot denyakin 11 times in the chest and limbs , as the free thought project reported no weapons were recovered on denyakins body or at the scene but when the mans family filed a 22 million civil suit against the officer , the situation took a dark turn defending his use of deadly force , rankin who had chosen a photograph of a dead serb who had been lynched by the nazis in 1943 as his facebook profile picture took to a local newspapers website , posting roughly 250 comments derisively attacking denyakins character and insulting his familys attempt to seek compensation , writing 22 mil wont buy your boy back let alone a habitual drunk working as a hotel cook weeks prior to that deadly interaction , one of the officers supervisors cautioned senior commanders rankin was dangerous and likely to harm someone further revelations included facebook posts in which the cop referred to his firearms case as rankins box of vengeance a grand jury refused to indict rankin for the denyakins killing and though the department placed him on administrative leave for nearly three years , it took just over a year after his return to active duty for rankin to fatally shoot chapman under circumstances suspicious enough to now stand accused of murder on the morning of april 22 , 2015 , portsmouth walmart employees summoned police to report a shoplifter rankin responded and confronted 18 year old chapman in the stores parking lot several witnesses reported seeing rankin attempting to handcuff the teen , but their observations of what happened next differ to some degree two construction workers said chapman broke free from the officer , knocking his taser to the ground but , in speaking to separate reporters afterward , one described the man whaling on the officer , the other noted the pairs subsequent interaction was a tussle in which the teen had not been close enough to physically strike rankin in a report , pathologists noted rankin would have been at least 30 inches away from chapman when he was shot , and the medical examiner did not find gunpowder burns or residue suggestive of a point blank or near point blank shooting no stolen items were listed among the victims personal effects further , body cam footage recorded rankin holding his taser , but abruptly and perhaps conveniently , if not outright suspiciously , stopped for the 15 seconds surrounding the shooting only to pick up after the deadly interaction , with the taser on the ground chapmans familys attorney , jon babineau , recounting what he was told for pilot online , said in december , the video was operational up until just before the shooting , and then it was not operational for about 15 seconds , though an unnamed source told him the gap had been caused by a power source issue and did not necessarily believe the tape had been edited in september 2015 , a grand jury indicted rankin for murder and the illegal use of a firearm rankin has since been terminated from the portsmouth force and continues to maintain his innocence jury selection for the murder trial is slated to begin this morning share google fred ziffel anytime the calculated death of a human being is forced by another knowing these actions are not absolutely necessary and there was no other immediate threat to life , the act of taking or ending said life becomes murder who the perpetrator is , or what his her occupational profession is , is totally irrelevant murder is not justifiable i hope they prosecute this vigorously and relentlessly bill allyn justice system reform list america has a serious , institutionalized , systemic law enforcement problem over the last 4 decades , our law enforcement has become increasingly militarized , putting every citizen at risk of being shot and killed for nothing more than reaching for their wallet , as instructed , or less this may increase safety for police officers \( debatable , in the long run \) , but at the expense of making american citizens far less safe , which is the exact opposite of the goals of law enforcement we need to create systems that bring back accountability within every level of the justice system nationally , we need to 1 create citizen oversight committees with powers of subpoena and prosecutorial discretion for every law enforcement agency in the country a special independent prosecutor must be assigned immediately for officer involved shootings committee members should be randomly selected and replaced often , like grand jurors , to avoid corruption 2 require law enforcement officers to be personally insured to protect taxpayers from lawsuits too risky for insurance \? no insurance , no badge insurance could be partially publicly subsidized 3 require every law enforcement officer to wear a camera no camera , no gun also , implement gps tracking on all police cars and cameras 4 require yearly psyche tests to screen out potentially abusive officers 5 require random drug and steroid tests 6 all police agencies must keep a database of every officer caused civilian injury , shooting or killing , and that data must be periodically transmitted to a third party , non biased national database 7 any officer involved in a shooting must be alcohol and drug tested immediately 8 officers should be made aware of studies on abuse of power , such as the stanford prison experiment and the milgram experiment on obedience to authority figures ensure there are clear policies on use of force 9 more training to deal with mentally ill , or a mental illness crisis unit more training and encouragement to use peacemaking , conflict resolution , and de escalation skills increase educational requirements , focusing on psychology , sociology , and social work 10 create a special number \( third party , independent of police \) to report police brutality victims of police brutality and the families of police shootings should immediately be appointed an attorney to represent their position case 11 create national database of abusive officers , so they dont just get hired elsewhere 12 reverse militarization of police forces take away military weapons , apcs , uniforms , and especially the attitude police officers are civilians , not a branch of the military require at least 5 years between active duty military and civilian police employment keep swat military weapons and equipment under lock and key only to be used in genuine emergencies quit viewing the community you police as a war zone 13 prohibit television shows that glorify bad , illegal , or unconstitutional policing , such as cops glorifying these behaviors creates a dangerous situation for american citizens and should not be tolerated 14 increase community outreach hire officers from the community officers need to be more in touch with the people they are sworn to protect 15 end no knock raids it is perfectly legal for a home owner to respond to a break in with gun in hand , which gets them killed when the police are the intruders this makes it unreasonably dangerous on citizens , especially when cops often go to the wrong address 16 reform forfeiture laws to protect citizens property rights and due process no forfeiture proceedings until after conviction all forfeiture proceeds go directly to the victims of police brutality and the families of police shootings 17 end drug prohibition war on drugs use harm reduction strategies 18 end private prison industry 19 create a national organization dedicated to these ideals this list is brilliant ! great post ibcamn cops are just criminals with a badge occams sad that there will be lots of tax dollars spent just to simply let him walk away , but then , that

concludes the overnight wrap good luck to all those braving the sales today its staggering to see the number of how to survive black friday articles out there now and how many more stories there are with tips and strategies to get the best bargains on the day apparently it now takes weeks of precise planning and preparation it sounds like youll need a decent plate of leftover turkey this morning to build up the energy first if the last 24 hours is anything to go by then its likely to be another fairly quiet day ahead with the us scheduled for an early close while there wasnt much to shout about in markets yesterday the most interesting story concerned a bloomberg report about the ecb possibly putting off decisions about the future of its bond buying program until next year the crux of the story concerned the parameters of the program and how the technical issues relating to bond scarcity may have eased with the recent rise in yields the story also suggested that some policy makers would consider a delay on the qe extension decision but wed also caveat that with the mention of most policymakers still seeing a need to send a dovish message at next months meeting given the inflation outlook indeed wed highlight that the recent message from ecb officials has been just that including president draghis recent comments a reminder too that the 2019 staff forecasts will be available for the first time at the meeting next month that said , it is worth noting that expectations were fairly high for a qe announcement in december 2014 and we had to wait for january 2015 for the decision to eventually be made so you cant entirely rule out the possibility a delay with that bloomberg report coming as markets in europe closed we didnt get to see too much of a reaction 10y bund yields finished little changed at 0 251 with yields , if anything , a couple of basis points higher following the story the periphery was a bit more mixed \( portugal and spain 1bp lower and italy 1bp higher \) but again moves were fairly modest this morning weve seen 10y treasury yields rise nearly 5bps however there was also some focus on fx markets yesterday with a number of em currencies making new recent lows including currencies in india , malaysia , vietnam and philippines the turkish lira \( 1 44 \) was also under pressure despite turkeys central bank raising rates for the first time in nearly three years following that though the european parliament then voted overwhelmingly in favour of suspending eu membership talks with turkey elsewhere , equity markets in europe yesterday were generally a touch firmer despite volumes some 50 or so below the usual daily average the stoxx 600 closed up 0 31 as healthcare and tech stocks led the move higher , while credit indices were marginally tighter a bit of stability in the oil complex seemingly helped too with wti continuing to hover around the 48 bbl level ahead of the opec meeting next week back to the ecb , vice president constancio also added to the recent chorus of dovish communication from the bank yesterday he said that we want our policies , including unconventional policies , in place until we are convinced there is a sustained path toward our objective of inflation the ecbs twice yearly financial stability review was also released yesterday with the report warning about the risk of a possible abrupt global correction on the back of political uncertainty and elevated geopolitical tensions which is posing risks to stability , banks , confidence and economic growth this morning in asia , with the exception of china its been a broadly positive session for equity markets the nikkei \( 0 77 \) , hang seng \( 0 38 \) , kospi \( 0 10 \) and asx \( 0 62 \) are all up although in china the shanghai comp \( 0 43 \) has dipped lower us equity index futures are also a smidgen higher while sovereign bond markets are generally weaker 10y jgb yields in particular are a couple of basis points higher at 0 053 and the highest yield since mid february the yen \( 0 25 \) however is under pressure and approaching 114 following the latest leg higher for the dollar the latest cpi data was also out in japan overnight the good news is that headline cpi return to positive territory at 0 1 yoy versus 0 5 in september , however the core remains rooted in deflation at 0 4 yoy \( from 0 5 \) the core core did also improve to 0 2 yoy from 0 0 our economists noted that the increase in overall cpi was mainly due to a sharp increase in the price of fresh vegetables due to unfavourable weather the only other snippet to mention from yesterday was the economic data the most significant came from germany where there was no final revisions made to the q3 gdp print of 0 2 qoq , leaving the yoy rate at 1 7 the components of the report showed that growth mainly came from domestic demand , especially private and government consumption meanwhile germanys november ifo survey revealed a business climate reading of 110 4 which was unchanged from the month prior a slight increase in the current assessment component was offset by a modest decline in expectations in france business confidence was also unchanged in november at 102 looking at todays calendar the main focus this morning in the european session will likely be on the uk where well get the second estimate of q3 gdp and where the office for national statistics is expected to confirm that gdp grew at 0 5 qoq during the quarter well also receive the wider components of the gdp report which will be interesting to see also due out in the uk today is the cbis distributive trades survey for november while french consumer confidence data is the early print this morning markets in the us should be quiet again today but there is some data due out including the remaining flash november pmis \( services and composite \) , wholesale inventories and the advance goods trade balance for october itll also be worth keeping an eye on any retail sales data for black friday sales in the us a quick reminder before we sign off that this sunday , the second and final round of the french centre right primary is due to be held as a reminder the run off is between francois fillon and alain juppe , the former coming out on top in the first round , with the winner going on to be the chosen republican candidate we should know the

gobbles addresses an angry crowd in a shock election result , turkeys have voted in favour of christmas for the first time since they gained the right to hold elections in 1845 in every year since then , turkeys have voted firmly against the yuletide feast however , this year a populist right wing turkey called steve paxo has managed the impossible , and persuaded turkeys to vote for christmas during the campaign , paxo was helped by his sinister propaganda adviser , gobbles , and made a series of promises to the other turkeys he said that he would take back control of christmas , and make it great again he promised to ban the eating of turkeys at christmas , although he has no power to enforce this he also said that all the money spent on killing turkeys at christmas could instead be used to provide free chocolate and hdtv to all turkeys the win seems to have surprised even gobbles and paxo , and they began to backtrack on their pledges almost immediately of course when we said we would take back control of christmas we meant in a non literal sense , said gobbles it is likely that many turkeys will be slaughtered this year anyway some turkeys were disappointed with the result mr clucky voted for christmas but is beginning to regret it i 've had a rough year , he said my cage is a mess and i thought voting for christmas would fix it all they promised so much no turkey farmers are thought to be considering taking the result seriously in any case , the turkeys voted in favour of christmas , so there is actually less controversy this year than when the birds have voted against it farmer arse of norwich said , them turkeys is as dumb as chickens they deserve everything they get make sir geoffroy cockface 's
by on october 28 , 2016 ben jacobs , sabrina siddiqui and spencer ackerman the guardian oct 28 , 2016 the fbi is investigating newly discovered emails related to hillary clintons personal server , its director has announced the fbi had announced in july that its investigation into the democratic presidential candidates private email server had concluded with a recommendation of no criminal charges in the matter , although james comey , the fbis director , criticised clinton as careless but in a letter sent to members of congress on friday , comey said new emails had been discovered in an unrelated case in connection with an unrelated case , the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation , comey wrote i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday , and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation comey added although the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant and i cannot predict how long it will take to complete this additional work , i believe it is important to update your committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony the system might not be as rigged as i thought , remarked donald trump at a rally on friday afternoon a us security source firmly ruled out that the unrelated case comey referred to in his letter was the investigation into the digital penetration of the democratic national committee earlier this year us intelligence officials have blamed russia for hacking the dnc and releasing its internal communications online the source , who would not speak on the record , said neither that inquiry nor its adjuncts were related to the new investigative developments related to clinton nor is the recent criminal investigation into a national security agency contractor accused of hoarding highly classified intelligence data later the associated press , citing an unnamed official , claimed the newly discovered emails did not come from her private server the letter from comey comes 11 days before the presidential election and nearly four months after the fbi director announced the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against clinton for what it dubbed extremely careless use of a private email server while secretary of state the fbi director said then although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case it was not immediately clear if clinton would address the matter publicly she ignored shouted questions from reporters waiting on the tarmac about the fbis announcement and did not raise the issue after taking the stage in cedar rapids , iowa , sticking with her routine stump speech
president elect donald trump has said he plans to deport two to three million undocumented immigrants with criminal records from the country immediately and has insisted that he will build his wall in his first extensive interview since he won the white house , trump is reassuring his supporters that he will deport or incarcerate up to three million gang members and drug dealers in an interview with cbss 60 minutes that airs on sunday evening his first since winning the election trump insisted that he will build the wall along the us mexico border that was a vital part of his presidential campaign what we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records , gang members , drug dealers , where a lot of these people , probably two million it could be even three million we are getting them out of the country or we are going to incarcerate , mr trump told 60 minutes be were getting them out of the country , theyre here illegally he explained that once the border is secure , then the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement will assess the status of the remaining undocumented immigrants in the country after the border is secure and after everything gets normalized , were going to make a determination on the people that theyre talking about who are terrific people , theyre terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that , he said but before we make that determination its very important , we are going to secure our border when asked if he actually intends to build the wall along the southern border , mr trump simply replied , yes however , mr trump explained that the wall along the 1 , 900 mile border would probably not be as grandiose as he promised describing an iteration of the boundary between the two countries that essentially already exists there could be some fencing , he said for certain areas i would accept a fence , but certain areas , a wall is more appropriate im very good at this , its called construction the president elects comments about mass deportations stand at odds with a statement made by paul ryan , the highest ranking republican , on sunday morning we are not planning on erecting a deportation force donald trumps not planning on that , mr ryan told cnn i think we should put peoples minds at ease that is not what our focus is that is not what were focused on were focused on securing the border , he added we think thats first and foremost , before we get into any other immigration issue , weve got to know whos coming and going into the country weve got to secure the border mr ryans remarks seemed to indicate yet another u turn in policy proposals for the president elect on friday , he told the wall street journal that he would more than likely keep some parts of the affordable care act , more commonly known as obamacare , rather than completely repealing it either obamacare will be amended , or repealed and replaced , mr trump told the newspaper following his 90 minute meeting with president barack obama i told him i will look at his suggestions and , out of respect , i will do that while mr obama said he felt encouraged by the thursday meeting , a signifcant number of americans believe mr trumps election will mark a dark , new phase for the united states , as he intends to dismantle much of the sitting presidents legacy millions of protesters took to the streets after election night to protest over mr trumps defeat of hillary clinton while the new york businessman did win enough electoral votes to make it to the white house , ms clinton took the popular vote more than any us president in history , with the exception of mr obama protests filled roads in major cities , like los angeles , new york , and chicago , and echoed with chants of not my president and dump trump dissenters are using the protests to rebuke the racism and bigotry promoted by the trump campaign , as manifested through policy proposals like building a wall along the border , mass deportations , and the blockade of muslim immigrants mr trumps victory has galvanised white supremacists across the country , as a wave of reported hate crimesreaches new highs neo nazi and daily stormer founder andrew anglin exalted mr trump as a god emperor following tuesday nights election results our glorious leader has ascended to god emperor make no mistake about it we did this if it were not for us , it wouldnt have been possible , he wrote t he white race is back in the game and if were playing , no one can beat us the winning is not going to stop the ku klux klan also announced a victory parade for the beginning of december in north carolina civil rights organisations are preparing themselves for the incoming trump administration the american civil liberties union published a full page ad in the new york times with an open letter threatening to sue mr trump if you do not reverse course and endeavor to make these campaign promises a reality , the aclu wrote , you will have to contend with the full firepower of the aclu at your every step source \( independent uk \)
over the course of this years us presidential election , which has been nothing if not bizarre , some have repeatedly speculated that the election may not actually happen at all if an
did donald trump unite the american silent majority behind things true and shared \? these are economic prosperity , national pride and unity , recognizable neighborhoodsa yen that demands an end to the transformation of neighborhoods through centrally planned , mass immigrationand an end to gratuitous wars those were the questions asked in the trump revolution the donalds creative destruction deconstructed \( june 29 , 2016 \) , and answered in the affirmative unlike americas self anointed cognoscenti , some of us saw this coming the former recognize truth only once card carrying members arrive at it independently , grasp and broadcast it , sometimes years too late not so americas marginalized writers not in 2012 , but in 2002 did we pinpoint the wrongness of the iraq war and not in 2016 , but in july of 2015 did some of us , not fortuitously , finger trump as a candidate to kick the crap out of all the politicians and send the systems sycophants scattering \( august 14 , 2015 \) his appeal , as this writer has contended since late in 2015 , transcended left and right conversely , vaunted statistician nate silver calculated , last november , that trumps support was about the same share of people who think the apollo moon landings were faked \( professor tyler cowen of george mason university properly downgraded wonder boy silvers intellectual prowess his prose , wrote the good teacher , was a sprawl that evinces a greater affiliation to rigor with data analysis than to rigor with philosophy of science or , for that matter , rigor with rhetoric \) given the disparate groups that rooted for mr trumps candidacy , it would appear that he did in fact awaken a historic majority you could say mr trump was an omnibus candidate , a concept floated by historian david hackett fischer an omnibus campaign is one that appeals in all cultural regions back in the 1840 and 1848 elections , william henry harrison and zachary taylor , respectively , proved to be omnibus candidates , popular across cultural regions in his ability to run strongly in almost every cultural region , trump is the closest the country has come in a long time to an omnibus candidate president elect trump answered the many prayers of very many people the establishments reaction to the trump revolution comports with the conduct of elites , also traced by hackett fischer in his towering text , albions seed four british folkways in america there is a cultural equivalent of the iron law of oligarchy small groups dominate every cultural system they tend to do so by controlling institutions and processes , so that they become the governors of a culture in both a political and mechanical sense the iron law of cultural elites is an historical constant , posited hackett fischer in his magisterial account of american cultural and social origins but the relation between elites and other cultural groups is highly variable every culture might be seen as a system of bargaining , in which elites maintain their hegemony by concessions to other groups these old bargaining processes may have worked in new englands town system , where each community enjoyed a high degree of autonomy and also a common interest in supporting the system itself but reciprocal liberty in early americas back settlements has long since given way to elite solidarity , hegemony , log rolling and collusion with favored interests in virtue , the american oligarchy currently in control of the intellectual means of production bears no resemblance to the natural aristocracy , the object of thomas jeffersons lauding reflections likewise , sir william berkeleys concept of a society governed by gentlemen of honor , courage and breeding is nowhere seen in the fragmented , faction based politics of america this is not to say that mr trump exemplifies these lost qualities , but , as the trump revolution contends , there is a distinct element of gruff , made in america noblesse oblige to trumps political crusade put it this way , president elect trump is unlikely to be caught off guard mouthing his contempt for small town america , as barack obama did in depicting potential voters as clinging to their guns , god and other bigotries its hard to imagine president elect trump ever demonstrating the cruelty and hypocrisy of a gordon brown , great britains former prime minister in may of 2010 , after hearing mrs gillian duffys worries over deficits and immigration , the pompous , two faced boor of a prime minister retreated to his limousine , and , microphone on , proceeded to berate this perfectly decent lady , calling her horrible , old woman , and bigoted the trump presidency is the last heave ho of americas mrs duffys of americas historic , founding majority almost 200 years on , albions seed is scattered , diluted and demoralized more so than cultural identities , issues have come to dominate elections the trump revolution boiled down to fundamental things like islam \( no thanks \) , immigration \( much less \) , and a government that refused to heed in the short term , the success of this majority awakened and its candidate will depend on president elect trumps ability to beat back the sprawling political machine that makes up the d c comitatus , now writhing like a fire breathing mythical monster in the throes of death or , so we hope
here 's something interesting from the unz review recipient name recipient email i was born on july 20 , 1944 , the day of the failed officers plot against adolf hitler that means i preceded the official dawning of the nuclear age by exactly 369 days , which makes me part of the last generation to do so im speaking not of the obliteration of two japanese cities by americas new wonder weapon on august 6th and 9th , 1945 , but of the trinity test of the first atomic bomb in the new mexican desert near alamogordo on july 16th of that year when physicist robert oppenheimer , the father of the atomic bomb , witnessed that explosion , the line from the hindu holy book , the bhagavad gita , that famously came into his head was i am become death , the destroyer of worlds how apt it still remains more than seven decades later , at a moment when nine countries possess such weapons more than 15 , 000 of them in their arsenals , most of which are now staggeringly more destructive than that first devastating bomb , and as tomdispatch regular michael klare points out today , some of which are closer to possible use than at any point in at least a couple of decades for those of us who lived through the years of bomb shelters , atomic movie monsters , the cuban missile crisis \( which left me , age 18 , fearing i might be toast in the morning \) , the rise and fall of antinuclear movements , and nuclear nightmares of a sort i still remember vividly from my youth in a way i no longer recall the dreams of last night , its a horror to imagine that nuclear war is still with us even more so , because , in election 2016 , we have a presidential candidate who is not only ignorant about those weapons in hard to believe ways , but who wonders why we cant use them , and who might months from now have his finger on that nuclear button \( or rather command of the nuclear codes that could launch such a war \) dont tell me that this isnt a living nightmare of the first order i find it eerie in the extreme and unnervingly apt that the clinton campaign has brought back a living icon of our nuclear fears , the little girl from the 1964 election who appeared in the famous \( or infamous \) daisy ad president lyndon johnson ran against republican contender barry goldwater \( who , in retrospect , seems like the soul of stability compared with you know whom \) she was then seen counting to 10 as she plucked petals off a daisy just before an ominous , echoing male voice began the countdown to an atomic explosion that filled the screen now , that girl , monique luiz , a grown woman , is shown saying , the fear of nuclear war we had as children , i never thought our children would ever have to deal with that again and to see that coming forward in this election is really scary shes now 55 years old and , however the clinton campaign may be using her , theres still something deeply unnerving for those of us who had hoped to outlast the nuclear age simply to see her there more than five decades later and if you think thats unnerving on the eve of the most bizarre presidential election in memory , then read todays piece by michael klare and imagine just how unsettling , in nuclear terms , the years ahead may prove to be
cnns jake tapper hit the nail on the head last night , as he was speaking about why people voted for trump tapper said that most americans are sick of the income inequality , globalization , and politics as usual that the status quo have given us he even pointed out that only a handful of people have gotten rich off of globalization , and a lot of people have been left behind indeed , exit polls last night showed that the economy was the number 1 concern for voters the guardian reports its the economy , stupid was a phrase coined by her husbands adviser james carville in the 1992 election and , in many ways , it ought to have helped democrats again in 2016 barack obama helped rescue the us from the financial crash and presided over a record series of consecutive quarters of job growth unfortunately for clinton , many americans simply did not feel as positive stagnant wage levels and soaring inequality were symptoms of the malaise felt by many voters trump successfully convinced them to believe this was caused by bad trade deals and a rigged economy despite being pushed in this direction by sanders in the democratic primary , clinton never really found a satisfactory response her volte face on trade sounded and was later proved by leaked emails unconvincing at best deeply cynical at worst similarly , brexit the other recent vote which went against all political forecasts was largely a vote by those who lost out on the benefits of globalization that only a handful of fatcats really profited from leaders of the brexit campaign noted the confluence of the two votes jeremy corbyn described mr trumps victory as an unmistakable rejection of political establishment ukip leader nigel farage who went to the us to appear at a trump campaign rally said he was handing over his mantle as the creator of political earthquakes to the new president , saying that 2016 was the year of two great political revolutions , adding i thought brexit was big , but boy , this looks like its going to be even bigger n igel farage has issued this statement following donald trumps victory today , the establishment is in deep shock even more so than after brexit what we are witnessing is the end of a period of big business and big politics controlling our lives voters across the western world want nation state democracy , proper border controls and to be in charge of their own lives i commend donald trump for the courage with which he has fought this campaign and i look forward to a closer relationship between the usa and the uk we now have a president who likes our country and understands our post brexit values prepare for further political shocks in the years to come voters in the uk and the worlds strongest nation , the u s , have both rebuked the status quo , including neoliberal trade and economic policies whats next \? the rebellion will spreadfor example , its so probable that merkels christian democratic union party will be thrown out on its ear that merkel is already trying to distract with silly claims that the russians will hack the german election postscript there are , of course , other reasons that trump won but the economy is the main one

sputnik reports australian prime minister malcolm turnbull said the government is set to present a parliamentary bill to amend the migration act , and prevent adults who are sent to australias offshore immigration centers from receiving an australian visa in the future this will send the strongest possible signal to the people smugglers , it will send the strongest possible signal to those who are seeking to persuade persons currently on nauru and manus \( the islands where australias immigration centers are located \) that the australian government will change its mind and allow them to settle here , turnbull said australian barrister greg barns , spokesman for the australian lawyers alliance , told radio sputnik that the proposal breaches the un refugee convention this declares that refugees are entitled to claim asylum regardless of their method of reaching a country , if they say they have been persecuted in their country of origin the governments plan would prevent migrants from visiting australia many years later , while on business or as tourists , even if they have successfully settled in a third country and gained citizenship there its the most draconian legislation the world has ever seen , its unprecedented in global terms , and it means that australia puts itself , yet again , in the basket of pariah states when it comes to those sorts of issues , barns said turnbulls liberal party will require the support of opposition parties to pass the legislation while bill shorten , leader of australias opposition labor party , said the proposal seems ridiculous , his party stopped short of rejecting it and instead promised to examine the plan closely unfortunately the opposition labor party in australia has been very weak on these issues in recent years , and both the major political parties , the conservatives \( australias liberal party \) and the labor party , have been able to force these sorts of changes on australian policy , barns told sputnik there have been suggestions today that the labor party might finally get some backbone and oppose this legislation , because if the labor party , which is the major opposition party , supports this legislation , then it will become a reality the governments claim that their proposal is compliant with international law is laughable , and shows yet again that australia snubs its nose at international law when it suits it , barns said barns said that australias immigration policy has become harsher as a result of public fears of migration , and the actions of successive government which have played on these fears some australians have a xenophobic , racist view about the rest of the world , they have this ridiculous fear about hordes coming to this island continent and invading it , thats been historic if you dont have strong political leadership which says that we can do better , this will become politically popular , said barns , who contrasted the current policy with that of malcom frasers 1970s liberal government , which accepted large numbers of refugees who came on boats from vietnam since the government of john howard from 1996 to 2007 , successive governments in australia have pandered to the xenophobic , racist side of the country , and thats precisely what malcolm turnbull is doing with this legislation australia is a nation built on migration , and in fact some of the leading figures in australian society came here by boat those very same people now would be banned under this law turnbulls proposal has won the praise of australias right wing populist one nation party , led by pauline hanson , who won re election to australias house of representatives this year good to see that it looks like the government is now taking its cues from one nation just like last time auspol phon nauru manus https t co c0gqew7vr8 pauline hanson \( paulinehansonoz \) 30 october 2016 barns said that turnbulls proposal is an effort to attract votes from hansons one nation to the conservative liberal party malcolm turnbulls party wants to try and take over some of its vote , and it seems to be that this is the way to do it to pass outrageous , draconian laws that trash australias reputation even further in world eyes when it comes to refugees , simply for short term political gain
ah the old pump and dump the market should bottom righ before elections and then a big rally the next day when the rigging continues markets and elections
sasha polakow suransky , guardian , november 1 , 2016 in april 2002 , jean marie le pen stunned all of europe by defeating the socialist candidate , lionel jospin , in the first round of the french presidential election , and advancing to the final round between the top two candidates terrified by the prospect of a far right victory , the french leftincluding communists , greens and the socialist partythrew their support behind the incumbent president , jacques chirac , a pillar of the centre right establishment who had served as mayor of paris for 18 years before becoming president in 1995 this electoral strategy effectively isolated le pens front national \( fn \) , depicting it as a cancerous force in the french body politic two weeks later , on 5 may , chirac won the election with an astronomical 82 of the vote , trouncing le pen by the biggest margin in a french presidential election since 1848 raucous celebrations spilled into the streets of paris we have gone through a time of serious anxiety for the countrybut tonight france has reaffirmed its attachment to the values of the republic , chirac declared in his victory speech then , speaking to the joyous crowds in the place de la rpublique , he lauded them for rejecting intolerance and demagoguery but may 2002 was not , in fact , a moment of triumph rather it was the dying gasp of an old order , in which the fate of european nations was controlled by large establishment parties jean marie le pen was an easy target for the left , and for establishment figures such as chirac he was a political provocateur who appealed as much to antisemites and homophobes as to voters upset about immigration , drawing his support largely from the most reactionary elements of the old catholic right in other words , he was a familiar villainand his ideology represented an archaic france , a defeated past moreover , he did not seriously aim for power , and never really came close to acquiring it his role was to be a rabble rouser and to inject his ideas into the national debate europes new far right is different from denmark to the netherlands to germany , a new wave of rightwing parties has emerged over the past decade and a half , and they are casting a much wider net than jean marie le pen ever attempted to and by deftly appealing to fear , nostalgia and resentment of elites , they are rapidly broadening their base le pens own daughter is a prime example of the new ambitions of the right unlike her incendiary father , marine le pen is running a disciplined political operation and has already proven that her party can win upwards of 40 of the vote in regions from calais in the north to the cte dazur in the south she and her danish and dutch counterparts are notas some on the left would like to believeneo nazis or inconsequential extremists with fringe ideas lacking popular appeal these parties have built a coherent ideology and steadily chipped away at the establishment parties hold on power by pursuing a new and devastatingly effective electoral strategy they have made a very public break with the symbols of the old rights past , distancing themselves from skinheads , neo nazis and homophobes they have also deftly co opted the causes , policies and rhetoric of their opponents they have sought to outflank the left when it comes to defending a strong welfare state and protecting social benefits that they claim are threatened by an influx of freeloading migrants they have effectively claimed the progressive causes of the leftfrom gay rights to womens equality and protecting jews from antisemitismas their own , by depicting muslim immigrants as the primary threat to all three groups as fear of islam has spread , with their encouragement , they have presented themselves as the only true defenders of western identity and western libertiesthe last bulwark protecting a besieged judeo christian civilisation from the barbarians at the gates these parties have steadily filled an electoral vacuum left open by social democratic and centre right parties , who ignored voters growing anger over immigrationsome of it legitimate , some of it bigotedor simply waited too long to address it they have shed some of the rights most unsavoury baggage while responding to both economic anxiety and fear of terrorism by blending a nativist economic policymore welfare , but only for us and tough anti immigration and border security measures their message is beginning to resonate widely with a fearful population that believes the liberal governing elite no longer listens to them brexit was just the start europes new far right is poised to transform the continents political landscapeeither by winning elections or simply by pulling a besieged political centre so far in its direction that its ideas become the new normal and when that happens , groups that would never have contemplated voting for a far right party 10 years agothe young , gay people , jews , feministsmay join the working class voters who have already abandoned parties of the left to become the new backbone of the populist right on 6 may 2002 , one day after revellers filled the streets of paris to celebrate chiracs historic victory , the flamboyant and iconoclastic leader of the dutch far right , pim fortuyn , was gunned down by a radical animal rights activist as he emerged from a radio interview his assassin later claimed that he had killed fortuyn to stop him from using muslims as scapegoats in national elections nine days later , fortuyns eponymous partythe pim fortuyn list became the second largest in the netherlands with 17 of the vote fortuyn , a former communist and openly gay man who boasted of sleeping with muslim immigrants while calling for a ban on muslim immigration , was an electrifying figure in a country known for its staid politics his time in the limelight was short but transformative it was fortuyn who blazed the trail for the new generation of far right leaders across europe he may not have intended to be a pioneer , but his brand of plain spoken political incorrectness and his depiction of islamic culture as a backwards and reactionary threat to the hard won progressive values of western europe would provide a potent template for a modernised far right his ideological inheritors in dutch politics , as well as the revamped front national in france , the danish peoples party and germanys alternative f r deutschland have all emulated fortuyn in their own ways fortuyn proved that the winning argument for the european far right was not a us style appeal to conservative religious values , but rather to claim it was defending secular , progressive culture from the threat of immigration , argues merijn oudenampsen of tilburg university the netherlands was a perfect laboratory for this new strategy because , unlike france , it did not have a strong contingent of religious traditionalists opposed to womens liberation and gay rights before founding his own party in 2002 , fortuyn had tried to join an establishment centre right party , the peoples party for freedom and democracy \( vvd \) , in the late 1990s the partys then leader , frits bolkestein , who had been one of the first figures to speak critically about immigration in the early 1990s , remembers fortuyn as a talented but inflammatory politician he had a thoroughly theatrical personality , and that played in his favour , said bolkestein , now in his 80s , from his office overlooking the canals of amsterdam i didnt want him to be in my parliamentary group , so i cold shouldered him he would have acted as a fragmentation bomb fortuyn took his explosive rhetoric elsewhere and , by creating a new type of far right politics in progressive garba form of xenophobia ideally suited to a nation that prides itself on its tolerance , as a new yorker profile once described ithe redirected the entire national debate in a way that has endured long after his death two years after fortuyn was killed , the netherlands was traumatised by another political assassination early one morning in november 2004 , the filmmaker theo van gogh was murdered by a young dutch moroccan , mohammed bouyeri , who shot van gogh eight times , slashed his throat and then pinned a letter to his chest with a knife the letter was a death threat aimed at the somali born dutch parliamentarian ayaan hirsi ali a vocal critic of islam who was soon placed under the protection of the dutch security services the two assassinations shook the netherlands to its core and catapulted a little known and theatrically coiffed politician , geert wilders , to popularity as an ideological successor to fortuyn wilders had also flirted with bolkesteins vvd , beginning his political career as a staffer in the party office in late 2004 , he split off and formed his own with hirsi ali in hiding , he quickly became the most prominent anti immigration voice in the countryand has remained so ever since for those who cared to look , the political ground had already begun to shift six months before chiracs trouncing of le pen and fortuyns assassination , denmark had an election on its surface the result was not a historical watershed the centre right venstre party ousted the social democrats , handing power from one establishment party to the other what had changed was that the danish peoples party , which had campaigned on an overtly anti immigrant platform , took 12 of the votetransforming it into a kingmaker in parliament unlike france , which revelled in its triumph over the fn , or the netherlands , where the remains of fortuyns party failed to become a real parliamentary force , the dpp immediately became a serious player with real influence over policy and it was not only taking votes from the right it was also attracting disgruntled social democratic voters who felt that their leaders had abandoned them the dpp had crafted a social and economic policy that was in many ways more socialist than that of the social democratspromising better health care , better care for the elderly , and more subsidised housing as the outgoing social democratic prime minister poul nyrup rasmussen told me in 2002 , a few months after his defeat they took a part of our rhetoric and tried to sell it as a new package to the people , and with some success , one may say back then , naser khader , a danish member of parliament who immigrated from syria as a child , argued that the best way to weaken the dpp is to give them influence he was wrong the headquarters of the front national sits on a quiet street in the unassuming paris suburb of nanterre , near a car repair shop and a portuguese restaurant only when you approach the grey building with its mostly closed blue shutters do the armed guards come into view in her modest second floor office , surrounded by books and a cloud of vape smoke , marine le pen explained earlier this year how she transformed a party previously known for calling the holocaust a detail of history into a genuine contender for the presidency voluntarily or not , he gave ammunition to our adversaries , le pen said of her father but she insisted that she has now cleaned house i fired them all all those people who expressed an ideology or held views that i found unacceptable julien rochedy , a 28 year old who headed the fns youth wing but has since left the party , told me that he believes the changes are real whereas the partys former leader used to pepper his speeches with lines that made jews hair stand on end , today , if someone tells a racist joke within the party , you will be attacked straight away , rochedy said there is such self discipline these days they are so afraid theyll be accused once again of being antisemitic or racist still , the partys detractors continue to level the same charges at the fn , which outrages marine le pen today our adversaries no longer have that ammunition , and they repeat on loop old tropes about fascists and racists at a certain point this argument loses its force , she continued , because voters see clearly that theres absolutely nothing in our platform that remotely resembles fascism or racism le pen has done more than kick out the most blatant racists and antisemites she has consciously crafted a campaign designed to appeal to voters of the centre and leftand other constituencieswho could never have imagined voting for her fathers front national as le mondes olivier faye has written , she is trying to erase another image that has stuck to the skin of the fnthat of homophobia and it is working a survey showed that her share of the vote among married gay couples in the 2015 regional elections was over 32 up from just 19 in a similar poll from 2012 as le pen has filled her inner circle with more and more openly gay advisers and party leaders , she has also made her pitch to jewish voters more explicit for a lot of french jews , the fn appears to be the only movement that can defend them from this new antisemitism nourished in the banlieues , le pen told me in a very natural way they have turned toward the fn , because the fn is capable , i think , of protecting them from that among french voters threatened by the countrys new diversity , rejection of a multicultural society increasingly takes the form of longing for a bygone era and peddling nostalgia is the centrepiece of many new far right parties across europe in france , marine le pen has promised a return to a time when the french had their own currency and monetary policy , when there were fewer mosques and less halal meat , when no one complained about nativity scenes in public buildings , and when french schools promoted a republican ethos of assimilation a growing number of french people feel uncomfortable in their own country , the prominent philosopher , alain finkielkraut , declared in january during a debate with the centre right presidential candidate alain juppwho has taken a less strident line on islam and migration than his rival nicolas sarkozy finkielkraut depicted contemporary france as a country of halal butchers and tea shops filled only with men , pleading that the public good isnt in the clouds , its made from tangible thingsthe french of proust and montaigne the jardin du luxembourg and the cows of normandy finkielkraut , a 67 year old jewish liberal , is not an admirer of the front national , but marine le pens deliberate appeals to jews and gay people have given political expression to an argument that he first made more than a decade agothat the left , with its indulgence of islam , poses a greater threat to france than the far right after chirac saved the republic from jean marie le pen in 2002 , finkielkraut watched the celebrations in the streets and warned that the victors were the real danger the future of hate is in their camp and not in the camp of those nostalgic for vichy , he wrote , in the camp of the multicultural society and not that of the ethnic nationin the camp of respect , not that of rejection fourteen years later , after the terrorist attacks on charlie hebdo , the bataclan and nice , finkielkraut is even more certain he was correct anti racism today frequently serves as a pretext for not seeing the true danger that threatens us , he told me when we met in his paris apartment this summer while he is still no fan of the fn , he believes it has changed and argues that it should be resisted , but for what it is today and not what it was in the past , and not in the name of anti fascism the french must , he insisted , avoid simplistic analogies with the 1930s we must not mistake what era we live in europe doesnt only have demons it also has enemies , and it needs to know how to fight those enemies he worries that integration has been such a failure that france will have to reconquer its lost territoriesby which he means the suburbs surrounding paris integrating people is not telling them you are how you are and we are how we are integration means making them an integral part of our civilisation and if that doesnt happen , he warned darkly , at best well have secession and at worst civil war continued immigration from muslim countries , he argues , is nothing less than the planned demise of europe across the country , nostalgia for an older , whiter france has become a potent political force in the southern city of bziers , mayor robert mnard , a former trotskyist who cofounded the press freedom group reporters without borders , is seeking to place a moratorium on the opening of kebab shops and has renamed a street after one of the french officers who joined a failed coup against de gaulle in 1961 to prevent algerian independence mnard comes from a family of pieds noirs , french settlers in algeria he regards the evian accords that ended the algerian war as a capitulation , and those who tried to preserve french algeria as heroes this nostalgia has an unmistakable appeal , but not necessarily for the sort of voters one might expect whereas young britons overwhelmingly voted to remain in the eu and the elderly voted to leave , in france it is the opposite according to julian rochedy , the former fn youth leader , appeals to nostalgia work better with the young in francewho dream of an era they never witnessedthan with the old , who lived through the era marine le pen promises to restore it is older voters , rochedy argues , who are the greatest obstacle to le pens victory they are afraid of leaving the euro , he says they are afraid of huge changes rochedy is convinced that the fn will never win simply by fetishising the past they just want to go back 30 years , he said of his erstwhile colleagues its a discourse that doesnt at all take into account the world as it is and what france has become even if le pen cannot win over enough older voters for her to become president , there is one ageing constituency that has already moved significantly to the rightthe former members of what used to be the largest communist party in western europe as the french communist party collapsed , its supporters were left rudderless according to andrew hussey , a liverpool born academic who teaches in paris , the technocratic leaders of the socialist party many of them graduates of the ultra elite ecole nationale dadministrationare so disconnected from ordinary people that even former marxists wont consider voting for them distrustful of the establishment and searching for a state that protects them , many have turned to the fn i think youve got a big political question here about who looks after you , hussey said this is a very communist way of thinking le pen knows that she is attracting these people many of her supporters used to be socialists , but they arent any more , she told me although she prefers to avoid the phrase welfare statethats a socialist concept , she insistedle pen has appealed directly to this yearning for a large and nurturing state that fights for the common man and not the rich i defend fraternitythe idea that a developed country should be able to be able to provide the poorest with the minimum needed to live with dignity as a human being the french state no longer does that , she told me were in a world today in which you either defend the interests of the people or the interests of the banks and she has seen results she points to the northern pas de calais region it was socialist communist for 80 years , she says i won 45 at the same time as marine le pen was working to de demonise the fn , the leaders of the dutch far right successfully seized the mantle of radicalism by positioning itself as the only force that dares to challenge an out of touch political establishment , and the only party willing to speak out about what many voters fear extremist islam geert wilders and his party for freedom \( pvv \) have surpassed the dutch labour party to take up a close second place in polls ahead of the march 2017 election last september , wilders declared that europe was facing an islamic invasion the sort of comments that landed him in court this week on charges of inciting racial hatred , which he dismisses as an attack on freedom of expression the presence of masses of young men in their 20s with beards singing allahu akbar across europe , wilders warned at the peak of last years refugee crisis , posed a dire threat to our prosperity , our security , our culture and identity across the country , grassroots groups responded to wilderss warning , attempting to block the resettlement of asylum seekers in their towns last october , klaas dijkhoff , the deputy minister responsible for refugee resettlement , arrived for a visit to the tiny north eastern village of oranje , where the dutch government had decided to place 700 refugees outraged locals blocked the road leading to town , kicked dijkhoffs car and tore off its rearview mirrors a few days later , near utrecht , an asylum centre was attacked by masked men with smoke bombs and fireworks in the decade following the assassinations of fortuyn and van gogh , the integration of muslim immigrants became the most divisive issue in dutch politics suddenly , turkish and moroccan born dutch citizens became muslims and as the public debate over islam and migration grew even more hostile , even the most basic forms of visible religious observancewearing the hijab , buying halal meat , fasting during ramadanbecame politically loaded the dutch labour mp ahmed marcouch , who came to the netherlands from rural morocco when he was 10 , recounted how controversies have erupted everywhere from supermarkets to classrooms it is a jolt to the traditionally liberal netherlands when teenage girls tell their male teachers they cant shake hands , or that they fast and pray while many other dutch kids are out drinking and having sex as marcouch remarked , it runs against everything that dutch youth culture promotes wilderss pvv has capitalised on this cultural angst by using simple and deliberately brash slogans about immigration , crime , and refugeesone of his latest memes is simply de islamiseto win over voters who feel that everything familiar to them is slipping away by framing its anti migrant politics as a battle against imperious elites and political correctness , the pvv has been able to capitalise on a panoply of grievances , from anger over asylum seekers to euroscepticism meanwhile , many causes of the radical leftincluding anti racism and anti colonialismhave now become establishment thinking in the netherlands idealism has been bureaucratised , argues the journalist bas heijne , who writes a column in the liberal daily newspaper nrc handelsblad and when the establishment enforces universalism , you react against it thats why there is such a strong anti pc tone to the dutch right do not tell us what to say , what to celebrate and who we must live next to just as marine le pens fn has become a huge presence on social media in france , the right is in the midst of colonising the dutch media geen stijl \( no style \) , a popular breitbart style news site featuring abrasive articles and videos , encourages its best and angriest commenters to visit mainstream news sites and go on the attack it is massively important , says tilburg universitys merijn oudenampsen , like a social movement the site began as a blog dedicated to those who felt politically homeless after fortuyns murder , and has since become a ubiquitous presence in dutch public debate , with an army of reactors on twitter according to oudenampsen , some politicians have told him that geen stijl is the first site they check in the morning the rights newfound media clout has also helped shape what the journalist kustaw bessems , from the leftwing volkskrant newspaper , sees as a new , inverted , form of political correctness in the old days , he says , there were taboos enforced by the left badmouth immigrants and you were immediately called a racist and extreme right and basically pressured to shut up now , its the other way around as soon as you say anything other than immigration is a problem or islam is the cause of terrorism the thought police immediately jump on your neck to correct you a dutch government official who focuses on security issues complained that even as the integration of muslim immigrants and the threat of radical islam had become the most heated and polarising issues in the netherlands , almost none of the feverish public debate was informed by knowledge of islamism or terrorism while politicians fan the flames of fear , the official said , the economists look for the economic roots of the problem , sociologists look for social causes and the anthropologists try to explain jihadi culturebut none of them have any idea about theology even scholars of radicalisation tend to study todays extremists through the historical lens of the european radical leftwhich does little to explain what leads a small number of young muslim men such as van goghs killer , mohamed bouyeri , to devote themselves to the cause of jihad its easy to be a marxist , the security official quipped its fucking hard to be a salafi as the perception that the state is helpless to prevent the radicalisation of muslim teenagers deepens and the fear of terrorism increases , so does the share of voters who are newly receptive to the far rights tirades about islamisation these days it is not only anti migration activists pushing back against the bureaucratised consensus there are also many disappointed progressivesthe people who saw the cultural victories of the 1960s and 1970s as major battles that had long since been won , making sexual freedom , feminism and gay rights an unquestioned part of dutch society suddenly those old victories seem tenuous there is a sense that , we are welcoming and then they do this , says bas heijne they have been terribly let down in their good intentions and in such an environment , traditionally leftist constituencies such as gay people and jews feel threatenedand some have become reflexively suspicious of muslims the stereotype that observant muslims hate gay men and lesbians has become so entrenched in the netherlands that neither side can fathom evidence to the contrary when the moroccan born labour mp ahmed marcouch first joined in amsterdams legendary gay pride parade , he was , as he puts it , the first hetero active muslim to participate the gay community feared violence from extremists conservative muslims were baffled and angry both groups concluded , oh , maybe marcouch is homosexual too , he says with a laugh neither group could imagine a straight muslim doing what he did but public displays of solidarity such as marcouchs are rare among openly gay couples and religious jews alike , there is a palpable fear of being targeted by homophobic or antisemitic young muslim men much as in france , this fraught atmosphere has made far right parties seem a palatable option for groups who would never previously have considered voting for them in amsterdam earlier this year , i had several meetings with a staunch jewish supporter of wilderss pvv , who insisted on remaining anonymous he described his own backing for the far right in terms that echoed alain finkielkraut its an outdated reflex for jews to always say the problem is the extreme right , he told me we have new enemies and we need new ideas the experience of his own family during the second world war has convinced him that europes capacity for murderous violence is always lurking beneath the surface anne frank wasnt betrayed by the germans , he argued but by dutch people regular dutch jews need to find new allies in a new war , he argues , because they will never be safe the trains for the jews will always come , he added , ominously id rather be wrong than be too calm and end up on the trains he is not unsympathetic to the plight of european muslims , and told me that he even sees parallels with the persecution his own family faced if i were a muslim in europe at this moment id be very uneasy , he admitted if europeans regain their manhood , it could be bad its the history of europe to treat foreigners terribly we jews know that for that reason , he argues , muslims should regard wilders as a lesser evil every muslim should be happy geert wilders exists if someone else channelled these hateful feelings it would be much worse , he told me menacingly wilders is civil he is a democrat he is not the new hitler to frits bolkestein , who led the netherlands centre right vvd in the 1990sand was briefly wilders boss when he was a young aide in the party officethe rise of the far right is as much about class as it is about islam the dutch labour party , he argues , gave up on its working class base they made a major mistake , he says of his old rivals , with a tinge of satisfaction faced with the choice between the foreign born and the labour classes , they chose the foreign born and theyve paid for it dearly current polls project that the party will drop from the 36 seats it now holds \( out of 150 \) to just 10 marcouch concedes that , like the old leftists in france , many former labour voters now back wilders moreover , he says , they still live in the very neighbourhoods that families such as his own moved into in the 1980s , as many white dutch families were moving out their message to the labour party , he said , is you ignored us you let it happen the danish peoples party has been seeking out such voters for years , and they have masterfully leveraged anti immigrant sentiment to siphon away the social democrats traditional basepeople who fear that the bread will be buttered more thinly , as the danish journalist lars trier mogensen puts it the dpp has effectively combined anti immigrant rhetoric with a strong pro welfare message that stresses quality health benefits and good care for the elderly sren espersen , the dpps deputy leader , doesnt think that former social democrats will ever go back when one of those takes the step to vote for us , it is a very , very huge step he is taking , he says of voters who supported the social democrats all their lives and why should he go back \? i mean , to come over this first hurdle of voting for us , then hes done it the social democrats first began to lose their dominance in and around the major cities in the 1990s , with many of their votes going to the dpp one of those places is the small satellite town of herlev , about 10 miles west of copenhagen the 41 year old social democratic mayor , thomas gyldal petersen , has lived there all his life , and he is adamant that controlling immigration numbers is the only way to reverse his partys political misfortunes for gyldal petersen , the key to successful integration is a demographic balance as soon as a school or housing estate becomes majority immigrantor majority unemployedhe says , problems start to arise he blames his own partys leaders mayors in the 80s , they were warning , something is going wrong , you have to change but the party leadership shut their eyes , he says then came the muhammad cartoons in 2005 , the editors at jyllands posten , denmarks largest newspaper , invited a group of well known cartoonists to draw the prophet the initial response was underwhelming , but within a few monthsthrough a combination of diplomatic pressure , a
