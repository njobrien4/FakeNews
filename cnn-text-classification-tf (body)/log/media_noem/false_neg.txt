savage kingdom a three part nature documentary that begins friday on nat geo wild is hard to watch and even harder to listen to its an effort to capitalize on game of thrones by imposing a human narrative onto wild animals in botswana in southern africa a game of thrones star charles dance reads a ponderous narration in a sonorous voice that is supposed to be ominously intriguing but is too often just nap inducing it doesnt help that the default speed of the six hour mini series seems to be slow motion the combination of voice and slow motion is only slightly more stimulating than a television yule log thats too bad because the imagery can be impressive we see big cats lions leopards snatching prey out of trees and on the plains turning on one another trying in vain to protect cubs we see hyenas battle wild dogs the special was filmed over two years and you can only marvel at some of the shots and wonder how they were obtained that said the program is preoccupied with blood and death so much so that the episodes are preceded by a viewer advisory rarely do more than a few minutes go by without a shot of one animal carrying a chunk of some other animal in its jaws random close ups of grinning skulls and fly covered leg bones are used as transitional adornments theres nothing wrong with emphasizing the kill or be killed reality of life in the wild but thats been done before repeatedly to set itself apart savage kingdom accompanies the grisly footage with a sort of story line in which the leaders of the various species have names and all of them are plotting and scheming for control of a game rich marsh the clich heavy narration mr dance is saddled with is full of references to defending the border and military style strategy worthy of macarthur in this overwrought world female hyenas arent merely tending their young the sisterhood is raising an army mr dance intones trying to shake off the sameness that has settled over a lot of wildlife programming is a commendable instinct but the treatment here is a bit much for a more easygoing animal themed offering try polar bear town a six part documentary series that began in mid november on the smithsonian channel the series with new episodes wednesday nights chronicles the annual polar bear migration that runs through churchill a town in manitoba canada where the relocating bears are a tourist draw the series explores the push and pull between the natural world and the human one things can become dicey when the gawkers forget that the bears are wild animals our first priority is the safety of people from polar bears bob windsor a manitoba natural resource officer explained in the first episode second priority is basically the safety of polar bears from people churchill has tour guides who make a living off taking tourists to see bears a job that became more difficult recently after a bear attack now the authorities are more aggressive about keeping bears away from people and some of the guides best viewing spots are off limits seeing tourists intrude on the natural cycle of the animals is annoying but its hard to blame them the bears are gorgeous its too bad at least from the bears perspective that this series will probably encourage even more tourists to come
washington in the summer of armed american drones over eastern syria stalked junaid hussain an influential hacker and recruiter for the islamic state for weeks mr hussain was careful to keep his young stepson by his side and the drones held their fire but late one night mr hussain left an internet cafe alone and minutes later a hellfire missile killed him as he walked between two buildings in raqqa syria the islamic states de facto capital mr hussain a year old from birmingham england was a leader of a band of english speaking computer specialists who had given a far reaching megaphone to islamic state propaganda and exhorted online followers to carry out attacks in the west one by one american and allied forces have killed the most important of roughly a dozen members of the cell which the f b i calls the legion as part of a secretive campaign that has largely silenced a powerful voice that led to a surge of counterterrorism activity across the united states in as young men and women came under the influence of its propaganda american military intelligence and law enforcement officials acknowledge that the islamic state still retains a sophisticated social media arm that could still inspire attacks like those in san bernardino calif and in orlando fla and remains a potent foe suspected of maintaining clandestine cells in europe but they point to the coordinated effort against the legion as evidence of the success the united states has had in reducing the islamic states ability to direct enable or inspire attacks against the west initially the threat posed by the legion was primarily seen as a problem for law enforcement officials but as the threat worsened last year and the f b i stepped up the monitoring of terrorism suspects around the country the bureau pressed the military to focus on the group according to current and former american officials while american and british forces conducted a series of drone strikes on members of the group the f b i sifted through thousands of the legions followers on social media to figure out who had actually been inspired to take action in the last two years it has arrested nearly people in cases involving the terrorist group several of the arrests were of people who had direct contact with the legion many of the others involved were folks who first came on our radar because we became aware of them through their connections with hussain and reyaad khan also a british citizen who was another leader of the group according to andrew mccabe deputy director of the f b i mr hussain wore a number of hats including that of a hacker he was linked to the release of personal information on more than american military and government employees in march his group posted the names and addresses of service members with instructions kill them in their own lands behead them in their own homes stab them to death as they walk their streets thinking they are safe more important were mr hussains efforts as an online recruiter according to court records mr hussain communicated with at least four men in four states imploring them to initiate attacks or help spread the islamic states message mr hussain was behind a plot to behead pamela geller the author of a conservative blog in early mr hussain began communicating with usaamah abdullah rahim and gave him instructions to kill ms geller mr rahim abruptly abandoned the plan and decided instead to kill a police officer in the boston area the bureau was monitoring him and mr rahim was shot and killed in june after he confronted an f b i surveillance team with a knife the f b i also arrested two of mr rahims associates whom prosecutors say were involved in the plot mr hussains associates were also busy another briton named raphael hostey was in touch with mohammed hamzah khan of bolingbrook ill mr khan tried to travel to syria with his two younger siblings before he was arrested by the f b i in another plot that the f b i disrupted mr hussain instructed an ohio college student named munir abdulkader to kidnap a member of the military and record his killing on video mr hussain then asked mr abdulkader to attack a police station in the cincinnati area as mr abdulkader prepared for the suicide operation he told mr hussain about his prowess on the shooting range mr hussain responded next time ul be shooting kuffar in their face and stomach kuffar is a derogatory term for non muslims mr abdulkader who was born in eritrea was arrested and pleaded guilty in july to material support for terrorism and plotting to kill a member of the military and police officers he was sentenced to years in prison and last year the f b i arrested a north carolina man justin nolan sullivan then and charged him with trying to provide material support to the islamic state federal prosecutors say he planned to target a public venue in a mass shooting the authorities said that mr sullivan and mr hussain had discussed making a video of the attack for use as propaganda when mr sullivans parents voiced concerns about their son buying a silencer he approached an undercover f b i employee about killing them mr sullivan who described mr hussain as part of the islamic state cyberteam was also charged with fatally shooting his year old neighbor in the head a senior american law enforcement official described the spring and summer of as a nightmare for the f b i a spike in terrorism activity left the f b i reeling the strain was so great said the f b i director james b comey that the bureau was struggling to keep pace with the threat forcing it to move criminal officers to surveillance squads but then carrying out one strike after the next american and

erbil iraq at least people many of them shiite pilgrims on their way home to iran were killed on thursday when an islamic state suicide bomber detonated a truck filled with explosives at a roadside service station in southern iraq local officials said the devastating attack came two days after prime minister haider al abadi applauded the security forces for protecting the millions of shiites who have flowed through southern iraq in recent days for what many consider the worlds largest religious pilgrimage larger even than the hajj in saudi arabia in years past the annual rite known as arbaeen a commemoration of the martyrdom of imam hussein a revered seventh century shiite figure was a frequent target of sunni extremist groups like the islamic state and its predecessor al qaeda in iraq until the bombing on thursday for which the islamic state claimed responsibility in a statement the event had been carried out safely that was seen as a success for mr abadi and the military and was hailed as a sign that the government could keep pushing a major offensive against the islamic state in mosul while protecting pilgrims in the south thursdays bombing in hilla a city south of baghdad shattered that illusion the islamic state clearly remains a potent force both on the battlefields of mosul where fighters are putting up a last stand against iraqs elite counterterrorism forces in eastern neighborhoods and in its ability to carry out more traditional guerrilla attacks for nearly six weeks tens of thousands of iraqi security force members have been fighting in northern iraq to retake mosul the countrys second largest city and the last stronghold of the islamic state in iraq government forces have found themselves bogged down fighting house to house in dense urban neighborhoods and many civilians have been killed a victory in mosul could represent the end of the islamic states control of territory in iraq but the bombing thursday was a stark reminder that the group will most likely revert to its roots as a guerrilla insurgency and continue to carry out terrorist attacks across the country the bombing was the deadliest in iraq since an explosives filled truck blew up near a shopping mall in baghdad in july killing at least people in the worst terrorist attack in the capital since the american invasion of iraq in that attack alarmed american officials who worry that efforts to help the iraqis defeat the islamic state in mosul will be squandered if civilians around the country are terrorized by suicide bombings in recent months the united states has rushed intelligence advisers and new drones to iraq to counter car bomb attacks in baghdad and the south before thursdays bombing there had been a noticeable decline in the numbers of attacks falah al khafaji the head of the provincial security committee in babil province where the bombing occurred said that at least people had been killed and that dozens more had been wounded mr khafaji said early reports suggested that the bomber had followed a bus of iranian pilgrims and then detonated his explosives in a crowded parking lot at a gas station restaurant complex setting fire to a number of vehicles and fuel tanks another local official dr nowras abdulrazak the head of babils health directorate said on thursday that his casualty toll was people dead and wounded that number was likely to rise he said most of the victims were iranians officials said but it was unclear in the immediate aftermath of the attack exactly how many iranian state television however reported that a majority of the victims were afghan citizens living in iran iran is the regions pre eminent shiite power and millions of its citizens annually flock to iraq which is also majority shiite to visit important religious sites in the cities of karbala and najaf the islamic state said in a statement released after the attack that one of its fighters an iraqi man had carried out the suicide bombing the group vowed to spread the flames of the battles underway in mosul to the shiite dominated south according to a translation released by the site intelligence group which tracks jihadist statements the islamic state considers shiites apostates and it has long carried out a campaign of sectarian killings in iraq in its statement it called shiites miscreants and said what awaits them in the immediate future allah permitting is more sorrowful and bitter one of the people hurt in the bombing toma muhan said on thursday that just before the explosion he parked his car at the service station he was walking away when he was knocked to the ground i felt a strong blast at my back and then severe pain in my leg he said from a hospital bed where he was being treated for shrapnel wounds and burns to his neck and legs i remember hearing loud screaming and then i passed out and woke up later at the hospital a local police officer col thamir jhazala said that the restaurant and gas station had opened recently and that security was not good he cited what he said was a lack of surveillance cameras numan al jibouri who works at the station said that thursday was a day off for him but that he had been nearby when the explosion occurred and rushed to the scene i heard the sound of a big explosion and saw the blaze rising up to the sky followed by smoke he said when he got to the scene mr jibouri said he saw charred and unrecognizable victims but he did recognize one a man who works with him named mohammed who was severely burned he rushed his colleague to the hospital where he was being treated

an email i received from a reader some time ago has begun to haunt me the readers sister was dying of cancer how she asked me would i respond to the word grace in the context of a cancer death my correspondent did not gloss over the miseries of her sisters terminal state she outlined a series of horrific tests that led doctors to withhold food she described fevers infections and the weeping legs caused by edema but then she testified to her sisters uncanny ability to brighten any room with her smiles had i received this query while i was undergoing my first treatments it would have triggered irritation bordering on apoplexy why should a cancer patient be expected to lift her own spirits or anyone elses isnt it hard enough dealing with such dire circumstances without having to become a booster for oneself and for caregivers one scholar of american cancer culture samantha king decries a tyranny of cheerfulness that gets too many patients down making us feel guilty about expressing understandable anguish during the intervening years however i have interacted with friends as they confronted an irreversible condition and i too have witnessed a kind of grace that i found inspiring while coping with cancer these people contested it and sometimes the medical protocols upon which they had to rely yet when bodily functions shut down few of them dug in and battled a condition pronounced terminal indeed their sense of tranquillity seemed to be founded on acceptance of their impending mortality what might have contributed to their patent and patient grace and given my own impatience with circumstances beyond my control could i possibly tap such sources catholic and protestant authorities agree on the mysterious nature of grace which they see as a free and undeserved or gratuitous favor not a reward a disposition that works to perfect the soul grace cannot be known or acquired through words beliefs or deeds in the jewish tradition the hebrew word chen for grace appears in the benediction may the lord be gracious to you though the word baruch for blessed is used more frequently to denote an unmerited gift for believers who seek this benefit from god as for nonbelievers who seek it elsewhere grace remains a highly elusive but highly desirable state especially in troubled times people with cancer explore all the activities that people without cancer use to make themselves receptive to a sense of beneficence or loving kindness religious liturgies private prayer meditation breathing and body exercises verse or mantra recitations making or looking at pictures listening to or making music walking in nature communing with friends and alcohol or marijuana those engaged daily in one or more of these practices testify to their efficacy a zillion self help books offer instructions but the trick must consist in finding ones own eccentric way my correspondent had glimpsed grace in her sisters smiles shed also found it in an obituary that a massachusetts mother beth orourke had composed for herself while she was dying of cancer and she included a link to it the self obituarys eerie opening i died thursday april prefaces a description of ms orourkes life and then her conclusion that in the end grace and love win not cancer it reminded me of the first self obituary i had read after a recurrence of endometrial cancer the seattle based author and editor jane catherine lotter posted an essay in which she recalled the high points of her education and career because she wanted to be joyful about having a full life rather than sad about having to die she closed with thanks for her family and ended with beautiful day happy to have been here might the introspection and retrospection of writing serve as one source of grace that transforms it from a gift received to a gift conferred after my friend pep died of metastatic colon cancer his self obit in the local paper brought tears to my eyes it was as if i heard his jokey self deprecating voice from beyond the grave the act of composition must have composed him providing an opportunity to reflect on his life to express appreciation of his family and friends and to make peace with the posthumous presence he would become in common parlance the word grace means elegance ease of comportment a style that charms those who observe it a scholar of many languages pep would have known that it derives from the latin gratus which mean pleasing or thankful and that it gave rise to the italian grazie and the spanish gracias by virtue of his gracious words pep bestowed a gift of grace on his family and friends i cannot imagine attaining a durable state of grace throughout the ordeals that will surely arrive in the future instead i consider practicing a series of hesitant brief grace notes the musical notation of these short notes is printed in smaller type to indicate an ornament and with a slur mark linking them to the note they precede a fleeting sound before a longer lasting duration that immediately follows to me they look buoyant like a tiny bounce or skip forward there must be as many ways to play grace notes as there are people in the world what might they be i wonder in this season i give thanks for the time that remains to resist animosity and fear i want to devote it to becoming proficient at all sorts of grace notes before the chords of closure resound into silence
as we enter this season of contemplation and reflection we all have more than the usual number of everyday financial questions weighing on us how much more might we pay for health care under president elect donald trump how will any new trade policies affect our household budgets and job prospects how much less will some of us pay in taxes after his promised reforms and what might we do with what could be many thousands of dollars of extra money step back a bit however and you will see that every money question eventually boils down to a single line of inquiry how much is enough it is a quantitative question for sure how much insurance is enough how much federal revenue and how much personal income and spending but the questions qualitative nature is what makes it special and singular it is about how money makes us feel and ultimately it is an inquiry into the nature of our values about what our spending saving and giving say about us and what we and our families ultimately stand for it is not a new question we find some version of it in the liturgy of various world religions on the covers of books by financial services professionals and economists and in the title of an second song by the punk band bad religion that decries our rapacity tenacity capacity for more but addressing the question is an appropriate task right now given an unpredictable president elect and a congress nominally behind him poised to make good on at least some promises to change our financial lives absent any certainty about what will happen in washington we can at least try to get ourselves square in our heads about what feels like enough for us enough awareness how much do any of us really know about what our spending saving and giving add up to could we draw an accurate pie chart that reflects a year of household outflows this is not another call to write down everything you spend in a notebook but it is a reminder that if you dont like what you see when you glance at the credit or debit card statement or the pile of receipts then its time to reconsider a few things my colleague carl richards has offered short courses here recently on spending awareness and aligning spending with values moneys value is in part as an observational tool as something to meditate on said vicki robin whose classic book your money or your life is an excellent longer course on defining enough does spending money bring you pleasure in proportion to the hours that you spent earning it she too is reluctant to order anyone to start new spreadsheets she does note however that you probably wont achieve zen mastery with just two breaths or forgiveness and enlightenment by taking communion once in a while rigor is the tiller on your boat she said enough is enough once you have a baseline on spending and quantity the qualitative work begins manisha thakor director of wealth strategies for women at the financial advisory firm buckingham speaks often on the topic of defining enough and laments all the noise that gets in the way of getting it right first there is nonreality television where every policewoman nurse and paralegal live much larger than their professional station in life would suggest is possible all these humid east coast cities and theyre clearly getting a blowout before every shift she said switch from television to a smaller screen and you are confronted with curated social media profiles where everyone is editing themselves combine that with the ever present pressure to maintain a prominent personal brand and its no wonder that so many people think that the right definition of enough is just a little bit more it just creates this feeling of lack ms thakor said she said that one good place to start is the most elementary of benchmarks she is often surprised for instance by how few people have heard of the basic one that elizabeth warren suggested years ago when she was still a professor spend percent on needs percent on wants and percent on savings not everyone will be able to meet those targets especially if they live in a high cost area if their income is irregular or if temporary job loss or illness interrupts their earning but at least those percentages give people something to shoot for or revise from when attempting to define enough savings and discretionary spending in their own lives enough for children embedded in now senator warrens definition is the concept of wants and needs something that is well worth defining and discussing with any children in your life from their earliest possible age john bogle vanguards founder learned this early and by necessity when his family fell on hard times an experience he describes in his book enough in an interview this week he described the advantage of having to stand up for yourself financially and help your family get along i worked from the age of when my friends were out playing tennis and it never bothered me one damn bit he said his own children worked too even though it was no longer financially necessary they were all trying to get high sales of the day at the county seat he recalled in his book he laments that so many children growing up in an affluent world dont get enough opportunities to build character to fail and contemplate and pick themselves up again giving children an allowance to budget and practice with can help get them started how much is enough pocket money just enough so that they have the things they need and some of what they want but not so much that they do not have to make hard choices tradeoffs are what we adults do each day after all and all parents are ultimately in the adult making business
when isaac avila stopped sending his mother birthday and christmas cards his family knew something was wrong his sister guadalupe avila and her large family tried unsuccessfully to find their brother especially in when their father died and in when a brother passed away so the family was stunned when after years mr avila found them via a second video posted by miracle messages an organization that aims to reconnect homeless people with their loved ones i hope to see you all pretty soon i wish i could get a hold of you in a better way but this is going to be the fastest way and i hope you all have a computer mr avila said in his video i miss you all very much my heart is missing you big time within days of posting the video on youtube earlier this year miracle messages had shown mr avilas message to his family and begun setting in place a reunion today mr avila is living with his year old mother helping to take care of her in his childhood home in texas mr avilas reunion is one of more than two dozen miracle messages has successfully engineered as families around the country gather for thanksgiving many are missing a relative according to the department of housing and urban development more than americans are homeless and in many cases they have lost touch with their families the goal of miracle messages is to help percent of the worlds estimated million homeless people reunite with loved ones by said its founder and chief executive kevin f adler he said he started the organization almost two years ago in honor of his uncle mark who lived on and off the streets for years this is an effort to humanize a homeless person and reconnect them with their families mr adler said even if you are homeless you are a complete being as you are mr adler said he found that through social media it was relatively easy to find a homeless persons family one of the first videos he recorded on christmas eve was of a homeless man named jeffrey gottshall who was living on the streets of san francisco he posted it to a facebook group in the small town in pennsylvania where mr gottshall was from and within minutes someone had tagged his sister ninety percent of the messages weve been able to deliver have been received positively and in about percent of the reunions the homeless person has stable housing or is living with family mr adler said in some cases the family does not want to be in contact for whatever reason and we have to respect their wishes but in those cases we often find friends or other relatives who do want to reach out so far miracle messages has recorded more than videos delivered and reunited families the organization relies on sponsors donations and a crowdfunding campaign to do its work mr adler was also named as one of ted residency program residents this fall to help miracle messages grow some reunions are happy ones like the avila familys in a telephone interview mr avila recounted the day he made the video as he got food from a local homeless outreach group in miami he heard an announcement that miracle messages would be recording videos of anyone who wanted to send loved ones a message mr avila stepped forward it was time for me to contact my family he said he spoke of bouncing from printing press jobs at several newspapers in texas before going to miami to find work he said that for a few years in the he worked in the printing press shop for the miami herald but he said he had a mental breakdown and walked away one day during the time he was lost to his family mr avila lived on and off the streets found some work at local outreach centers and suffered a heart attack now he is thrilled to be home with his large family but not every reunion has a happy ending jeffrey gottshall is still waiting for his mr gottshalls second video taken on the streets of san francisco where he still lives plunged his family in pennsylvania into a spotlight many members did not welcome his younger sister jennifer gottshall gavitt stepped forward to embrace her brother the best way to describe my family is old school mrs gottshall gavitt said in a telephone interview you dont even cry at funerals because thats making a public spectacle so when the video was made public it was like the sky had fallen for some members of my family when her family saw mr gottshalls message it was the first time in years they had been in contact with him although mrs gottshall gavitt and her husband had tried to find him she went to san francisco to see her brother and with mr adlers help was able to reunite and talk to him she says her brother suffers from mental health issues she is trying to help him get the help he needs but says he needs to want to help himself for now the best she can do from her pennsylvania home is to have people like mr adler and a police sergeant she met with san franciscos homeless outreach unit keep her updated on how her brother is doing they help mr gottshall call her on occasion so she knows hes o k even if jeffrey doesnt end up with a happy ending other people are getting their happy ending and thats just as important she said no one should be lost in his own way jeffrey has helped find people
jerusalem parts of the port city of haifa in northern israel were ablaze on thursday as wildfires raged through the country for a third day devouring forests damaging homes and prompting the evacuation of tens of thousands of people asked how long haifa was likely to be battling the blazes mayor yona yahav told reporters this is a question that has to be referred to god israeli officials said the fires had been fanned by unusually strong winds and made worse by a dry atmosphere but they also said they suspected that many of them had been caused by arson and negligence dozens of people have been slightly affected by smoke inhalation but no serious injuries or fatalities have been reported gilad erdan israels public security minister told army radio that the professional assessment was that almost half the fires were the result of arson prime minister benjamin netanyahu attributed the fires to natural and unnatural causes and said that any fire caused by arson or incitement to arson is terrorism in every sense of the word and we will treat it as such arab leaders in israel protested the widespread allegations that palestinian nationalists were behind many of the fires saying their land was burning too and they condemned what they viewed as unfair accusations against israels arab citizens who make up about a fifth of the population ahmad tibi a veteran arab lawmaker in the israeli parliament wrote on twitter i called yona yahav our homes are open to the evacuees sad and painful lets join hands to overcome the fire and lets also douse the flames of incitement mr netanyahu spoke on thursday with president vladimir v putin of russia who promised to send two huge firefighting aircraft firefighting planes and teams from cyprus and greece had already arrived and the israeli police and foreign ministry said that more help was on the way from croatia italy and turkey the palestinian authority also sent some fire engines to tackle the fires the israeli emergency services are more prepared and better equipped than they were in when a fierce fire raged through the carmel forest area near haifa more than people most of them officer cadets from the prison service were killed in that blaze when their bus was engulfed in flames as they were on their way to evacuate a prison that episode counted as israels worst natural disaster the government of mr netanyahu who assumed office in was accused of being woefully unprepared it was the first time that israel which often provides doctors and aid workers for disasters abroad had to rely on international help israel has since added firefighting planes but they do not have the capacity of larger aircraft like those that russia was expected to send nor can they operate at night the police and emergency services have been going door to door evacuating homes schools two prisons neighborhoods and in some cases whole communities noy parati a student at the israel institute of technology in haifa described scenes of panic with people pushing one another out of the way to evacuate as soon as they tell me where to go i will leave ms parati told israeli television adding everyone is trying to escape yael hamer a resident of the romema neighborhood of haifa said people were leaving on foot and by car my house was filled with smoke she told reporters by phone from her car with the sirens of fire engines and

fire began in the forest surrounding neve shalom known in arabic as wahat al salam or oasis of peace a small cooperative community about halfway between tel aviv and jerusalem where israeli jews and arabs live together despite the suspicion of arson in many cases the israeli authorities were cautious in assigning blame but some israeli news organizations were labeling the wave of fires an arson intifada alluding to a palestinian uprising mr erdan the public security minister noted that jewish extremists had been charged with arson attacks in the past including one last year in the west bank village of duma that killed a palestinian toddler and his parents mr erdan has instructed the police to focus efforts on locating incitement to arson on social networks by thursday night mr erdan said

the first part of lion garth daviss unabashedly tear jerking movie about a remarkable real world incident has some of the scary wondrous feeling of a fairy tale the audience is invited to imagine a long ago time to be precise before social media or smartphones or google in those days a person could get lost which is just what happens to a little boy named saroo who accidentally travels more than miles from his home in central india to the streets of calcutta saroos mother is a laborer in a poor village he and his beloved older brother guddu supplement her meager wages with whatever casual work they can find in the first scene they are scavenging lumps of coal to exchange for milk at the market later saroo follows guddu to a railroad station where the younger boy accidentally boards an out of service train that takes him to a city full of strangers who speak a different language with minimal dialogue and graceful editing mr davis and the screenwriter luke davies convey the dickensian dimensions of saroos situation he is small and vulnerable but also smart and resourceful and even as he is exposed to horrifying cruelty he is also a hero on an adventure the enormous pain of his loss is sometimes mitigated by the excitement of discovery you fear for him and also root for him and mostly you are captivated by his story and the sophisticated simplicity of its telling what happens in the second part of the movie is a little more complicated saroo has grown to manhood as the adopted son of an australian couple john and sue brierley he has a brother mantosh who was also adopted from india and has mental health and substance abuse problems despite that saroo seems to be living in the happily ever after stage of the fairy tale he moves to melbourne to study hotel management and falls in love with a fellow student lucy from america but memories of his long ago life haunt him and the arrival of new technology raises the tantalizing possibility of a return to his first home using google earth saroo sets out to retrace on the computer screen and on sheets of paper tacked to his bedroom wall his accidental journey its not a fast or easy process and the effort takes an emotional toll on him on his parents and on lucy but you know even if youre not familiar with the true story behind lion that the fairy tale will come true mr davis with strong assistance from a cast of dignified charismatic criers and the music of hauschka and dustin ohalloran floods the viewer with big feelings if you have ever been a child raised a child lost a child or met a child or a mother this movie will wreck you as a purely emotional experience it succeeds without feeling too manipulative or maudlin i mean it is manipulative and maudlin but in a way that seems fair and transparent still it isnt quite satisfying the transition from the young to the grown up saroo demands a shift in tone and genre that lion doesnt quite achieve what felt in the first part like wonderful spielbergian simplicity feels in the latter sections like simplification there isnt enough of the rough texture of family life or the complications of young love to give the older saroo a full identity the movie hovers on the edge of going deeper into his psychological predicament but holds itself back at the end the focus shifts from the agonies of saroo to the glories of google i cant complain too much about that for all i know google brought you to this review but i also cant help feeling a dystopian chill amid all the warm dont be evil fuzzies a hint of corporate propaganda behind the fable it is indeed remarkable how small the world has become how many problems data can solve how connected we all are to one another but weve lost something too and we cant even see what it is
in forbes dropped j k rowling after eight years on its authoritative billionaires list saying high british taxes and large charitable contributions had eroded her fortune forbes may want to rethink that last weekend fantastic beasts and where to find them the first of a new multifilm franchise with a script by ms rowling opened in the united states to a strong million weekend hugely popular wizarding world of harry potter attractions have opened at universal studio theme parks in orlando fla hollywood and osaka japan as well as a potter attraction at warner bros studio tour london the two part drama harry potter and the cursed child is a smash hit in london and is scheduled to open on broadway in a book based on the play was an instant no best seller warner bros recently licensed the television rights to the harry potter films to nbcuniversal for as much as million any estimate of ms rowlings fortune is at best informed speculation and most previous attempts ive seen dont seem very informed ms rowling is famously private especially about her financial and business affairs she denied being a billionaire after forbes first anointed her telling the television interviewer katie couric in that ive got plenty of money more money than i ever dreamed i would have but i am not a billionaire she has remained publicly silent on the subject since so i set out this week to assess the size and scope of her fortune not to invade her privacy but because shes that all too rare commodity in the ranks of the ultrawealthy a role model not only has she made her fortune largely through her own wits and imagination but she also pays taxes and gives generously to charity at a time of bitter disputes over rising income inequality no one seems to resent ms rowlings runaway success its an impressive story said steven n kaplan a professor at the university of chicago booth school of business and an author of its the market the broad based rise in the return to top talent a study of wealth generation in the digital age she struggled as a single mother he said then she created this amazing franchise she had tremendous talent and shes reaping the rewards people dont mind that what they resent is when chief executives get paid for failure ms rowling has also been backed by some high powered negotiating and marketing muscle scholastic which published the potter books warner bros the studio behind the potter films and now the fantastic beasts franchise and nbcuniversal which opened the wizarding world attractions at its theme parks neil blair a former warner bros executive has represented her and fiercely protected her interests since he founded the blair partnership a literary agency in with ms rowling as his most prominent client mr blair did not respond to requests for comment along with other famous authors entertainers and sports stars ms rowling has also benefited from globalization and technology advances the same forces that have squeezed the working class thirty and years ago entertainers and sports figures didnt have that kind of money professor kaplan said thanks to globalization the internet and social media they can reach a much bigger market today he said a close look at ms rowlings sources of income suggests that shes worth more than billion even allowing for a large margin of error i came up with the estimates by interviewing a range of publishing and entertainment executives and agents some of them have negotiated with ms rowlings representatives and knew what terms they were seeking no one was willing to be identified because pretty much everyone hopes to do business with ms rowling shes a sacred cow one executive said to start with the obvious theres the source of her wealth the seven harry potter books have sold an estimated million copies with estimated total revenue of billion at a standard percent authors royalty she would have earned billion these books continue to sell strongly years after they were first published ms rowling has presumably been able to negotiate better deals for her subsequent books which include adult mysteries under the pseudonym robert galbraith published by a little brown imprint as well as numerous potter spinoffs these works probably contributed at least another million ms rowlings deal with warner bros is a closely guarded secret but it has been reported that she sold the film rights to the first four potter films for just million nearly all such deals though also include a percentage of the net profits which were substantial the first four films grossed close to billion and generated an estimated billion in profit if she managed to achieve a percent net profit participation thats million the next four potter films were far more lucrative generating well over billion in revenue by then she was one of the rare talents who probably had negotiated a deal providing her a percentage of a films gross revenue at percent thats another million she almost certainly according to the people i spoke with managed a similar deal for the fantastic beasts series even if the first film generates just million in revenue less than half the highest grossing potter films that adds another million to her fortune bringing the film total to million warner negotiated ms rowlings theme park deals on her behalf that deal with nbcuniversal is also secret but she is one of the unusual examples of someone who is also a consultant and gets a percentage of the gate she also received a one time licensing fee estimated at million to million and annual development fees like mr spielberg ms rowling also gets a percentage of gross sales of merchandise food and beverages nbcuniversal does not break out revenue from the wizarding world attractions but attendance has more than doubled since the first harry potter attraction opened in last year nbcuniversals parent comcast said overall theme park revenue jumped

after months of wrangling with reporters and in court over the disclosure of emails the administration of mayor bill de blasio on wednesday released a third batch of its correspondence with outside advisers that it has designated as agents of the city the emails released in response to a freedom of information law request totaled more than pages and date to the first days of mr de blasios tenure in early through april they reveal a city hall in regular contact with public relations firms over the minutia of press strategy whether to remove a fence to make a better backdrop for an event in harlem a lengthy discussion of how to discredit rival cities in a bid to host the democratic national convention in brooklyn whether to solicit a politician to speak with a reporter a little worried that he will unintentionally go off message jonathan rosen a principal at the public relations firm berlinrosen said in a february email of sheldon silver the democratic speaker of the new york state assembly at the time he is somewhat constitutionally unable not to screw up that kind of thing but not present except in brief snippets is the voice of mr de blasio a democrat his emails often marked simply as b are largely redacted so too are some from his closest outside advisers who city lawyers have said are city agents a group that includes mr rosen bill hyers and nicholas baldick of hilltop public solutions a political consulting firm john del cecato a speechwriter at akpd message and media and patrick gaspard the united states ambassador to south africa and a longtime friend of mr de blasio the city argues in court and in its response to freedom of information requests that the designation also applies to dozens of others who work for their firms correspondence is at the heart of a fight between reporters and the de blasio administration which maintains that the emails with outside advisers are in effect the same as those within a city agency and are therefore exempt from public disclosure under the states freedom of information law a court case begun by the new york post and seeking to unveil those emails is pending government watchdog groups have raised concerns that the advisers act as a shadow government and present concerns about conflicts of interest because they also represent companies that do business with the city the release on wednesday was the third disclosure by city hall in connection with the emails previous releases have contained emails to city officials from the advisers on behalf of their clients weve carefully re reviewed all of the documents and have expanded our disclosure to make sure that we havent missed anything eric f phillips the mayors press secretary said in an email mr phillips said that the redactions were determined by the citys law department and covered only those portions of the emails containing private information like cellphone numbers or email addresses or inter intra agency deliberative content a category that includes deliberative commentary on news articles while the emails do not provide new information related to the state and federal investigations into mr de blasios fund raising they shed light on the details of assembling favorable commentary from those who are aligned with the mayors causes or have donated money to him one email contained a list of hundreds of official validators people who could be counted on for a good quote heres who i am shooting for ross offinger a fund raiser for the mayor wrote on january about providing a list of prominent real estate and business leaders the list included donors and bundlers for mr de blasio whom the mayor was going to contact in connection with the his universal prekindergarten program the email went to the first deputy mayor anthony e shorris two top aides and mr rosen can we take this off official thread please one of the aides peter ragone replied mr ragone mr rosen and mr del cecato declined to comment on the emails other advisers could not immediately be reached for comment on wednesday night
hillary clintons lead in the popular vote is growing she is roughly votes behind donald j trump in the key swing states of michigan and wisconsin a combined gap that is narrowing her impassioned supporters are now urging her to challenge the results in those two states and pennsylvania grasping at the last straws to reverse mr trumps decisive majority in the electoral college in recent days they have seized on a report by a respected computer scientist and other experts suggesting that michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin the keys to mr trumps electoral college victory need to manually review paper ballots to assure the election was not hacked were this years deviations from pre election polls the results of a cyberattack j alex halderman a computer science professor at the university of michigan who has studied the vulnerabilities of election systems at length wrote on medium on wednesday as the calls based on his conclusions mounted probably not more likely he wrote pre election polls were systematically wrong but the only way to resolve the lingering questions would be to examine paper ballots and voting equipment in critical states he wrote tellingly the pleas for recounts have gained no support from the clinton campaign which has concluded along with outside experts that it is highly unlikely the outcome would change even after an expensive and time consuming review of ballots but that has not quieted mrs clintons supporters who see the inequity of her growing lead in the national popular vote which is now more than two million votes or percent of all ballots cast according to the nonpartisan cook political report which regularly updates its count as states continue to tally and to certify votes since there is currently no effort to review the paper ballots which exist in michigan and wisconsin but only in parts of pennsylvania conspiracy theories about the election may live on for years after united states intelligence agencies accused russia of trying to influence the election by stealing and publishing emails from the democratic national committee and a range of other institutions and prominent individuals the united states went on high alert to determine if there was any attempt to sabotage the vote count so far no one in the obama administration has indicated that there is any such evidence in the three battleground states mrs clinton is behind by percent or less and the final results have not yet been certified uniting around the social media hashtag auditthevote the campaign after the campaign has picked up momentum among grass roots activists still mourning mr trumps victory and who echo paradoxically his pre election complaint that the vote was rigged based on the information of the intelligence community that russia was actively trying to screw around with our election i thought why not take the time and question this said michelle zuckerman parker an engineer in pittsburgh who on wednesday planned to petition her county election board for a recount of the nov vote that view spread quickly on social media on tuesday evening when new york magazine published an article about professor halderman and others who had contacted the remnants of the clinton campaign it also generated pushback by experts who said that even though it was theoretically possible to hack voting machines it would be enormously difficult because it would have to be highly targeted in key precincts and conducted on a scale required to assure mr trumps victory left wing conspiracy theories of vote rigging are pathetic dave wasserman of the cook political report said on twitter time may have already run out pennsylvania allows individual voters to petition for a recount but the deadline was sunday said wanda murren a spokeswoman for the pennsylvania department of state a candidate can also contest an election in court and the deadline is monday michigan and wisconsin have not reached their deadlines for seeking a recount but they will in days so far mrs clinton has not requested any action said reid magney a spokesman for the wisconsin elections commission until the publication of professor haldermans work clinton supporters had few reasons to hope he did not offer them much he noted that while the voting machines used in those states are not connected to the internet during the election they are programmed before the election the data is usually transferred on a usb stick or other data card if attackers can modify that software by infecting the machines with malware they can cause the machines to give any answer whatsoever professor halderman wrote the problem as bruce schneier a security expert who has written often on the issue noted in an interview is that the usual triggers for a recount a very close margin between two candidates make little sense in a world of state sponsored computer hackings a truly sophisticated hacking would result in a wider margin of victory that would not set off an automatic recount mrs clinton would have to triumph in all three states to win the electoral college the electors will meet in december to formally choose the president and there mr trump is ahead by votes to mrs clintons with michigan still officially uncalled as of wednesday mr trumps lead in michigan had shrunk to votes or percent according to the national popular vote tracker maintained by the cook political report mr trumps lead in wisconsin has narrowed to votes or percent in pennsylvania his lead slightly grew on wednesday to or percent the clinton campaign did not respond to requests for comment other democrats said it was time to move on im not sure its possible to undo the results and all the people are focusing their energy on opposing the worst ideas of this administration at this point not the legitimacy of the results said daniel doubet an organizer for keystone progress a liberal group in pennsylvania those pushing for a recount say they are trying to pick up the fight for a tired

manila thomas dooley has bad memories of the world cup he was a player with the united states back then when the team lost all three of its games in france after the tournament fifa ranked the participants it put the americans last we had no team spirit no positive team energy nothing dooley said after the coach announced the roster we got the bonus and then there was just selfishness the players didnt listen anymore they were against each other the coach lived in a different hotel everything was negative i didnt want to be a part of it and i wanted to go home dooley has little time to follow u s soccers activities these days not even the departure of jurgen klinsmann who briefly brought dooley back into the national team fold in to help him coach his first match a friendly against mexico dooley has his own leadership concerns now as head coach of the philippines national team he is busy trying to prevent another first round exit the event in question is the suzuki cup southeast asias biennial championship and a big deal especially as no team from the region has been to the world cup since when indonesia participated as the dutch east indies with points from its first two games against singapore and indonesia the philippines has to defeat thailand the defending champion on friday to be assured of a place in the semifinals dooley who won the bundesliga title with kaiserslautern in wants the win the semifinal berth and the trophy that could help bring an even bigger prize an opportunity to help soccer compete with basketball in the philippines a sprawling archipelago that is home to more than million people and was a united states colony from to next door to the quezon city hotel where the philippine team is staying this week is the araneta coliseum which in hosted the thrilla in manila in which muhammad ali defeated joe frazier these days it plays host to basketball and on the biggest nights more than pack inside to watch the games the equivalent showdowns in the countrys national soccer league regularly struggle to attract four figure crowds basketball is still king here the n b a opened an office in april and there are three official n b a stores in the country the big european soccer clubs that visit singapore kuala lumpur shanghai and bangkok on their summer tours do not make it to manila in the lobby of the official hotel here even the branded suzuki cup television in the corner is showing womens basketball from the united states we are not a soccer country simple as that said cedelf tupas a sports reporter for the philippine daily inquirer it is easy to play basketball in manila while he praised the rising standards in the soccer league he said people dont watch it is not promoted events like the suzuki cup may help but that depends on how dooleys team performs after a disastrous record from to a period in which they lost of games the azkals as the philippine team is known have reached the semifinals on the last three occasions this time it wants to play in the final every win is another log on the fire said dooley who was hired in february after the father of a boy he was coaching in california alerted the philippines football federation to his availability although it doesnt help that much there are so many things we need the organizational things in the nearly three years since dooley took the job there have been improvements now we have nice bags the backpacks he said at the airport everyone looks the same with the uniforms we used to look like a bunch of tourists but there is still something missing we should be on the billboards here dooley said the people need heroes they had them at the suzuki cup in which the team thrilled the nation by defeating the defending champion vietnam in front of stunned fans in hanoi it was the first time soccer made the front page of a major philippines newspaper tupas said it was unexpected at home too with no stadium in the country ready or equipped to host the home leg of the philippines semifinal against indonesia as a result both matches were played in jakarta with a combined attendance of even in defeat the reception and the news media attention back home were unlike anything the team had ever known but the passion has disappeared on saturday fewer than fans braved manilas chaotic traffic to head north to bacoue for the opening game a scoreless tie against singapore considerably fewer turned up for tuesdays tie with indonesia i dont know what happened the teams star midfielder stephan schrock said as he stretched by the pool i have no idea where the passion has gone it was here in but now it is not not in manila anyway i think there is more in the provinces schrock who was born in germany and is a former player with the bundesliga club eintracht frankfurt is one of the so called fil foreigns players born and raised overseas usually in europe but eligible to represent the philippines because they have one filipino parent the foreign born players have helped raise standards for the national team and results have been improving the team is ranked in the world by fifa the highest in the region but until last year the philippines had won only one world cup qualifier against sri lanka before the cup in brazil on the road to russia for however the azkals have already defeated two established asian powers north korea and bahrain there is still much to do however on and off the field dooley the son of an american serviceman moved to the united states in before major league soccer was born but

seattle a federal judge on wednesday ordered striking airline cargo pilots who transport packages for amazon and other customers to immediately resume work about pilots for the carrier abx air went on strike on tuesday accusing their employer of forcing them to work an excessive number of flight assignments in violation of their contract the strike threatened to hold up shipments of amazon orders though the internet retailer said it had avoided delays so far in a hearing wednesday evening in cincinnati federal district court judge timothy s black granted abx air a temporary restraining order blocking the strike according to representatives of the company and pilots union the airline professionals association teamsters local the union representing the pilots started the strike because of what it called significant understaffing problems at abx air which has demanded that pilots fly emergency flights to meet the demands of its cargo customers disrupting the pilots schedules the pilots were picketing outside abx headquarters in wilmington ohio and cincinnati northern kentucky international airport where dhl one of abxs big customers has its north american hub in a statement the union said its pilots would return to work but called on abx to address the staffing shortages that prompted the strike abx airs failure to address the staffing crisis hurts our families and compromises our ability to do our jobs and meet the needs of amazon dhl and other customers said rick ziebarth an abx pilot and a representative of the pilots union amazon has significantly expanded the number of jets it leases from carriers like abx over the last year to meet soaring demand from customers for speedy shipment of their orders this year amazon and the air transport services group the parent company of abx announced that amazon was leasing boeing freighter aircraft to ensure that the retailer had enough capacity to ship one and two day deliveries for customers as part of their agreement the carrier granted amazon warrants to buy just under percent of its stock over a five year period amazon suggested that so far the strike had not affected its customers we rebalanced capacity across our diverse network of carrier partners and these adjustments ensure there are no disruptions through the busy holiday weekend kelly cheeseman an amazon spokeswoman said abx said it expected flights to resume immediately i am pleased that the court continues to recognize the value to all parties from continuing to work out remaining differences in negotiations and through arbitration john starkovich president of abx air said in a statement amazon has gone to great lengths to discourage employees in its warehouses across the country from forming unions arguing that they would interfere with the companys ability to innovate inside the facilities but the strike by the pilots shows how some segments of its logistics network could still be affected by organized labor in a phone interview before the judges ruling mr ziebarth the abx pilot and union representative said that the scheduling demands of his employer had caused considerable strain among pilots which could become worse as the carrier and its customers head into the peak holiday shopping season i cant tell you how many birthdays family events anniversaries and even funerals our pilots have had to miss because of all these emergency flights he said
if the supposed war on christmas is still being waged youd never know it from the television listings for the next few weeks christmas which conservative critics have complained has been marginalized in our cross cultural age is everywhere this season often right in the titles of specials and made for tv movies and one of the first examples comes friday night on that most libertine of cable outlets hbo its once upon a sesame street christmas a music dotted fable in the tradition of christmas eve on sesame street elmo saves christmas and assorted other holiday offerings featuring the furry gang the sesame street franchise moved to hbo early this year and it shows in the casting of the new special the guest stars include zosia mamet of the hbo series girls the show pleasant and witty contains obligatory references to hanukkah and kwanzaa but the story is decidedly about christmas or more correctly about the dark time in sesame streets past when christmas was not celebrated decorations were not hung and santa did not bother stopping that might sound as if it were some kind of metaphor for the very war on christmas world those aforementioned critics have trumpeted but really its just a bedtime story being told to elmo by his father the tale results in a flashback to a dickensian looking period when sesame street was known as the unfriendliest street in town and ancestors of all the current gang spent their days crabbing at one another a forebear of elmos is a new arrival on the street and he sets about changing the prevailing mind set introducing concepts like generosity and good will elmo and hbo are actually a bit slow to board the christmas bandwagon the hallmark channel began its annual countdown to christmas weeks ago it has already debuted original movies that include every christmas has a story christmas cookies and my christmas dream while its companion channel hallmark movies mysteries has introduced finding father christmas and operation christmas still to come to name just the most imminent hallmark channel films christmas in homestead christmas list a heavenly christmas and journey back to christmas lifetime is almost as fond of christmas titles as in all i want for christmas and a christmas wedding date the up tv programming stunt we get christmas which like hallmarks countdown to christmas began a few weeks ago includes the world premiere movies a puppy for christmas falling for christmas the rooftop christmas tree and girlfriends of christmas past as that last title suggests somehow the christmas story has been invaded by singles seeking to fill a romantic or other void in their lives on saturday tv ones monthlong tv winter onederland has the christmas swap which the channel describes as the story of a down on his luck single father who questions his decision to give up his dreams to take care of his ailing mother on the same channel on dec merry ex mas about a mild mannered single mother who sets out to foil her ex husbands remarriage most of this fare strays quite far from the actual christmas story the one in the christian bible dolly parton at least is not afraid to put a little faith back into the equation with dolly partons christmas of many colors circle of love nov on nbc like dolly partons coat of many colors last year it is inspired by her own childhood and its short on subtlety but at least it doesnt shy away from the sacred side of christmas the best of the religious themed christmas shows is a little harder to find and doesnt blare its seasonal intentions in the title its winter thaw thanksgiving night on byutv its a quiet beautifully acted adaptation of a leo tolstoy story where love is god is with john rhys davies as a gnarled embittered cobbler who learns that he holds within himself the key to breaking out of his misery so is there still a war on christmas there certainly is in supermansion war on christmas a hilarious special episode of crackles animated supermansion show that is the polar opposite of the dignified story of the cobbler the series is about an assortment of inept superheroes and in the christmas special which begins streaming dec they have to band together to save christmas from a psychotic doll the plot is too bizarre for further description suffice it to say that if you like your holiday fare demented and fearless rather than subdued this ones for you
donald j trump sat down on tuesday with reporters editors and columnists of the new york times for an exclusive interview times reporters have annotated portions of the interview the full transcript is available here the personal interactions between president obama and mr trump have so far been pleasant but its not clear that the kumbaya moment will last mr obama has already indicated that he may weigh in against mr trump once the new administration takes over especially if the new president attacks mr obamas legacy achievements here is our story on the cordial minute meeting between mr trump and mr obama in the oval office mr trump is working to reset his mercurial relationship with the media as he looks toward assuming office starting with this meeting at what he branded the failing new york times during his presidential campaign but he still nurses intense grievances toward news outlets in general and the times in particular here is more about mr trumps relationships with the news media and the times mr trump is hinting that even though federal law does not require him to do anything specific to separate himself from his vast business empire he is inclined to submit to some sort of voluntary standard of ethics that would avoid conflicts of interest or their appearance but he leaves open the possibility that there may not be a way to accomplish it this story has more about mr trumps business ties mr trump is correct that federal law for the most part exempts the president from conflict of interest rules meaning he is allowed to take actions that could benefit his financial holdings but in modern times most presidents have voluntarily put their financial assets into blind trusts mr trump has said he does not intend to take such a step instead will turn his companies over to his children read this story for more on mr trumps potential conflicts of interest the wall street journal editorial board among others has suggested that the only solution to mr trumps potential conflicts of interest is to sell off all of his assets and then have a blind trust reinvest the proceeds mr trump suggests that this is not practical mr trumps crowds at rallies frequently targeted hillary clinton chanting lock her up and referring to her as a criminal in july mr trump himself encouraged a crowd in colorado telling them im starting to agree with you as they chanted lock her up in addition despite mr trumps remarks here the f b i and the justice department which have investigated mrs clintons email server and the clinton foundation conduct criminal inquiries largely independently of the white house a president attempting to intervene in those kinds of inquiries in any direction would be a major scandal here is our full story about mr trumps reversal on prosecuting mrs clinton mr trump has been criticized for not specifically denouncing bigotry and groups that spread bigoted views his statements about such conduct tend to be vague including here when he says i disavow the group that nonspecific language has been comforting to leaders of the alt right a rebranded white nationalist movement including richard b spencer who led a gathering at a federal building near the white house last weekend that included some audience members offering a nazi salute mr trump here acknowledges perhaps for the first time that being president will perhaps help enrich his family he also concedes that the arrangement might fairly be called a conflict of interest back in february when he was still a candidate mr trump said definitively that torture was effective dont tell me it doesnt work torture works he told an audience in south carolina o k folks torture you know half these guys torture doesnt work believe me it works o k so mr trumps answer on tuesday offered a revealing insight into his willingness to shift or rethink a position especially after talking with someone he respects gen james n mattis may well be mr trumps secretary of defense and his rejection of torture clearly had an effect on the president elect the reality is more complicated the number of factories and the number of americans who work in factories both have declined sharply in recent decades but the nations manufacturing output is at the highest level in history the labor intensive production of low value goods like socks has been replaced by the largely automated production of high value goods like circuits in president ronald reagan signed a landmark law that prohibited the hiring of illegal immigrants provided new resources for enforcement along the mexican border and offered legal status to several million illegal immigrants experts say the law did little to slow migration to the united states but made crossing the border more difficult and dangerous premiums for many health plans under the affordable care act are increasing percent to percent or more but increases of percent are extremely rare deductibles for many plans are high but not for a family plan in the maximum out of pocket cost including the deductible is mr trumps comments about his fellow republicans had a sharp edge and an implicit message they owe their congressional majority to him and he expects to be treated accordingly whether this is true and to what extent will be one of the pivotal stories of the new trump administration and crucial to figuring out how much or how little he can get done he needs congress to achieve many of the campaign promises he made including the deep tax cut and large infrastructure spending package not to mention and it is an open question how in love with his policies republicans will prove to be read these stories for background on mr trumps relationships with republican leaders in congress and the never trump stalwarts who are pondering the future of the conservative movement mr trump suggests here that he may name jared kushner his son
in a dutch woman named christiane van maarsen took out a notebook from her childhood she tore out a page with an eight line poem that her little sisters best friend had written decades earlier the friends condescending tone had long rubbed her the wrong way the friend was anne frank the opening lines of the poem written in a poezie album or friendship book sought to motivate christiane whom anne regarded as somewhat idle they are traditional lines of encouragement that might have come from a dutch periodical the closing verses which may be annes own say if others have reproached you for what you have done wrong then be sure to amend your mistake that is the best answer one can make ms van maarsen who died in gave the poem to her sister jacqueline annes best friend for safekeeping and she kept it for decades on wednesday the autographed poem fetched about at an auction in the dutch city of haarlem a price that reflected the profound resonance anne frank continues to have in global popular culture seven decades after she perished in the holocaust addressed to dear cri cri the poem is signed by anne and dated march nearly four months before her family went into hiding in an annex of rooms above the amsterdam office of her father otto frank it was there that she wrote her famous diary which was published in and transformed her into an emblem of lost innocence in a phone interview from amsterdam on wednesday jacqueline van maarsen said that she had decided to part with the poem in part because her sister had spurned it she stressed however that she treasured the notes and verse that anne had written to her my sister didnt really like the poem very much because anne was very critical of her because she left school early whereas anne was busy all the time she said she gave it to me because she knew i was collecting annes things i would never sell the verse that anne addressed to me but as my sister was not attached to hers i decided to sell it thys blankevoort co director of bubb kuyper the auction house that sold the poem said the price was nearly five times the minimum price of he said the successful bidder wished to remain anonymous mr blankevoort said that autographed works by anne frank were extremely rare and that only four or five had been discovered in the past four decades he said the auction had generated strong interest including inquiries from as far away as fiji and japan the bid was much higher than i expected and shows anne franks cultural importance and also the emotional attachment to who she was and what she represents he said any item by anne frank is very important as there is not much left when the nazis broke down doors they put everything on the street where it could be destroyed by the rain or stolen after two years of hiding from the nazis in the annex the frank family was discovered in august and deported everyone died except for mr frank anne died of typhus at the bergen belsen concentration camp in germany in the first few months of she was her diary of a young girl has been translated into languages and has sold million copies mr blankevoort noted that the friendship books that circulated in the netherlands in the were the social media of their time and that the sentiments expressed by anne to christiane were particularly notable because they were written before anne was confined emotionally and physically by the attic walls that would soon curtail her activities in our mind she is the girl who never left the attic he said but here she is free with her spirit free in the spring a massachusetts museum paid for a copy of grimms fairy tales in which anne had inscribed her name and the name of her sister margot in another short piece of verse written in a friends notebook went on sale at christies the anne frank house the popular four story museum in amsterdam on the prinsengracht canal where the frank family hid during the war decided not to bid on the latest document for sale maatje mostart a spokeswoman for the museum noted that the poem was addressed to the sister of a friend and as such did not shed deep light on annes own story its of course very special that part of an anne frank collection comes out after so many years ms mostart said as we have other original manuscripts directly connected to her life for us this is less important jacqueline van maarsen whose father was jewish survived the nazi occupation because her mother who was born catholic had registered her as a christian the father survived the holocaust but his relatives died she has written a memoir your best friend anne frank which she said was how anne signed a farewell letter to her before she went into hiding ms van maarsen said the two had enjoyed playing monopoly and chatting about hollywood stars she said her friend would have loved the interest around the world that her writing had inspired people say her diary was very well written and i think her work remains powerful so many decades later because of her intelligence and her character she said adding to me she was just my little friend and i miss her very much
donald j trump has said climate change is a hoax created by the chinese to get the united states to suppress its manufacturing sector that prompted a public rebuttal last week from a chinese official attending a climate summit meeting in marrakesh morocco on tuesday mr trump appeared to back away from the strict climate denier viewpoint embraced by many republicans in an interview with the new york times saying that there was some connectivity between human activity and climate change he also said he wanted to keep an open mind about whether to pull the united states out of the paris agreement the main global climate change accord mr trumps opacity means it is unclear whether he will actually support policies to limit the effects of climate change after being sworn in as president in january but officials from china which has surpassed the united states as the worlds largest emitter of greenhouse gas have said they will move forward on climate policies without the americans if it comes to that on tuesday michael r bloomberg the media tycoon and former mayor of new york city said that american cities would continue to enact climate policies no matter what mr trump and the federal government decided to do mr bloomberg made his remarks in washington at a talk hosted by the china general chamber of commerce they were adapted for an op ed article published tuesday by bloomberg view under the headline washington wont have last word on climate change mr bloomberg a longtime advocate for action on climate change praised xie zhenhua chinas climate envoy for saying china remained committed to tackling the issue thats a responsible thing to do for the chinese people and the world he said mr bloomberg added that if mr trump decided to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement then he would urge the mayors of cities in the united states who see the need to fight climate change to join the agreement following is a central passage from mr bloombergs op ed article i cant tell you what donald trumps administration will do and in all fairness they will need time to figure it out themselves whats said on the campaign trail is one thing actually carrying out a specific policy is another i hope theyll recognize the importance of the issue but i am confident that no matter what happens in washington no matter what regulations the next administration adopts or rescinds no matter what laws the next congress may pass we will meet the pledges that the u s made in paris the reason is simple cities businesses and citizens will continue reducing emissions because they have concluded just as china has that doing so is in their own self interest the u s s success in fighting climate change has never been primarily dependent on washington bear in mind over the past decade congress has not passed a single bill that takes direct aim at climate change yet at the same time the u s has led the world in reducing emissions that progress has been driven by cities businesses and citizens and none of them are letting up now just the opposite all are looking for ways to expand their efforts mayors and local leaders around the country are determined to keep pushing ahead on climate change mr bloombergs remarks dovetail with recent ones made by american mayors who say their cities will defy potential policies from mr trump on critical issues among others the mayors of new york chicago seattle philadelphia and washington have said their cities will be immigrant sanctuaries that do not cooperate with united states immigration and customs enforcement in his visit with reporters and editors at the new york times on tuesday mr trump said of the paris agreement im looking at it very closely i have an open mind to it in addressing the climate issue he also said clean air is vitally important mr trump appeared to be confusing the issues of climate change and air pollution carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change do not cause smog it is buildup of particulate matter that leads to toxic air a severe problem in chinese cities greenhouses gases and particulate matter can both come from the same source in many cases industrial coal burning so any policies to limit the use of coal helps with both issues the united states and china have made pledges to curb the use of coal mr bloomberg concluded the op ed article published tuesday with this thought washington will not have the last word on the fate of the paris agreement in the u s mayors will together with business leaders and citizens
is childhood the golden era of friendship and can you get those relationships back the other day i took down from the shelf a beautiful novel by william maxwell so long see you tomorrow and i realized the title alone summons the unspoken bond the constant availability the relentless promise that friendship is when you are my great friend at that age was mark macdonald in those early rain soaked days on scotlands west coast mark was my constant companion and my secret weapon whatever happened at home there would always be mark to brighten the day and spit with style like river phoenix did in stand by me via a rolled up tongue we would be up at the crack of dawn to wander over the fields scan the beaches for coins climb the hills together and sit in the graveyard comparing our plans for world domination mark had crohns disease he was often in hospital and wed write to each other planning our adventures for the summer he told me i was a good writer and i told him he was a great painter before we disappeared from each others lives i havent seen him in years when i recently tried to find mark again he didnt appear to exist like the boys in maxwells novel he seemed like a figment or a fragile piece of memory that crumbles when you turn it in your hands he wasnt to be found at the old address i had for him in the seaside town of saltcoats his name is a popular one on facebook but none of the marks i found was the one i knew and he wasnt on twitter or instagram either none of the search engines reveal anything about mark i tried death certificates fearing as i have for a long time that my old friend might have died i asked my mother if any of her friends had kept in touch with the family but none had i could remember two of his sisters names but they didnt show up on the internet either when i went back to scotland recently i drove to the square where we once lived and i looked up at the window of my old house remembering how i used to shine a torch from there to marks bedroom two flashes meant good night three flashes meant see you tomorrow i wonder if technology has changed the meaning of friendship my daughter is and most things that happen to her are photographed she and her friends get together and spend hours trying out poses making videos retouching them setting them to music and posting them on this or that social media network im sure the girls are bonded in many of the traditional ways but i also wonder if theyll ever lose sight of each other which was always one of the possibilities of friendship an aspect of its mystery i think we always knew we would move on in life and that our great friendships would be a matter of memory i dont have a single photograph of mark macdonald i dont think we were ever photographed together and that adds to the notion that our friendship was a fiction social media is a vehicle of self promotion a means of fixing an idea of yourself in the social sphere without people actually knowing you at all and thats a change the thing about friendship used to be that the ideal was shared entirely by the pair of you or sometimes by a group yet it remained local and that was part of its power its the mindfulness i miss a pair of excellent youngsters in my wider family have over facebook friends between them they say they dont know half of them and that some of them are frenemies the social network gives them the option of corralling people into close friends or acquaintances and naturally they always have the option of clicking unfriend but are the majority of these people friends or are they just names you can know everything thats going on in peoples lives without knowing a single thing going on in their hearts but is that friendship im told that empathy still flowers in the usual way but i have my doubts people now in their have a lot of self advertising talent but are they i wonder close to the point where a bad breakup say or a death in the family isnt a moment of opportunity for the protective and dignifying balms of old friendship but simply a quiet day on social media the times we live in are big on loyalty technology has driven us wild with questions of loyalty to flags to nations to a way of life or to brands who give out loyalty points to those who stay tight but the only kind of loyalty that matters is to know your friends and stick with them the relationship has nothing really to do with outside people or with your self image or with status updates and perhaps our vision of friendship has been degraded by the instantaneous relentless nature of our communications technology replace watch and click with listen and feel close the curtains and mix two drinks download nothing share nothing but lose yourself in the sort of communication that has nothing to sell love gets all the big headlines but friendship is where the action is especially if you consider that it is really a lack of friendship that makes an unhappy marriage fundamentally its the art of friendship that warms you in the various winters of your discontent and when youre in trouble you dont want people but just one friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain the late muhammad ali is thought to have said its not something you learn in school but if you havent learned the meaning of friendship you really havent learned anything and that is why i

istanbul the european parliament is likely to vote on thursday to suspend negotiations to bring turkey into the european union infuriating ankara and possibly hastening the end of a long and troubled process while the vote is advisory rather than binding the government of president recep tayyip erdogan is smarting from european criticism of its crackdown on opponents and on the news media after a failed coup attempt in july so it has suggested that in any event it may pull out of the process altogether if there is no progress by the end of the year such progress now seems improbable mr erdogan has also said that he would approve a restoration of the death penalty which would almost certainly force an end to any talk of turkey joining the bloc since a ban on capital punishment is a condition of membership many policy makers and analysts criticized the european parliaments expected move saying it would only push turkey to harden its position on issues like human rights and the death penalty while endangering cooperation on limiting refugee flows to europe it would be a strategic stupidity of the first order for the e u to unilaterally abandon its relationship with turkey carl bildt a former swedish prime minister said in a twitter post this week nonetheless at a debate in the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday night it was clear that lawmakers from most of the main parties seemed likely to vote on thursday to suspend accession talks mr erdogan did not wait for the formality of the vote to react with bitterness the e u parliament resorting to such a vote means it takes terror organizations under its wings it takes sides with them he said on wednesday addressing an organization of islamic cooperation meeting in istanbul only a few days ago the turkish president according to the hurriyet newspaper threatened to join the shanghai cooperation organization a body that includes china and russia in place of seeking membership of the european union the e u has been delaying us for years how can such a thing happen the paper quoted mr erdogan as saying turkey first expressed interest in joining the union in the although formal accession talks began in the european parliaments vote comes at an awkward time for both the european union and turkey accession talks formally resumed this year in a limited number of areas as part of the deal to limit migration though they could also help unlock an agreement for cyprus one of the longest running disputes in the world but talks in switzerland between greek and turkish cypriot leaders collapsed on tuesday with no date set for resumption the e u finds itself devoid of a flexible response toward turkey and is now contemplating the nuclear option suspension of negotiations said sinan ulgen a turkish scholar at carnegie europe a foreign policy think tank in brussels that he said could threaten the refugee deal that europe has with turkey that deal which was reached last march provides for the union and member states to pay turkey billion euros or about billion for refugee assistance in and and it foresees a further billion in in exchange turkey agreed to help stop the flow of refugees across its border and to take back migrants rejected for asylum in europe turkey hosts an estimated million refugees or other migrants from afghanistan syria and other countries the agreement has been broadly successful in reducing the flow into europe the number of migrants crossing into greece was at about or fewer a day in the last few weeks compared with a day last year so far europe has disbursed million of the promised funds badly needed at a time of economic hardship in turkey the deal was a complex one however it tied returns of migrants to progress on visa free travel to europe for turks as well as resettlement of registered refugees visa free travel was further conditioned on turkey modifying its antiterror legislation but the attempted coup on july led instead to even harsher tactics under extraordinary emergency powers that have seen some people jailed and more than fired from public sector jobs including on tuesday that means the refugee deal could well unravel as there seems little inclination in ankara to liberalize its terrorism legislation or in brussels to grant visa free travel to turks the majority of the society has started not believing in the sincerity of the e u said mustafa yeneroglu head of the turkish parliaments human rights committee and a member of the governing party the justice and development party we have come to a point that the enmity in europe against turks and islam is at a level that it does not seem possible for turkey to become an e u member despite fulfilling all conditions mr ulgen the carnegie europe scholar said that while the probable outcome of the european parliaments vote makes the refugee deal even more tenuous both sides nonetheless have an interest in maintaining it it could lead to unraveling of the deal but does not mean the full deal will collapse because it generates benefits for both sides the possibility that the european parliament would vote for suspension has been opposed by some of the blocs most senior officials i believe the best way to strengthening turkeys democracy the most effective way is by engaging with turkey by keeping channels open said the european unions foreign policy chief federica mogherini if the accession process came to an end i believe we would both find ourselves in a lose lose scenario to formally suspend or cancel accession talks would require a vote by member states the parliament is voting on whether to recommend that they do that but so far only austria has publicly advocated such a measure it seems unlikely that the recommendation will gain much traction ahead of the next european union summit meeting in december nevertheless the parliament seems
if you think back to this years presidential campaign and recall a lot of articles mentioning hillary clintons email troubles and donald j trumps various controversies you wouldnt be wrong if it seems there were fewer articles about jobs the economy and taxes thats because there were the temptation to blame news organizations for this imbalance is strong but there is at least some reason to resist it critics have long assailed campaign coverage as focused too much on candidate personality campaign strategy and assessments of whos winning instead of on policies and ideas but this year the candidates share the blame i compared the content of campaign ads with the content of news articles about two specific topics candidate traits or characteristics and the economy or jobs both the candidates and news organizations spent more time discussing the candidates fitness for office than they did the nations economy and the imbalance grew more lopsided as the election approached using analytic tools provided by crimson hexagon i categorized the campaign news coverage of media outlets this consisted of four broadcast networks three cable news networks national public radio and hugh hewitt on the radio two online news sites and newspapers i specifically searched for news about mrs clintons campaign and her email server or her campaign and wikileaks and several controversies connected to mr trumps campaign i also looked for news about the candidates campaign appeals on the economy and jobs this list isnt exhaustive but it gives a sense of the trade off between coverage of these controversies and the economy the candidates controversies received more coverage on average than their views on the economy from june until election day percent of the stories mentioned mr trumps various missteps and percent mentioned mrs clintons email only percent mentioned mr trump and jobs or the economy and only percent cited mrs clintons campaign and the economy closer to the election from oct on the numbers got even more lopsided this was an important date just after the release of the access hollywood video and a few weeks before f b i director james b comeys letter to congress from this point percent of the campaign articles mentioning either controversies or the economy discuss mrs clintons email while only percent mention her alongside jobs or the economy as for mr trump percent mention his entanglements while percent mention him related to jobs and the economy the imbalance in coverage of the candidates character is striking as is the lack of coverage about the economy compared with the controversies moving one week past the video release between oct and election day roughly half of the stories about scandals and the economy mentioned mrs clintons emails and only a quarter discussed mr trump and his imbroglios a mere percent of the stories in these last three weeks mentioned mrs clinton and the economy these choices have consequences according to the gallup organization americans reports of what they heard or read about mrs clinton between june and september were mainly references to her handling of emails during her time as secretary of state in contrast mentions of mr trump changed week by week tracking what was happening on the campaign trail but before anyone blames the news media its important to examine what the candidates themselves were talking about over the course of the campaign if media reports reflect candidate discourse accurately then it is not merely the media choosing to report on scandals it might be at least as much the candidates choosing to campaign on them that results in unending coverage of traits and characteristics to figure out if this was the case i used data from kantar media cmag on all the candidates campaign ads aired between june and election day i coded all of the appeals in each ad and weighted the appeals by how many times the ads ran on television mrs clinton made more ads than mr trump and she vastly out advertised him running nearly three times as many ads as he did all told over half a million ads were run in during this period the content of the ads is revealing both candidates spent most of their television advertising time attacking the other persons character in fact the losing candidates ads did little else more than three quarters of the appeals in mrs clintons advertisements were about traits characteristics or dispositions only percent of mrs clintons appeals in her ads were about jobs or the economy by contrast percent of mr trumps appeals focused on the economy jobs taxes and trade since the start of presidential campaign television advertising in no campaign has made percent of its television ad appeals about any single topic on average traits typically garner

new delhi in the dense smog that engulfed indias capital early this month a baby named vaishnavi gasped through the night in the concrete room that her father and mother rent for a month they took turns staying up laying a hand on her rib cage feeling it move up and down her coughing fits became so violent that she vomited milk mixed with ropes of sputum three times they thought she would not survive until morning twenty miles away in an elegant high ceilinged house in an elite neighborhood a year old boy named mehtab was also struggling to fill his lungs with air his mother heavily pregnant sat beside him administering corticosteroids through a nebulizer mask once an hour but once an hour wasnt enough mehtabs father fought waves of panic as they waited for the sun to rise the boy looked to him like a fish suffocating in the air for seven days at the beginning of this month a thick cloud settled over this metropolis of million people held in place by a weather system known as an anticyclone the pollution was pulled inward and down trapping the people of this city in concentrations of hazardous micro particles never before recorded here the rich who are buffered from so many of delhis dangers bunkered themselves inside filtering out particles in their own air through expensive high tech purifiers but the nature of air pollution is that it is pervasive researchers in china have found that exposure rates for the rich and the poor are virtually indistinguishable as average daytime levels of pm the most dangerous particles passed micrograms per cubic meter times the concentration the world health organization considers safe the authorities in delhi took the unprecedented step of shutting schools for three days protesters marched in surgical masks carrying posters likening the city to a gas chamber eventually the wind picked up reducing the citys pollution down to its usual atrocious winter level but the air quality in north india will remain dangerous for months as poor people fight the dropping temperature by burning things leaves plastic anything to stay warm there is a clear body of evidence that death rates emergency room visits heart attacks and strokes all rise when particulate concentrations are high recent data from the w h o s global burden of disease project indicates that the number of premature deaths related to air pollution in india has caught up with the number in china and is now surpassing it the worst hit will be the very old who are susceptible to heart disease and stroke and the very young whose lungs are taxed so badly by polluted air that they cannot develop normally children are more vulnerable because they are smaller with shallower breaths and higher heart rates they breathe more air in the very different homes of vaishnavi and mehtab four parents are waiting to see what the rest of this winter will do to their children vaishnavis father ravi who like many in india does not use a last name remembers the day when he woke up and smelled something burning the rubber casing of an electrical wire is burning that was his first thought he splashed his eyes with water to stop the stinging on the ride into central delhi where he sells trinkets on a street corner he passed columns of smoke gray blue wisps from piles of trash and black pillars from fields where farmers were burning the straw left over from their rice harvests scientists had been tracking the progress of a mass of smoke via nasa satellite images as it rose off farmers fields in the nearby states of punjab and haryana and floated across the plains toward the city a two day drift in delhi it merged with emissions from cars coal fired power plants open air burning of trash and dust from construction this year the crop burning emissions happened to arrive on the eve of diwali the hindu festival of lights when smoke from millions of celebratory fireworks typically send concentrations of the harmful pm particles skyrocketing ravi has worked on the same corner since he was a child and his mother worked there before him he had never seen a smog so thick that it obscured the shangri la hotel he knew something was not right he felt dizzy as if he had been sniffing glue what worried him more was his only child vaishnavi just months old whose spasmodic nighttime cough no longer quieted with the arrival of morning he bought her a surgical mask for rupees about cents from a merchant at an intersection but she kept pulling it off on the way home he furiously jumped out of the auto rickshaw and confronted a man burning a pile of trash on the road please dont burn this my daughter is crying he said the man responded with a string of especially dirty abuses the air that week was utterly still meteorologists measured both horizontal and vertical movement at nil madhurbain singh anand the father of year old mehtab peered into the garden behind their house as the cloud of pollution settled on the city the garden wall maybe feet away was no longer visible when someone opened a door a haze filled the room its like those horror movies he said you open the door and the thing comes in mr anand an executive at a clothing company grew up in the house and moved his family back to it from mumbai shortly after his son their only child turned he hoped mehtab could enjoy the same protected delhi boyhood that he did tumbling out the door after school and running around with a gang of neighborhood children until dinner but mehtabs life is nothing like that in the winter when the air quality plummets he barely goes outside for fear of setting off his breathing problems his mother guntas kaur enrolled him in tennis lessons
it happened so fast one moment i was running trails the next i was staring a black bear sow in the face so close i could smell it wild and pungent and alarming and i knew it could smell me too my fear i was in the middle of a rainy mile run in far north bicentennial park on the outskirts of anchorage where i live it was late july a time when grizzlies sweep down from the mountains to feast on the red flecked salmon swimming up campbell creek but i was miles from the water i had planned my route away from the creek and i hadnt seen bear scat in more than an hour as i crested a hill a crash sounded from my right and i instinctively moved to the left expecting a moose but it was the sow with three cubs the cubs fled up a tree the sow paused in front of me as if waiting i backed into the brush fortifying myself behind a skinny grove of alder trees moving slowly carefully never taking my eyes off the bear when it veered as if to leave i felt such relief that my throat loosened and small gasps escaped my lips then it abruptly turned and charged directly at me its impossible to run the trails around alaska without thinking about bears there are piles of scat everywhere dotted with blueberry and cranberry seeds that glint in the sun reminders that you have to be careful you have to be versed in bear awareness bear etiquette and bear protocol headphones are a no no and going alone is discouraged making noise and carrying bear spray is recommended still i often ran alone i preferred it that way i liked the serenity and the loneliness liked the hours of nothing but me and the mountains and the trees that day i wore a bear bell attached to my hydration pack and i sang too whenever i came to dense areas i sang old rock n roll songs loudly and badly i was cautious but not afraid i ran these trails all summer and the summer before and while i saw bears on many other trails i only twice saw them on these sections maybe i let down my guard maybe i felt invincible the way you feel when you repeat risky behavior without negative results maybe the bear was having a bad day when the bear charged time stood still i felt every millisecond i stood in the drizzle rain coating my face like tears and i did what they tell you to do if a black bear charges i waved my arms and yelled im human i cried my voice rising through the birch trees through that silent and never ending moment im a person the bear paused and ran back toward the brush a minute later it charged a second time and again i waved my arms and yelled and again it stopped this time so close i could almost reach out and touch its snout i couldnt breathe couldnt swallow i wondered briefly and almost idly if this was how i would die suddenly i wanted to talk to my son who was grown and off living his own life i wanted to hear his voice a lifetime later the bear turned and ran off its backside swaying into the trees i had to get back to the trail to the possibility of safety yet i couldnt step away from the alders it was my only protection thats when the bear began circling around me in a wide arc thats when i knew i was in trouble became really afraid when my son was young and nothing would comfort him i would talk it didnt matter what i said he needed my voice the steady flow of words as i stepped from the shelter of the alders i talked out loud my voice surprisingly calm i talked to the bear to show that i meant no harm but mostly i talked to reassure myself as the bear circled for a second time i stumbled through devils club snagging my shorts and scratching my legs and i talked about the day my son was born how i recognized his face immediately when i reached the trail i kept talking the bear followed but i didnt look back a half a mile later i glanced over my shoulder and the bear was gone i started running and didnt stop until i encountered two hikers and i collapsed at their feet for weeks i saw that bears face in my dreams and i woke up heart pounding i swore i would never run trails again but i missed it too much and soon i was out with the trees and that big big sky some things are worth the risk though i made sure to carry a canister of bear spray just in case and sometimes even now when im running i think of that bear charging and how i stood there so still and yet so alive it opened something inside of me that can never be closed it offered a taste of the unknown at any time i might find myself crouched in the brush face to face with my own fragile existence so much of life is chance there are no guarantees but there are vast landscapes and dangers and wild moments of good luck

hong kong whenever the windows of her employers floor apartment looked dirty win win warsiating would lean halfway out of the high rise building to clean them sometimes she would glance down at the ground far below and be seized with anxiety she said but she never complained that was years ago when ms warsiating a domestic worker from indonesia was new to hong kong and the job these days she said she would be far less willing to compromise her safety to please an employer i agree to clean windows but if you are not safe of course not she said at a recent rally for migrant workers rights in hong kong in a rich city known for its soaring high rises reports that several domestic workers fell to their deaths this year while cleaning windows have added urgency to a long running debate about the citys deep social inequality and dependence on low cost migrant labor last month the deaths prompted indonesia and the philippines the countries that supply the vast majority of hong kongs roughly migrant domestic workers to call for window washing safety regulations last week the labor department said that starting in january new employment contracts would contain a clause prohibiting domestic workers from cleaning any windows without secure grilles or from extending anything but their arms beyond window ledges but the underlying question of what rights hong kongs domestic migrant workers deserve is far from resolved labor activists said the new clause would do little to improve a system they say is rife with exploitation by employment agencies and which hong kong officials rely on to plug gaps in social services for children and older residents they want to keep the labor cheap said leo tang the organizing secretary at the hong kong confederation of trade unions mr tang said the government could raise the minimum wage for domestic migrant workers or better police the employment agencies but of course for all these types of needs they have to increase the public expenditure he said that is the thing they wouldnt do as a neoliberal government hong kongs migrant domestic workers who are mainly women typically work six days a week and earn a monthly minimum wage of about far less than what other workers are guaranteed under hong kong law they also pay placement fees to employment agencies and security deposits that are worth several months of wages hong kong a former british colony does provide better legal protections than these workers would find in many other popular destinations for economic migrants across asia and the middle east but jade anderson an anti human trafficking coordinator at justice center hong kong an advocacy group said that was no excuse for employment policies that she said encouraged abuse being the best amongst a series of poor choices doesnt say much for hong kong ms anderson said a recent survey by the center of migrant domestic workers found that percent displayed signs of being subjected to forced labor while a third said they did not feel free to quit their jobs eman c villanueva the spokesman for the asian migrants coordinating body another advocacy group said that migrant domestic workers feel discriminated against by rules that require them to live in their employers homes by vague job descriptions that can facilitate exploitation and by immigration policies that oblige them to leave the city within two weeks if their contracts are terminated we are segregated we are excluded from hong kong society he said and i think that is the underlying thing that reinforces the mind set of the people that we can be treated differently and treated unfairly mr villanueva citing philippine officials and indonesian activists said that three filipinos and two indonesians had died in hong kong this year after falling from heights although he said the figures included both suicides and work related accidents the debate over window washing began last month after the philippine consulate sent a letter to employment agencies saying that it would require new employment contracts for its citizens to stipulate that domestic workers were banned from cleaning windows the indonesian consulate later said it would do the same for us the most important thing is that our workers are protected by law tri tharyat the indonesian consul general said in an interview before the new clause was announced indonesia has said it plans to stop sending domestic workers to several countries he added but hong kong was not on that list because its legal code provided better protections for migrants its not perfect yet but its better than nothing he said carlson k s chan hong kongs labor commissioner told reporters last week that the new clause on window washing represented a pragmatic compromise among labor unions foreign consulates migrant workers and their employers im very happy that all the parties have been adopting a very sensible attitude mr chan said he added that he did not have official data on how many migrant workers had died while cleaning windows this year benny lee the chief operating officer of the support group for hong kong employers with foreign domestic helpers said he was willing to accept some safety measures but worried that the clause could inspire the workers to negotiate other aspects of their contracts resulting in reams of paperwork that might confuse employers hong kong provides some of the best legal protections for migrant workers in asia mr lee added and accusations of exploitation were frequently exaggerated by the international news media its totally unfair he said ms warsiating who was once frightened cleaning windows on high floors now spends her off days advising newly arrived indonesian domestic workers about their rights some tell her they would be willing to complain about unsafe conditions ms warsiating said but others say doing so could give their employers a pretext to fire them and therefore put them at risk of being deported or having to pay extra job placement

in early october yurie adachi a member of the japanese womens national hockey team was preparing for a late night practice in tokyo when she met a visitor from new york adachi who does not speak much english smiled and offered a one word greeting riveters since junior high school adachi has played with nana fujimoto the japanese goaltender who competed in the inaugural season of the national womens hockey league in adachi kept track of fujimoto with the riveters the leagues new york area franchise that now plays its home games in newark canada united states are wonderful environments for hockey adachi said through an interpreter sitting in an aging rink where water from the roof leaked onto the ice the formation of the n w h l was a significant moment female hockey players in the united states would finally receive salaries as professionals the first season of operation was largely deemed a success with paid attendance the league said of per game so the n w h l s players were staggered when they were notified on thursday that their salaries would be cut to keep the league afloat this season according to the league average attendance has dropped to now with the future of the n w h l uncertain players are calling for more transparency from the league office theyve made that clear that we need to rebuild some trust dani rylan the n w h l s commissioner said on sunday during the riveters win over the connecticut whale in newark i think trust is a two way street even though it was an unfortunate set of circumstances it might end up realigning us and putting us back on that path together this season player salaries ranged from to originally some players said they were told that salaries would be cut in half but multiple sources with direct knowledge of the leagues finances confirmed the actual pay cut would be percent the reduction softened by a recent contribution by dunkin donuts meanwhile many players are troubled because they have received little information about the leagues condition there are many things since their inception that have been a state secret said brant feldman managing partner of american group management who has represented womens hockey players since if you operate something without a public image to it i get it but if youre operating a sports league of any sort you need things done in a public facing manner n w h l players in a statement released saturday through social media called for an independent audit of the leagues finances disclosure of the identity of investors and an explanation of why revenue has diminished so quickly the biggest thing is we need transparency right now riveters forward bray ketchum said of the players demands rylan said there are some things we will work with the players on there are some demands that we might not be able to but i think that we are committed to working together on sunday the leagues four teams the riveters the whale the boston pride and the buffalo beauts played for the first time since the salary cuts getting back on the ice had the effect of cooling emotions some players had contemplated walking away from the league rather than accept its new circumstances i can understand how much it hurts them and if they feel a bit betrayed and they cant trust this league right now pride forward rachel llanes said the league has a players association but there is no collective bargaining agreement christopher fusco managing partner of the law firm callahan and fusco has a background in sports and employment law he said he thought cutting salary without any negotiations was an unfair labor practice but without a collective bargaining agreement he added players do not have much recourse unless they are willing to walk out opt out clauses were added to player contracts this season but few are likely to use them for the players a percent pay cut meant that game preparation was replaced by questions about paying rent getting out of leases or becoming eligible for unemployment benefits the riveters have been discussing ways to raise money and pitch in to help teammates under serious financial strain riveters defender kiira dosdall and other players also thought the role of the players association should be reassessed on the management side rylan said she had no doubt this season would be completed but added that attracting sponsors had been harder than expected before dunkin donuts agreed to give toward salaries players had received dunkin donuts gift cards each season tom manchester the companys vice president for field marketing in the united states said it was possible the company would provide further salary contributions although the n h l has collaborated with the n w h l there is no formal partnership between the two or with the canadian womens hockey league another womens professional league which is in its season in an email an n h l spokesman said that the league was supportive of womens hockey but that it had always questioned the viability of two professional womens leagues and the sustainability of the current business model riveters forward janine weber said everyone understood the risks involved in joining a start up venture that was bound to encounter setbacks amid these flaws the n w h l has had its groundbreaking moments as well kelsey koelzer is believed to be the first african american taken first over all in a top tier american hockey league draft when the riveters selected her in june last month harrison browne became the first openly transgender athlete in professional team sports in north america the league has also continually raised money for denna laing the pride player who was badly injured last december during an outdoor game at gillette stadium in foxborough mass the league which this season has a game schedule that runs from october to april
apple iphones and other hand held devices have long had an airplane mode that shuts off wireless communications to prevent interference with the vast electronics systems that control modern aircraft now federal auto safety regulators want makers of these devices to add a driver mode to modify or block certain apps and features to keep a drivers attention on the road the initiative comes in the form of voluntary guidelines that will be issued wednesday by the national highway traffic safety administration they arrive amid a spike in traffic fatalities in the last two years and increasing concerns about the distractions posed by smartphones and the many apps that americans are using while behind the wheel your smartphone becomes so many different things that its not just a communication device anthony foxx secretary of the transportation department said in an interview distraction is still a problem too many people are dying and being injured on our roadways the guidelines call on electronics manufacturers like apple and samsung to design future operating systems that limit the functionality and simplify interfaces while a vehicle is in motion and to develop technology to identify when the devices are being used by a driver while driving that would ensure the limits are placed on drivers and not other vehicle occupants the new guidelines from n h t s a are the agencys first recommendations specifically for portable devices that are used while driving the agency cannot force electronics companies to comply but in the past it issued a set of guidelines for the navigation and entertainment systems built into cars by the manufacturer and carmakers adopted them for the most part the airplane mode has been around about as long as smartphones the federal aviation administration had required turning off electronics before takeoff but that rule was relaxed to allow the use of smartphones in flight as long as they had their communications shut off that led to airplane mode which the iphone had in unfortunately there are varying degrees of recognition in the tech community that when youre building an app or a smartphone or contemplating usage theres a strong possibility that someone could be trying to use that in the drivers seat mr foxx said in the first six months of highway deaths increased percent to according to preliminary data compiled by n h t s a at that rate more than people die every day in traffic accidents in traffic fatalities rose percent it was the largest annual percentage increase in traffic deaths in years part of the increase in road deaths can be explained by the improving economy higher employment numbers and low gasoline prices all of which are causing americans to drive more than they did just a few years ago during the depths of the recession in an interview in october mark rosekind the n h t s a administrator said the increase in miles traveled was not enough by itself to explain this spike in crashes injuries and deaths indeed fatalities are occurring more frequently even when the increased travel is factored in mr rosekind and other safety experts think one factor is distracted driving in their view distractions and the allure of smartphones other devices and in car electronics have multiplied greatly since the dangers of distracted driving entered the national consciousness years ago at that time the main phone related distracting activities were texting and talking on the phone now a wide range of apps and games also tempt drivers to reach for their phones niantic the maker of pokmon go recently modified the game to prevent it from operating while moving at speeds of more than about miles per hour a spokeswoman for the company said she declined to give further details on the modifications because niantic did not want users to find ways to get around them she said the change was made after a spate of accidents was blamed on drivers who were playing the game while at the wheel i dont think pokmon go is something any driver should be using at any speed mr foxx said makers of smartphones have added some technology that can be used to reduce the distraction of electronics apples iphones have a do not disturb feature that can block incoming calls and texts and a silent mode that eliminates the chimes and other audio cues that signal the arrival of a new message or posting on facebook many carmakers now include apples carplay software in their newest models when an iphone is connected to the vehicle via carplay the software limits the apps drivers can use to apple maps the music service pandora and others that are used while traveling drivers can have the system read new texts aloud and dictate responses there are apps and other products that can be used to block incoming communications in cars one called drivesafe mode lets parents monitor if a childs phone is used for texting or email while in a vehicle the guidelines encourage smartphone makers to ensure their devices pair up with in car electronics so drivers can use their steering wheel buttons and in dash screen to control apps a driver mode would present a simplified interface and detect when the device is being used by a driver in this mode a smartphone would block any video or distracting graphics eliminate scrolling text and prohibit keypad use for texting or email any social media content or content from web pages like news reports should be blocked as well the guidelines say
san francisco mark zuckerberg facebooks chief executive has cultivated relationships with chinas leaders including president xi jinping he has paid multiple visits to the country to meet its top internet executives he has made an effort to learn mandarin inside facebook the work to enter china runs far deeper the social network has quietly developed software to suppress posts from appearing in peoples news feeds in specific geographic areas according to three current and former facebook employees who asked for anonymity because the tool is confidential the feature was created to help facebook get into china a market where the social network has been blocked these people said mr zuckerberg has supported and defended the effort the people added facebook has restricted content in other countries before such as pakistan russia and turkey in keeping with the typical practice of american internet companies that generally comply with government requests to block certain content after it is posted facebook blocked roughly pieces of content in about countries between july and december for example but the new feature takes that a step further by preventing content from appearing in feeds in china in the first place facebook does not intend to suppress the posts itself instead it would offer the software to enable a third party in this case most likely a partner chinese company to monitor popular stories and topics that bubble up as users share them across the social network the people said facebooks partner would then have full control to decide whether those posts should show up in users feeds the current and former facebook employees caution that the software is one of many ideas the company has discussed with respect to entering china and like many experiments inside facebook it may never see the light of day the feature whose code is visible to engineers inside the company has so far gone unused and there is no indication that facebook has offered it to the authorities in china but the project illustrates the extent to which facebook may be willing to compromise one of its core mission statements to make the world more open and connected to gain access to a market of billion chinese people even as facebook faces pressure to continue growing mr zuckerberg has often asked where the companys next billion users will come from china has been cordoned off to the social network since because of the governments strict rules around censorship of user content the suppression software has been contentious within facebook which is separately grappling with what should or should not be shown to its users after the american presidential elections unexpected outcome spurred questions over fake news on the social network several employees who were working on the project have left facebook after expressing misgivings about it according to the current and former employees a facebook spokeswoman said in a statement we have long said that we are interested in china and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country she added that the company had made no decisions on its approach into china facebooks tricky position underscores the difficulties that many american internet companies have had gaining access to china for years companies like google and twitter have been blocked there for refusing to yield to the governments demands around censorship in google said it was directing users of its search engine in china to its service in hong kong because of censorship and intrusion from hackers other companies like the professional social networking service linkedin agreed to censor some content on their platforms in china the current climate for internet companies in china may not help facebook in august the ride hailing giant uber gave up an expensive battle to crack the chinese market selling its chinese business to an incumbent rival didi chuxing more broadly china has streamlined and tightened its controls over the internet under president xi targeting influential social media celebrities and adding new reviews to popular online video sites still some officials responsible for chinas tech policy have been willing to entertain the idea of facebooks operating in the country it would legitimize chinas strict style of internet governance and if done according to official standards would enable easy tracking of political opinions deemed problematic even so resistance remains at the top levels of chinese leadership some analysts have said facebooks best option is to follow a model laid out by other internet companies and cooperate with a local company or investor finding a partner and potentially allowing it to own a majority stake in facebooks china operation would take the burden of censorship and surveillance off the silicon valley company it would also let facebook rely on a local companys government connections and experience to deal with the difficult task of communicating with beijing facebook and chinese officials have had intermittent talks in the last few years about the social networks entering the market according to employees who were involved in the discussions though the two sides have been unable to reach a compromise facebook currently sells advertising for some chinese businesses from its hong kong office among its customers are state media sites that act as the propaganda arm of the chinese government and that operate official accounts where they post articles chinese citizens who wish to gain access to facebook must tunnel in using a technology known as a virtual private network or vpn its unclear when the suppression tool originated but the project picked up momentum in the last year as engineers were plucked from other parts of facebook to work on the effort the current and former employees said the project was led by vaughan smith a vice president for mobile corporate and business development at facebook they said like mr zuckerberg mr smith speaks a smattering of mandarin unveiling a new censorship tool in china could lead to more demands to suppress content from other

kara waite an english teacher at bunker hill community college in charlestown mass made a rule for herself for every political rant she posts on facebook she must pick up the phone and call a legislator its kind of a swear jar for political action ms waite said recently ms waite who volunteers for liberal causes and who created a widely shared document last week to teach others her methods figures that a phone ringing off the hook is more difficult for a lawmaker to ignore than a flooded inbox activists of all political stripes recommend calling legislators not just emailing and certainly not just venting on social media several lawmakers along with those who work for them said in interviews that ms waite is right a phone call from a constituent can indeed hold more weight than an email and far outweighs a facebook post or a tweet to understand why it helps to know what happens when someone answers the phone at a legislators office emily ellsworth whose jobs have included answering phones in the district offices of two republican representatives from utah jason chaffetz from to and chris stewart from to said the way your points reach a lawmaker depends on how many calls the office is getting at the time and how you present your story in some cases its a simple process when a caller offered an opinion staff members would write the comments down in a spreadsheet compile them each month and present reports to top officials she said if the lawmaker had already put out a statement on the issue the staff member would read it to the caller she said but a large volume of calls on an issue could bring an office to a halt sometimes spurring the legislator to put out a statement on his or her position ms ellsworth said she recommended the tactic in a series of tweets shared thousands of times it brings a legislative issue right to the top of the mind of a member she said it makes it impossible to ignore for the whole staff you dont get a whole lot else done when her branch in utah received a lot of calls she contacted the washington office and coordinated the messaging involving the communications director the legislative director or the chief of staff ms ellsworth said while scripts found on the internet can be useful for people uncomfortable talking on the phone she suggested making the phone calls as personal as possible in some cases if she was moved by a call she would pass on the comments to her district director she said what representatives and staffers want to hear is the individual impact of your individual story she said i couldnt listen to peoples stories for six to eight hours a day and not be profoundly impacted by them a new york state senator phil boyle a republican said that one of his staff members would contact him after a constituent called his office and that he would try to call everyone back thats a perk exclusive to those who call in since he sometimes gets more than emails per day he said i couldnt possibly do that for emails mr boyle said when its a subject in which he lacks expertise he said the calls have made a difference in one case several retired law enforcement officers called him about a gun control law that was enacted in worried that they would have to give up their service revolvers senator boyle who said he doesnt use firearms much was unaware of that possibility and proposed an amendment to grant them an exception gov andrew m cuomo granted the exception seven months after the law was passed most calls can be handled by staff members said brian kolb the republican minority leader in the new york state assembly many callers just want to express an opinion and dont even offer a name he said in other cases callers who want to talk out an issue more fully could be directed to a staff member who has expertise in the area said state senator liz krueger a democrat in new york ms waite who has had a calendar reminder for each monday morning alerting her to call party leadership said that first time callers often fear they will be quizzed or interrogated but that they generally just need to offer their opinion and basic personal information like name and city she implored people to be courteous since the staff members might be getting many calls communicate in a way that someone cant ignore ms waite said

seoul south korea president park geun hye on tuesday approved a military intelligence sharing pact with japan aimed at countering the north korean threat a move that angered south korean opposition parties which want to impeach ms park over a corruption scandal the united states an ally of both south korea and japan has pressed them to increase military cooperation so the three countries can more effectively monitor and confront threats from the north whose development of nuclear arms and missiles has been accelerating currently japan and south korea use washington as an intermediary when sharing intelligence on north korea but south koreans are wary of cooperating too closely with japan which ruled korea as a colony for years until the end of world war ii many of the protesters who have been demanding that ms park resign over the corruption scandal have also insisted that she cancel the negotiations with japan ms park has been accused of conspiring with a friend choi soon sil to extort millions from big businesses her polling numbers have reached record lows and huge crowds have gathered in seoul the capital and other major cities to demand that ms park step down or face impeachment prosecutors further undermined ms park on sunday by identifying her as a criminal accomplice while indicting ms choi on extortion charges as a sitting president ms park cannot be indicted since the scandal engulfed her administration ms park has made moves to assert her leadership such as making high profile government appointments critics have charged that the talks with japan were another attempt to establish her authority and rally her conservative supporters who favor the deal her government has denied this saying that the pact was needed to counter the threat from pyongyang the main opposition democratic party said tuesday that ms park would be remembered as a traitorous president because of the deal with japan we cannot restrain our anger at president parks arrogance the party said in a statement she is not satisfied with parlaying the government through her unprecedented scandal now she is trying to ruin diplomacy and national security too yoshihide suga the japanese chief cabinet secretary said tuesday at a news conference in tokyo that the government wanted to work for an early signing of the agreement but did not comment further the kyodo news agency reported many south koreans harbor strong resentment over japans harsh colonial rule and any moves by japan to expand its military role in the region stir painful associations here in a similar intelligence sharing deal with japan was put on hold at the last minute after a domestic backlash in south korea the governments sudden announcement that the talks would resume came a month ago after the scandal involving ms choi had erupted the pact which was approved earlier tuesday by ms parks cabinet will take effect at a signing ceremony wednesday morning officials said
throughout this bitter election campaign liberal celebrities like lady gaga jennifer lawrence lena dunham and lin manuel miranda used their powerful media platforms to sing hillary clintons praises now theyve invited their online followers to join them in processing her loss and protesting the impending administration of donald j trump i want to live in a countryofkindness where lovetrumpshate lady gaga wrote on twitter the day after the election she added a photo of herself at a protest outside trump tower in manhattan where she had climbed onto a truck in a strapless black jumpsuit and raised a pro clinton sign while the angry tweets therapeutic instagram testimonials and fiery speeches may comfort their fans these left leaning celebrities are also inadvertently energizing the opposition conservative news outlets most notably breitbart news network the right wing populist enclave are perfecting the art of sapping democratic stars name recognition and repurposing their words and actions into pro trump material the enormous reach that celebrities enjoy and the privileged bubble they live in is wielded against them here refashioned as evidence of the outsize control that the rich and famous have over regular americans this new battle in the culture wars is being waged not by bombastic big name right wing commentators like rush limbaugh but by nimble often nameless online aggregators who quickly churn through popular culture and throw the most evocative stories to their readers often without much commentary all it takes is a pointed headline an unflattering photo and a few well chosen quotes like this lady gaga protests on sanitation truck outside trump tower read breitbarts headline for its article on her tweet america is divided by its politics its media and as this election made even clearer by its celebrity influencers in the weeks before the election the avengers director joss whedon booted up his own online public service announcement factory save the day and recruited stars like robert downey jr don cheadle and scarlett johansson to churn out web videos for mrs clinton katy perry america ferrera lebron james and beyonc joined democratic candidate at rallies and when vice president elect mike pence caught a performance of the broadway hit hamilton on friday one of the shows stars addressed him on behalf of the diverse america who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us no offense to paris hilton and pat boone but the president elect doesnt have the biggest stars on his side instead breitbart mostly uses its culture pages to aim spitballs at hollywood lefties as part of its coverage of what it calls big hollywood the glamour of celebrities becomes grist for the sites overarching narrative about the corrosive influence of the cultural elite the image ms dunham posted to instagram of a restorative trip to sedona ariz may have played as soothingly aspirational for an audience concentrated with young coastal women but to breitbarts demo under the headline grieving lena dunham seeks answers in arizona wilderness after trump win it looks like a damning shot of a celebrity who decided to jet into a red state for a quirky vacation retreat as the hamilton controversy raged prodded by mr trumps demand that the cast apologize to mr pence breitbart pointedly reminded readers of the private fund raiser mr miranda hosted for mrs clinton during the campaign where ticket prices ranged from to and just like that a celebrity speaking out against mr trump becomes a point in his defense breitbarts postelection hollywood coverage appears largely to be a cool cataloging of aggrieved celebrities including rick ross beneath the surface of these articles though is subtle signaling at work a piece about a postelection vice essay by jennifer lawrence in which she railed against the barriers still facing women in the workplace includes an underhanded accolade about her she was recently named the highest paid actress in hollywood for the second straight year this recent headline depressed robert de niro trump election makes me feel like i did after packs a one two punch pairing the image of a pathetic weepy liberal with a flip attitude toward terrorism breitbarts article on the hamilton dust up titled tolerance hamilton cast lectures mike pence from broadway stage is threaded with buzzwords that cast liberals as elite pedantic hypocrites while breitbart produces its share of original content it ran an essay by ann coulter ridiculing whining celebrities last week most of the conservative media outlets doing this work are scrappy spammy and surprisingly banal on regated a bare bones conservative aggregator the hamilton incident was inflated into a full blown class war just like clockwork the rich elitist liberals come out to mock the poor hamilton cast members along with other liberals took to twitter to mock and bully the less fortunate people in america but much of the text generated by these sites is barely politicized the conservative online outlet patriotic folks recently aggregated quotes from a lady gaga essay published in harpers bazaar about how she was depressed and hurt about mr trumps remarks about women and worked in just a whiff of commentary women are fighting for their lives because of the leaked access hollywood tape where donald trump makes lewd comments or at least thats what lady gaga thinks highlighting words like hurt and depressed works like a low frequency conservative dog whistle signaling to readers who want to revel in liberals pain or ridicule them as emotional children postelection breitbart may appear little different from any celebrity news aggregator but the sites greater political context as a breeding ground for extremists adds another layer breitbart is the site that boosted stephen k bannon to a thought leader with that in mind an article calling attention to ms dunhams jewish faith feels like a bone thrown to the sites white nationalist readers and the catalog of slighted celebrities starts to read like something of a star studded enemies list the real ideological action is undertaken by the
thanksgiving can be stressful extended family members often disagree on everything from who is hosting the dinner to what will be on the menu and for young people there are the inevitable questions involving grades relationships and future plans this year the recent election has added another layer of stress for many families and friends who are celebrating the holiday but not celebrating a common political viewpoint is it possible to have meaningful conversations and to connect with family and friends who widely disagree the times has some suggestions how could you questions to ask loved ones who voted the other way asks the article then suggests questions you can use to go deeper including students read all the questions then tell us do you ever talk about politics with your family and friends do these conversations ever get awkward or uncomfortable why are politics and the recent election likely to come up during your thanksgiving celebrations if yes do you think it will be stressful why can you see yourself using the question format this holiday season would you like to have this conversation with anyone in particular listen to the podcast at the end of the article in which one trump voter and one clinton voter used this guide to facilitate conversation do you think aaron and kyle handled themselves well during the conversation what surprised you about their discussion kyle admitted that social media postings made it easier to avoid a real conversation with aaron over the years and said i realize now that was wrong open dialogue is obviously what brings people together do you think aaron and kyle would have had the same conversation without the help of the guiding questions in your opinion what did they do especially well during their conversation let us know what you think in the comments section
maybe i shouldnt have been surprised that donald trump could be elected president but i was i live in brooklyn and work in manhattan two of the most liberal places in the country but even online i wasnt seeing many signs of support for him how did that blindness occur social media is my portal into the rest of the world my periscope into the communities next to my community into how the rest of the world thinks and feels and it completely failed me in hindsight that failure makes sense ive spent nearly years coaching facebook and instagram and twitter on what kinds of news and photos i dont want to see and they all behaved accordingly each time i liked an article or clicked on a link or hid another the algorithms that curate my streams took notice and showed me only what they thought i wanted to see that meant i didnt realize that most of my family members who live in rural virginia were voicing their support for trump online and i didnt see any of the pro trump memes that were in heavy circulation before the election i never saw a trump hat or a sign or a shirt in my feeds and the only election day selfies i saw were of people declaring their support for hillary clinton to be clear im not blaming the algorithms for what i assume to be their role in augmenting my worldview they did exactly what i told them to do blocking out racist misogynist and anti immigrant comments hiding anyone who didnt support black lives matter all with such deftness that i had no idea that a candidate who ran a campaign on exactly those values had gained enough popularity to win the election but considering that more than percent of our countrys population consumes news on facebook finding alternative perspectives shouldnt have been that hard i knew about eli parisers theory on filter bubbles or the idea that online personalization distorts the type of information we see and even so i still chose to let algorithms shape how i perceive the world everything i could want to see is available at my fingertips and yet i didnt look in april mark zuckerberg chief executive of facebook addressed a room of developers about the importance of his social network facebook he said has the power to bring people together who might otherwise never have the chance to meet the internet has enabled all of us to access and share more ideas and information than ever before he said weve gone from a world of isolated communities to one global community and we are all better off for it but thats not what has happened zuckerbergs idealism is belied by his desire to duck responsibility for mediating the content of his site on facebook the political divide has only been entrenched further its the buzzfeed dress debate only for our entire lives we are two countries one that sees blue and black and the other that sees white and gold the internet once offered outlets we could use to understand one another but they are rapidly disappearing most social media like facebook and instagram is curated by software built to manage the high influx of information flowing into it but there have still been a few islands of digital wilderness a galpagos of sorts where culture thrived untouched they included vine and snapchat and even tumblr which were homes for marginalized ideas theories and lifestyles the video sharing app vine was the first place i got a glimpse of cultures beyond my own including those of the middle east i was able to see how some women there wanted us to see them prospering aware a young woman living in saudi arabia who goes by the name amy roko used vine to show clips of herself living her life her version of normalcy at the mall goofing off at home in her most viral video she stares into the camera her face covered in a niqab save for her perfectly outlined eyes expletive called me ugly she snaps i said expletive where the emphasis on the last word becomes the punch line as she whips off one niqab to reveal a second underneath i was thrilled to realize that women living there could have a sense of humor similar to my own vine was born as an app and intended to be a social community but vine links could be shared independent of the network and people did so with abandon meaning that vines appeared scattershot around the web defying the sorting mechanism of streams and feeds they could land on your screen via text message direct message email rokos vine was a riff on one originally posted by a young black american named brionna london who was miffed that someone thought she needed makeup to be pretty you can draw a straight line from brown women in saudi arabia to black women in america a marvel unto itself a window into the way the internet flattens space and time a vivid example of its fulfilling its promise to bridge divides at vines peak it had more than million monthly users who watched videos billions of times and it excelled at showing these sorts of commonalities that say black kids in new orleans lived and looked a lot like white kids in florida and yet twitter which owns vine and is struggling to turn a profit while keeping its main service appealing to advertisers could seemingly no longer afford to keep the video feature afloat following news about twitters decision to close the service there were rumors that outside companies made inquiries about purchasing vines remains but its most likely too late to salvage the community there in its earlier days snapchat offered its own version of cultural exchange the app had an incredible series on city life that gave users direct windows into different worlds people submitted
in tim obrien then a financial reporter at the new york times published the book trumpnation the art of being the donald talked to sources with an up close view of donald j trumps finances who concluded that the real estate developers net worth was million to million rather than the billion to billion trump had variously claimed trump who had courted obrien by taking him for rides in his ferrari and private jet sued obrien for libel in new jersey in trump called obrien a wack job on the today show while obrien says continuing to curry favor with him privately obriens publisher warner books was also named in the suit and hired top lawyers who put trump through an unsparing two day deposition asked about his finances trump was caught lying or exaggerating times he thought hed get a friendly judge and we would roll over says obrien who is now the executive editor of bloomberg view we didnt the case went through four judges and was dismissed in trumps suit against obrien is one of seven forays president elect trump and his companies have made as libel plaintiffs he won only once when a defendant failed to appear but the standard measure defending his reputation and achieving victory in court isnt how trump says he thinks about his investment i spent a couple of bucks on legal fees and they spent a whole lot more he told the washington post in march about the hefty sum he spent on the case against obrien i did it to make his life miserable which im happy about trump was wrong warner books spent less than he did and obrien paid nothing but that doesnt make trumps central idea any less jarring that libel law can be a tool of revenge its disconcerting for a superrich plaintiff to treat the legal system as a weapon to be deployed against critics once installed in the white house trump will have a wider array of tools at his disposal and his record suggests that more than his predecessors he will try to use the press and also control and subdue it as a candidate trump blustered vaguely that he wanted to open up our libel laws i asked his spokeswoman hope hicks by email what he meant by that but she didnt answer the question its not within the presidents direct powers to change the rules for libel suits but our legal safeguards for writers and publishers arent foolproof in the last few years trump has been joined by at least two billionaires who are determined to exploit cracks in the wall of defense around the press the members of this club are innovators they have sued or funded suits to defend reputations or protect privacy but an underlying aim appears to be to punish critics like obrien or even destroy entire media outlets this kind of manipulation of the law is unfolding at a keen moment of weakness for the press which has already been buffeted by falling revenue and mounting public disaffection only percent of the public the lowest rate since at least the trusts the media to report the news fully accurately and fairly according to a gallup survey conducted in september this mistrust has been growing for a long time but it was stoked by trump during the campaign he called the reporters who covered him scum and whipped up yelling and booing crowds there is no consensus among his supporters that the press should hold those in power accountable a recent pew survey found that only half of trump backers agreed that it was important in a strong democracy that news organizations are free to criticize political leaders media outlets have won many cases by persuading a judge to dismiss them but since they have succeeded in only percent of the libel and privacy suits that have gone to trial a dip from percent in the previous decade according to the media law resource center the median damage award has increased fivefold since the to million the figure includes three big verdicts over the last eight months against gawker rolling stone and the news observer in raleigh n c these include run of the mill libel suits and its too early to say that the sky is falling on the press but its darkening the high bar for winning a libel case in the united states was set in when the supreme court decided new york times v sullivan in that case widely hailed as one of the courts strongest stands for free speech l b sullivan a city commissioner who supervised the police in montgomery ala sued the times over an ad in the newspaper signed by civil rights supporters the ad turned out to include minor factual errors sullivan said its depiction of how the montgomery police responded to civil rights protests made him look bad under the rules at the time a libel plaintiff was entitled to victory if he could show that the content that harmed his reputation was false the alabama jury agreed with sullivan on that point and awarded him in damages with similar cases pending the times pulled its reporters out of alabama but when the newspaper appealed to the supreme court the justices threw out the sullivan verdict and set a far stiffer standard for proving libel the court wrote that a public figure has to prove that a false and damaging statement about him was published with actual malice translated as knowing or reckless disregard for the truth by the the number of libel suits decreased and if suits did go to trial they frequently ended in defeat for the plaintiff in two examples from that era gen william westmoreland sued cbs and ariel sharon the israeli defense minister sued time magazine neither man won damages those outcomes as well as losses in other high profile cases were a major deterrent for plaintiffs and their lawyers says george

beijing a single spark can start a prairie fire mao zedong said and being accused of a bigoted outburst can start a wildfire on the internet in china as a manager for daimler the german automaker has learned to his regret daimler greater china said it had removed a manager after a regrettable matter the emailed statement from the company a unit of daimler which makes mercedes benz cars and other prestigious vehicles did not identify the manager or say exactly what he had done but the chinese news media and internet users have been much blunter they accused rainer grtner the president and chief executive of daimler trucks and buses of insulting the chinese people on sunday during a squabble with a driver over a parking spot on the outskirts of beijing the controversy took off this week after a user of weibo a popular chinese microblog service accused mr grtner of insulting chinese people after a standoff over the parking spot in shunyi a district in northeast beijing where many middle class foreigners and chinese live in townhouse communities that rub shoulders with poorer residents who used to be farmers i am in china one year already mr grtner told the chinese motorist in english according to the account which the beijing news said came from a friend of the motorist it said mr grtner went on to say the first thing i learned here is and then used a crude insult to describe all you chinese the account also said mr grtner used pepper spray against members of the gathering crowd including one man whose eyes were hurt by the spray mr grtner has not commented publicly on the quarrel and did not respond to messages and neither daimler nor the police in beijing have shared details so it was impossible to know whether he agreed with that description of events even so the chinese news media and many internet users seized on mr grtner as an example of arrogant western bigotry and demanded that he and daimler apologize he became the latest example of the power of the chinese internet to humble governments companies and people accused of wounding national pride some people think this was making a mountain out of a molehill said an editorial on tuesday in southern daily an official newspaper for the southern province of guangdong but it continued some foreign companies often use racially prejudiced words and actions about chinese consumers even chinese employees foreign executives easily become arrogant about the chinese market the newspaper said mr grtner a german had worked at the chinese truck and bus unit since july after a six year stint in south korea according to his profile on linkedin the controversy over mr grtner has come hard on the heels of another volatile episode when gnther h oettinger a european union commissioner from germany apologized after making crudely disparaging comments about chinese people initially daimler greater china said on monday that it was deeply sorry about the dispute and stressed that such comments by employees do not represent daimler according to chinese news reports but as the public anger in china grew on monday the company acted and announced mr grtners departure from his job in making the announcement daimler greater china said the dispute while a private issue was detrimental to the standing of our company unbecoming of a manager of our brand and prejudicial to our good name chinese news reports celebrated the decision as a victory for good sense and many appeared to assume that mr grtner had been fired from daimler but the corporate communications office for daimler greater china did not answer questions about whether mr grtner had been dismissed by the company or moved on perhaps pending a new assignment elsewhere in the company global times a popular chinese newspaper said it was understandable that frustrated drivers in beijing a painfully congested city would exchange sharp words over parking spots but no matter how filthy the words hearts should not be filthy the newspaper said theres no explaining away an argument that escalates to using you chinese

washington days before the presidential election james alefantis owner of a local pizza restaurant called comet ping pong noticed an unusual spike in the number of his instagram followers within hours menacing messages like were on to you began appearing in his instagram feed in the ensuing days hundreds of death threats one read i will kill you personally started arriving via texts facebook and twitter all of them alleged something that made mr alefantiss jaw drop that comet ping pong was the home base of a child abuse ring led by hillary clinton and her campaign chief john d podesta when mr alefantis discovered that his employees were getting similar abusive messages he looked online to unravel the accusations he found dozens of made up articles about mrs clinton kidnapping molesting and trafficking children in the restaurants back rooms the articles appeared on facebook and on websites such as the new nationalist and the vigilant citizen with one headline blaring pizzagate how uncovered the sick world of washingtons occult elite none of it was true while mr alefantis has some prominent democratic friends in washington and was a supporter of mrs clinton he has never met her does not sell or abuse children and is not being investigated by law enforcement for any of these claims he and his employees had unwittingly become real people caught in the middle of a storm of fake news from this insane fabricated conspiracy theory weve come under constant assault said mr alefantis who was once in a relationship with david brock a provocative former right wing journalist who became an outspoken advocate for mrs clinton mr alefantis suspects those relationships may have helped to make him a target ive done nothing for days but try to clean this up and protect my staff and friends from being terrorized he said fake news online has been at the center of a furious debate for the past few weeks over how it may have influenced voters in the presidential election president obama warned last week that we are in an age where theres so much active misinformation and its packaged very well on social media sites the criticism has buffeted web companies such as google and facebook whose chief executive mark zuckerberg has promised to work on technology tools to slow the gusher of false digital information but mr alefantiss experience shows it is not just politicians and internet companies that are grappling with the fake news fallout he his staff and friends have become a new kind of private citizen bulls eye for the purveyors of false articles and their believers for more than two weeks they have struggled to deal with the abusive social media comments and to protect photos of their own children which were used in the false articles as evidence that the pizza restaurant was running a pedophilia ring one person even visited comet ping pong to investigate the allegations for himself to combat the fake news tide mr alefantis has contacted the federal bureau of investigation and the local police and he has asked facebook twitter youtube and reddit to remove the articles yet the misinformation has continued to spread growing into a theory known as pizzagate that has traveled to ireland at one point comets staff counted five pizzagate twitter posts a minute as recently as sunday night the twitter message dont let up pizzagate everywhere was reposted and liked hundreds of times its like trying to shoot a swarm of bees with one gun said bryce reh comets general manager whose wife asked him to leave his job because of the threats and vulgar messages they both have received on their social media accounts mr alefantis an artist born and raised in washington co founded comet ping pong years ago as a casual spot for clay oven pizza the restaurant has kid friendly features like ping pong tables and a craft room famous natives like members of the band fugazi have held small shows there the eatery which seats is a mash up of red and white checkered tablecloths and modernist murals and paintings from friends of mr alefantis mr alefantis mingles with other washington chefs and his establishment helped him to be named no in gq magazines most powerful people in washington in his customers include some high powered locals such as tony podesta the brother of john podesta whom mr alefantis knows casually mr alefantis and mr brock who is the founder of media matters for america a website that tracks press coverage critical of the clintons and works to debunk misinformation in the conservative press broke up five years ago the misinformation campaign began when john podestas email account was hacked and his emails were published by wikileaks during the presidential campaign days before the election users on the online message board noticed that one of mr podestas leaked emails contained communications with mr alefantis discussing a fund raiser for mrs clinton the users immediately speculated about the links between comet ping pong and the democratic party some posited the restaurant was part of a larger democratic child trafficking ring which was a theory long held by some conservative blogs that idea jumped to other social media services such as twitter and reddit where it gained momentum on the page the donald a new reddit discussion thread called pizzagate quickly attracted subscribers glen caplin a former campaign official for mrs clinton did not comment directly about comet ping pong but said wikileaks has spawned several conspiracy theories that have been independently debunked mr podesta did not respond to requests for comment soon dozens of fake news articles on sites such as facebook planet free will and living resistance emerged readers shared the stories in saudi arabia and on turkish and other foreign language sites last week one supporter of the pizzagate theory shot a live video from within the restaurant during a busy dinner shift local police who had parked across the street

washington president elect donald j trump on monday released a two and a half minute infomercial style video turning to social media to deliver a direct to camera message in which he vowed to create jobs renegotiate trade agreements end restrictions on energy production and impose bans on lobbying mr trump offered what he called an update on his transition which he said was going very smoothly efficiently and effectively reading from a script and looking into a camera he steered clear of his most inflammatory campaign promises to deport immigrants and track muslims and his pledge to repeal the affordable care act whether its producing steel building cars or curing disease i want the next generation of production and innovation to happen right here in our great homeland america creating wealth and jobs for american workers mr trump said in the video the brief youtube video offered one of the few opportunities for the public to hear from mr trump directly since he was elected two weeks ago the president elect has declined to hold a news conference since his victory and instead has used early morning twitter bursts to communicate mr trump gave a brief middle of the night speech after hillary clinton called him on nov and he sat for an interview with the wall street journal and an appearance surrounded by his family on cbs newss minutes last week since then he has mostly been behind closed doors as he assembles a cabinet and white house team in the video mr trump described his plans to make america great again on day but his message seemed aimed less at the supporters who chanted that slogan at rallies and more at the americans who remain skeptical about it the president elect appeared to try to emphasize his appeal to those voters at the end of the video and he promised to provide more updates as he worked together with everyone to reach his goals and i mean everyone he emphasized the video underscored the extent to which mr trump intends to try to navigate around the traditional newspaper and television media outlets as he seeks to communicate his message to the public ari fleischer who served as white house press secretary under george w bush said mr trump was using technology to communicate with the public in a format that mr bushs staff would never have dreamed of doing years ago because the news media would have dismissed it as propaganda president obama has become adept at doing the same thing in recent years through videos posted on facebook and other media mr fleischer said hes just doing more of what president obama successfully did and what im fascinated about is what does this mean for the future on monday the president elect met privately with television executives in a confidential session that was described later as a sometimes contentious effort to clear the air after a campaign season in which mr trump often clashed with members of the media mr trump is also scheduled to meet with editors and reporters at the new york times on tuesday but his decision to deliver a highly scripted video message suggests that he like mr obama is eager to embrace new media opportunities by monday mr trumps realdonaldtrump twitter account which he enjoys using had million followers once in the white house he will inherit potus with its million online followers mr trump also spent monday at his office in trump tower interviewing a stream of potential republican cabinet candidates they included rick perry a former governor of texas former senator scott brown of massachusetts and representative tulsi gabbard of hawaii a democrat perhaps the most interesting thing about mr trumps video was what he did not say in it on immigration he avoided any mention of his plan to build a wall along the border with mexico or his desire to deport immigrants here illegally whether or not they have a criminal record he made no mention of ending president obamas program that grants work permits to immigrants who were brought illegally to the united states as children instead mr trump simply promised to direct the labor department to investigate visa abuses the tough talking president elect who has often railed against mr obama and the generals for what he often called their stupid conduct of foreign policy said nothing in the video about fighting terrorism confronting russian aggression or pressuring nato allies to pay more for their common defense instead he said he would ask his top military officials for a comprehensive plan to guard americas vital infrastructure from cyberattacks and all other form of attacks mr trumps other promises in the video recapped points that he made repeatedly during the campaign offering a series of executive actions that he says he will order on his first full day in the oval office some like his pledge to issue our notification of intent to withdraw from the trans pacific partnership trade deal will be well within his power as president to accomplish but his additional promise to negotiate fair bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto american shores will be in the eyes of the beholder and may not produce the results he expects others appear to be overblown political hyperbole like his promise in the video to cancel job killing restrictions on the production of american energy including shale energy and clean coal creating many millions of high paying jobs he did not specify in the short video what restrictions he will lift or how that would result in many millions of jobs even supporters of the keystone xl oil pipeline which mr trump has said he will greenlight once in office do not believe it would create millions of jobs if it was built mr fleischer said mr trumps more inclusive tone in the video was the latest example of a pattern he set during the campaign of dialing back his impulse
moscow russias defense ministry said monday that ukrainian security service operatives had abducted two of its servicemen who were later described by kiev as deserters from the ukrainian army the two servicemen identified by russia as maksim odintsov and aleksandr baranov were detained and whisked by the operatives over the disputed border of crimea into the mykolaiv region of ukraine on sunday the russian defense ministry said in a statement the ukrainian special services are trying to fabricate a criminal case against mr baranov and mr odintsov the statement said as carried by the interfax news agency it is not excluded that psychological and physical evidence will be applied against the russian servicemen in order to get the right testimony the statement described what happened as a rude provocation and demanded the immediate return of the men in kiev the ukrainian security service confirmed that the two servicemen had been detained on the border with crimea but it described them as former ukrainian army soldiers who are now facing charges of treason for defecting to russia these are two former ukrainian servicemen who broke the oath of enlistment and went to serve in the russian army a representative of the security service told interfax in contrast to the russian statement the ukrainian official said the servicemen had been detained on ukrainian territory after crossing the border russia annexed crimea in after deploying thousands of troops throughout the peninsula and conducting a hastily organized pro russian referendum there many soldiers and officers of the ukrainian army and navy have switched sides and begun to serve in the russian military after the annexation crimea was the site of a number of episodes especially along its disputed border with ukraine this month russias main security service said it had arrested several ukrainian citizens in crimea accusing them of planning to attack military sites and infrastructure there ukrainian officials dismissed the reports as false in august russia said it had dismantled a ukrainian spy network and accused the ukrainian leadership of sponsoring terrorism in crimea kiev denied both claims as fantasies
washington the islamic state has used chemical weapons including chlorine and sulfur mustard agents at least times on the battlefield in syria and iraq since it swept to power in according to a new independent analysis more than one third of those chemical attacks have come in and around mosul the islamic state stronghold in northern iraq according to the assessment by the ihs conflict monitor a london based intelligence collection and analysis service the ihs conclusions which are based on local news reports social media and islamic state propaganda mark the broadest compilation of chemical attacks in the conflict american and iraqi military officials have expressed growing alarm over the prospect of additional chemical attacks as the allies press to regain both mosul and raqqa the islamic state capital in syria the coalition is concerned about isils use of chemical weapons col john dorrian a military spokesman in iraq said in an email on monday using another name for the islamic state isil has used them in iraq and syria in the past and we expect them to continue employing these types of weapons colonel dorrian said that the islamic states ability to use chemical weapons is rudimentary and that american iraqi and other allied troops are equipped to deal with the impact of these chemical attacks typically rockets mortar shells or artillery shells filled with chemical agents the effects of these chemical munitions thus far have been limited to the immediate area where they land the ihs assessment is to be made public on tuesday the new york times obtained an advance copy of the assessment and the location of the reported chemical attacks the analysis did not break down the cases by type of chemical attack in an effort to blunt the islamic states ability to make the weapons the american led air campaign has bombed militants associated with overseeing their production and the facilities where chemical ordnance is manufactured in september for instance allied warplanes attacked a converted pharmaceutical factory in northern iraq thought to have been a chemical weapons production facility as iraqi forces now advance into mosul analysts warned that the islamic state could unleash more chemical attacks as they cede control iraqi forces have reclaimed about one third of mosul iraqs second largest city as the islamic state loses ground around mosul there is a high risk of the group using chemical weapons to slow down and demoralize advancing enemy forces said columb strack a senior analyst and the head of the ihs conflict monitor and to potentially make an example of and take revenge on civilian dissidents within the city at least of the chemical attacks have taken place in and around mosul according to the ihs data but the assessment noted a decline in attacks before the iraqi led offensive against the city mosul was at the center of the islamic states chemical weapons production mr strack said but most of the equipment and experts were probably evacuated to syria in the weeks and months leading up to the mosul offensive along with convoys of other senior members and their families the islamic state is not the only actor in syria to carry out chemical weapons strikes the syrian government has conducted many more such attacks syrian military helicopters dropped bombs containing chlorine on civilians in at least two attacks over the past two years a special joint investigation of the united nations and an international chemical weapons monitor said in august beginning last year american officials confirmed the first instances of the islamic state using sulfur mustard a chemical warfare agent and the presence of the mustard gas on fragments of ordnance used in attacks by the group in syria and iraq laboratory tests which were also performed on scraps of clothing from victims showed the presence of a partly degraded form of distilled sulfur mustard an internationally banned substance that burns a victims skin breathing passages and eyes chemical warfare agents broadly condemned and banned by most nations under international convention are indiscriminate they are also difficult to defend against without specialized equipment which many of the islamic states foes in iraq and syria lack the chemical agents are worrisome as potential terrorist weapons even though chlorine and blister agents are typically less lethal than bullets shrapnel or explosives it was unclear how the islamic state had obtained sulfur mustard a banned substance with a narrow chemical warfare application both the former hussein government in iraq and the current government in syria at one point possessed chemical warfare programs chlorine is commercially available as an industrial chemical and has been used occasionally by bomb makers from sunni militant groups in iraq for about a decade but it is not known how the islamic state would have obtained sulfur mustard the officials said abandoned and aging chemical munitions produced by iraq during its war against iran in the were used in roadside bombs against american forces during the occupation that followed the american invasion of iraq but american officials have said the types of ordnance that have been publicly disclosed so far have not matched known chemical ordnance in the former iraqi inventory the attacks have been geographically scattered and have varied in their delivery systems suggesting that the islamic state had access to and was experimenting with different types of rockets and shells configured to carry chemical warfare agents or toxic industrial chemicals one theory is that the militants were manufacturing a crude mustard agent themselves american officials say another theory is that the islamic state

weve never camped out on its floors as some people do but my family has long had a fascination with the american museum of natural history when i was and years old i lived blocks north of the fortresslike structure on central park west in manhattan and in those days when not everyone had a television set it became a delightful source of entertainment and what passed at that tender age for enlightenment decades later we took our daughter annie there shes now but it remains her favorite museum an educational outpost so stuffed with information so prone to inspire questions that it can at times seem overwhelming like the towering stature of its alaskan brown bear or the immense girth of its year old sequoia tree more than years after i first visited the museums sights are just as breathtaking and the questions it sparks are just as abundant but in the age of the smartphone they can now be addressed and the impact of its exhibits enhanced with a new museum app for iphone and android users that offers lots of fun facts videos and teaching tools for some of the most compelling items on display this app which is called explorer and can be downloaded free explains how the foot wide sequoia slice was fitted through the foot museum doorway it tells you that at up to pounds the blue whale weighs as much as about five subway cars making it the planets largest animal it lets you hear the sound the real creature makes underwater and shows you a short video of a woman in a forklift swabbing the museums whale with a long handled brush for its annual three day scrubbing it supposedly reassures me that the whale pounds of foam and fiberglass is suspended by a single steel pipe anchored in the ceiling nevertheless i still declined to venture under the whale to check out its mammalian navel which the app also steers you to the explorer app which cost about million offset by the gift of an undisclosed amount from bloomberg philanthropies is also a teaching tool it can explain to people with little knowledge of biology for example that the blue whale is more closely related to a clown than a clown fish to a hippo than a sea otter the information is in far simpler form than the sometimes encyclopedic texts of the exhibition labels that more than a few visitors seem to ignore given the museums labyrinthine structure a collection of some buildings cobbled together over the decades with a maze of corridors and halls the app has a bluetooth operated feature that guides you gps like to exhibitions it recommends you see based on your input of any of a dozen interests you may not know where you are but signal emitting beacons sprinkled through the museum pinpoint your location within feet or so very helpful if you are looking to find the bathroom or the cafe in short its a great aid to anyone seeing the museum for the first or time preferably with a child or two in tow its like having a curator on your shoulder the museum likes to say and in the age of the smartphone when all of life seems to be connected to a hand held device the app may be the only way to entice some children to see what more grouchy tykes may regard as a collection of stuffed animals and timeworn artifacts its in keeping with how a new generation approaches content ellen v futter president of the almost year old museum told me adding that the smartphone is the go to for young people and increasingly for everyone and it may not even be such an anomaly after all as matt tarr the digital architect who led the apps in house design team said as he showed off the app the museums dioramas of animals set against superbly painted scenic backdrops were the original examples of virtual reality a concern and one that museum designers of the app have tried to guard against is that some children may be so entranced by the app that they barely look at the giant mosquito or the radiant carat star of india sapphire or the recreation of lucy one of the earliest fossils of the hominid ancestors of todays humans and they may entirely avoid the labels which are indispensable for those seeking more sophisticated information one can appreciate such dangers of technology when you watch tourists at the vatican lining up with their point and shoot cameras for michelangelos piet and see them spending their few seconds in front of the magnificent statue snapping a photo rather than taking in the pathos its creator was able to register in marble we are very intentional about the fact that we dont want you to go around looking only at your phone said anne canty a museum spokeswoman the idea is to inspire you to look back at the objects not spending time with the exhibitions themselves would be a shame since they remain as astonishing as when i was and years old

when robert eidelbergs journalism class at john bowne high school in flushing queens convened in september our first assignment was to write an obituary about ourselves we were all about years old without much life experience so the task was to invent our futures did you keep mine i asked mr eidelberg last week soon after i announced my move to the obits staff after years in sports didnt he responded with a laugh prompting me to wish that i could read how i had lived and what i had died of eidelberg is the one teacher ive stayed in touch with all these years he inspired me to enter journalism and each time ive made a significant change in my career ive called him forty four years later he is teaching at hunter college and retains the big hearted enthusiasm he brought to our class he recalled that he asked us to write our obituaries as a way to understand ourselves and test our imaginations it was the biographical version of i spent my summer vacation he said but i wouldnt have gotten so much interesting content if i hadnt framed it as an obituary of yourself id like to think i awarded myself a pulitzer now i will be writing obituaries of others which ive done now and then while covering sports media and business ive written nearly three dozen obits all of sports personalities including the announcers mel allen ernie harwell jim mckay phil rizzuto and harry caray each was in that ghoulish way that obit writers feel a pleasure to write some years ago i wrote an advance obit of vin scully the great brooklyn and los angeles dodgers annnouncer who retired last month after years at the microphone as i wrote about his unmatched career i couldnt help but think of what i might be adding to the article as i observed scullys gracious farewell to fans as he approaches his birthday would it be that he recorded wind beneath my wings for his wife as a christmas gift or his revelation that he would resume rooting for the giants the dodgers arch rival and the team he grew up loving when he and the giants were new yorkers the occasional obit that fit into my sports department schedule was a diversion not a full time endeavor the news of my departure for the dead zone generated three distinct reactions from friends colleagues and people i write about the first was congratulations the second involved fond memories of the obits i have written and the third was something a lot like dont call me for a while thats right people who recently lobbied me to write about them now hoped i would lose their phone numbers until they die a well known local sportscaster summed things up nicely when he said in an email i always looked forward to you writing a long feature on me in the paper of record now i can wait a loooong time in fact lets skip it completely the most unusual reaction came from a famous and sophisticated former sports commissioner will you interview me for my advance obit he asked teeming with apparent awareness that his years as a successful commissioner entitled him to an advance obit and that at age something he was overdue for one bill mcdonald the obituaries editor believes that this is the first offer by a big newsmaker to volunteer to talk to us for an article that he will never read we more frequently hear from second string types he told me looking for posthumous glory
do you remember playing pretend when you were little maybe you were a superhero a dinosaur or a princess its normal when youre little and its usually harmless most children know the difference between pretending to be a superhero and jumping off the roof thinking they can fly but adults often forget for instance we may stop pretending to be superheroes but a lot of us seem convinced that we can pretend to be investors thats dangerous pretend investors think that financial pornography is real so the ticker tape scrolling across the television screen all day represents actionable information real investors know it might be entertaining like going to the circus but they would never make a decision because of it pretend investors think it makes perfect sense to change their investments based on what they hear in the news theres a new president so act he doesnt like the federal reserve so trade he criticized bankers so buy bank stocks real investors know that they make changes to their investments based on what happens in their own lives if their goals change or there is a fundamental change in their financial situation then they consider an alteration but they would never make a change based on someone yelling buy or sell on television pretend investors think they need to monitor their investments all the time the little supercomputer they carry around in their pockets makes it so easy real investors know that it takes a long time for a tree to grow and it will not help to dig it up to see if the roots are still there the same rule applies to investments and because watching things get big slowly is not very exciting real investors tend not to talk about that tree all that much pretend investors talk about their investments a lot they say things like im long this or short that they use jargon that often does not make sense though it sounds kind of impressive if you dont listen too closely sometimes they cheer for things like increased consumer spending higher unemployment or in some cases war real investors understand the difference between the global economy and their personal economy and choose to focus on the latter pretend investors will worry endlessly about the news in some far off part of the world or the impact on their portfolio real investors focus on the things they can control like saving a bit more next year keeping their investment costs low not paying fees unless its necessary and managing their behavior by not buying high and selling again when prices are low pretend investors complain endlessly about volatility in the market and external actions that have short term impact on the big bets they have made on individual stocks real investors have enjoyed the benefits of a market that is up more than percent in the last years so ask yourself this isnt it finally time to stop pretending now
despite fears that dementia rates were going to explode as the population grows older and fatter and has more diabetes and high blood pressure a large nationally representative survey has found the reverse dementia is actually on the wane and when people do get dementia they get it at older and older ages previous studies found the same trend but involved much smaller and less diverse populations like the mostly white population of framingham mass and residents of a few areas in england and wales the new study found that the dementia rate in americans and older fell by percent over years to percent in from percent in that trend is statistically significant and impressive said samuel preston a demographer at the university of pennsylvania who was not associated with the study in people received a diagnosis of dementia at an average age of in the average age was the dementia rate is not immutable said dr richard hodes director of the national institute on aging it can change and that is very good news said john haaga director of the institutes division of behavioral and social research it means he said that roughly a million and a half people aged and older who do not have dementia now would have had it if the rate in had been in place keith fargo director of scientific programs and outreach at the alzheimers association said the group had been encouraged by some of the previous research showing a decline but had also been a little bit nervous about drawing conclusions because the populations in the earlier studies were so homogeneous now he said of the new data here is a nationally representative study its wonderful news an estimated four million to five million americans currently have dementia it remains the most expensive disease in america a study funded by the national institute on aging estimated that in it cost up to billion a year to care for dementia patients surpassing heart disease and cancer the study published online monday by the journal jama internal medicine included americans and older across all races education and income levels who participate in the health and retirement study which regularly surveys people and follows them as they age the national institute on aging funded the work but was not involved with the data collection analysis or interpretation to assess dementia participants were asked among other things to recall nouns immediately and after a delay to serially subtract seven from and to count backward from the test was based on extensive research indicating it was a good measure of memory and thinking skills participants also were asked about their education levels income and health in a way the dementia decline might seem unexpected it occurred despite an increase in diabetes the diabetes prevalence among older americans surged to percent in from percent in it began to fall only very recently and the study found diabetes increased the risk of dementia by percent more older people today also have cardiovascular risk factors high levels of blood pressure blood sugar and cholesterol which increase the risk of dementia but more are taking medications for those conditions so perhaps better control of those risk factors played a role in the decline the findings about obesity were especially puzzling compared with people of normal weight overweight people and obese people had a percent lower risk of dementia the study found underweight people had a risk times as great yet the obesity picture is muddled because other studies have found that obesity in middle age increases dementia risk in old age then there is the education question on average older americans in had one more year of schooling than older americans in and years of education were associated with decreased dementia risk in this study as in many others it is still not clear exactly why education would reduce the risk of dementia there is the cognitive reserve hypothesis that education changes developing brains in a good way making them more resistant to dementia and that people with more education have brains that are better able to compensate for dementia damage but education also is linked to more wealth people with more education often live in environments that differ from those of people who have less schooling and they tend to have better health over all they also are less likely to smoke as for black americans the dementia risk was higher but some possible reasons less education less wealth more cardiovascular risk factors did not fully explain the difference one possibility is that they received a poorer quality of education so each year of it offered less protection from dementia said the studys lead author dr kenneth langa in the end much of what is happening with dementia rates defies explanation said dr langa a professor of medicine at the university of michigan in ann arbor who also works in the veterans affairs health care system there dr denis evans a professor of medicine at rush university medical center in chicago urged caution in accepting the conclusion that dementia rates were declining and if they are in accepting the possible explanations although he had nothing but praise for the abilities of the researchers he noted that such studies were extremely difficult to do deciding if a respondent is demented can easily be inadvertently skewed he said its very complex dr evans said but the decline is consistent with what seems to be a long term trend despite researchers failure to find any effective way for individuals to protect themselves from alzheimers the most common form of dementia dr langa estimates that compared with the rate in the early there has been a to percent decrease in dementia rates among older americans as for the future that is hard to predict dr langa said even with the lower prevalence of dementia there will be many more older people in the united states over the next few decades especially people age and
san francisco for the last six years instagram has been a repository for users most picturesque moments but has been a year of reinvention for the photo sharing social network which has broadened what it lets people do with their images now instagram which is owned by facebook is rolling out two more new features on monday the company is unveiling one feature focused on live video and one on ephemeral messaging both tap into a type of sharing popularized in recent years by companies like snap inc which runs snapchat and twitter in its live streaming video app periscope we want instagram to be a place where you can share all of your moments to create a pressure free space to do so kevin weil head of product at instagram said in an interview mr weil said this philosophy and the feature choices that stem from it would encourage people to use instagram for more than the selected highly polished feeds for which it is known the new features thrust instagram more directly into competition with twitter and into a heightened rivalry with snap which is particularly notable as snap recently filed paperwork to go public instagram has steadily been introducing features to compete with snap this year it unveiled a feature called instagram stories which mimics a snapchat feature called snapchat stories in which people can organize their photos into a story line instagrams live video feature will be released to a small test group on monday a wider rollout is planned for the weeks to come the feature lets instagram users broadcast live video to their followers through the stories section of the app much as in twitters periscope friends and followers watching instagram live videos can comment and send cartoon hearts to the broadcaster during the stream but live instagram videos are meant to be fleeting and cannot be saved to watch later that gives broadcasters room to express themselves more fully mr weil said without the added pressure of the raw video sticking around indefinitely instagrams other new feature disappearing photos and videos within the companys private messaging tool will be available to all its users while an ephemeral live broadcast may be seen by many disappearing messages are for the few usually friends or family in a tighter circle than the wider audience of followers disappearing messages were made famous by snapchat which was able to draw a generation of young regular users snapchat rose to prominence in a post facebook era of social media one in which people grew fond of the idea that their digital history did not have to follow them around the internet in perpetuity mr weil defended the companys move into ephemeral sharing and pointed to improvements and product adjustments that he said highlighted instagrams innovation with the format the format is definitely something that snapchat innovated on mr weil said but its just like how hashtags started on twitter and are used everywhere i think this particular format is one that we will see adopted everywhere else
ten days removed from the still fresh shock of donald trumps election around lunchtime on a friday i navigated the jagged lines of steel barriers police officers and secret service battalions with big dogs and big guns surrounding trump tower the glass and marble shopping mall tourist trap and tv set had been transformed into the unlikely plotting ground for the nations immediate future it was anybodys guess what was taking shape inside the gilded bunkers clots of media people passers by and protesters crowded the lobby and nearby streets for the occasional clue or at least glimpses of marla maples and prime minister shinzo abe of japan kellyanne conway posed for a selfie with a few lucky cops the locus of the scene was a bank of elevators ferrying staff cabinet candidates and the competing maestros of the trump transition to and from various nerve centers over several floors every time a bell sounded announcing the opening of an elevator door lobby heads would bob expectantly is that what jeff sessions looks like i heard a photographer ask no doubt a host of key trump orchestrators and luminary actors were making ample use of auxiliary entrances and exits sneaking in and out new rumors predictions and potential firestorms seemed to materialize every hour the kremlinology of the incoming white house is shaping up as knotty to say the least not one of trumps initial high level hires has any experience working in a white house how will they work with the volatile real estate and reality show maven in the oval office with his proclivity to make decisions based on the last person he speaks to with his children playing an uncertain role his son in law a possibly ever present whisperer how will it all work with trumps senior adviser steve bannon former head of breitbart news who has a long rap sheet of racial ethnic and sexist affronts and a long running war on washington republicans i had gone to trump tower to see reince priebus the republican national committee chairman whom trump named as his chief of staff five days after his election in the same release in which bannon was named chief strategist and senior counselor bannon was mentioned first for kremlinologists scoring at home and his appointment has consumed the bulk of the attention given his hyperprovocative ways but priebus in a sense filled a more exotic role he would be the chief establishment ambassador for a president whose brief and meteoric political career has been predicated on blowing that establishment up a generous reading is that trump is trying to foster a yin yang tension between his top deputies who will represent his own diametrically opposed impulses the simpler reading is that trump hasnt thought that much about this and is simply trying to reward and surround himself with people he feels served him well in the campaign its almost like a puzzle mystery priebus told me last summer i dont recall what we were talking about but priebus had a knack for homespun wisconsin logic and particularly throwaway lines that would stick with me i kept thinking of the puzzle mysteries that were playing out up and down trump tower even though i showed up friday without an appointment with priebus and was confined to the lobby watching tourists ride up and down its now famous escalators priebus and i started talking last spring as i was undertaking an article for this magazine about the seemingly fracturing state of the republican party we kept in touch during the campaign drank the occasional miller high life in his office and exchanged the sporadic email priebus was constantly going on tv saying he was certain trump would win even though he could read polls and precedents like everyone else still he carried on as the chief carrier of trumps choppy water because thats what a party chairman does he smiles and spins and swallows his best laid plans and audibles in the name of getting his nominee to the finish line in a sense priebus who squired his future wife to a local g o p banquet on their first date was the purest form of political hack that trump would rail against as he bulldozed the g o p for his efforts during the campaign priebus gained the respect and gratitude of trump loyalists especially the fiercest loyalist donald j trump himself he also won derision and ridicule he was the subject of multiple stories in the onion his spirited tv defenses of trumps indefensible behavior drew him comparisons to baghdad bob saddam husseins chief propagandist during the early months of the iraq war whose dubious predictions of imminent victory despite growing devastation all around made him an international laughingstock long before trumps victory back when it seemed like a long shot i asked priebus whether he would consider taking a job in a trump administration maybe a plum ambassadorship to somewhere yes he said wisconsin it was a throwaway answer to a throwaway question which was laughably hypothetical anyway but i never had a sense he had thought that much about a trump administration job besides possibly staying on as r n c chairman whether or not the donald prevailed for all his well honed sheepishness

aman was on a train in japan reading a novel set in japan the train slid past the mountains bound for kyoto where the man bearded bright eyed was headed the year was the train was a bullet train the man on the train was in a quandary and the man in the novel he was reading was in a quandary and as he read the novel it emerged that his quandary and the one in the novel were essentially the same the man in the novel was sebastian rodrigues a portuguese jesuit priest sent to japan in the century he was there to minister to japanese catholics suffering under a brutal regime and also to find out what had happened to his mentor a priest rumored to have renounced the faith under torture the man on the train was martin scorsese he was in japan to play the part of vincent van gogh in a movie by akira kurosawa another master filmmaker he was also there to move past a brutal battle in americas culture wars over a picture of his the last temptation of christ the film had been pilloried by conservative christians for a dream sequence in which christ has sex with mary magdalene in depicting christs life as a doubt ridden struggle between his human and divine natures scorsese had intended to make a film that was at once an act of doubt and an act of faith in the novel he was reading the priest was shown profaning an image of christ and yet the act was an act of faith the train slid past the mountains scorsese turned the pages this novel spoke to him all at once he saw it as a picture he would like to make the novel was silence by shusaku endo a japanese convert steeped in european literature and the history of catholicism in japan published in japan in silence sold copies a huge number in that country endo was called the japanese graham greene and was considered for the nobel prize greene referred to silence as one of the finest novels of our time the jesuit missionary francis xavier brought catholicism to japan in in the next century it was suppressed through the torture of missionaries and their followers who were forced to apostatize by stepping on the a piece of copper impressed with an image of christ in silence endo took the missionaries point of view casting much of the novel in the form of letters by rodrigues reporting back to his superior he goes to japan with another young priest francisco garrpe vowing to seek the truth about their mentor father cristvo ferreira but they are captured and shown the dogma defying reality of human suffering under torture the shogunate invites the japanese converts to avoid torture by stepping on the many do some are tortured anyway rodrigues sees converts crucified burned alive drowned a magistrate fluent in christianity makes a grim proposal rodrigues can save the lives of the converts under torture if only he will step on the and apostatize when scorsese returned from japan he procured the film rights to silence as the years passed hardly a day went by without his mentioning the project to the people around him actors friends and even his old parish priest father principe as he made the aviator and the departed shutter island and hugo he insisted that silence was the picture he really wanted to make a jesuit was elected pope islamic terrorists began targeting christians in the middle east in with the wolf of wall street a hit scorsese declared that silence would be his next picture he wouldnt commit to another until it was finished twenty six years in filming began what led this great american artist to make a story of missionaries in japan his ultimate passion project he is known for his gangster pictures he is a grandmaster of the profane from the beginning he has revealed himself to be an artist of intensely catholic preoccupations and the poisoned arrow of religious conflict runs straight through his career taxi driver a vietnam vet as a spiritual avenger bent on cleansing the city of filth through violence cape fear a tattooed fundamentalist determined to exact gods justice kundun a young man raised to be a spiritual master thrust up against spirit killing communism even living in the material world scorseses documentary about george harrison takes as its theme the conflict between flesh and spirit between beatle and seeker silence is a novel for our time it locates in the missionary past so many of the religious matters that vex us in the postsecular present the claims to universal truths in diverse societies the conflict between a profession of faith and the expression of it and the seeming silence of god while believers are drawn into violence on his behalf as material for scorsese then silence is apt and yet scorseses commitment to it has been extraordinary even by his exacting standards to understand that commitment i spoke with the filmmaker with members of the cast and the production team and with others who know the novel well trying to grasp just what kind of an act of faith this film is i dont know if theres redemption but there is such a thing as trying to get it right scorsese said to me in the ungentrified new york voice familiar from the cameos in his movies but how do you do it the right way to live has to do with selflessness i believe that but how does one act that out i dont think you practice it consciously it has to be something that develops in you maybe through a lot of mistakes he had invited me to his east side townhouse at p m having spent a full day editing silence in midtown the living room high ceilinged oak paneled is decorated with a vintage movie camera billboard size posters
seoul south korea a popular south korean singer lee seung chul recently posted on twitter what he called a sad joke that reflected public outrage over a scandal involving the countrys president park geun hye if hillary is elected the united states will have its first female president if trump is elected it will have its first crazy president went the joke which was widely shared online south korea got both in ms parks victory was hailed as a milestone for south koreas deeply patriarchal society but four years later pressure is mounting across the country and even from within her party for ms park to step down or face impeachment this week she became south koreas first sitting president to be accused by prosecutors of a criminal conspiracy the scandal surrounding ms park has left many south korean women infuriated with the president and fearful that it could be used to argue that women are unfit to lead they worry that the country already among the lowest in global gender equality rankings could become even more resistant to elevating women to positions of power we have had more than our share of outrageous male politicians said kim yun jeong who had a placard that said park geun hye out at a recent demonstration in seoul the capital but i feel men now saying behind our back and with a smirk on their faces see this is what we get when we have a woman president for a change ms parks troubles stem from her decades of ties to choi soon sil a daughter of choi tae min the founder of a fringe religious sect who befriended ms park in the ms choi was indicted sunday on charges of using her influence with ms park to extort millions from businesses prosecutors said ms park was an accomplice of ms choi but she is protected by the constitution from criminal indictment ms park has agreed to submit to an inquiry but on tuesday her lawyer yoo yeong ha tried to use ms parks gender as a shield saying that she was a woman before being president and that her privacy as a woman should be protected from prosecutors who sought to question her womens groups were having none of it they are not investigating her privacy as a woman but her acts of destroying constitutional order as president a group of womens advocacy organizations said in a joint statement south koreas women have been just as loud as its men in denouncing ms park recent polls have found her to be deeply unpopular among both men and women and in the huge protests that have filled central seoul over the past four weekends women have often led peaceful marches an unusual sight in south korea where anti government demonstrations often feature men clashing with riot police officers during a nov rally that attracted one million people by some estimates a student from the sacred heart girls high school in seoul ms parks alma mater took the podium you have become an object of shame for us the student said of ms park prompting wild cheers from the crowd we can no longer tolerate you representing our nation although ms park is often called south koreas first female president that label fails to capture the complicated ways in which people here regard her presidency ms park has never been considered a champion of womens rights either as the president or as a legislator before that according to kim young soon a leader at the korean womens associations united gender inequality has actually worsened under ms park with sex crimes on the rise and a growing wealth gap taking a harder toll on women her presidential campaign was aimed at securing the support of older conservatives who still revered her father the military dictator park chung hee for leading the country out of poverty in the and many saw in ms park a modern version of her charismatic father south koreans like to say that they see ms park not as a female president but as park chung hees daughter that places her in a peculiar and precarious position in south korea where patriarchy rules the political and corporate worlds a widely shared twitter post last year summed up the challenges ms park has faced in the shadow of her fathers legacy and with the cultural misgivings over female leaders when president park geun hye does well she wears the clothes of park chung hee but when she does badly she becomes a woman so far ms parks gender has not been an outright issue in the scandal but it has colored the outrage older conservative men who have turned against ms park since the scandal often disdainfully refer to her as an unfilial daughter online men have attacked ms park and ms choi by invoking an old korean diatribe against assertive women if a hen crows the household collapses in the local news media photographs have emerged that show urinals painted with images of ms park and ms choi people have derided ms choi who has no background in government or policy making as an ajumma or homemaker from gangnam a seoul district often associated with affluence and moral weakness president park is taken as evidence that women are not qualified for politics a feminist group said last week protesting what it called gender prejudices tainting the campaign against ms park ms park has seldom spoken of her gender but she has styled herself after her mother yuk young soo who is seen as a symbol of feminine sacrifice among older koreans the former first lady was fatally shot in by a pro north korean assassin who had targeted her husband for decades ms parks hairstyle has reminded people of her mother she has also built a muscular political reputation in what some analysts have called an attempt to dispel the notion that a female leader would be weak on security issues

president elect donald j trumps wife melania and their year old son barron will not immediately move to the white house after mr trump takes office in january out of concern for uprooting barron in the middle of the school year transition officials said on sunday ms trump and barron will remain in new york for at least another six months the officials said speaking to reporters on sunday at his golf course in bedminster n j mr trump said they would join him very soon after hes finished with school mr trump said he would move to the white house still with his family remaining at trump tower the likelihood may increase that mr trump will spend part of the week in new york jason miller a spokesman for mr trump said no official statement has been released by the trump family regarding transition timing but like any parents they are concerned about pulling their year old son out of school in the middle of the year mr miller urged that the same privacy and security considerations given to previous first families with regard to minor children be extended to the trumps as well the new york times previously reported that ms trump was planning to move to the white house eventually but was concerned about disrupting her sons routine the new york post reported on sunday that she and barron would not join her husband immediately after the inauguration for all of the enthusiasm that the president elect displayed on the campaign trail ms trump a former model never shared in it she did not join her husband other than for major events like the republican national convention and she granted few interviews she is the main caregiver for their son who attends a private school in manhattan and is taken there most days by his mother she is said to be concerned not just about the potential disruption to her sons life but also about bringing him closer to the news media spotlight people who know her have said she plans to revisit the issue at the end of the school year the situation is similar in ways to the one michelle obama faced in after her husband was elected mrs obama also did not care for the attention that came with the campaign and she was said to be considering remaining in chicago with their two daughters but she ultimately made the move with their children mr trump and his aides have not said whether he plans to move to the white house full time but he has told aides he would like to be in new york when he can keeping trump tower as a residence for the incoming presidents family will create security and logistical hurdles for the secret service and the police department the tower is on fifth avenue a major thoroughfare
friday night the facebook co founder mark zuckerberg went on his vast social network to convince an expanding chorus of critics including the departing president of the united states that he honest to goodness wants to combat the fake news that is running wild across his site and others and turning our politics into a paranoiac fantasy come to life weve been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility seriously he wrote weve made significant progress but there is more work to be done he continued listing various steps facebook was taking like making it easier to report bad information and enlisting fact checking organizations it was heartening to hear especially after his earlier assertion that it was crazy to believe that misinformation on facebook had affected the presidential election in any real way despite copious evidence that it was disturbingly in the mix whether it directly swung the result or not but as mr zuckerberg went on to say that facebook had to be careful not to mistakenly block accurate content he added this we do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves which was why he said facebook would continue to rely on our community and trusted third parties his statement pointed up how much facebook struggles to find the balance between its mission to be a free expression utopia for its billion users and its responsibility to protect them from all that is defamatory dangerous and untrue but more to the point it appeared to buy into the notion that truth is relative at a time when that notion has to finally go away do you really need an outside arbiter to determine whether a video suggesting without basis that hillary clinton was involved in john f kennedy jr s fatal plane crash in should be allowed to stand truth doesnt need arbiters it needs defenders and it needs them now more than ever as the american democracy staggers into its next uncertain phase with a mainstream news media that works hard to separate fact from fiction under economic and political threat facebook which has contributed to that economic threat by gobbling up so much of the online advertising market is going to have a special responsibility to do its part just imagine what things will look like if the unsavory elements that tore through the election false narratives fake news and aggressive efforts to delegitimize traditional journalism come back into play as donald j trump presses to enact his agenda if the past week provided any indication of where politics are going the next four years are going to require an all hands on deck effort to keep the national conversation honest the national security adviser mr trump named last week michael t flynn a retired army lieutenant general has subscribed to the conspiracy theory that shariah law is taking root in the united states contributing to his insistence that americans have every reason to view islam as a threat he recently used twitter to circulate a fake news item that the federal bureau of investigation was sitting on evidence from anthony weiners laptop that would put hillary and her crew away for life mr trumps nominee for attorney general senator jeff sessions of alabama has falsely claimed that hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants are successfully crossing the border annually then there was the announcement by the conspiracy theorist alex jones that mr trump had called to thank him and his radio and internet audience for their support in the campaign add to that the fact that mr trump was the most prominent promoter of the false notion that president obama wasnt born here and didnt hesitate to repeat the outrageous suggestion that the father of senator ted cruz was linked to the assassination of president john f kennedy then consider what it may look like when mr trump pursues policies regarding muslim immigrants and undocumented immigrants its not so outlandish to envision mr trumps attempts to sell his plans getting a lift from the likes of mr jones or a fake site out of macedonia perhaps claiming that democrats are working with isis to use undocumented immigrants to poison local water supplies or some such president obama seemed to have had something like that in mind when he told reporters in germany on thursday if we are not serious about facts and whats true and whats not and if we cant discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda then we have problems mr obama knows of what he speaks he had to muddle through the first wave of this you might remember how his health care plan was marred by a false accusation that the plan included so called death panels that would decide who lived and who died based on their level of productivity to society as former gov sarah palin put it the false death panel allegation was partly based on proposals to reimburse doctors for optional consultations with families over end of life care decisions the accusations took on such power that even newt gingrich signed on to the falsehood despite the fact that he had previously expressed bullish support for end of life planning news organizations including this one debunked the myth but the bills authors stripped out the provision just the same and by then the death panel fiction had negated any shot at a reasoned ideological debate as dan pfeiffer who was the presidents chief communications strategist at the time so grimly put it to me last week the faux death panels were the canary in the coal mine about the coming death of truth things have advanced since then todays fake news is limited only by the imaginations of its inventors and the number of shares it can garner on facebook or twitter thats why people who care about the truth citizens journalists and lets hope social media giants like facebook too will have to come up with a solution to
for a brand seeking to reach the podcast listening public there is one thing better than sponsoring a hit series creating your own general electric pulled it off last year with its quaintly named ge podcast theater its eight part science fiction thriller the message produced with the panoply podcasting network hit no on the itunes podcast chart and had nearly five million downloads now comes lifeafter a futuristic episode drama the first installment of which was released this month it tells the story of a low level worker at the federal bureau of investigation who is obsessed with the traces of life his dead wife left behind on social media particularly a fictional audio service the first episode kicks off with what sounds like an ad for that service but perhaps thats a wink of sorts as with the message a notable detail in this branding experiment is that the sponsoring brand is by design almost never mentioned distributing and helping create such sponsor content has been part of panoplys business for a while think of it as a variation on the so called native advertising or branded content now so familiar online material flagged as having been paid for but crafted to resemble editorial content according to matt turck panoplys chief revenue officer the company has produced more than episodes of custom podcast series for brands including purina umpqua bank prudential and starbucks its been an important part of our business he said it generates revenue and differentiates us in the marketplace that last part may change for example another podcast network gimlet media now has a unit called gimlet creative which this year created a six episode branded podcast for ebay called open for business panoply spun out of the podcast unit of the online magazine slate in positioning itself as a platform for shows produced with partners like the wall street journal and vox as well as its own roster of programs relatively quickly mr turck said the possibility of sponsored shows was added to the mix g e which previously worked with slate custom the sites sponsored content division and became intrigued by podcasting ended up being one of the first examples but its approach has been distinct most sponsored podcasts follow a fairly traditional hosts and interviews format the decision to turn the message into a multipart series was inspired in part by the runaway success of the true crime podcast serial but the fictional form was an attempt to do something different a new way of reprising the kind of radio dramas of the said alexa christon head of media innovation for g e one of the plot twists in the message its story unfolded as a fake podcast documenting efforts to decode an alien communiqu was loosely inspired by sound therapy technology that g e is working on but since that connection is never mentioned most listeners probably never got it the name ge podcast theater is noted at the beginning and end of the series and on the cover art people see when playing an episode on smartphones but thats it andy goldberg g e s chief creative officer said this was in line with the companys branded entertainment work in other media such as the six episode science series breakthrough made last year in collaboration with the national geographic channel too many references to the sponsor turns people off mr goldberg said people knew it was ge podcast theater he said suggesting that listeners gave the company a lot of credit for keeping a light touch backing up that assertion is tricky one of the widely noted shortcomings of podcast advertising is the dearth of detailed audience data outside of download numbers ms christon said g e judged the success of the message partly by way of the organic groups that have sprung up in places like reddit swapping plot theories and even generating fan fiction g e used a similar method to create lifeafter the internal marketing group zeroed in on the companys digital twin research which seeks to precisely replicate physical objects applying that idea to humans was a jumping off point for a fictional story fleshed out in collaboration with the creative agency bbdo the agency giant spoon and panoply panoply essentially runs the production out of its studios with its team of sound engineers and producers helping recruit writers and voice actors this was the most collaborative effort that ive worked on said mr turck of panoply of course the success of the message added some pressure and the more crowded the podcast market becomes including a wave of fiction shows the harder it is to break through weve got very high expectations mr turck said adding that the first episode of lifeafter cracked the top on itunes within a week of its release the most prominent form of podcast sponsorship remains the familiar advertising break often referring to specific instructions for listeners to get a discount or other offer a direct response style that makes ad performance more bluntly measurable but mr turck says plenty of clients want to experiment he points to prudentials moneymind project with panoply which involves taking a finance themed sponsored quiz on slate that leads to a podcast episode chosen according to your answers some marketers want to brainstorm others want advice attitudes vary on formats and how heavy handed the branding should be the only thing thats consistent he said is that theres just more and more interest neither g e nor panoply would disclose specifics about costs but mr goldberg acknowledges that compared with say film or tv even a slick sounding podcast is not a massive expense and despite the challenges in measuring the impact it also means an opportunity for g e to insert itself however obliquely into broader cultural conversations lifeafter will ultimately address such trendy topics as artificial intelligence and the possibility of a digital afterlife its a means ms christon said for doing
kanye west likened himself to donald j trump at a concert on saturday in california before tumbling into a minute free associative speech addressing radio programmers mtv his friends and collaborators jay z and beyonc hillary clinton mark zuckerberg and more after getting an array of grievances off his chest from real world politics to awards show politics mr west ended the performance with a microphone drop having played only three songs leaving fans bitter and upset according to reactions on social media its a new world hillary clinton its a new world mr west said from his floating platform stage above the crowd feelings matter because guess what everybody in middle america felt a way and they showed you how they felt the brief concert at the golden center in sacramento came two nights after mr west shocked his audience by announcing at a show in san jose calif that he had not voted but would have cast a ballot for mr trump if he had though the rapper affirmed his belief in the importance of issues like black lives matter and womens rights he praised mr trumps method of communication as very futuristic on saturday night in a trademark polemic the likes of which had been mostly absent from his current saint pablo tour mr west doubled down on his embrace of trump like political incorrectness and opined on the state of the media yeah im taking his lead mr west said of the president elect a lot of people here tonight felt like they lost the rapper began you know why because yall been lied to google lied to you facebook lied to you radio lied to you turning his focus on the music industry mr west questioned gatekeepers for promoting songs by drake but not frank ocean and wondered once again why he is often overlooked at awards shows referring to this years mtv video music awards mr west pulled back the curtain on what he said was the political behind the scenes dealings that go into booking celebrities for such events beyonc i was hurt because i heard that you said you wouldnt perform unless you won video of the year over me and over hotline bling he said sometimes we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win he continued ive been sitting here to give yall my truth even at the risk of my own life even at the risk of my own success my own career however mr west said such truth telling was necessary for real progress obama couldnt make america great because he couldnt be him to be who he was he said black men have been slaves obama wasnt allowed to do this the rapper screamed and still win he had to be perfect but being perfect dont always change things when more music failed to follow the impromptu stump speech disappointed fans turned to social media to demand refunds on sunday the golden center announced that ticketholders would be paid back in full including ticketmaster fees on monday a representative for mr west said that remaining dates on the second leg of the saint pablo tour have been canceled even amid his raw spontaneous and sometimes rambling monologue mr west seemed to know he was courting controversy im not always going to say things the perfect way the right way he said but im going to say how i feel he added get ready to have a field day press get ready get ready because the shows over
beijing zhou yunfei a technology executive who owns a villa in eastern china did not have much in common with an impoverished farmer more than miles away who was convicted of murdering a village chief with a nail gun but when mr zhou heard last week that the chinese government had executed the farmer jia jinglong he was furious he saw it as a sign that the ruling communist party was imposing harsh punishments on the most vulnerable members of society while coddling the well connected elite the legal system isnt fair mr zhou said adding that local officials had turned against the common people president xi jinping has made restoring confidence in chinese courts a centerpiece of his rule vowing to promote social justice and equality in a legal system long plagued by favoritism and abuse since coming to power in he has led a high profile campaign against corruption ensnaring thousands of low level officials and even some of the partys most senior leaders but the furor over the execution of mr jia who had sought revenge on officials for demolishing his home has raised doubts about mr xis efforts with people across the country publicly assailing inequities in the justice system and asking why high level officials often escape the death penalty the perception is that the people are powerless and vulnerable against corrupt officials said fu hualing a law professor at the university of hong kong what is surprising is that xi jinping has been in power for four years and that narrative has not changed the uproar has placed the party which is working to tighten its grip on courts while promoting the idea of fairness in an awkward position mr xi has cultivated an image as a champion of the people willing to take on corrupt officials of any stripe yet mr jias case has reawakened concerns especially among rural residents and members of the urban working class that the communist party is protecting its own members in fiery social media posts and dinner table conversations some have argued for making punishments against corrupt officials more severe others have suggested that china believed to be the worlds top executioner should substantially reduce its use of the death penalty against impoverished citizens chinas leaders seem conflicted about how to respond to complaints of unfair treatment which have plagued the judiciary for decades but have taken on new urgency as mr xi attempts a top to bottom overhaul of the system on the one hand party leaders might be wary of exacerbating the anger felt by many chinese people who often side with villagers like mr jia seeing them as folk heroes standing up against venal forces at the same time beijing might not want to be seen as endorsing an attack on a government official and some party leaders may not like the idea of setting a precedent for using the death penalty against senior officials at a time when critics of mr xi say he is using the anticorruption campaign to go after political enemies theres a strong incentive for the elite within the party to protect itself said jerome a cohen a new york university law professor people realize today theyre free but tomorrow they could be the targets in recent days the partys hesitation has seeped into public view the government at first appeared to tolerate and even encourage debate about mr jias case lawyers issued open letters pointing to flaws in the prosecutions argument and state media outlets published sanctimonious editorials calling for the court to show humanity but as discontent spread on social media in the days leading up to mr jias execution the government reversed course and began censoring some online discussions about the case state run media organizations adopted a scolding tone warning that public opinion had hijacked the case peoples daily the partys flagship newspaper went a step further arguing that citizens should not express contrarian views about court cases in public we can see that online public opinion can deviate from reason and even become a terrifying tool that kills humanity and conscience an editorial in the newspaper said while the government has historically tolerated some debate about judicial decisions mr xi has generally sought to rein in dissent especially when it gathers force online li wei an activist in beijing who was imprisoned for two years under mr xi for helping organize protests demanding financial disclosures from party leaders circulated a four page petition online in late october calling for mr jia to be spared and for the government to adopt a more humane justice system soon his cellphone was buzzing with messages from university students professors security guards and others he gathered signatures over a few days he said before the authorities shut down his social media accounts the so called anticorruption campaign is not genuine mr li said in an interview at a beijing teahouse the reason why they were doing this is because they want to salvage the communist party regime chinese leaders appear to be working to counter perceptions that officials are being treated with kid gloves over the past year party leaders have vowed to consider punishing officials who commit grave crimes including stealing more than about with the death penalty they have also introduced new forms of punishment aimed at corrupt officials including lifetime jail sentences without the possibility of parole but the government has yet to systematically invoke any of those punishments against prominent officials and critics can point to a raft of recent cases in which powerful people and their families escaped the death penalty there is the example of zhou yongkang chinas former security chief who was sentenced to life in prison last year for taking bribes and revealing state secrets he was the most senior leader to be jailed for corruption in more than years of communist rule and many people note the case of gu kailai the wife of one of chinas most prominent
jerusalem dogged for decades by scandals ranging from the funding of family trips to enormous ice cream bills prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel is again under scrutiny this time over a billion dollar deal with germany for the acquisition of three new submarines political opponents are calling for an inquiry into what they view as the murky circumstances surrounding the framework agreement reached with germany over the past year apparently at mr netanyahus urging to buy the boats mr netanyahu one of israels longest serving prime ministers who is now serving a fourth term in office faces allegations of a possible conflict of interest within his inner circle in making the deal the issue came to light when israels channel news reported last week that mr netanyahus personal lawyer also represents the israeli agent of the german shipyard that builds the submarines thyssenkrupp marine systems both mr netanyahu and the lawyer david shimron have denied any impropriety the security of israel requires the acquisition of submarines and the renewal of the submarine fleet mr netanyahu said on sunday in remarks broadcast at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting increasing the security and strength of the state of israel is the only consideration that guided me in acquiring the submarines the justice ministry issued a statement later sunday saying the attorney generals office was examining the matter at this stage it has decided not to involve the police there were conflicting reports in the israeli news media on whether the three submarines were meant to replace aging ones or to increase israels current fleet of five submarines with a sixth to be delivered in submarines ordered now would not go into service for another decade moshe yaalon a former israeli defense minister who resigned in may after mr netanyahu promised his job to another politician wrote on twitter that he had strenuously opposed increasing the fleet by three submarines saying the military did not need them israeli security experts said it was the prime ministers prerogative to make such strategic decisions about increasing or updating the fleet but israeli commentators have focused on the role of mr shimron mr netanyahus lawyer a statement issued by the prime ministers office on thursday said that mr shimron had never discussed submarines with mr netanyahu the first mr netanyahu knew of mr shimron representing the businessman linked to the naval project it said was when channel asked for a response to its report yair lapid the leader of a centrist opposition party said that if mr netanyahu did not know he should have why did the germans retain shimron mr lapid asked on israels channel news saying it was not because of his expertise in submarines they retained him because he is the man closest to the israeli prime minister mr lapid said the germans knew that the prime ministers personal lawyer was working for them and we didnt know mr shimron has denied any ethical offense in not reporting his association with miki ganor the israeli representative of the german shipyard but some israeli analysts were skeptical given mr shimrons ties to mr netanyahu on sunday the political columnist ben dror yemini wrote in yediot aharonot after all this is the prime ministers royal attorney who is also a private attorney and the netanyahu family lawyer and also a lawyer who serves as the prime ministers official representative he has a finger in every pot and it was netanyahu of all people who did not know that shimron was involved with the submarines strange
san salvador on a sultry evening in late july the salvadoran authorities executed their very first assault on what they called the financial cupola of mara salvatrucha or ms the largest of the ruthless gangs that have made el salvador the murder capital of the world until that point the national civil police had followed an almost choreographed routine again and again as they sought to cripple the gangs economically in the dead of night often accompanied by television cameras officers would batter down the doors of ramshackle houses in marginalized communities and then arrest and put on display a cluster of tattooed and half naked men between and the total amount confiscated in these showy anti extortion raids was an absurdly tiny sum considering that the united states has designated ms as a global criminal organization on a par with the zetas of mexico or the yakuza of japan on july however in a mission baptized operation check the authorities shifted gears they deployed police officers to raid scores of supposed gang fronts including car dealerships and bars motels and brothels with great fanfare they presented to the news media rows and rows of impounded buses and cars along with suspects identified as the financial operatives of ms and their collaborators among them were the supposed c e o of the street gang marvin ramos quintanilla and two other leaders portrayed as controlling millions and possessing luxuries unimaginable to the destitute gang members beneath them but the presentation was something of an exaggeration as are many official characterizations of the gangs whose criminal sophistication and global reach tend to be overstated by authorities frustrated that they cannot vanquish them for instance that supposed chief executive officer hardly lived like a kingpin he leased a squat concrete house with a corrugated roof in a neighborhood where rents rarely reach he owned an old honda civic and a nissan van in collaboration with the new york times el faro a digital newspaper based in san salvador sought to pierce the secrecy surrounding the finances of the gangs that terrorize el salvador which is experiencing a level of deadly violence unparalleled outside war zones homicides per residents last year compared with five in the united states with an estimated members in a country of million people the gangs hold power disproportionate to their numbers they maintain a menacing presence in of municipalities they extort about percent of businesses they dislodge entire communities from their homes and help propel thousands of salvadorans to undertake dangerous journeys to the united states their violence costs el salvador billion a year according to a study by the countrys central reserve bank and yet the reporting determined ms and its rival street gangs in el salvador are not sophisticated transnational criminal enterprises they do not begin to belong in the same financial league with the billion dollar mexican japanese and russian syndicates with which they are grouped if they are mafias they are mafias of the poor el salvador has been brought to its knees by an army of flies ms annual revenue appears to be about million that estimate is based on information in the page file of operation check to which el faro got exclusive access wiretapped conversations reveal that the gangs national leadership ordered its programs or chapters to turn over all the money earned in a single typical week which happened to be in april it collected it sounds like a lot of money but if divided equitably among the estimated members of ms each gang member would earn a week and about a month that is half the minimum wage of an agricultural day laborer but the gangs ms and its main rival the street gang do not distribute their proceeds equitably they use them to pay for lawyers and funeral services for weapons and munitions and for the support of those serving long prison terms and their families theirs is a criminal subsistence economy even many of their leaders are barely solvent that the authorities call them businessmen either their intelligence is invalid or its pretty crude said rolando monroy a former salvadoran prosecutor who oversaw money laundering investigations until the gangs are like an anthill they are all after the same thing something to eat unlike other groups considered global organized crime syndicates the salvadoran gangs do not survive on the international trafficking of cocaine arms and humans while they dabble in small time drug dealing gun sales and prostitution they engage primarily in a single crime committed over and over within salvadoran territory extortion inside el salvador they hold the reins of power largely because of a chilling demand

not we are going to burn one of your new minibuses it was signed by the street gang sends its best at p m on a summer day in two young gang members intercepted a businessman as he was returning home from work i have kids calm down please he managed to say before the youths grabbed him threw him to the ground and shot him in a shoulder in the stomach and twice in the face they were delivering a message written in lead it was because of the extortion not for any other reason the mans son said the man owned a bus his son who also owned a bus said his father tired of being extorted had finally stopped making his daily payment to the gang three weeks before his death it murdered him because of among salvadoran businesses transportation companies whose vehicles crisscross gang territory have proved especially vulnerable to extortion over the last five years it has been more dangerous to drive a bus than to fight gang crime the gangs have killed transportation workers and police officers

london during a tennis season pockmarked by match fixing reports high profile doping busts sexist comments by tournament directors and superstars sidelined by injuries tanking would seem to be low on the list of priorities yet with only the atp world tour finals and the davis cup final between croatia and argentina left on the calendar a deliberate lack of effort on the part of players has emerged as a pressing topic its something that were looking at very closely said chris kermode the atps chief executive atp officials are grappling with the knotty issue because some of the sports up and coming male stars have been perceived to be thumbing their noses at the game the talented but volatile nick kyrgios was suspended last month for disrespecting fans his opponents and the sport deliberately trying to lose which violates the best effort clause in the atps code of conduct is a serious offense it cuts to the heart of the games integrity in an era when bettors can wager on individual games and points in matches across the globe it raises additional match fixing worries but like obscenity tanking can be hard to define even if most people believe they know it when they see it its a difficult one to police the top ranked andy murray said last week at the world tour finals the atps elite year end event in london effort or the perception of effort is subjective and situational one players tanking is anothers tactical act of disruption depending on the circumstance it could be a conscious decision to throw away a couple of games or points to conserve physical or emotional energy for a coming decisive set in interviews last week in london several former and current players admitted to periodic lack of effort when for whatever reason they had mentally checked out is that worthy of punishment its a gray area isnt it said tim henman the former british standout who is now a bbc commentator this years united states open semifinal between novak djokovic and gal monfils vividly expressed this tension trailing by in the first set monfils began to loop and chip balls back into the center of the court barely moving his feet on television john mcenroe criticized his effort and called it borderline unprofessional the strange tactics worked monfils who did not receive a warning from the umpire pulled the score back to and went on to play more conventionally in a four set defeat he later defended his tactics and said they were a gutsy attempt to work his way back into the match there was little ambiguity when kyrgios threw away a second round match against mischa zverev who was ranked outside the top at the shanghai masters last month the ranked kyrgios a year old australian gave little effort during the defeat at one point tapping in a first serve midway through the first set and walking toward the sideline before his opponent had struck his return kyrgios went on to tell the umpire to call time so he could finish this match and go home he argued with fans in the stands he disparaged the paying public in comments to the news media afterward kyrgios was fined a total of for lack of best effort unsportsmanlike conduct and verbal abuse of a spectator after further review the atp gave him an additional penalty and effectively suspended him for the rest of the season while encouraging him to see a sports psychologist while the umpire ali nili spoke to kyrgios about his performance after his dubious serve he never issued a warning for tanking obviously there were missed opportunities to take official action said gayle david bradshaw the executive vice president for rules and competition at the atp kyrgios is not the only perpetrator of desultory efforts this season his fellow australian bernard tomic inverted his racket and tried to return serve with the handle on match point in a loss to fabio fognini in madrid he was fined for unsportsmanlike conduct tomic has a history of suspect efforts and off court run ins with authorities that have earned him the nickname tomic the tank engine he also had a defeat to jarkko nieminen in that lasted minutes the quickest match since the atp began keeping records in these and other incidents in a long and enervating season have prompted bradshaw to step up efforts to deal with tanking bradshaw said the atp intends to streamline its procedures to publicize egregious cases and push them up the chain of review more quickly the tour is considering more than doubling on site fines for various code violations including best effort in the current maximum is bradshaw also plans to give tanking renewed emphasis at his annual gathering with umpires and supervisors at the atp americas headquarters in florida this month he said he had to make sure that officials arent afraid to step in when they see it bradshaw added i dont want them to be trigger happy but its something we cant keep saying you should have done the key for umpires is keeping a players style and history in mind along with factors like the score and the weather its so subjective in every single case said ross hutchins a former doubles specialist now serving as the atps chief player officer its always a balance do you speak to him do you warn him do you tell him do you ban him do you default him its all in that very moment that the umpire has to make a decision murray the thoughtful and outspoken scot said kyrgioss transparency had a silver lining it brought the issue out of the shadows he also admitted to it as well which is actually good in some ways because a lot of people dont try their best then would just say nothing to sort of defend themselves so they dont get in a bad situation said murray who
im a millennial computer scientist who also writes books and runs a blog demographically speaking i should be a heavy social media user but that is not the case ive never had a social media account at the moment this makes me an outlier but i think many more people should follow my lead and quit these services there are many issues with social media from its corrosion of civic life to its cultural shallowness but the argument i want to make here is more pragmatic you should quit social media because it can hurt your career this claim of course runs counter to our current understanding of social medias role in the professional sphere weve been told that its important to tend to your so called social media brand as this provides you access to opportunities you might otherwise miss and supports the diverse contact network you need to get ahead many people in my generation fear that without a social media presence they would be invisible to the job market in a recent new york magazine essay andrew sullivan recalled when he started to feel obligated to update his blog every half hour or so it seemed as if everyone with a facebook account and a smartphone now felt pressured to run their own high stress one person media operation and the once unimaginable pace of the professional blogger was now the default for everyone he wrote i think this behavior is misguided in a capitalist economy the market rewards things that are rare and valuable social media use is decidedly not rare or valuable any year old with a smartphone can invent a hashtag or repost a viral article the idea that if you engage in enough of this low value activity it will somehow add up to something of high value in your career is the same dubious alchemy that forms the core of most snake oil and flimflam in business professional success is hard but its not complicated the foundation to achievement and fulfillment almost without exception requires that you hone a useful craft and then apply it to things that people care about this is a philosophy perhaps best summarized by the advice steve martin used to give aspiring entertainers be so good they cant ignore you if you do that the rest will work itself out regardless of the size of your instagram following a common response to my social media skepticism is the idea that using these services cant hurt in addition to honing skills and producing things that are valuable my critics note why not also expose yourself to the opportunities and connections that social media can generate i have two objections to this line of thinking first interesting opportunities and useful connections are not as scarce as social media proponents claim in my own professional life for example as i improved my standing as an academic and a writer i began receiving more interesting opportunities than i could handle i currently have filters on my website aimed at not increasing the number of offers and introductions i receive my research on successful professionals underscores that this experience is common as you become more valuable to the marketplace good things will find you to be clear im not arguing that new opportunities and connections are unimportant im instead arguing that you dont need social medias help to attract them my second objection concerns the idea that social media is harmless consider that the ability to concentrate without distraction on hard tasks is becoming increasingly valuable in an increasingly complicated economy social media weakens this skill because its engineered to be addictive the more you use social media in the way its designed to be used persistently throughout your waking hours the more your brain learns to crave a quick hit of stimulus at the slightest hint of boredom once this pavlovian connection is solidified it becomes hard to give difficult tasks the unbroken concentration they require and your brain simply wont tolerate such a long period without a fix indeed part of my own rejection of social media comes from this fear that these services will diminish my ability to concentrate the skill on which i make my living the idea of purposefully introducing into my life a service designed to fragment my attention is as scary to me as the idea of smoking would be to an endurance athlete and it should be to you if youre serious about creating things that matter perhaps more important however than my specific objections to the idea that social media is a harmless lift to your career is my general unease with the mind set this belief fosters a dedication to cultivating your social media brand is a fundamentally passive approach to professional advancement it diverts your time and attention away from producing work that matters and toward convincing the world that matter the latter activity is seductive especially for many members of my generation who were raised on this message but it can be disastrously counterproductive most social media is best described as a collection of somewhat trivial entertainment services that are currently having a good run these networks are fun but youre deluding yourself if you think that twitter messages posts and likes are a productive use of your time if youre serious about making an impact in the world power down your smartphone close your browser tabs roll up your sleeves and get to work
behind much of the middle easts chaos the wars in syria and yemen the political upheaval in iraq and lebanon and bahrain there is another conflict saudi arabia and iran are waging a struggle for dominance that has turned much of the middle east into their battlefield rather than fighting directly they wield and in that way worsen the regions direst problems dictatorship militia violence and religious extremism the history of their rivalry tracks and helps to explain the middle easts disintegration particularly the sunni shiite sectarianism both powers have found useful to cultivate it is a story in which the united states has been a supporting but constant player most recently by backing the saudi war in yemen which kills hundreds of civilians these dynamics scholars warn point toward a future of civil wars divided societies and unstable governments f gregory gause iii an international relations scholar at texas a m university struggled to name another region that had been torn apart in this way central africa could be similar he suggested referring to the two decades of interrelated wars and genocides that driven by meddling regional powers killed five million but in the middle east it is just getting started saudi arabia a young country pieced together only in the has built its legitimacy on religion by promoting its stewardship of the holy sites at mecca and medina it could justify its royal familys grip on power irans revolution in threatened that legitimacy iranians toppled their authoritarian government installing islamists who claimed to represent a revolution for the entire islamic world said kenneth m pollack a senior fellow at the brookings institution the revolutionaries encouraged all muslims especially saudis to overthrow their rulers as well but because iran is mostly shiite they had the greatest influence with and tended to reach out to shia groups dr pollack said some saudi shiites who make up about percent of the population protested in solidarity or even set up offices in tehran stoking saudi fears of internal unrest and separatism this was the opening shot in the sectarianization of their rivalry which would encompass the whole region the saudis have looked at iran as a domestic threat from the get go from dr gause said seeing the threat as intolerable they began looking for a way to strike back they found that way the next year when saddam husseins iraq invaded iran hoping to seize oil rich territory saudi arabia dr pollack said backed the iraqis to the hilt because they want the iranian revolution stopped the war over eight years of trench warfare and chemical weapons attacks killed perhaps a million people it set a pattern of iranian saudi struggle through proxies and of sucking in the united states whose policy is to maintain access to the vast oil and gas reserves that lie between the rivals the conflicts toll exhausted irans zeal for sowing revolution abroad but gave it a new mission to overturn the saudi led american backed regional order that tehran saw as an existential threat that sense of insecurity would later drive irans meddling abroad said marc lynch a political scientist at george washington university and perhaps its missile and nuclear programs the provided a pause in the regional rivalry but also set up the conditions that would allow it to later explode in such force saudi arabia wishing to contain irans reach to the regions minority shiite populations sought to harden sunni shiite rifts government programs promoted anti shia incitement in schools islamic universities and the media toby matthiesen an oxford university scholar wrote in a brief for the carnegie endowment these policies dr matthiesen warned cultivated sectarian fears and sometimes violence that would later feed into the ideology of the islamic state in iraq invaded kuwait a saudi ally the united states after expelling the iraqis established military bases in the region to defend its allies from iraq this further tilted the regional power balance against iran which saw the american forces as a threat iraqs humiliating defeat also spurred many of its citizens to rise up particularly in poorer communities that happened to be shiite arab in response dr gause said saddams regime became explicitly sectarian widening sunni shiite divides to deter future uprisings that allowed iran still worried about iraq to cultivate allies among iraqs increasingly disenfranchised shiites including militias that had risen up though it was not obvious at the time iraq had become a powder keg one that would ignite when its government was toppled a decade later the american led invasion by toppling an iraqi government that had been hostile to both saudi arabia and iran upended the regions power balance iran convinced that the united states and saudi arabia would install a pliant iraqi government and remembering the horrors they had inflicted on iran in the raced to fill the postwar vacuum its leverage with shiite groups which are iraqs largest demographic group allowed it to influence baghdad politics iran also wielded shiite militias to control iraqi streets and undermine the american led occupation but sectarian violence took on its own inevitable momentum hastening the countrys slide into civil war saudi arabia sought to match irans reach but after years of oppressing its own shiite population struggled to make inroads with those in iraq the problem for the saudis is that their natural allies in iraq dr gause said referring to sunni groups that were increasingly turning to jihadism wanted to kill them this was the first sign that saudi arabias strategy for containing iran by fostering sectarianism and aligning itself with the regions sunni majority had backfired as sunni governments collapsed and sunni militias turned to jihadism riyadh would be left with few reliable proxies as their competition in iraq heated up saudi arabia and iran sought to counterbalance each other through another weak state lebanon lebanon provided the perfect opening a frail democracy recovering from civil war with parties and lingering militias primarily organized by religion
when dylan ratigan was last on daily television he was often in a bit of a rage after two highly publicized rants about unseemly ties between corporations and politicians on msnbc he left his show in disillusioned he decided that rather than complain about the state of the world he would at least try to be part of the solution he was especially intrigued by something he had heard over the years from both silicon valley entrepreneurs and war veterans if you really want to combat conflicts bring the things that we fight over said mr ratigan dont bring more bullets and boots bring water food shelter communications so we can empower women and children who are physically left in the villages that took him eventually to this line of questioning why not use hydroponics solar panels and reverse osmosis water filtration to reduce poverty and conflict in the united states and abroad why not use agriculture technology to help people in inner cities refugee camps or war zones and after natural disasters and why not recruit veterans to help with everything from manufacturing to installation to operations the vets i was meeting argued that easily deployed resource kits that can be packed and unpacked from a container are the best way to do this mr ratigan said this continues the same mission but with a new set of equipment mr ratigan moved to california and volunteered at archis acres in escondido which trains veterans for careers in agriculture he taught communications and business development and his interest grew along with the crops through a mutual friend mr ratigan met kohlie frantzen an oilman from lafayette la who had lived through hurricane katrina at mr ratigans urging mr frantzen completed the six week training class at archis and became a certified hydroponic organic farmer not long after the two men formed a manufacturing and design company helical holdings investing a few million dollars between them the companys first product is the outpost a or foot shipping container that can house a hydroponic farm and a solar power station and provide wi fi and satellite communication the outpost includes a filtration system that can provide up to gallons of clean water a day it can also generate kilowatt hours of solar power and can produce heads of leafy greens a week it uses a fifth of the water and a tenth of the land of a traditional organic farm the company says each unit costs to depending on size and configuration and can be erected anywhere its like a hair dryer with a set of adapters said eric g strauss the executive director of the center for urban resilience at loyola marymount university los angeles you plug into any adapter in the world urban agriculture growing food on vacant lots on rooftops or in inner cities is not new freight farms and podponics grow produce inside shipping containers ikea sells hydroponic indoor gardening kits in its british stores farm from a box which started in takes an approach similar to that of helical holdings brandi decarli a co founder of farm from a box said both companies help communities become more sustainable or can help them rebuild after crises shifting the focus from large scale mass production to production by the masses can help contribute to greater stability in the food system she said the united nations food and agriculture organization estimates that about million people worldwide suffer from chronic undernourishment nearly all live in developing nations where poverty and conflicts over limited resources are rampant while the helical holdings containers have not been used overseas yet mr ratigan said he was in preliminary talks with the united states agency for international development the united states department of agriculture and representatives from the mexican french kuwaiti canadian and philippine governments an outpost has been installed at an elementary school in lafayette la there is also one at patriot farms of america in berryville va which trains veterans in agriculture and is a nonprofit partner of helical holdings patriot farmers was founded by kory apton the wife of phil griffin mr ratigans former boss at msnbc so far mr ratigan said the outposts in louisiana and virginia have purified gallons of water while growing leafy greens and pounds of vine crops such as cucumbers tomatoes and watermelons they have also created jobs mr ratigan said in general he did not miss the grind of daily television although a part of him wishes he were on the air for postelection coverage his temper still flares especially during the news but im better at seeing u s politics for what it is a very sick system in need of help he said the people of america are painfully aware of the fact that a few very wealthy people have controlled our politicians for years and hillary clinton is a symbol for that relationship he said its why senator sanders and president elect trump had so much support and its why mr trump won in addition to his work with helical holdings he stays busy by minding his stakes in two financial companies producing films and serving as a global brand ambassador for hotelplanner com mr ratigan said the biggest surprise was realizing how much time and money it took to start a business but he said he was proud that he was finally putting his money where his opinionated mouth was even though the uncertainty of the entrepreneurial life makes it a double edged sword when im well rested i like it he said when im tired it is scary
milan victor massiah has grown weary of talk that the italian banking system is so threadbare and stuffed with terrible loans that it threatens europe with another financial crisis the mansion that serves as local headquarters for the bank he runs ubi banca one of italys largest lenders does not feel like a place on the verge of running out of money an inlaid marble fireplace sits in a conference room beneath wooden beams worthy of a castle a statue of the greek goddess athena stands triumphantly over a staircase as you can see he says sweeping a hand across the scene were not necessarily bankrupt among policy makers alert for signs of the next financial disaster italys mountain of uncollectable bank debt is a subject discussed in tones ordinarily reserved for piles of plutonium its banks seem at once too big to fail and eminently capable of doing so menacing the global economy for years italian lenders have muddled through hoping time would cure their afflictions but italys economy has been terminally weak not growing at all over a recent year stretch bad loans have festered good loans have deteriorated italys problems are europes problems nearly one fifth of all loans in the italian banking system are classified as troubled a toll worth billion euros or nearly billion at the end of last year according to the international monetary fund that represents roughly percent of all the bad loans within the countries sharing the euro in recent weeks the worlds focus has shifted to germanys largest lender deutsche bank on fears that it could be forced to seek a rescue but if deutsche has become the crisis of the moment italy is the perpetual threat that could at any moment present the world with an unpleasant surprise potent enough to send legions of officials descending on rome to try to contain the damage the italian government has sought to spend more money to spur the economy but european leaders led by germany have enforced rules limiting budget deficits and italian banks have held tight to cash and are reluctant to lend starving an already anemic economy of capital all of which leaves italy and europe and to some extent the global economy with a formidable conundrum europe may never regain economic vigor so long as italys banks are a slow motion emergency but italys banks cannot get healthy without growth and italys economy cant grow without healthy banks mr massiah has no patience for stories that cast banking as the source of danger a few irresponsible cases aside italys lenders are not the cause of trouble he insisted rather they are the victims of their times a recession that lasted seven years wiped out nearly a quarter of italian industry the unemployment rate sits above percent the population is aging and too few women are working limiting spending power too many italian businesses are small operations that are especially vulnerable to globalization family run craft and apparel makers have been destroyed by low cost competition from china negative interest rates maintained by the european central bank to encourage lending have cut into bank profit margins this is a bank centric country and there was a huge crisis mr massiah said when the tide goes out you dont see everything nice in the sea italys banking pain is a symptom of an italian business style that has traditionally favored relationships and community ties over a dispassionate analysis of the bottom line a perception the nation is eager to alter to visit senior italian officials in their offices decked out like personal versions of the sistine chapel is to hear a recitation of complaints that reforms have gone underappreciated they betray resentment that italy continues to be caricatured as the reckless debacle at the center of european economic decline the comically ineffectual former prime minister silvio berlusconi a fiercely tanned media magnate has been dispatched to history at the controls today is the young technocrat matteo renzi who has delivered a spate of politically perilous reforms long sought by solemn faced officials in brussels under mr renzis direction italy has made it easier to fire workers this has somewhat diminished a major disincentive to giving people jobs the not irrational fear that problem hires will stick around forever like grown children tethered to the refrigerator italy has also sped up civil processes in its notoriously inefficient courts the prime minister is now seeking a constitutional change that would refashion the entire legislative process in an effort to break a logjam in the upper chamber of parliament he argues it would eliminate obstructions to further pro growth measures italians vote on the amendments next month if they reject the proposal mr renzi has suggested he may step down yet in the telling of some economists the reforms are a sideshow the trouble lies with the banks they prop up so called zombie companies that will never repay their loans extending just enough credit to keep them current on their debts suggest this to the man in charge of the system ignazio visco governor of the bank of italy and he recoils as if someone has thrown an offensive object on his elegant silk carpet the bulk of italys bad debt is backed by collateral he said most of the remainder has a solid chance of turning into collectible debt provided that economic growth returns it is the result of bad economic conditions seven years of almost continuous recession mr visco said banking is a symptom not the cause banking is also an activity that in such conditions seems equal parts math and hope mr massiah the man heading ubi banca confronts a contradictory set of imperatives his bank is strong in northern italy home to some of the most productive industrial areas in europe if he frets too much about limiting risk he may deprive the companies that could build a more vibrant future but if he lends too aggressively he risks
in the broadway classic the music man set in the con artist harold hill shows up in river city iowa and attempts to persuade the otherwise contented townspeople that their youth are slipping into degradation he singles out a billiard parlor the devils playground as the root you got trouble he sings with a capital t and that rhymes with p and that stands for pool these days you dont need goosed up threats of nicotine stains and rebuckled knickerbockers to rouse the anxieties of parents all you need is to broach the one subject that everyone views as trouble by now all parents know that technology poses at least some threat to children just last month the american academy of pediatrics released a study that said while digital and social media can help early learning they also come with a host of risks including negative effects on sleep attention and learning along with higher incidence of obesity and depression the group recommends that parents develop a family media use plan fair enough but what should be in such a plan as the parent of adolescents i want more than bromides i want to know what other parents are actually doing that works for the last six weeks ive circulated questions covering topics like homework passwords bedtime and punishments i received responses from more than families and though the survey was unscientific the answers have already changed how we manage tech at my house first phones the vast majority of parents who responded gave their children their first phones in sixth or seventh grade with a few holding out until high school but those devices arent always cutting edge parents opted for dumb phones flip phones or hand me down phones from siblings or grown ups they also turn off features including wi fi siri even internet access other popular restrictions include writing an expected behavior contract no use of the internet on school days screen time limited to to minutes per day during the week unlimited on saturday mornings another is a partial ban on group texting i was able to help my son feel better about not having this by allowing him to view group texts on the family ipad one parent said it helped him see how little value the group chatter has phones during friend visits are another issue nothing more disappointing than seeing my childrens friends bring their devices to my home and have them focus on the devices to the exclusion of hanging out with my children my own favorite way to limit tech use poor reception the phones dont always work asked to give other parents advice on when to give their children a phone the consensus answer was wait as long as possible once you provide it its very difficult to take back homework should children be allowed to communicate with friends while doing homework two thirds of the parents say yes one third say no among the comments by the yeses were only if they are in common areas of the house or only with the door open another added depends if they are working on a project together which is difficult to enforce the nos said that homework is done independently and that if kids need help they should find a parent or the parents contact a teacher wider use of computers for homework also drew mixed reactions some parents are quite strict limiting all technology outside of a computer for spelling or google docs only homework related sites and no social media only certain educational sites are allowed wikipedia is completely discouraged i strongly believe that actual books should be read for research purposes as opposed to googling everything others are more lax you have to let them use the tools they will need in their lifetime otherwise lets give them coal and a slate slab like lincoln bedtime researchers at kings college london have found strong and consistent association between using devices at bedtime and inadequate sleep poor sleep and increased sleepiness during daytime parents have gotten the message an overwhelming majority ban phones from bedrooms at bedtime tech needs a bedtime too in our house mins before lights out no technology one hour before bedtime at p m she brings her phone downstairs where it stays until a m devices are supposed to be parked outside the kids bedrooms before they turn in for the night some parents make exceptions on weekends or as kids get older a few have no restrictions at all

two days before the start of last years winter meetings major league baseballs annual convention the mets announced that general manager sandy alderson could not attend the event in nashville because he was dealing with a treatable form of cancer everyone in baseball attends the winter meetings all teams send the members of their front offices often accompanied by scouts and owners most agents are there too with alderson beginning chemotherapy his main lieutenants agreed to turn to one point man during what turned out to be four busy and critical days in their off season john ricco the teams assistant general manager since john handled it in such a way that everything that was done i felt it was being done by sandy and thats a compliment to john said yankees general manager brian cashman who watched from afar before those meetings casual mets fans knew of ricco if they had heard of him at all as the teams longtime assistant general manager yet inside the mets and across baseball ricco was a well known and respected executive a steadying force inside the teams baseball operations through years of both contending and rebuilding he has served as the right hand man to three mets general managers jim duquette omar minaya and alderson during riccos time the mets have reached the national league championship series in and rebounded from financial losses sustained in the bernard l madoff scandal to reach the world series in but perhaps the best effort yet was riccos role in helping the mets front office patch up an injury riddled team with in season moves that turned them into a wild card team were fortunate to have him alderson said as time has gone on hes taken on more responsibility and i have tremendous faith in his judgment aldersons health has improved since last winter but riccos function will remain the same during another important off season for the mets with many injured players expected to have recovered the mets may be a force next season to contend they hope to retain the free agent outfielder yoenis cespedes an all star last season but they may have to display the same nimbleness as they did last december with alderson at home during the winter meetings the mets courted ben zobrist but he signed with the chicago cubs a day later the mets traded for neil walker to shore up second base and signed asdrubal cabrera to play shortstop ricco helped lead the mets efforts in nashville while staying in constant touch with alderson and he spoke to reporters at every turn what everyone saw at the winter meetings is what we see on a day to day basis said adam fisher the mets director of baseball operations who has worked with ricco for a dozen years hes calm cool and collected in pressure situations and he can handle himself fine as a leader hes been in the middle of every single one of our big acquisitions for the last years riccos path to the mets front office began in a newsroom growing up in cresskill n j ricco was a yankees fan an allegiance that has long since fizzled he wanted a career in sports but was not sure in exactly what capacity he worked at the student newspaper at villanova where he earned a degree in communications and by his second semester he was the sports editor he secured an internship at the abc affiliate in philadelphia and did some freelance work for television production companies after he graduated in ricco sent his rsum to every television network and baseball team and received no interest disappointed he cast a wider net to public relations firms and through a chance connection he landed an interview with jeff idelson then the yankees director of media relations ricco spent as an intern in the yankees media relations department i was open to anything in sports and this is kind of what happened he said that internship led to another this time in the american league media relations office back when each league had its own office that led to a full time job and then an offer to run the leagues waiver wire he administered all of the a l teams transactions learning the nuances of baseballs rules i was years old doing that and that was kind of my ticket into where i am today ricco said i started working with the g m s and assistant g m s on a daily basis and advising them on different rules that sparked riccos love for the details of baseball navigating the rules juggling the moving pieces of the major league and minor league rosters balancing a budget after four years of transactions ricco moved to major league baseballs labor relations department a breeding ground for future team executives and learned about the salary arbitration system and the collective bargaining agreement with the players union over the next years ricco moved his way up in the commissioners office handling matters including player grievances dealing with agents and helping rob manfred before he became commissioner determine the financial components of the labor agreements with the players union i made a lot of connections ricco said in when cashman took over as general manager of the yankees he remembered the former intern who had blossomed in the commissioners office and tried to hire him ricco turned down the offer of an assistant general manager position because he felt there was more he wanted to learn abut contract negotiations and the economics of baseball other teams tried to lure ricco as well when minaya became the general manager of the montreal expos in his first call was to ricco finally in ricco interviewed with the mets and accepted duquettes offer to become his assistant general manager i was brought in more because they knew i had experience with the rules and contracts ricco said those were the two areas and still
something is deeply wrong when the popes voice reputation and influence can be borrowed by a source that describes itself as a fantasy news site to claim that he has endorsed a presidential candidate and then be amplified unchallenged through a million individual shares the attention paid to fake news since the election has focused largely on fabrications and outright lies because they are indefensible easy to identify and extraordinarily viral fake news is created by the kinds of people who when asked might call their work satire or admit that theyre in it for the money or for the thrill of deception theirs is a behavior that can and should be shunned and that facebook is equipped and maybe willing to deal with for many people and especially opponents of president elect donald j trump the attention paid to fake news and its role in the election has provided a small relief the discovery of the error that explains everything but as the attention has spread widely even president obama talked passionately about it on thursday it may lead to an unwanted outcome for those who see it not just as an explanation but also as a way to correct the course it misunderstands a new media world in which every story and source is at risk of being discredited not by argument but by sheer force false news stories posted on fly by night websites were prevalent in this election so too were widely shared political videos some styled as newscasts containing outright falsehoods newslike image memes posted by individuals and shared by millions and endlessly shared quotes and video clips of the candidates themselves repeating falsehoods during the months i spent talking to partisan facebook page operators for a magazine article this year it became clear that while the ecosystem contained easily identifiable and intentional fabrication it contained much much more of something else i recall a conversation with a fact checker about how to describe a story posted on a pro trump website and promoted on a pro trump facebook page and incidentally copied from another pro trump site by overseas contractors it tried to cast suspicion on khizr khan the father of a slain american soldier who had spoken out against donald j trump the overarching claims of the story were disingenuous and horrifying the facts it included had been removed from all useful context and placed in a new sinister one its insinuating mention of muslim martyrs in proximity to mentions of mr khans son and its misleading and strategic mention of shariah law amounted to a repulsive smear it was a story that appealed to bigoted ideas and that would clearly appeal to those who held them this was a story the likes of which was an enormous force in this election clearly designed to function well within facebooks economy of sharing and it probably would not run afoul of the narrow definition of fake news stories like that one get to the heart of the rhetorical and strategic risk of holding up fake news as a broad media offensive position especially after an election cycle characterized by the euphoric inversion of rhetoric by some of mr trumps supporters and by the candidate himself as the campaign progressed criticism of mr trump was instantly projected back at his opponent or at the critics themselves no puppet no puppet youre the puppet this tactic was used on the language of social justice which was appropriated by opponents and redeployed nihilistically in an open effort to sap its power while simultaneously taking advantage of what power it retained anti racists were cast as the real racists progressives were cast as secretly regressive on their own terms this was not a new tactic but it was newly effective it didnt matter that its targets knew that it was a bad faith maneuver a clear bid for power rather than an attempt to engage or reason the referees called foul but nobody could hear them over the roar of the crowds or maybe they could but realized that nobody could make them listen fake news as shorthand will almost surely be returned upon the media tenfold the fake news narrative as widely understood and deployed has already begun to encompass not just falsified fabricated stories but a wider swath of traditional media on facebook and elsewhere fox news fake news mr trumps misleading claims about ford keeping jobs in america fake news the entirety of hyperpartisan facebook fake news this wide formulation of fake news will be applied back to the traditional news media which does not yet understand how threatened its ability is to declare things true even when they are facebook may try to address the narrow version of the problem the clearly fabricated posts facebook has plenty of tools at its disposal and has already promised to use one to bar sites that have been flagged as promoting falsified content from using its advertising platform but the worst identified defenders make their money outside facebook anyway another narrow response from facebook could be to assert editorial control over external forces facebook tried this to a very limited extent with trending topics members of the companys editorial staff wrote descriptions of trending news stories accompanied by links they deemed credible this initiative collapsed in a frenzy of bias accusations and political fear but it is easy to imagine a system in which a story upon reaching some high threshold of shares or a source upon reaching some cumulative audience could be audited and declared unreliable this could resemble facebooks short lived experiment to tag satire articles as such a number of narrow measures could stop a fake story about the pope for example but where would that leave the rest of the media answered and rebutted and barely better positioned against everything else that remained it would be a still dominant news environment in which almost everything there before remained intact the main difference being
off broadway theaters under pressure from an aggressive social media campaign by performers have agreed to pay higher salaries to hundreds of actors and stage managers the actors equity association the labor union representing actors and stage managers and the league of off broadway theaters and producers a trade group representing nonprofit and commercial theaters in new york with between and seats said friday that they had reached an agreement after weeks of contentious contract talks the settlement averts a possible strike or other job action the two sides did not immediately release full details of the agreement which was approved friday afternoon by the eastern regional board of actors equity but kate shindle the equity president said it would provide hefty wage increases ranging from to percent over the five year contract which covers members working in off broadway theaters of all types and budgets this is really a fantastic day for professional actors ms shindle said we are so pleased and proud that our off broadway partners recognize the value of our actors and stage managers adam hess president of the off broadway league in a statement cited the groups role as a fair and progressive leader we champion new voices we have been at the forefront of diversity on our stages and we are proud to also support our actors and stage managers with a fair wage he said stage acting has long been a poorly paid profession and it is not unusual for union members to agitate for higher wages but off broadway performers said their campaign this time was different because their wages had become increasingly unacceptable in most cases off broadway actors are paid no more than a week in roles that generally last only a few weeks and they have to pay percent to an agent percent to their union and about percent in taxes leaving them with take home pay that does not they say cover the cost of living in new york acting off broadway pays significantly less well than acting on broadway and many professional nonprofit theaters outside new york also pay significantly higher salaries than the off broadway theaters the performers waged a high visibility social media campaign using a hashtag fairwageonstage to enlist support from celebrities as they sought to pressure the citys nonprofit theaters and commercial producers to pay higher salaries off broadway where many of the nations most critically acclaimed productions are developed actors said they were motivated to action in part by the increasing cost of living in new york city and in part by an awareness that the citys biggest nonprofits have become increasingly large the public theater has a million annual budget and the signature theater hired frank gehry to build a multimillion dollar stage complex nicholas westrate an actor and organizer for the fair wage onstage campaign noted in an interview that the agreement did not force smaller theaters to offer the same increases as the larger ones the old one size fits all wasnt working for anybody he said im so glad equity and the producers came to an agreement on that the new agreement makes sense and is going to allow both the actors and stage managers and the theaters to thrive

tunis mothers trembled with anger demanding justice for sons shot dead during protests that ushered in democracy former prisoners described being tortured humiliated and forced to engage in homosexual acts the abuses they recalled were deliberate sadistic and aimed to break them torture in the prison was not systematic it was chaotic said sami brahim who was arrested as a student in the everything that happened in abu ghraib has already happened in tunisia he said referring to the abuses by american troops in the notorious prison in iraq that was just the first day of testimony in long awaited public hearings by tunisias truth and dignity commission an effort unique in the arab world to salve the wounds from nearly years of dictatorship and give a modicum of recognition and respect to the victims and their families seven witnesses testified live on national television and radio thursday evening in a highly charged ceremony a second evening of testimony is scheduled for friday much of the nation is riveted it is the first time that tunisians have been given a state venue to air the horrors of decades of systematic human rights violations under both president zine el abidine ben ali who was overthrown during the arab spring and his predecessor habib bourguiba this is a momentous day for the establishment of the constitution and the rule of law sihem bensedrine the president of the truth and dignity commission said in an opening speech victims of despotism are entitled to fairness and justice and this is the message we are conveying to the whole world over the past two years the commission has taken in complaints from victims investigating about of them so far but has struggled against political and institutional resistance and a hostile national news media which has accused it of spending money but doing nothing with the public hearings ms bensedrine said she hoped to win greater public support and push back against the current governments argument that stability and reconciliation are more important than reopening old wounds the audience on thursday included many politicians and activists who themselves had suffered imprisonment torture and exile under the dictatorships there were also representatives of truth commissions from africa asia and latin america and foreign diplomats senior tunisian government officials were conspicuously absent the setting was fittingly symbolic a reminder of the corrupt regime that oversaw some of the worst abuses club elyssa a luxurious spa in a northern suburb of tunis that was once owned by leila trabelsi the former first lady and wife of the ousted president mr ben ali it is a way for us to say that society is finally recovering such ill gotten places to underscore the principle of the rule of law ms bensedrine said when announcing the venue the significance of the setting was not lost on those who testified including ourida kaddouss whose year old son raouf was shot in the head during protests in sidi bouzid where a young man had set himself on fire and initiated the arab spring nearly six years ago you could not even say leilas name she said recalling the times under mr ben ali and here we are now in leilas palace if leila comes back we will be ready we are not going to let them but mostly she said she wanted justice for her son and her family we gave our most valuable thing we have and you forgot us ms kaddouss said we want the rights of the revolution we want dignity we want to live freely she and two other mothers who testified complained that the military tribunals that tried the killers of their sons had handed down lenient or suspended sentences for the perpetrators ribeh briki whose son slah dachroui was one of people who died in tunisia during the arab spring protests of held up her sons picture you the commission will bring back our rights she said we want the truth and my appeal is for those traitors and killers of our children to be punished properly she too challenged the ousted president mr ben ali who she hoped was watching from his home in exile in saudi arabia if you are brave enough come back she said we are sitting where you used to sit in an interview on tuesday ms bensedrine said she wanted to see some cases go to trial and also to have some of the perpetrators testify before the commission at a later stage her ultimate goal remains to dismantle the system so dictatorship can never return she said we have to reflect how injustice went unpunished and how it was allowed to happen she told the audience the mothers testimonies were a nod to the importance of the revolution in allowing democratic change in tunisia the testimonies that followed were examples of some of the worst abuses that occurred throughout tunisias modern history death from torture forced disappearance political imprisonment sexual and psychological torture and persecution of prisoners and their families for years after their release latifa and fatma

when all def comedy my showcase for up and coming black comedians had its premiere on nov on hbo it brought back memories of def comedy jam its era predecessor in the new york times jason zinoman wrote an appreciation of the old show calling it trailblazing and filled with a staggering amount of talent while i liked a lot of what he said he lacked insight on one point how important a platform like this still is the new show arrives in a very different comedy climate he wrote adding there are more platforms today and noting that the scene is less segregated the fact is the scene is still largely as segregated as it was years ago though emerging and creative voices are readily accessible my media company all def digital has put a great deal of such talent in front of audiences on youtube facebook snapchat and spotify hollywoods traditional gatekeepers still reach around the black community and its most cutting edge comedic talent in favor of much safer performers the comics favored by these gatekeepers are fine for television but do you see any of them being cast in major motion pictures im currently circulating scripts for different big screen comedies and the response from studio executives to almost every one is the same can you get kevin hart to do it kevin hart happens to be great but hes also apparently the only black comedian that any of these executives believe can carry a movie today there is a ton of black asian and latino comedy talent in hollywood now but these performers are segregated into a few performing spots politically of course hollywood is very well intentioned and liberal culturally its a backwater in the current setup black comedians are restricted to black comedy nights in various clubs like mo betta monday itd be funny if it werent so pathetic meanwhile these specialty showcases are often the biggest nights of the week for the clubs that host them if there were more than just a few black talent agents in this city the world would already have heard much more from the comedy stars of this new generation but thats not happening hollywood so white describes the problem in a nutshell i guess this blindness on the part of hollywood gatekeepers represents a huge opportunity for me for the last months ive been producing a weekly showcase at the tcl chinese theater its called all def comedy live it always sells out and as you probably guessed it was the inspiration for the show on hbo im pretty confident that the show will succeed on tv and that it will provide a gateway for new black talent to help fill this hole in the market call it the hip hop effect or the tanning of america hip hop music rescued and revitalized rock n roll and the music industry in the and then quickly did the same for the fashion industry in politics hip hop not only brought millions of otherwise alienated young people into the electoral process but it was also instrumental in putting a black man into the white house def comedy jam introduced the world to martin lawrence chris tucker bernie mac jamie foxx cedric the entertainer steve harvey tracy morgan kevin hart katt williams and many others mr zinoman zeroed in on the genius of black style when he noted that chris tucker had a delivery with such momentum and snap that he made jokes sound like music eventually the movie industry jumped on the bandwagon for a while the biggest movie star in the world was a former rapper who began his career as the fresh prince but the industrys current gatekeepers seem to have forgotten just how potent creatively and economically the black community can be whatever im back in hollywood im paying attention and its my great honor and pleasure to present all this new talent to the world
a century ago almost all black americans lived in the south largely in rural areas by most lived outside the south a great many in northern and western industrial cities driven in part by hopes for greater economic opportunity millions of black migrants made this move did they find what they were looking for in ways yes black workers in the north and west in addition to experiencing greater social and political freedoms made much more money than did their counterparts in the south but there were also disappointments black migration to industrial cities was not met with steadily growing economic equality between black and white workers and as migration increased so did black residential isolation exacerbated by white flight to the suburbs and eventually economic stagnation by seven out of black americans in northern and western cities resided in majority black neighborhoods which were often beset by high levels of poverty and crime scholars in the early part of the century had predicted migration would do more for black americans than it did what happened in her rich and technical account competition in the promised land black migrants in northern cities and labor markets the economist leah platt boustan employs the tools of her trade resourceful matching of data sets rigorous modeling of labor phenomena sweeping use of census figures to analyze the demographics and economics of the great migration as a whole more traditional historians often focusing on a single city and relying on less nationally representative sources like oral histories and newspaper accounts have not typically done this boustan does not aim to overturn the conventional explanation for sluggish black economic growth in the north namely the decline of american manufacturing and the persistence of racism in labor and housing markets but here as with many other aspects of the migration story her investigation both deepens our understanding of what we think we know and adds new complexities and wrinkles for example as the title of her book suggests boustan is interested in whether black economic progress in the north was hamstrung by labor competition between southern born and northern born black workers she finds that between and such competition did indeed lower wages for black men in the north by billion a year or percent of their median earnings absent such competition she argues black workers already living in the north would have closed more of the earnings gap with white workers she stresses however that this finding does not let racism off the hook black workers were competing with one another as opposed to with white workers sometimes because of discriminatory hiring practices that excluded blacks from jobs for which they were qualified and sometimes because they were genuinely less qualified than similarly trained white workers on account of the lower quality of their schooling as for the poor black urban neighborhoods that arose in the wake of the great migration many of which are still characterized by various forms of disadvantage what should be done in his provocative book dark ghettos injustice dissent and reform the philosopher tommie shelby tackles this question but he doesnt lay out a jobs program or a housing initiative indeed as he freely admits he offers no new political strategies or policy proposals what he aims to do instead is both more abstract and more radical to challenge the assumption common to liberals and conservatives alike that ghettos are problems best addressed with narrowly targeted government programs or civic interventions for shelby ghettos are something more troubling and less tractable symptoms of the systemic injustice of the united states they represent not aberrant dysfunction but the natural workings of a deeply unfair scheme the only real solution in this way of thinking is the fundamental reform of the basic structure of our society this proposal may sound too ambitious to be of much relevance to everyday debates about how to help struggling urban neighborhoods shelby is asking for no less than an overhaul of our major political economic and social institutions even if you agree that the ghetto poor are not merely disadvantaged but unjustly disadvantaged you may still deem it wiser to focus on more immediate measures but here is where shelbys argument becomes more germane he contends that the injustice of american ghettos places certain moral constraints on what the government may do to try to improve them in his view for example the state may not justifiably require people to work in order to receive welfare benefits likewise the injustice of ghettos relaxes certain moral constraints shelby believes on the behavior of the ghetto poor some of whose otherwise blameworthy and punishable actions are as he sees it sound expressions of self respect and legitimate resistance to an oppressive status quo at the heart of these arguments is a simple principle reciprocity in a just society you receive your fair share and contribute your fair share but if you are born into a ghetto with its social stigma its poor schools its go nowhere jobs its high levels of crime drug use and incarceration in what sense shelby asks have you received your fair share your equitable shot at life and if society has not held up its end of the bargain the least it can do when trying to patch things up is respect the autonomy and self esteem of those it aims to help a poor single woman in a ghetto may not have the resources to be an ideal parent shelby is willing to concede but if that is ultimately a shortcoming of our society it adds insult to injury to structure welfare benefits so as to discourage nonmarital childbearing thereby hindering her reproductive freedom similarly shelby does not deny that high jobless rates in ghettos are a problem but if some of the ghetto poor choose not to work he says maybe that is because they refuse to accommodate themselves to their place in a social order where it is possible to
imagine if the golden state warriors and the cleveland cavaliers had never played on national television until they met in last seasons n b a finals or that the basketball stars stephen curry and lebron james had never gotten to play in an all star game that is basically the situation for two of boxings brightest talents who will finally cross major milestones when they square off saturday night in a light heavyweight title bout the boxers andre ward and sergey kovalev both have wins and no losses in the rankings of the best pound for pound fighters in the world by the magazine the ring kovalev sits at no and ward at no both men have thrilling styles kovalev is a knockout artist and ward is a crafty boxer with some pepper on his punches yet when they meet it will be wards first time and kovalevs second fighting on boxings biggest stage las vegas and it will be the first time that either man has been a headliner on the sports premier platform pay per view both men have waited a long time for this exposure and the mainstream recognition that has eluded them but can certainly be earned if the bout in the t mobile arena turns out to be as thrilling as expected this is only the third time that two undefeated fighters who are in the top five of the rings pound for pound list have fought each other said kathy duva chief executive of main events the company that promotes kovalev in the era of floyd mayweather his light was so bright that you didnt see anybody else duva said but mayweathers retirement has left an opening now were beginning to see this changing of the guard she said somebody has to step into that big vacuum and take his place ward would seem to be a natural fit raised in the oakland calif area he seems like the all american guy handsome socially conscious and thoughtful he is the last american man to have won an olympic gold medal in boxing as a light heavyweight at the athens games kovalev grew up in humble means the son of factory workers in a steel town in the soviet union he is still working to improve his english but has the charm and affability of a star duva said kovalev who has one draw on his record toiled in relative obscurity through his first professional fights before duva saw him and his knockout power on one of her fight cards and signed him to a contract ward shot to prominence and seemingly inevitable stardom five years into his professional career when he blew through the competition to win the super six world boxing classic defeating much more seasoned professional fighters on the way to winning a middleweight title about a year after winning the super six he destroyed chad dawson one of the worlds most highly regarded fighters at that time but then things stalled he injured a shoulder and got into a dispute with his promoter dan goossen ward lost several court and arbitration battles in his effort to get out of his contract with goossen after the dawson victory ward fought only once over roughly the next three years he stuck mostly to working as a commentator for fights during that time goossen died in the fall of by the beginning of the next year ward had gotten out of his contract with goossen promotions and joined jay zs roc nation sports it was a match brokered by wards manager james prince a veteran of the music world who had a personal relationship with jay z and had reached out to him while seeking options for ward roc nation has positioned itself as a full service entertainment company certainly an appealing element to a guy like ward who has already made one hollywood appearance in the boxing drama creed we are a company that builds brands and we knew that that was important to andre michael r yormark roc nations president said adding that the company carried a cool factor that reached younger audiences but wards ability to reach mainstream household status also depends on a personal evolution he has built something of an anti mayweather persona as a consummate family man with a wife and four children he professes his christian faith he can come off at times as a reluctant superstar asked about the possibility of becoming the face of boxing he said he did not really believe in one person being the face of the sport because he saw it as disrespectful to other fighters it was only recently that ward started talking publicly about some of the challenges he had faced growing up in oakland both of his parents battled drug addiction and his father died unexpectedly of a heart attack in ive seen them a million times in the sport where a young fighter comes out and then his story is kind of ran through the mud so to speak for a year or two and then thats it ward said we know about it we know who you are we know your parents did this and thats it and i just didnt want that i wanted the public and the media to get to know me as a fighter me as a person before any of that stuff would have ever came out he said he also realized the importance of humanizing himself for his fans and hoped that his personal story encourages somebody and helps somebody get through what theyre going through yet for all the back story and branding in sports any successful marketing strategy begins with victory you got to have it ward said i dont have the luxury in my sport to lose and be able to pick it up again the next night theres little room

sukhumi georgia he is blind in one eye and has a bad hip that makes it painful to sit never mind endure the kicks and punches that are an essential part of his job as a mixed martial arts fighter he is also nearly twice the age of many of his rivals at the top of his harrowingly brutal profession yet as happens whenever jeff monson a year old american known as the snowman visits a town in russia or in this case abkhazia one of the pro russian enclaves in the lands of the former soviet union he was greeted with whoops of delight last month when he limped from the dynamo stadium locker room and clambered into a cage to battle a fit russian in his after just a few minutes the referee declared the combat over and the snowman a former world champion the loser on points all the same the battered american remained the undisputed star of the show as he and his victorious opponent walked back into the locker room fans ignored the russian and surged around mr monson pleading for selfies and autographs the russian year old levan persaev apologized for winning and told mr monson that the fight not a full mixed martial arts bout but a slightly more subdued grappling match should have been declared a draw jeff i just want to say how much i respect you we all respect you you are a model for us all mr persaev said the referee later took back his initial decision and declared the fight a draw at a time when the united states and russia do little but insult each other mr monson has become perhaps russias favorite american hugely admired for his tenacity his readiness to endure pain and not an insignificant factor his outspoken belief that russia is right about most things including the united states his views are so in sync with those of the kremlin that he has been given his own show on rt a state funded television channel that promotes russias take on the world what makes this particular american so popular however is that he is in many ways a russian or at least a close approximation of the image that many russians have of themselves as tough unrelenting underdogs righteous champions of the weak against the powerful and pure hearted avengers of the crimes committed by the strong notably the united states in america we think that they just drink vodka and want to take over the world mr monson said in an interview before the fight in sukhumi but it is america that wrecks countries like iraq and then just walks away with total impunity born in minnesota and raised in washington state he said he grew up rooting for the u s a but after studying psychology at the university of illinois and traveling overseas he says he figured out that the world is a little different from what he had believed his view of his home country today is summed up by the tattoo on his leg land of hypocrisy it says over an upside down stars and stripes other tattoos include the hammer and sickle several anarchist emblems the faces of marx and lenin and on his neck words that pretty much define his political philosophy at least with regard to the united states destroy authority although he has been a big name in the fighting world since the late mr monson did not enter russias pantheon of popular heroes until when watched from ringside in moscow by vladimir v putin then russias prime minister he got pummeled by the countrys best known fighter fedor emelianenko the russian shattered his leg and beat his face to a bloody pulp impressed by mr monsons tenacity in the face of defeat mr putin telephoned him the next day and told him you have the russian spirit you never give up after that mr monson a father of three started visiting russia regularly from his home in florida traveling the country for cage fights including one in st petersburg that was also watched by mr putin a martial arts enthusiast mr monson now spends much of his time in russia and in other parts of the former soviet union notably pro russian enclaves that crave recognition the president of abkhazia a breakaway region of georgia that only russia and three other countries recognize and that does not get many foreign visitors other than russian budget tourists appreciated mr monsons visit so much that he gave him a gold watch and pronounced him an honorary citizen of what much of the world views as a make believe country mr monson seemed bemused where is my passport he asked on leaving the abkhaz presidents office with only the watch and a letter thanking him for his great personal contribution to the protection and defense of the right of peoples to self determination and independence mr monson later acknowledged that he did not know much about abkhazia which broke away from georgia in the early and was alarmed to learn that getting citizenship there would almost certainly make it difficult for him to visit georgia i always wanted to visit georgia but i guess that is not on the cards anymore he said also probably unadvisable is a visit to chechnya whose kremlin backed leader ramzan a kadyrov loves mixed martial arts but brooks no lip from veteran fighters mr emelianenko mr monsons old opponent and now a good friend got on the wrong side of mr kadyrov recently by criticizing a cage fighting contest involving the chechen leaders three underage sons the feud initially confined to threats on social media took a violent turn last month when an unidentified assailant beat up mr emelianenkos teenage daughter in moscow and put her in the hospital mr kadyrov denied any hand in the assault mr monson delights in defying the caricature of cage fighters as muscle bound

taipei taiwan sitting in the third row of a small chapel ms liou wiped away tears of joy as her sister exchanged wedding vows with her new husband a few feet away ms lious partner stood alone maintaining their public charade of being just friends ms liou who asked that her full name not be disclosed because she had yet to come out as gay said she would feel more comfortable holding her partners hand or embracing her in a society that did not view their way of life as out of the ordinary if we could realize marriage equality in taiwan people in our situation could lead fuller lives she said that day could be coming soon although it is not assured bills that would legalize same sex marriage are moving through taiwans legislative system bringing the island closer to becoming the first place in asia with marriage equality some predict it could happen early next year the political climate in taiwan has never been more favorable president tsai ing wen who took office in may has spoken out in favor of same sex marriage her democratic progressive party which is largely sympathetic to gay rights holds the majority in the legislative yuan some cities are already extending symbolic recognition of same sex relationships in may kaohsiung became the first city in taiwan to register same sex couples shortly afterward taipei the capital followed suit this month kaohsiung issued its first same sex partnership cards to gay couples and the taipei city government announced that it would soon do the same the deputy director of the kaohsiung civil affairs bureau chen shu fang said the cards would make it easier to contact partners in emergencies and for hospitals to include partners in medical decisions in asia taiwan is an island of relative acceptance for gays lesbians and those of other sexual orientations in some asian countries including brunei homosexual acts are illegal the governing democratic progressive party the opposition nationalist party or kuomintang and the smaller new power party have each proposed same sex marriage bills as of friday the bills were in the hands of a legislative yuan judiciary committee taiwan has considered marriage equality before hsiao bi khim a legislator from the democratic progressive party submitted a same sex marriage bill in that was blocked outright in a bill reached the committee review stage but stalled now ms hsiao said things are different we have a much better chance this time around she said if a bill comes to a vote in the legislative yuan it will need the support of at least of the bodys lawmakers for passage so far ms hsiao said the bills have collectively received backing from legislators all of the bills would legalize same sex marriage and permit gay couples to adopt said yu mei nu a legislator who submitted the democratic progressive partys proposal the author of the kuomintang bill hsu yu jen also co signed the democratic progressive party draft highlighting the momentum that marriage equality has gathered in both major parties although some members of each party oppose it public support for legalizing same sex unions is robust ms yu said she noted the large turnout last month for the l g b t pride parade in taipei which attracted about participants from taiwan and around asia ms yu said legalization had a good chance of passing in taiwans next legislative session from february through may but if the proposal fails then its chances in the sessions that follow ahead of the local elections in november could be lower she said as the issue remains controversial this is a golden opportunity ms yu said but the opposition is strong she noted that legislators who had initially signed on to the bill withdrew their support after being pressured by groups opposed to same sex marriage on thursday thousands of people protesting legalization dressed in white occupied the street outside the judiciary committee proceedings in taipei denouncing what they called a black box in which the bills were being considered they chanted demands for the legislature to hold public hearings on the issue and some called for a plebiscite late thursday the legislative caucuses of the democratic progressive party and the kuomintang agreed to each hold a hearing to air opinions on legalization before continuing deliberations among the opposition is the alliance of religious groups for the love of families taiwan which was formed to block the bill and is now focusing its attention on presenting its views to legislators we dont use the term lobbying andrew chang the alliances secretary general said in an interview were going to explain in detail the social impacts and they can make their own decision miao poya a gay rights advocate said society on the whole has become more accepting than it was a decade ago when patrons of gay clubs were often harassed by the police support for marriage equality is especially strong among younger people gay friendly sex education in taiwans public schools and support from straight celebrities have helped increase tolerance she said among those celebrities is the pop singer a mei who is from the aboriginal puyuma tribe in our tribe we dont see love as complicated a mei wrote in an email so for me l g b t love and the right to marry are as natural as breathing and nobody should be able to deprive others of the right to breathe last month a mei received the generation award for her support for lesbian gay bisexual and transgender rights at the inaugural queermosa awards organized by the taiwan international queer film festival queermosas goal is to spotlight people working to make those voices heard said the festivals director jay lin he cited the united states as an example to emulate noting that television there includes many characters of varying sexual orientations i really do see a lot more potential for media to have an impact mr lin

hamilton bermuda kazuhiko sofuku sat on a leather couch in the base for his americas cup team with the pale blue waters of bermudas great sound for a backdrop pinched his cheek and gave it a shake to make sure this was not just a maritime mirage you know this whole thing is beyond my dreams almost he said last week on the eve of making the marathon journey to fukuoka japan for the louis vuitton americas cup world series event that begins on friday two years ago sofuku was still living in valencia spain working as a freelance sailor and wondering whether it was time to take a new tack i was getting old and my family was getting worried he said but that was before sofuku known in the international sailing community as fuku received a call from russell coutts who is chief executive of the americas cup event authority in charge of planning the next cup in bermuda in coutts told him that people in japan had preliminary interest in forming a new team could fuku provide advice and support i stopped everything i already had planned and went for it sofuku said after months of negotiations a new japanese syndicate softbank team japan representing the kansai yacht club announced in april that it would challenge for the americas cup with sofuku as general manager the teams main backer is masayoshi son the tech billionaire who is the founder and chief executive of softbank group and who is according to forbes japans second wealthiest man sofuku and the team hired dean barker the star helmsman from new zealand as skipper and chief executive and then added another major talent chris draper of britain as tactician and sailing team manager the last time a japanese syndicate participated in the cup was in in auckland new zealand when sofuku was a bowman on the crew of nippon challenge sixteen years later fuku remains the most prominent japanese sailor in the cup community even though the cup has changed radically with the shift from monohulls to much faster foiling catamarans to be honest with you the challenge and physical demands of this new type of boat are extremely hard said sofuku but somehow i still enjoy to wake up early in the morning and go to the gym and push hard with the boys luckily im still healthy enough and reasonably fit but obviously age doesnt help asian involvement was important to coutts and his boss larry ellison the american billionaire who has a personal relationship with son and whose syndicate oracle team usa holds the trophy together coutts and ellison made the controversial decision to take the americas cup outside of the united states to bermuda a british overseas territory in the north atlantic they wanted a better commercial deal than they could find in the united states and also wanted a time zone that would still work for television coverage in major markets though bermuda could not be much farther from japan kilometers or about miles and an hour time change from tokyo softbank team japan will get the chance to compete at home this week in fukuoka the world series regatta is the last before the cup next year and will be the first americas cup preliminary event contested in east asia hopefully this racing in fukuoka engages some of the japanese public in a sport which theyve been involved with in the past but not for the last years barker said the only other japanese team to challenge for the cup was nippon challenge in and it also relied heavily on foreign talent first chris dickson and john cutler of new zealand and then australias peter gilmour the gifted match racer who has long been one of sofukus mentors though sofuku grew up in the coastal city of niigata he never sailed competitively until his early his interest was piqued by a television program about the cup in fremantle australia he was a truck driver at the time but after responding to a job posting he joined a japanese sailing team bengal bay challenge that eventually folded without competing in the cup we had a big ryokan that the company rented sofuku said referring to a japanese inn and we were like young guys living together there and training and we got like a thousand dollars euros a month we went bankrupt like three times and every time more people left by the end there were just three of us left in that same ryokan every day we washed the boat and went to the gym for training but we couldnt really sail with just three of us he later joined nippon challenge for the and cups and was also a bowman for the american challenger oneworld in in auckland new zealand and a crew member for ellison and oracle in in valencia where sofuku and his family were based until this latest unexpected chance initially he was to sail only in the world series races this year before giving way to younger competitors next year when the vuitton cup which will select a challenger for oracle team usa gets underway in earnest in may in bermuda the crew work is grueling with at least four of the six sailors on board working as grinders by operating manual winches to perform maneuvers and generate power some of which is stored to fuel the yachts control systems but barker said sofuku has demonstrated remarkable endurance this season with at least one japanese sailor required by cup rules to be on board at all times and multiple races scheduled per day barker said it was likely that sofuku would rotate during the cup with the two other japanese sailors on the team yugo yoshida and yuki kasatani fuku has really got a big ticker on him barker said he pushes himself right to the edge and looks after himself very well but what drives fuku at this stage
from a sidewalk in lower manhattan the building at thomas street known as the long lines building looks like nothing less than a monument to the prize of privacy with not a window in its walls from the ground up to its height of feet thomas looms over church street with an architectural blank face nothing about it resembles a place of human habitation and in fact it was built for machines an at t subsidiary commissioned the tower to house long distance phone lines completed in it was fortified to withstand a nuclear attack on new york and the architect made plans to include enough food water and generator fuel to sustain people for two weeks during a catastrophic loss of power to the city now an investigative article in the intercept and an accompanying minute documentary film project x opening on friday at the ifc center in greenwich village say the building appears to have served another purpose as a listening post code named titanpointe by the national security agency the article and film say that titanpointe was one of the facilities used to collect communications with permission granted by judges from international entities that have at least some operations in new york such as the united nations the international monetary fund the world bank and countries according to the article and film n s a employees and contractors who traveled to titanpointe were given detailed instructions about how to rent cars anonymously through the f b i how to dress and even what to do if they got into a car accident equipment in the building monitored international long distance phone calls faxes videoconferencing voice calls made over the internet much of the documentation for the article and film draws on material provided by edward snowden a former contractor for the agency who released information in about the n s a s collaboration with telecommunication companies in vast surveillance programs laura poitras who collaborated with henrik moltke on the documentary film was a member of a group of journalists awarded a pulitzer prize for its reporting on mr snowdens revelations the new article and film say that n s a memos from refer to titanpointe by its code name and activities that take place there but do not mention its address mr moltke said a number of details in the snowden material pointed to thomas street including references to a known code name for at t the buildings location about a block from f b i offices at federal plaza and a reference to satellite intercepts for a program called skidrowe the building has satellite dishes on the roof and is the only site in new york city where at t has a federal communications commission license for such stations according to mr moltke who wrote the article with ryan gallagher the new york times and pro publica reported in august that at t had had a close relationship with the n s a for decades and had been lauded by the agency for its extreme willingness to help however neither the materials from mr snowden nor the new reports state with certainty that the n s a was using at t space or equipment as it happens while at t inc owns the land at thomas it has only about percent of the floor space the balance is owned by verizon asked about the intercept report fletcher cook an at t spokesman did not directly respond but said the company provided information when legally required or in specific emergency cases we do not allow any government agency to connect directly to or otherwise control our network to obtain our customers information he said a verizon spokesman took questions about his companys space but did not provide answers the n s a did not reply to a request for comment for all the powerful machinery available to government surveillance programs they are subject to some court jurisdiction that is not the case for commercial surveillance every aspect of daily life is tracked by smartphone apps social media and websites whatever spying may go on at thomas street would at least still be subject to legal oversight the building really may be a monument to quaint ideas about privacy

the documentary off the rails adam irvings first film is an assured and thoughtful debut he presents the story of darius mccollum a man with a long history of taking new york city subway trains and buses for joy rides even though he is not a transit employee but mr irvings subtext is a criminal justice system that has no way to deal with an offender like mr mccollum who has aspergers syndrome other than to keep throwing him in prison mr mccollums rsum will be familiar to new york audiences since he has been making news for decades beginning when he first took unauthorized control of a subway train at the age of now in his early he has been in and out of jail repeatedly for stealing trains and buses which he seems to want only to take for a ride no malice intended his advocates explain that aspergers can result in a single minded devotion to a particular thing in mr mccollums case transit he knows the schedules and terminology and even has a collection of transit worker uniforms mr mccollum who comes across as the worlds most genial repeat offender is the principal guide to his story which includes being stabbed in school by a fellow student when he was that may have shaped his later notoriety when he was assaulted he lost that sense of value as to who he is says rey cusicanqui a forensic social worker and part of his legal team wearing a uniform creates a sense of value for darius the news media has treated mr mccollum sometimes as a quirky new york character sometimes as a menace nuts ride to jail reads one headline seen in the film mr irving though treats him with dignity and as an example of someone the justice system is not made to help offenders driven by a psychological compulsion are a decidedly different type of criminal than a hit man or a ponzi scheme operator but this perceptive film laments they end up in the same jails a response that hasnt changed during mr mccollums years of riding and recidivism
with the election now in the rearview mirror bloomberg has decided to terminate its daily politics show with all due respect hosted by the political journalists john heilemann and mark halperin and refocus its bloomberg politics team according to a staff memo on thursday in the coming weeks as washington transitions from the obama administration to the incoming trump administration our bloomberg politics team will transition as well shifting our focus to the impact of politics and policy on the business and financial world john micklethwait the editor in chief of bloomberg and justin b smith chief executive of bloomberg media said in the memo will all due respect which began in october and was broadcast on bloomberg tv at p m and msnbc at p m will run daily until dec after which there will be four hourlong specials setting up the presidency of donald j trump the show will end with coverage of mr trumps inauguration on jan errol cockfield a spokesman for msnbc declined to comment on the networks plans for the p m hour mr heilemann and mr halperin the authors of the popular book game change about the election joined bloomberg in may but their hiring caused discord between bloombergs offices in new york and washington where journalists felt they were being overshadowed by the new politics team the show initially struggled to find an audience and was criticized in some quarters for being too frivolous with all of that in mind the inauguration could be viewed as both a natural and convenient endpoint the duo are in discussions about staying on as contributors and columnists for bloomberg according to the memo though they will no longer have day to day roles bloomberg politics will shift to a more global outlook and there are plans to start a new television show focused on global politics and the impact of the new administrations policies on business and finance worldwide according to the memo which was reported earlier by the huffington post the moves are part of a broader reshuffling at bloomberg which said in a separate memo on thursday that it was revamping its magazine bloomberg businessweek to focus more on business and finance megan murphy who was bloombergs washington bureau chief was named editor of the magazine which is expected to begin publishing in its new form in the second quarter of next year what will emerge from this will be very different from the stand alone magazine you all write for at the moment the memo said the memo also said the editorial team at the magazine may well be smaller
youve got to love the juxtaposition in the take a tasty thriller directed by james watkins tech and media savvy bad guys go up against that most humble of miscreants a pickpocket well against a pickpocket and a rule breaking c i a agent the agent sean is played with growly vigor by idris elba and he pairs perfectly with richard madden who portrays michael the pickpocket we first meet michael in a scene that shows a classic pickpocket technique create a distraction that allows for the easy snatching of wallets and such well not give the gimmick away here but it is largely responsible for earning the film its r rating in any case michael accidentally snatches a bag containing a bomb and that puts him on seans radar soon the two are working together to thwart what seems to be a terrorist plot a buddy cop variation that you hope youll see again in either a sequel or a television series the story is set in paris and yes its uncomfortable watching a terror themed tale in a city that so recently dealt with real terrorism but if you can get past that the movie sweeps you along with a brisk pace and even dashes of humor a hat tip to tim maurice jones the cinematographer who manages to render both a sprawling rooftop chase and a fight in a very confined space with pulse quickening verve neil genzlinger

a baltimore public school teacher is no longer employed after a cellphone video showed her berating minority students with abusive language that included a racial slur the school district said on thursday the teacher who was not named in the statement from the baltimore city public schools was recorded on tuesday disciplining a student in her middle school science class at harlem park elementary middle school after she ejected the student from the room she turned to the other students who remained raised her voice and said she was going to give them all zeros for not doing their work the teacher who is white then called the students idiots and asked them if they wanted to get an education or to be a punk ass who is gonna get shot using a common racial slur on thursday the school authorities said in the statement that the teacher had engaged in verbally abusive behavior and made racially charged comments directed at students the teacher involved in the incident is no longer employed by city schools an email seeking information including the name of the teacher and what she had told the authorities about the episode was not answered immediately on thursday by the city schools the baltimore teachers union said in a statement that it condemns the language used by the teacher a spokesman for the union ray baker declined by telephone to answer further questions including whether the teacher had a lawyer or whether she had been fired but sonja brookins santelises the chief executive officer of the school district said in a telephone interview on thursday afternoon that the woman was an eighth grade science teacher in her second year she said she could not provide further details because it was a personnel matter ms santelises said that although many teachers struggled with classroom management the teacher crossed the line by using the racial epithet the recording was posted on twitter by shaun king a reporter for the daily news who said it had been sent to him by a reader the newspaper reported on thursday that the cellphone video was posted on facebook on wednesday by a baltimore woman named erica deminds by thursday afternoon it had been viewed more than million times ms deminds told the daily news that one of her sons classmates had recorded the video she said the teacher had taught her son for two or three years and that she had met with her one on one shes a very nice teacher ms deminds was quoted as saying i cant say what happened that day i think she was at a breaking point ms deminds could not immediately be reached by telephone on thursday
in the debate over fracking of oil and gas wells opponents often cite the risk that the process can set off nearby earthquakes but scientists say that in the united states fracking induced earthquakes are not common in canada however a spate of earthquakes in alberta within the last five years has been attributed to fracking or hydraulic fracturing in which water chemicals and sand are injected at high pressure into a well drilled in a shale formation to break up the rock and release oil and gas now scientists at the university of calgary who studied those earthquakes near fox creek in the central part of the province say the quakes were induced in two ways by increases in pressure as the fracking occurred and for a time after the process was completed by pressure changes brought on by the lingering presence of fracking fluid the key message is that the primary cause of injection induced seismicity in western canada is different from the central united states said david w eaton a professor of geophysics at the university of calgary and co author of a paper in the journal science describing the research the findings could help regulators take steps to avoid such induced earthquakes he said scientists say most of the recent earthquakes in oklahoma and other parts of the united states have been caused by the burial of wastewater from all kinds of oil and gas wells rather than by the fracking process itself wastewater is injected under pressure into disposal wells drilled into a sandstone or other permeable formation and flows into the rock that can cause pressure changes in the formation that can upset the equilibrium around a fault zone causing an earthquake as the fault slips in the fox creek area in alberta where oil and gas companies have been drilling in recent years into a formation called the duvernay shale earlier research had seen links between the earthquakes all of which were minor and caused little damage and fracking rather than wastewater injection in their work dr eaton and xuewei bao a postdoctoral researcher looked into the links in more detail analyzing seismic data from a series of quakes at fox creek in late and early and records from wells where fracking was occurring at the time they found two patterns to the seismicity to the east in the fault zone most of the earthquakes occurred during the fracking process itself which lasted up to a month to the west there were few immediate quakes they occurred intermittently over several months after the fracking ended dr eaton said the fracking process could be likened to small underground explosions shocks that travel into the rock formation and rapidly change the stress patterns within if there is a critically stressed fault those stress changes are sufficient to push it over the edge he said that appears to be what happened in the eastern direction once the fracking stops those stresses relax fairly quickly he said but they found that to the west much of the fracking fluid remained underground in the fractured shale that would lead to more persistent pressure within the fault zone and more earthquakes over time dr eaton said he and others were conducting more research to understand why alberta responds differently to fracking than oklahoma and other parts of the united states its a different situation he said and understanding the origin of the differences is important

how can my team make the n f l playoffs its a simple question but answering it can be devilishly complicated at this point in the season when teams have six or seven games remaining the playoff picture is delightfully foggy for a normal fan particularly one for whom sports are a blissful escape from say the tumultuous world of american electoral politics its surprisingly difficult to figure out and more often than not the television commentators dont make things any easier its always bothered us too so we built an interactive tool to help us understand our n f l playoff simulator now entering its third year of existence is built for one purpose to help you explore the paths to the playoffs for every team in the n f l it works like this we let you choose the outcomes of any game you select and simulate every other game remaining in the season what makes this tool more useful than other online calculators like the ones at espn yahoo or nfl com is that we do the work for you theres no need to pick the outcomes of every game left in the season pick any outcomes or none at all and our tool will simulate the rest of the season for you instantly identifying the most important games remaining for each team and turning you into a playoff scenarios expert consider the minnesota vikings who started the season but have slipped in minnesotan fashion to at the moment we give them just better than odds of making the playoffs if they beat the cardinals in minnesota on sunday their odds move to percent if they lose those odds drop to about percent but what if the detroit lions who share the vikings record lose all their remaining games that kind of thinking is precisely what this tool was made for our simulator also lets you explore specific and unrealistic paths like one in which the vikings finish the season with the n f c s best record a bye week and home field advantage throughout the playoffs finally weve added a feature this year for fans of teams like the cleveland browns whose season is effectively over we now let you use the simulator backward to see how the browns could have their best shot at a no pick in the n f l draft as the season comes to an end figuring out who will finish last can get just as complicated as figuring out who will finish first if youre going to root against your own team you might as well do it as intelligently as possible
american officials accuse him of being part of the inner leadership circle of al qaedas syrian affiliate most widely known as the nusra front and of raising as much as million for the terrorist group while signing up thousands of fighters but abdallah muhammad al muhaysini insists that he could not be more surprised to learn that the united states treasury department had designated him as a terrorist and ordered his funds frozen today syrians are shocked to find that the united states has put on the terror list a person whom they consider to be a national symbol mr muhaysini said in a skype interview with the new york times last week its a very bizarre thing abdallah al muhaysini is an independent figure he added how can the american state department describe abdallah al muhaysini as belonging to fath al sham he said using a version of the nusra fronts new name until now mr muhaysini a year old saudi born cleric who said he was calling from syria had not been the type to contact western publications that he is doing so is most likely a reflection of how the nusra front is trying to buy itself some flexibility by publicly rebranding even if no one in counterterrorism circles believes it is truly changing public relations efforts have become paramount in the contest within the jihadist world for recruits and resources and in the effort to evade military reprisals from foreign powers in what analysts say is a calculated move to hide its ties to al qaeda the nusra front recently rebranded itself as a local insurgency against the government of bashar al assad declaring that it no longer intended to target the west and changing its name to jabhat fath al sham or the levant conquest front but experts and intelligence officials say the group is still an essential part of al qaeda committed as ever to competing with the islamic state for territory and support and leaving the fight against pro assad forces a lower priority colin p clarke an analyst at the rand corporation argues that the nusra front is actually the biggest of al qaedas branches with approximately fighters and he characterized the groups public split from al qaeda as simply a feint a way for the group to hunker down and rebuild as the islamic state gets pounded by airstrikes it has been used to give themselves a little bit of breathing room mr clarke said just as officials and analysts were not buying the nusra fronts attempt to rebrand they will not be trusting mr muhaysinis protests that he is merely a religious scholar with no stake in the jihadist competition in syria experts on the nusra front agree with american and european officials in considering mr muhaysini to be a senior leader in the group with deep ties to al qaedas international network and in his public communications up to now mr muhaysini himself has left little room between his positions and al qaedas appearing in social media posts eulogizing dead qaeda leaders and encouraging suicide bombers his biography has even appeared in the qaeda magazine al risalah in a skype interview on friday from a room illuminated by a single fluorescent bulb mr muhaysini seemed relaxed often breaking into a toothy grin as he insisted that he posed no threat to the west when asked he acknowledged having contacted ayman al zawahri the global chief of al qaeda in yes i talked to ayman zawahri because he is an old and generous sheikh and i asked him to speak about daesh because he has a huge audience he said using a derogatory acronym for the islamic state i wanted him to talk about daesh to prevent the youth from joining he describes the images that have appeared of him with other well known qaeda leaders and the comments he has made about them as similar to photographs that might emerge from a summit meeting in which president obama is seen sitting next to president vladimir v putin of russia it doesnt mean that they share an ideology he said after he was listed by the treasury department mr muhaysini contacted the times via an intermediary to confirm his identity the times compared his image on skype to his official portrait as well as his voice to previous recordings issued by him he further interacted with the times using his official twitter account which with over followers has become a reference point for jihadists in syria i am very well known i am like a sheikh he said saying he was skyping from a location in aleppo province a detail that could not be confirmed people around me told me to hide my location but i cant hide anything because im known to everyone i couldnt be working secretly for anyone thomas joscelyn is an analyst who has been tracking mr muhaysini since and has documented his close ties to al qaeda among the signs that mr joscelyn says point to mr muhaysinis allegiance to al qaeda is the fact that he tried to play a mediating role after the islamic state began clashing with al qaeda in syria after al qaedas leadership disowned the islamic state in mr muhaysini took to his popular twitter feed to tell islamic state members to defect to the qaeda group referring to al qaedas leader as the sheikh of the mujahedeen mr muhaysinis description of himself as an independent observer is part of al qaedas strategy of not broadcasting its allegiance and of using local groups as a fig leaf to obscure its real goals mr joscelyn said we consider this be to be a play out of al qaedas playbook he said they want to have ambiguity about their organizational affiliations because it makes it more difficult for them to achieve their goals if they are known as al qaeda so we dont take these denials at face value

heres how president elect trump could unify a bitterly divided america provide well paying jobs to many of the millions of disaffected workers who voted for him and lift the economy stock market and tax rolls all he needs to do is what he presumably does best build something and i dont mean a few miles of asphalt or a paint job on a rusting bridge build something awe inspiring something americans can be proud of something that will repay the investment many times over for generations to come build the modern day equivalent of the golden gate bridge the hoover dam the lincoln tunnel or the timberline lodge or even given mr trumps passion for the sport another bethpage state park black course the first public golf course to host the prestigious united states open all of these are depression era public works projects that are still in use can anyone name even one infrastructure project from president obamas billion american recovery and reinvestment act i didnt think so in fairness to mr obama republicans in congress bitterly opposed his public works spending plans and he lamented there were too few shovel ready projects that didnt stop franklin delano roosevelt his public works administration and works progress administration using combinations of public and private money solicited proposals from states and cities hired millions of workers and eventually built bridges miles of roads miles of airport runways playgrounds and military and civilian buildings including more than schools in most cases to high standards of quality and design the federal government built the la guardia ronald reagan washington national and los angeles international airports the upper mississippi locks and dams the bonneville power project on the columbia river the robert f kennedy bridge in new york and the florida keys overseas highway most are still in use today to a large degree this is the infrastructure that made america great to borrow mr trumps catchphrase what roosevelt accomplished is astounding said scott myers lipton a sociology professor at san jose state university and author of the books rebuild america solving the economic crisis through civic works and ending extreme inequality but its not so much the numbers people remember today most people just know there was an alphabet soup of organizations he said what they see and remember are the landmarks the bay bridge reagan national airport or the baseball stadium in san jose were living on that legacy today repealing obamacare lowering taxes for businesses and mostly wealthy people overhauling the immigration system and privatizing medicare what congressional republicans have cited as their top legislative priorities would be divisive in a nation bitterly split along partisan and geographic lines but nearly everyone agrees that america has grossly neglected its infrastructure even as the rest of the world notably china has raced ahead our airports are like from a third world country mr trump said at hofstra university during the first presidential debate you land at la guardia you land at kennedy you land at lax you land at newark and you come in from dubai and qatar and you see these incredible you come in from china you see these incredible airports and you land weve become a third world country who could disagree hillary clinton also called for a big increase in infrastructure spending the single best thing the federal government can do to promote economic growth is to repair and build the transportation network the highways railroads and airports said roger noll an emeritus professor of economics at stanford and a senior fellow at the stanford institute for economic policy research its been neglected for years last year dan mcnichol author of the book the roads that built america a history of the interstate highway system and a white house adviser on transportation issues for president george h w bush navigated the country in a hudson commodore on a mission to investigate the state of americas infrastructure i was trying to see if this was really a crisis or a media sensation he told me this week from california where hes working on the states high speed rail project i found out its pretty dire in terms of total infrastructure for a nation that leads the world in global trade our systems are failing mr trump has pledged trillion over years but no one i spoke to thought that was enough doubling that would be more realistic mr mcnichol said and mr trumps campaign proposal was limited to infrastructure projects that could pay for themselves out of user fees which seems like a shortsighted approach most economists say the best way to finance a big public works program particularly given todays low interest rates would be for the government to borrow most of the money from investors pulling off something on the scale of the depression era public works programs would be no small feat recent federal infrastructure efforts including reconstruction after hurricanes katrina and sandy as well as the obama stimulus program hardly inspire confidence alan brinkley a professor of history at columbia said he doubted mr trump could replicate roosevelts achievements roosevelt had a coherent mission if not always a consistent way to address the depression and the economic crisis mr brinkley said he was eclectic in his approach because he was pragmatic even more important roosevelt was informed surrounded himself with informed people and was prepared on day to begin im not sure that trumps policies go beyond his electioneering slogans mr brinkley said im afraid a new p w a he added referring to the public works administration will stand for promises without actions but in the spirit of magnanimity lets give mr trump the benefit of the doubt as mr obama has suggested hell need his own versions of harold l ickes roosevelts interior secretary who ran the p w a and his close adviser harry l hopkins who ran the w p a mr trump will also need to be hands on
san francisco an automated army of pro donald j trump chatbots overwhelmed similar programs supporting hillary clinton five to one in the days leading up to the presidential election according to a report published thursday by researchers at oxford university the chatbots basic software programs with a bit of artificial intelligence and rudimentary communication skills would send messages on twitter based on a topic usually defined on the social network by a word preceded by a hashtag symbol like clinton their purpose to rant confuse people on facts or simply muddy discussions said philip n howard a sociologist at the oxford internet institute and one of the authors of the report if you were looking for a real debate of the issues you werent going to find it with a chatbot theyre yelling fools dr howard said and a lot of what they pass around is false news the role fake news played in the presidential election has become a sore point for the technology industry particularly google twitter and facebook on monday google said it would ban websites that peddle fake news from using its online advertising service facebook also updated the language in its facebook audience network policy which already says it will not display ads in sites that show misleading or illegal content to include fake news sites in some cases the bots would post embarrassing photos make references to the federal bureau of investigation inquiry into mrs clintons private email server or produce false statements for instance that mrs clinton was about to go to jail or was already in jail the use of automated accounts was deliberate and strategic throughout the election the researchers wrote in the report published by the project on algorithms computational propaganda and digital politics at oxford because the chatbots were almost entirely anonymous and were frequently bought in secret from companies or individual programmers it was not possible to directly link the activity to either campaign except for a handful of joke bots created by mrs clintons campaign they noted however there was evidence that the mystery chatbots were part of an organized effort there does seem to be strategy behind the bots dr howard said by the third debate trump bots were launching into their activity early and we noticed that automated accounts were actually colonizing clinton hashtags a hashtag is used to indicate a twitter posts topic by adopting hashtags relating to mrs clinton the opposition bots were most likely able to wiggle their way into an online conversation among clinton supporters after the election the bot traffic declined rapidly with the exception of some pro trump programs that gloated we won and you lost dr howard said trump campaign officials did not respond to requests for comment twitter executives argued that more people would not follow the programs and so they would be picked up only by those who looked for particular hashtags anyone who claims that automated spam accounts that tweeted about the u s election had an effect on voters opinions or influenced the national twitter conversation clearly underestimates voters and fails to understand how twitter works said nick pacilio a twitter spokesman the researchers based their study on a collection of about million twitter posts gathered in the first nine days of november they selected tweets based on hashtags identifying certain subjects and identified automated posting by finding accounts that post at least times a day for example the top accounts which were mostly bots and highly automated accounts averaged over tweets a day and they generated more than tweets the researchers noted the top accounts which still used high levels of automation generated around tweets at an average rate of tweets per day the oxford researchers had previously reported that political chatbots had played a role in shaping the political landscape that led to britains brexit vote the researchers have coined the term computational propaganda to describe the explosion of deceptive social media campaigns on services like facebook and twitter in a previous research paper dr howard and bence kollanyi a researcher at corvinus university of budapest described how political chatbots had a small but strategic role in shaping the online conversation during the run up to the brexit referendum the bot managers seem to repurpose the programs as well during the british campaign they discovered that a family of bots that had been tweeting around israeli palestinian issues for three or four years had suddenly become pro brexit after the vote the bots returned to their original issue in the case of the american election the researchers noted that highly automated accounts the accounts that tweeted or more times with a related hashtag and user mention during the data collection period generated close to percent of all twitter traffic about the presidential election they also noted that bots tend to circulate negative news much more effectively than positive reports one of the consequences of the intense social media campaigns will be a rise in what social scientists

i was and had fallen in love he was a grad student who lived in a long narrow apartment with a room devoted solely to books i didnt live there with him but my toothbrush did i lived in a dorm a minute drive away but he and i hardly spent a night apart when id finished my work for the day hed pick me up at the back gate of my dorm i always ran to his car because it was cold and because walking would not get me to him fast enough this was first love the real thing the full symphony but i thought his love was predicated on my ability to keep a secret from him ill tell you that secret because im not afraid you wont love me for a year and a half i had been struggling with a bout of anorexia that had knocked pounds off my already slim frame i had to be weighed multiple times a week at the medical center at yale where i went to school and i saw a therapist almost as often the causes for my eating disorder ran along the usual lines depression an inability to express my rage a desire to exert control a desire to feel less a desire to have my body express the things my voice could not that and i had gotten in the habit of believing it was better to take up less space when i met the boy i fell in love with i was a year into this disease and subsisting on less than calories a day love didnt make me better but it made me happier and it gave me the incentive to appear well even if i was not my boyfriend would make a full pot of persian style rice and put half of it on my plate hed buy me a giant bowl of oatmeal loaded with peaches and granola and nuts i ate everything he gave me this was when i was still chugging liters of water before my appointments to bring up my weight but in his presence i ate because i thought if he knew there was something wrong with me he wouldnt want me and i ate because the food came from him which pardoned it in my disordered mind anything he touched was good including me i gained a little weight this way pretending to be o k at the end of the school year my nurse told me i wouldnt have to be weighed over the summer i trust you she said this made me anxious what if i failed my summer internship took me back to los angeles to my parents house my boyfriend stayed in new haven to do research i cried so much when he dropped me off at the hartford airport my face was still puffy when i landed at lax my parents were leaving for the summer so id be living in the house by myself our old craftsman house which even family skeptics agreed was haunted and the spirits had always seemed most active around me are you sure youll be all right my mother asked at i had never lived alone i still occasionally slept with my teddy bear i was still afraid of the dark but i had an investment in being brave i wanted not only to seem well but also to seem like an adult yes ill be fine the noises began at night footsteps on the stairs running water voices and laughter from the other room it had been bad before but never like this i started waking up in the middle of the night with all the lights turned on one morning i came downstairs and the chairs had been pulled out from the dining room table i took to sleeping in my parents room with the television on full blast if i was brave enough to get through the night i thought surely i could take care of myself in other ways but i had a practical problem i had no idea how to feed myself in sickness i had constructed a mode of eating that relied heavily on props filling a plate and eating only the vegetables for instance with my boyfriend i was eating real meals but again under his gaze now no one was watching no one was weighing me i was the only arbiter of my body what does a person eat when her only goal is satiation who was i when i was alone finally i hit on a system mornings were yogurt and granola lunches were whatever they ordered at work and on sundays i would buy frozen tamales fresh zucchini and tofu carbohydrate vegetable protein every night i would roast the tofu and zucchini in the oven while i steamed a tamale then i would put on a movie to fill the darkness of the empty house and eat it wasnt wellness exactly but night after night i filled my plate and ate everything on it when i saw my boyfriend again at the end of the summer i thought i could see surprise in his eyes at the changed shape of my body it made me defensive full feeling had returned to me and with sentience came sharpness rage one warm night walking home together he asked if i had ever had an eating disorder i pulled away stung and pretended i didnt know what he was talking about but later in bed with a strange silence between us i asked him to cover his face with his pillow i didnt want to watch the love drain from him when i told him the truth it all came out more than i thought i had to say when i finished he pulled the pillow away and met my eyes i saw love there before he said anything dragging the terrible thing into the light can strip it of
istanbul a prominent columnist wrote recently about how president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey hates cigarettes so much that he confiscates packs from his followers lecturing them on the evils of smoking the columnist kadri gursel then urged his readers to protest the presidents anti democratic ways by lighting a cigarette and not putting it out for that mr gursel was arrested on terrorism charges and is being held in pretrial detention one of journalists who have been jailed in turkeys crackdown on the news media since a failed coup attempt in july there he has the company of colleagues from his newspaper cumhuriyet the countrys last major independent publication among them are its editor and the papers chief executive arrested as he stepped off a flight to istanbul last friday turkey now has handily outstripped china as the worlds biggest jailer of journalists according to figures compiled by the committee to protect journalists the jailings are the most obvious example of an effort to muzzle not just the free press but free speech generally more than turks have faced charges of insulting the president including a former miss turkey merve buyuksarac who posted on instagram a satirical rewording of the countrys national anthem as if mr erdogan were singing she was sentenced to months in prison suspended on the condition that she not repeat any offensive remarks the government and its supporters are behind a wave of demands to twitter to remove offending posts more than all other countries in the world put together according to twitters transparency report several journalists including mr gursel whose column was published three days before the coup attempt have been retroactively accused of subliminal messaging in support of the july uprising even more risky now is anything viewed as support for the outlawed kurdish nationalist party the pkk some have been attacked for calling members of the group militants rather than terrorists others are in jail for advocating a resumption of the collapsed peace process with the kurdish guerrillas although few here dare use the word guerrilla failing to mention how many people were killed in the attempted coup in any article about it is also considered proof of terrorist sympathies others have been convicted of terrorism charges for reporting on a scandal in which mr erdogans government was accused of supplying weapons to the islamic state which it is now fighting in syria one of those is cumhuriyets former editor in chief can dundar who was free on appeal when he announced in august that he was not returning from a trip to germany saying he could not expect a fair trial in the wake of the coup attempt in addition to the jailings here some news outlets have been shuttered ranging from tv stations to online enterprises according to erol onderoglu the turkish representative for reporters without borders but probably the most corrosive long term effect of the crackdown has been a highly effective government push for businessmen who are loyal to it to take over ownership of many of the remaining outlets turning them into avid cheerleaders for mr erdogan and his policies whats left they are all basically pravda said gulsin harman who left her job as a foreign editor at milliyet a once independent newspaper that is now owned by an erdogan crony there is no more critical journalism percent of the free press is destroyed directly or indirectly mr onderoglu said investigative journalism is considered treason journalism has been stolen by the government asked for comment a senior government official who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with official policy maintained that the journalists in jail in turkey were there for criminal and terrorist offenses not for their journalism he also said there remained many publications in turkey that were critical of the government there have been press crackdowns in turkey before especially during periods of military rule and even mr erdogan and his government have used press laws and intimidation against journalists on a large scale since but the sweeping emergency powers granted to mr erdogan after the failed military coup against him by supporters of the exiled muslim cleric fethullah gulen have greatly accelerated the crackdown never has there been such a dark period as this said ayse yildirim a cumhuriyet columnist who found out by accident that criminal charges had been lodged against her for reporting on a kurdish baby killed by a police bullet at a protest in addition to mr dundar and the cumhuriyet staff members in jail the papers employees are fending off an estimated other criminal cases against them on a variety of charges such as offending turkishness the president or local officials terrorism and membership in the pkk now even publishing a not nice picture of erdogan would be trouble said one prominent journalist who spoke only on condition of anonymity because she feared she would be arrested as many of her colleagues have been now we even have ministers calling us and saying why did you run that picture of me i dont like the way it looks she said some of the most virulent attacks on independent minded journalists have come from journalists in the pro erdogan press who are known by their colleagues as hit men first they attack the target by name then personally lobby with intimidated media owners or the government to have the person fired or jailed the most notorious and effective of such hit men is a television commentator and social media activist named cem kucuk a nationalist who many journalists say is really a government operative when a new york times journalist telephoned to arrange an interview with him his colleagues said he could more easily be reached at the presidents office mr kucuk laughed about that comment saying no no im very close to erdogan he denied he was a presidential employee but made no apologies for advocating the jailing of journalists he views as traitors and supporters of

monterrey mexico like many football crazed boys luis carranza grew up with a poster of emmitt smith his hero on his bedroom wall and vowed to emulate him he took a one hour bus ride to football practice starting at age and the discipline of study running study running earned him a spot first on an elite high school team and then on what may as well be mexicos crimson tide the rams of tec de monterrey he is now a star running back and pint size fans cried out his name and engulfed him for autographs after a recent victory even though an injury had knocked him out of the game early a star is a star its such a big tradition here carranza said everybody is committed even the little fans there is no tailgating here but the stadium tacos arent bad nobody cries gooooool at a big score but the touch in touchdown gets more gusto instead of billion dollar television deals the games are limited to local tv and streamed on an internet site and whatever signing bonus these players have in their future will probably come not from the n f l but from the law firms and businesses many are headed to after graduation the addiction to the other ftbol ftbol soccer as people make the distinction here is better known in this country but the fever for american football ftbol americano feeds a vibrant subculture rooted in college teams that attract thousands of fans and players for the tigres the potros the aztecas the pumas the guilas and one of the oldest and most winning teams the borregos salvajes the big difference with the americans is size and speed in which they have an advantage over us carranza said explaining the appeal but here we play with heart on monday the n f l picking up on the american football passion here will play its first regular season game in mexico in years the houston texans versus the oakland raiders at the famed azteca stadium in mexico city the game the first monday night football contest to be played outside the united states is sold out with expected to attend american football does not have the global reach of basketball and baseball but it is played in dozens of countries in an international tournament of college teams mexico has won back to back championships this year defeating a team from the united states made up of division iii players mexico has also done well in postcollegiate international tournaments this surprises nobody in monterrey where the borregos salvajes have long exemplified the best football in the country it was only a scrimmage but the teams defeat of blinn college in texas which featured cam newton at quarterback is still recalled here with the fervor of the catch and other great n f l plays we didnt know anything about the team but we heard all this talk about this great division i quarterback playing for them said sergio cantu muoz a tec coach and former player who intercepted newton then playing for blinn between stops at the university of florida and auburn pulling up the video of the play he keeps on his cellphone he added i didnt realize until later how important it was a handful of its players over the years have landed on practice squads in the n f l but mexico has had only fledgling professional leagues including one that started in february but has only four teams most players here know that college is the pinnacle of the sport and then they graduate and move on to careers the league gives players seven years of eligibility as long as they remain enrolled in classes meaning some are earning masters degrees carranza is studying to be a lawyer as are several of his teammates while other players are working toward jobs in finance engineering and other professions the team claims a percent graduation rate it makes tec de monterrey one of the highest ranking universities academically in latin america something more of a stanford then but with more championships than any other college it can brag of the winning tradition of an alabama i would say they are like a midway division ii team or a strong division iii said frank gonzalez a former longtime coach who unsuccessfully sought to have the university join the n c a a there have been many players good enough to play in the n f l but there are many more players good enough in the united states there is no pipeline here to send them to the league the players say they are in it more for the game than for the fame unlike soccer with a powerful professional league and a system of clubs and academies to recruit and mold young players american football has a pipeline that is more ad hoc many have followed a similar progression the sons of players who joined one of the hundreds of youth football clubs in the country and then landed on high school and college teams most often with the help of scholarships tec de monterrey has had a football team for nearly years an outgrowth of the sport carried to mexico by american visitors years before television and more recently the internet have helped stoke interest in the game n f l and college games have regularly aired for years and cable and satellite television has expanded the offerings with tec and the proximity to the border about a three hour drive to texas monterrey has been a football hotbed on a recent night hundreds of children clad in helmets and pads raced up and down a field under stadium lights aspiring to join tec or one of its rival teams some of the rams coach the younger players concerns about concussions and their serious consequences into adulthood have been raised by parents here though the issue has not been as extensively
cairo the student leader spoke in english to the chanting crowd at the elite american university of cairo the leader amr el alfy told his peers that he was frustrated over the university administrations lack of clarity about whether tuition would rise as much as percent in response to egypts flailing economy and floating currency mr el alfy said that he was so frustrated that he thought about blocking the campus gate with his car a volkswagen golf this should be an economic sanctuary he declared for days hundreds of students have been marching through the palm dotted campus demanding a cap on their tuition the demonstrations are the largest and longest running at the institution in years reflecting how egypts economic woes have touched nearly everybody in this stratified society of million people while the poor have scrambled to find food staples and to absorb price increases of even a penny middle class and wealthy egyptians are car pooling more and shopping less putting their savings into stable assets like real estate bank bonds and gold and even waiting to have children when the economic crisis hits the elite it means the suffering is all over the place said malak rostom the vice president of the student union if we cant afford it we can tell how much other people are suffering some egyptians may sneer at the problems of the children of middle and upper class families worried about tuition increases that dwarf the salaries of the countrys vast legions of impoverished but generations of graduates of the american university have helped lead egypts government business and nonprofit sectors so any problem on the campus can spiral outward with magnified effect youll say those are the proletariat one prominent television host amr adeeb said in a recent broadcast as if expecting a collective eye roll among his audience fine but dont you want to have some educated people in this society the american university protests began a week ago after the university administration staged a forum to discuss the repercussions of the central banks decision to decrease the value of the egyptian pound against the dollar in an effort to thwart black market currency traders and shore up the economy the pound is now trading at about per dollar up from on nov when the pound was floated the banks decision was part of a government effort to win a billion loan from the international monetary fund which came through last friday but for students whose tuition is tied to the united states dollar the currency flotation threatened to translate to an instant increase in fees to about egyptian pounds a year for the cheapest degree from about pounds the american universitys students are the apex of an elite group of students enrolled at private universities where the curriculum is often taught in english and fees reach thousands of dollars each semester the vast majority of the countrys million university students attend overcrowded ramshackle public institutions often looking at the elite campuses with envy and disdain though the american universitys fees have long been out of reach for most egyptians two thirds of its students receive scholarships based on financial need according to the administration and some families sell off assets to pay for the education salam hefzi who is and studying marketing said that her mother a widow sold two apartments that salam was meant to inherit to cover her tuition the money is good for another two years if the tuition stays the same ms hefzi said my tuition might reach a quarter of a million pounds im dead scared the effects of the foundering economy on the middle class may pale compared with the suffering of poor people now unable to afford basic foodstuffs but that does not mean they are not felt at a cairo mall that was all but abandoned one recent afternoon clothing prices at h m were going up so fast that the tags were obsolete and a cashier was informing customers of the new prices instead outside another nearly empty mall one shopper roaya iskander said that she and her husband were putting off having children because of the unstable economy many workers said they had been car pooling since gas prices rose to the equivalent of cents a liter this month up from cents many others have lost jobs because their employers can no longer afford to import raw materials or because sales have contracted amr alaa and his pregnant wife ala mashour worked at abbvie an american pharmaceutical research and development company they said they were out for sushi one night last month when they saw emails on their smartphones announcing a meeting the next day to discuss their future instead they said they turned up at the office to find themselves and colleagues locked out fired we are just sitting at home depressed now mr alaa said just looking for jobs online other well off egyptians have tried to stave off losing their savings by purchasing apartments bonds and gold bars sales of gold are up to percent this year according to ehab wassef who represents gold sellers in the union of chambers of commerce but many more it seems woke up the day after the currency was floated and found their savings had been halved you live at a certain level and its hard to go down said sana saleh a widow who had cut back on food and dialed down her electricity use trying to keep her daughter in a private school whose tuition is egyptian pounds a month timothy kaldas a nonresident fellow at the tahrir institute for middle east policy said that wealthy egyptians spent a significant amount on education and that most private schools based tuition on the value of the dollar because they had many foreigners as faculty members american universitys tuition which already went up percent for this academic year is particularly vulnerable to currency fluctuations one half of the

every day on her way to the practice floor at pauley pavilion u c l a s womens basketball coach cori close makes a point of walking past the banners for the national championships the bruins mens team won under john wooden close born in is too young to remember watching woodens teams but after a stellar playing career at the university of california santa barbara she received the chance to meet and then get to know wooden through her first job out of college as an assistant for u c l a s womens team steve lavin who coached the bruins men at the time introduced them close and wooden bonded over closes first name which she shared with woodens great granddaughter but that initial encounter spawned regular meetings usually on tuesday nights for years with close returning to woodens house every chance she got wooden died in a year before close returned to westwood as head coach but the lessons she took from those conversations continue to serve her today i dont know why he let me continue that relationship with him close said the reality is hes a much closer person to me than i am to him and im just really humbled and thankful not only just the stuff he talked to me about but that i got to watch him live over a long period of time for years really i dont know exactly how it started but im grateful that it did in important ways she said her teams are building on woodens legacy while some critics of the womens game take pains to point out its differences with mens basketball the similarities between the mens game of woodens time and the womens game of today are striking much more so than the mens games of then and now particularly in the aspects of coaching most important to wooden thats one of the reasons i love coaching womens basketball close said i dont have any one and doners its not just about helping them develop on the court one of the things coach wooden talked about was being a part of young mens lives nothing short of creating a transformational experience that helps them reach elite levels in basketball but also prepares them for life equips them for something bigger and deeper i do think the parallels are strong with womens basketball going back to coach woodens time its still about growing young women its still about seeing their growth over four years and thats really a joy to be a part of there is a logic to the idea that womens college basketball has in many ways reached the rough equivalent of what the wooden era was for the mens game consider that the n c a a tournament began in for the men and wooden won his title in years later the obvious analogue to wooden in the womens game is connecticuts geno auriemma who won his title in years after the n c a a created the womens tournament auriemma whose third ranked huskies meet no baylor on thursday night in one of the seasons most eagerly awaited games has long argued that the relative lack of parity at the very top of the womens college game is a consequence of a simple difference between the mens and womens versions many of the top male players leave after a single season while women are not even eligible to declare for the w n b a unless they turn during the calendar year of a draft maybe this year well look up and see four completely different teams that have never been in the final four auriemma said what are the chances of that slim and the reason for that is that everybody stays four years if we played with one and done thered be a lot of different teams every year in the final four as long as we get to keep our players for four years were going to have a lot of the same teams close is set to benefit from that reality the bruins recruiting class led by guard jordin canada and forward monique billings and rated as the best in the country at the time has ripened with the players now entering their junior seasons u c l a reached the n c a a tournaments round of in march and was picked by pacific coaches and the news media as the preseason favorite to win this seasons conference title an appearance in the final four would hardly be a surprise but for close woodens lessons have as much to do with appreciating the shared experiences she has enjoyed through her job as they do with continuing to develop a winning program i remember having a conversation with jordin canada and monique billings about what they dream of doing in their hometowns close said and why theyd want the chance to create a legacy and watching those building blocks right in front of my eyes those are really special moments woodens most tangible and best known guide to motivation is his celebrated pyramid of success so close had a huge version of the pyramid installed in her office in her first two years only the traits wooden placed on the bottom level industriousness friendship loyalty cooperation and enthusiasm were lit in the next phase the bruins focused on level self control alertness initiative and intentness i would say that were progressing to the third level if im being honest close said and were talking about skill now the first several years were all about culture habits building the internal workings culture was very adult driven the first few years and now its very player driven theyre starting to protect the culture fight for the culture believe in the culture and reinforce that and thats really been a blessing for me because its not about me its about equipping them to be leaders because wooden died before she
when iran conducted a mass hanging in august of sunni prisoners accused of attacks in its restive western kurdish region the executions were widely criticized as an egregious human rights violation but death penalty opponents also were appalled at what came next videos that showed apparently coerced confessions of the prisoners interwoven with ominous sounding music and clips of unrelated assaults by militants of the islamic state have been shown on iranian state television in the months since the executions produced and disseminated by official media outlets the videos contain no apologies for the mass hangings they apparently are meant to exploit fears among the countrys majority shiite population about the islamic state the sunni extremist group ensconced in syria and iraq that shares antipathy for both iran and the west human rights groups say the hangings in iran on aug put to prisoners to death one of the largest mass executions ever carried out in that country in a report about the videos issued wednesday titled broadcasting injustice boasting of mass killing the rights group amnesty international accused iran of having used stage managed confessions falsehoods and sensationalist screen titles like in the devils hands and in the depth of darkness to justify the mass hangings to a domestic audience in some cases the rights group said the confessions covered crimes committed well after the condemned had been incarcerated by parading death row prisoners on national tv the authorities are blatantly attempting to convince the public of their guilt but they cannot mask the disturbing truth that the executed men were convicted of vague and broadly defined offenses and sentenced to death after grossly unfair trials said philip luther amnesty internationals research and advocacy director for the middle east and north africa since the islamic revolution iran has been among the worlds leaders in administering the death penalty and has applied it for a wide range of crimes beyond homicide many of the executed have been convicted of drug offenses or on the more vaguely defined charge of enmity against god use of the death penalty in the region is not limited to iran saudi arabia and iraq for example also have been singled out by amnesty international and other human rights groups while these groups have long accused the judicial authorities in iran of using torture and other coercive methods against suspects the use of recorded confessions in sophisticated videos shown on national television is relatively new it seems iran has joined the regions propaganda industry producing slick videos featuring the apparently forced confessions of men they later executed as terrorists bizarrely interspersed with scary videos of islamic state attacks they had nothing to do with wrote sarah leah whitson the middle east director at human rights watch in an emailed reaction to the amnesty international report ms whitson also said she was troubled by the role of iranian media agencies in producing and distributing these videos which implicate them in a rather macabre and ugly form of abuse the amnesty report scrutinized the confessions shown in the videos in which the condemned men repeatedly described themselves as terrorists and heinous criminals who deserve their punishment the men confessed to membership in an outlawed sunni extremist group known as tohid and jihad which they said carried out attacks and plotted assassinations in some of the videos they compared themselves to the islamic state and said they would have committed atrocities worse than is if we had not been stopped the amnesty international report uncovered what it described as several inconsistencies in the videos suggesting the confessions had been scripted in some cases the men are linked to crimes that occurred months after they had been arrested or the nature of their involvement in the crimes attributed to them change massively from one video to another the report said there was no immediate response to the amnesty international report from iranian officials while they have often ignored criticism from amnesty international and other rights groups they are not immune to it a number of countries in the european union angered over irans use of the death penalty in drug related crimes have severed contributions to the united nations agency that helps iran finance its counternarcotics campaign last month iranian media reported that irans parliament was debating a measure to reduce use of the death penalty in iranian judges were given the discretion to impose alternative penalties on juveniles convicted of capital offenses precisely how judges have used this discretion remains unclear but the change was seen as a response to criticism of iran for putting some children on death row the iranian government is sensitive to global public concern said sunjeev bery the advocacy director for the middle east and north africa at amnesty internationals washington office like many governments iranian officials may attempt to portray themselves as impervious to international criticism mr bery said but it can lead to many costs
facebook is moving to restore confidence among advertisers and publishers that it is accurately measuring how often and how long users see videos news articles ads and corporate messages on its social network the steps announced on wednesday followed the companys apology in september for an error that resulted in considerably overstating how long on average users spent watching videos on facebook facebook said that it would increase its use of outside measurement services for display and video ads the company said it is expanding its use of metrics services like comscore moat nielsen and integral ad science and looking to add others facebook said it would form a measurement council of ad agency executives and marketers to develop metrics suited to the needs of advertisers to communicate more openly facebook established a blog metrics fyi to post regular updates on the metrics it uses and what its analysts have found this is an important evolution for facebook said randall rothenberg chief executive of the interactive advertising bureau a trade group of media and technology companies including facebook this is facebook saying yes we know that we need to be and are getting more involved in advertising transparency in the first blog post facebook after a lengthy internal audit said it had uncovered a few more bugs one such miscalculation involved double counting of repeat visitors to view what are known as marketers organic messages regular facebook posts by companies rather than paid ads the post said correcting that problem it said would have reduced the measurement of the number of unique users seeing the marketers messages by percent on average over a seven day period and by percent over the day span the facebook data analysts also found that the time spent on what are known as instant articles fast loading news items tailored for easier reading on smartphones was overstated on average by to percent the blog said but another bug resulted in undercounting a video metric the facebook research found that the number of people viewing video ads from beginning to end was percent higher than it had previously calculated facebook emphasized that that newly uncovered flaws involve only a few of the more than metrics facebook deploys the impact of the disclosure of further calculation miscues after the september apology is uncertain advertisers and publishers have little choice but to embrace facebook given its huge audience and its dominance with google of online advertising early this month facebook reported that its third quarter profits surged percent from a year ago to nearly billion but analysts said concerns about the accuracy of facebooks metrics could prompt some to question whether they should invest so much time money and resources with the company its not like you can not use facebook as an advertiser or as a publisher said brian wieser a media industry analyst at pivotal research but it is a question of who do you prioritize and how many resources do you send that way the moves facebook has taken are intended to quell such doubts and restore its credibility among advertisers and publishers our goal going forward facebook said in its web post is to communicate more regularly about our metrics so that our partners can focus on doing what they do best servicing their customers with the best insights possible yet a more skeptical view of digital advertising is emerging not only for reasons of measurement but some major advertisers wonder if it is as effective as they had assumed the ascendant view had been if its digital its better mr wieser said and i think with every passing incident those who have not been appropriately skeptical or appropriately critical have come down to earth a bit
a packed sweaty ready to mosh crowd greeted metallica in september at webster hall in manhattan a rare chance to see the band in a club rather than an arena for a set including two songs from hardwired to self destruct the bands first studio album in eight years eight years went by fast said a grinning james hetfield the bands singer rhythm guitarist and lyricist but not for you i guess the set included two songs from the new album that rev up to the punky speed metal tempos of metallica hardwired with a chorus delivering unbridled pessimism in four letter words and moth into flame a tirade at the corrosive effects of fame and social media infamy all for publicity destruction going viral songs about rage mayhem madness and annihilation are business as usual for metallica on hardwired to self destruct its metallicas studio album its first on its own blackened recordings label and its first since death magnetic in although its songs clock in at under minutes which means they could be squeezed onto a single cd its being released on friday as a double album a grander statement by phone from paris on tuesday mr hetfield said that in his latest lyrics a lot of it is tongue in cheek a lot of it is cynicism as an adult you get to stand back and see what is happening in the world and put your cents in metallica has embraced its adulthood reclaiming the attack of its music while jettisoning the image of a hard rock band as young fast and out of control were a bunch of fairly happy go lucky people who when we get together theres a lot of energy that happens in the music said lars ulrich the bands drummer who writes the songs with mr hetfield james certainly acknowledges that he carries a lot of things within him but i think its still possible to make energetic thrashy music without necessarily walking around being these sulky angry sullen dark people with black cartoon thunderstorms over their heads band members have gone through rehab and group therapy making the process public in the film metallica some kind of monster which showed the band working through entrenched hostilities to record an album its members are now settled family men who separate life and art back in the day making records and touring was pretty much the only thing that was going on mr ulrich said by phone from his home in san francisco now the band is basically secondary to our families to our domestic needs to our attempts at keeping our sanity checked we have a whole way of doing things that may not be the most efficient if people are counting the days until the next record but in terms of keeping the band somewhat sane and keeping the collective healthy its a different model for the new album metallica polished a style it has honed for years ever since mr hetfield answered an ad placed by mr ulrich to start the band mr hetfield howls his tidings of looming catastrophe over a fastidious fine tuned thrust and roar mr ulrichs drums mr hetfields rhythm guitar and robert trujillos bass hurtle through riff after riff fast and hard behind mr hetfields muscular growl and kirk hammetts screaming wriggling lead guitar solos instead of reinventing itself for this album metallica subtly tightened up notching up the amount of melody in guitars and vocals and trying to limit sprawling songs there was this strange thing for many years in our band mr ulrich said we were in such a hurry to move forward and in such a hurry to move away from certain perceptions about us that we kept chasing something that we didnt really need to chase he was referring to the albums often reviled by longtime fans that metallica made between its blockbuster metallica which sold million copies worldwide and death magnetic on which the producer rick rubin persuaded the band to embrace its past with the release of death magnetic metallica toured for three years but at a manageable adult pace we basically dont leave the house for more than two weeks at a time mr ulrich said theres almost a whole european soccer team between us in terms of the kids and we like to see them every couple of weeks so a tour takes a bit longer than it did when we used to play shows in days after its main three year tour metallica also put together two of its own ambitious orion music and more festivals for much of they collaborated with lou reed on his last album lulu in the band performed on all seven continents including antarctica mr hetfield noted work on hardwired to self destruct started in songwriting for metallica is like a giant jigsaw puzzle mr ulrich said the band records everything shows rehearsals soundchecks backstage jam sessions then it selects riffs and melodies and starts to fit them together theres just so much material that we accumulate all the time mr ulrich said james hetfield every time he turns his amp on its wait a minute stop did somebody record that riff put an x next to the thing he played at p m because it was awesome mr ulrich spent the summer of with an ipod holding every single note that wed recorded since death magnetic some tracks many were labeled by the city they were recorded in the album has riffs from chicago vilnius lithuania and glastonbury england in september mr ulrich said i walked into the studio with ideas from that ipod i thought this sounds like a good place to pop a blister and we just threw ourselves at it they recorded at metallica hq their rehearsal studio in san rafael calif on death magnetic songs had stretched out this time when the band found itself pushing toward extremes it made an effort to rein this in

social media has been in the glare since the election for its perceived harmful qualities such as the spreading of hate speech and the false information but the effect of social media on world affairs is much larger than just misinformation and mean tweets farhad manjoo writes in his new state of the art column he argues that social media now collectively used by billions of people worldwide through services like facebook snapchat twitter wechat and weibo has grown to a point where it is increasingly influencing the course of global events the election of donald j trump who used twitter to magnify his message is evidence of that shift farhad writes so was the rise of bernie sanders whose liberal philosophy and policies were also spread by social media and there are many other examples such as brexit and the momentum behind isis of events and movements most likely enabled by social media now each person with once maligned views can see that hes not alone farhad writes and when these people find one another they can get things done create memes publications and entire online worlds that bolster their worldview and then break into the mainstream social media is also in the spotlight for a different reason these days the kind involving big dollar signs that comes in the form of snap the parent company of the social media service snapchat which has filed confidentially for an initial public offering michael j de la merced and katie benner write snaps i p o which is likely to take place early next year is set to be the biggest tech offering since that of the chinese e commerce company alibaba in it presages a wave of other possible public offerings from highly valued tech start ups such as airbnb and uber time to mark your calendars
a swedish union has set up a hotline for workers to report instances of mansplaining as part of a weeklong effort to raise awareness of a certain kind of condescending elocution that men use to explain to women things they already understand well actually its not all men who do it of course but a certain kind of man you know him he is probably getting ready to mansplain this article to you the hotline which is temporary and open to men and women was set up by unionen a trade union that represents about private sector employees in sweden and describes itself as the largest white collar union in the world our objective is to contribute to awareness and start a discussion which we hope will be the first step in changing the way we treat each other and talk about each other in the workplace jennie zetterstrm a union spokeswoman said in an email on wednesday its important to create awareness about how seemingly small things that we do or say add up to a larger issue between a m and p m every day this week members are being encouraged to phone the hotline to talk about mansplaining in their working lives the calls will be answered by men and women who are gender experts authors academics and others the most important thing when we consulted these people is that they have knowledge and interest in the issue ms zetterstrm said both women and men carrying valuable experience for such a type of activity so far ms zetterstrm said callers have asked for advice on speaking up when they feel run over by male colleagues and on how to help female colleagues who are being ignored by men in their working groups others have asked how to address clients or colleagues who address only the male employees even when a woman is in charge and how to address men who get credit for a womans work the term mansplaining a portmanteau of explain and man entered popular usage after the author and historian rebecca solnit published a essay titled men explain things to me she described attending a party at which a man insisted on explaining to her a very important book he had heard about and did not immediately seem to absorb that she had written the book with a knowing roll of the eyes and a deep sigh women and some men recognized the experience ms solnit relayed and a new word was born just this year a man wrote to the advice columnist amy dickinson to complain that she had misused the term in her response to an earlier letter she replied that his letter contained an almost magical dynamic others complained that i had misused the word mansplaining but you are the only person to mansplain while doing it and last month the word was featured as an answer on jeopardy predictably the hotline in sweden has prompted a strong reaction the independent newspaper reported that unionens facebook page had been inundated with negative comments particularly from men our intention has never been to point fingers or blame all men our intention has simply been to spark an interest and start a debate at our work places and in society ms zetterstrm said she added that the debate had been lively and said of course its regretful if someone feels offended but the union says it hopes the hotline raises awareness of gender discrimination in the workplace and in doing so perhaps helps to alleviate it obviously not all men subject all women to mansplaining all of the time wrote peter tai christensen one of the gender experts who will be manning the phone lines that would be an absurd assertion and not based in reality but enough women are subjected to it by enough men for it to be a problem that warrants being addressed discussed and resolved
shenzhen china in a one man war room in his apartment a laid off walmart employee named wang shishu was tapping out a message on his phone to a group of workers and plotting his next move over the past few months mr wang has helped organize a national movement in china against walmart labor strikes have hit stores in the south simultaneously there have been boycotts in the northeast and here in shenzhen where walmart opened its first outlet in china two decades ago employees have filed a lawsuit demanding back pay we want a snowball effect he said in the booming baritone of a street preacher we want everybody to know what to do next as the chinese economy has slowed strikes and labor protests have broken out across the country mostly scattered episodes targeting a single factory or business the government has responded aggressively detaining activists and increasing censorship to keep unrest from spreading but activism against walmarts more than stores in china in recent months has followed a different pattern workers in several cities agitating against the same company bypassing official unions controlled by the communist party and using social media to coordinate their actions while the authorities largely stand aside across china walmart employees have raised their fists at protests chanting workers stand up they have appealed to local officials with patriotic fervor invoking the struggles of mao zedong against foreign imperialists they have posted screeds online against unkind bosses and union puppets in doing so the chinese work force of the worlds largest retail chain has put the ruling communist party in an uncomfortable position publicly testing its marxist commitment to defend the working class and pitting that against its fear of independent labor activism ever since the solidarity trade union helped topple communist rule in poland beijing has sought to prevent the emergence of a nationwide labor movement suppressing efforts by workers to organize across industries or localities but the authorities appear to be hesitating in the case of walmart whose workers have complained of low wages and a new scheduling system they say has left them poorer and exhausted in recent months as many as people about a fifth of the companys work force in china have joined messaging groups set up by mr wang and other activists on wechat a popular app in these forums they vent about company policies share protest slogans and discuss plans to coordinate demonstrations for maximum effect mr wang a former customer service representative whom walmart has fired twice spends his days babysitting his granddaughter and trading messages with workers across the country often as late as a m what theyre doing is inhumane he said i want walmart to return to the sympathetic company it used to be eli friedman a labor scholar at cornell university said the walmart movement was probably the most substantive example of sustained cross workplace independent worker organizing weve ever seen in chinas private sector the government appears to be keeping a distance because it is worried about provoking a backlash or about acting on behalf of a prominent american company against chinese workers at a time when nationalism in china is rising but by doing little or nothing it risks encouraging disaffected workers elsewhere especially at the growing number of national chain businesses with operations across china already workers at neutrogena stores and china unicom a state owned telecom operator have used similar tactics while avoiding serious punishment we can only expect that online organizing will continue to break down local barriers said keegan elmer a researcher for china labour bulletin an advocacy group based in hong kong the retail sector in particular has become a hotbed of worker activism the government wants to shift growth from manufacturing to service industries but many new jobs at restaurants hotels and stores are low paying or part time from july through september there were strikes and protests at service sector firms about double the number last year outpacing episodes in manufacturing for the first time since at least according to china labour bulletin chinese law requires businesses to establish labor unions but they are almost always controlled by management and companies generally use the unions to contain worker activism in the face of labor strife some businesses have offered back pay bonuses and other benefits to workers but others concerned that labor activism could force costly concessions have resorted to tougher tactics retaliating against those who help organize protests at walmart some of the most vocal workers have been deprived of raises reassigned or in some cases fired according to interviews with more than a dozen employees at one store in zhongshan west of shenzhen a labor activist said a supervisor photographed her in the bathroom as retribution for speaking out she asked not to be identified for fear of further antagonizing her bosses much of the discontent stems from a new scheduling system that walmart put in place this summer as a way the company said of giving workers more flexibility workers have argued that it has resulted in cuts to overtime pay and excessively long shifts and some say they were coerced into signing new contracts agreeing to the system walmart denied that it had treated its employees unfairly or had pressured them to accept the new schedules rebecca lui a spokeswoman said that the vast majority of its work force supported the new system and that employees were free to keep their old schedules our associates are our most valuable asset she said in a statement zhai xiuhua a former greeter at a walmart store in shenzhen said she was fired in september after leading a fight against the new scheduling system i told them even if you put a knife to my neck ill never agree she recalled at her home where her uniform and identification badge no still hang on the wall ms zhai worried about medical bills says she now hopes to find work in

reykjavik iceland iceland has discovered the secret to a booming tourist industry first have a mammoth financial implosion then an enormous volcanic explosion the collapse of the icelandic krona after the financial crisis transformed this arctic island packed with active volcanoes into a top destination by making it cheap for visitors two years later eyjafjallajokull erupted spewing thick ash clouds into european skies millions of passengers were grounded for days and airlines suffered financial losses but the explosion put iceland on the map the foreign news media descended on the island beaming images around the world of spectacular landscapes even as journalists struggled to pronounce the volcanos name iceland has been saved by the crash and the eruption said fridrik palsson who owns hotel ranga a luxury resort just miles from the slopes of eyjafjallajokull the letter volcano that is often shortened to e by foreigners i have never seen anything take off so fast he said the combined effect of the catastrophes has been an invasion on a scale possibly unseen since vikings raided the island hundreds of years ago tourists are expected to outnumber the local population of by seven to one next year according to official data by comparison last year visitors to france outnumbered the french by two to one tourism is now the islands biggest industry taking over from fishing and aluminum smelting much as the financial sector did in the years before the crash the influx could be even higher following the rise of the pirate party with its black pirate flag and anarchist leanings it recently gained more seats in parliament and even more attention helping to burnish icelands image as cool and alternative the number of tourists has risen by as much as percent every year for the last four years according to icelands tourist board they brought in revenues of billion in a third of the countrys export earnings tourism is the single biggest employer and many icelanders are pouring money into services and new construction mr palsson who used to sell iceland as a place to see the northern lights employs an astronomer in his hotel he has also invested in three expensive telescopes that are powerful enough for guests to see the rings on saturn or the fuzzy glow of a distant dying star landsbref a fund management company that was spun off from one of three failed icelandic banks set up a million tourism fund reykjavik looks like a scandinavian version of singapore compact clean orderly and rich streets are lined with crayola color houses and mercedes cars chic coffeehouses sell kale and date sandwiches and play ethiopian jazz restaurants offer inventive nordic cuisine using local ingredients like puffin and shark the a boutique hotel that was once an exclusive hangout for bankers is now filled with tourists in a possible dig at the hotels former denizens a sculpture of what looked like a gray suited banker hung on one wall with a cryptic instruction disconnect the battery remove the rear hood and hinge brackets inscribed beneath it tourists come from as far as hong kong they chase the northern lights they scale glaciers they dive in the arctic circle with puffins go horseback riding or take helicopter tours listening to ethereal whale like sounds by the icelandic band sigur ros fans of game of thrones flock to filming locations around the island some apparently genuinely in search of wildlings outside the capital thick white plumes of steam which are harnessed for icelands energy needs rise in the sky as if the earth were vaping hot springs are everywhere even in peoples backyards but there is growing concern that uncontrolled tourism is placing too large a burden on this small island housing prices and rents are rising quickly forcing young people to live with their parents car rentals have tripled clogging traffic littering and light pollution are spoiling parts of the landscape many icelanders say its like the city is not my city anymore birgitta jonsdottir the leader of the pirate party complained last month its like disneyland downtown a poll in october conducted by the national broadcaster ruv reported that percent of icelanders want the government to raise fees or taxes on tourists the tourist boom is making some icelanders uneasy another crash like the one that hit the banks is just a matter of time and many said they are saving money or investing in hard assets pessimists say all it takes to prick the tourism bubble is a sudden drop in visitors triggered by something like a financial crisis overseas or the adverse effects of britains exit from the european union its happening all over again said kristjan asjaersson a cabdriver during icelands short lived heyday he recalled having to crisscross the island just to deliver fish caught by icelandic billionaires they had forgotten to pack their catch before flying off in their private jets too many people rely on tourism he said when tourist numbers fall the economy will collapse again i know it will happen but i will be prepared diddi bardarson a tall man with russet locks that reveal his viking roots also predicted another crash instead of relying so heavily on tourism he is putting his financial security into a living asset icelands famous horses mr bardarson breeds hundreds of icelandic horses on a acre ranch in hella a small town miles southeast of reykjavik that straddles the salmon rich ranga river iceland exports nearly horses a year many of them to the united states and canada a fine stallion can fetch more than million horses are deep in our soul mr bardarson said feeding a year old black stallion named markus eyes hidden under luxuriously thick bangs who has sired more than horses horses were and still are our lifeline mr bardarson has also benefited from the tourism boom demand for his horses has grown sevenfold over the past few years he said partly because some rich tourists become so

lod israel it would be easy to miss the mosque in a temporary building with a concrete floor and corrugated roof but it is impossible to miss the constellation of six loudspeakers atop a giant metal structure resembling the eiffel tower five times a day starting well before dawn these loudspeakers broadcast the muezzins call to prayer in lod a city of arabs and jews near ben gurion international airport and therein lies one more friction point in a country full of them one groups expression of faith is anothers noise pollution and israels government is planning a crackdown a proposal backed by prime minister benjamin netanyahu and initially endorsed this week by his ministers would authorize the government to ban the use of loudspeakers by mosques and other houses of worship across israel for many on both sides of the nations sectarian line few questions could prove more provocative than whether the muezzin should be muzzled the call to prayer is a symbol of islam said adel elfar the imam of the lod mosque one of several that have been controversial here this is something thats existed for years he said that he could hear bells from a christian church in town and that jewish residents drove around the city every couple of months broadcasting from loudspeakers on their vehicles the call of every religion if you get rid of extremism shouldnt bother anybody he added and yet it does among those bothered is lods mayor yair revivo who is jewish and announced last month that the city would broadcast the shema a central prayer that begins hear o israel to counter the mosques call the first of islams five daily prayers begins before dawn noted col motti yogev a member of parliament who introduced the new ban the goal of the law is to prevent peoples sleep from being disturbed he said we have no desire to harm the prayer of the muslims the fight over the muezzin underscores a fundamental societal challenge for israel beyond its conflict with palestinians living in gaza or the occupied west bank about percent of israels citizens are arabs and cities like lod where about a third of the nearly residents are arab perennially struggle to find a comfortable balance the conflict has also grown in jerusalem which is divided between largely jewish and arab communities the proposed ban approved on sunday by mr netanyahus ministers and sent to parliament has drawn denunciations from jordan and the palestinian authority in a sign of the complexity of the issue it drew surprise opposition on tuesday from israels ultra orthodox health minister yaakov litzman who temporarily blocked parliamentary debate and sent the issue back to the ministers because it might also affect the use of sirens to announce the beginning of the jewish sabbath ahmad tibi a leader of the arab members of the israeli parliament or knesset said mr netanyahu was inflaming anti muslim sentiments if the muezzin law passes the knesset i call on the arab public in israel to rise up i call for a civil popular uprising he told a lebanese television outlet all muslims must be called to protect mosques to defend the calls from the mosques amnon beeri sulitzeanu of the abraham fund initiatives a nonprofit organization that promotes coexistence between jews and arabs said the proposal conflicted with mr netanyahus recent drive to increase investment in arab communities to reduce gaps in educational and economic opportunities you see those two conflicting trends yet again which basically tells me that the israeli establishment still hasnt made up its mind in regard to its arab citizens he said what do we want from the arab palestinian minority do we want to really integrate it and include it as an integrated part of israeli society the text of the proposed ban on mosque loudspeakers says that hundreds of thousands of citizens in parts of israel suffer habitually and daily from loud and unreasonable noise that is caused by the call of muezzin from mosques colonel yogev said it could be narrowed to apply only to sleeping hours mr netanyahu has said he is trying to balance competing interests israel is committed to freedom for all religions but is also responsible for protecting citizens from noise he said this week in lod which traces its history to the days of canaan frustration over the mosques has grown as more jewish residents have moved in since the evacuation of settlements in gaza a decade ago there is already a noise law on the books but advocates of the new legislation said it was not applied to the muezzin if someone is having a karaoke party with loudspeakers at night and you call the police they will come and take down the loudspeakers said amichai langfeld a member of the city council but if you call about the mosque they wont under existing law mr langfeld added the police must test the level of the call to prayer or of any noise to see if it exceeded the limit the new law would simply ban loudspeakers at mr elfars mosque the call to prayer was broadcast on tuesday at a m a m p m p m and p m the tension over the loudspeakers was easy to detect in a visit to a clothes and jewelry market a few blocks away several jewish shoppers and salespeople said that they did not mind the call during daylight hours but that the earliest one invariably woke them up some described trying to muffle the noise with curtains or blankets often to little effect naama reichmann who moved to lod about five years ago said the a m call made it hard for her and her year old daughter to sleep through the night we dont say they cant do it but not so loud she said chaim koti who was selling clothes was more pointed they do it intentionally loud in order to bother
cannon ball n d on any given night supper lines here at the dusty prairie camps near the missouri river where the last piece of a mile pipeline is set to be placed might include young navajo women from arizona who have never camped in the cold and older white women for whom chaining themselves to a fence for a cause is nothing new there are protest tourists in new boots lakota elders who spend hours in prayer parents from the suburbs who have dragged the children away from their video games they have all driven for hours sometimes days to join hundreds of protesters at the standing rock sioux reservation and they all need to eat the camps grew fast over the summer sometimes swelling on the weekends to what both organizers and the north dakota state patrol said was well over people the original intent was to stop or at least change the route of the dakota access pipeline a billion project that will stretch across four states the camps have since broadened into a gathering of people focused on bringing attention to environmental issues and the rights of indigenous people as the number of teepees and yurts built to withstand the brutal north dakota winter has grown so too have the camp kitchens no one is directly in charge of the chaotic but robust network of what amounts to several free restaurants which reflect both the broad spectrum of the nations diet and its battles over food politics there is no rhyme or reason but everyone gets fed rosetta buan a cook from asheville n c who is on her third trip here said sunday there are little miracles every day dishes get washed bellies get filled the roster of cooks can change daily bringing the kind of cutthroat power plays any chef will tell you is inherent in many professional kitchens writing a daily menu is a challenge the voluminous stream of food donations might produce pound bags of rice cases of funyuns butternut squash from an urban farm in detroit and roadkill deer supplies supplemented by runs to bismarck about an hours drive away are spread among pop up and permanent tents refrigerated trucks and wooden palettes on the ground anyone who is hungry heads to the dining tent grabs a plastic plate from a mismatched pile and lines up under a sign that reads lakota rules women and children first all that is asked is that you take a minute to wash dishes sort food or find some other way to pay for your meal with labor ms buan who owns the vegetarian restaurant rosettas kitchen in asheville was called upon during one trip to help figure out what to do with a donated buffalo that was hanging from the bucket of a bulldozer on this visit she is setting up a snug vegetarian kitchen that will feed about of her family members and friends who plan to stay through the winter even if energy transfer partners the dallas based company building the pipeline meets its goal and finishes the project by january like almost every cook here she will feed anyone who walks in the main kitchen is at the oceti sakowin camp the biggest of four camps within a short hike of one another most of the meals are prepared in a military tent outfitted with a burner propane stove and a few other large pieces of cooking equipment including a black smoker just outside the door members of the news media are warned that no images can be captured from within the main food tents for fear that health inspectors might spot violations and use them as an excuse to shut down the camps its hard to be up to code when you are camp cooking but were getting there said mateo cadena who took a break from his kitchen job at the yellowstone club a private resort in big sky mont to cook at the main kitchen for several days earlier this month the clash of food cultures is writ large here a sizable contingent of vegans and vegetarians struggle in a culture that is based on hunting game although everyone tries to be respectful a kitchen shift can get tense at the nearby sacred stone camp the lakota woman who runs a kitchen that can feed up to people a day struggles with a white cook from montana who insists that using propane is disingenuous when they are fighting an oil company and that children should not be fed white sugar caitlyn huss a manager of a vegan hostel in los angeles was closing up late one night last month when the tent flap opened and someone dropped off a deer that had just been killed by a car we knew we had to find an elder from the sacred fire to come and bless it then find someone who could skin it for us she recalled it was crazy brian yazzie a navajo chef who works for the sioux chef a native food company based in minneapolis said the cultural gap even among tribe members can be wide he spent a few days last month cooking at the camps and is gathering donations so he can head back during the week of thanksgiving he cooks food he describes as pre colonization local meat and vegetables and no gluten dairy or processed products its difficult at the camps he said when he first surveyed the supply tent he saw stacks of flour canned goods and vegetable oil it was like the mid when my ancestors were put on reservations or internment camps and given government rations to eat instead of their natural resources at the camp he made hominy and bison soup and roasted pumpkin with quinoa flavored with maple syrup it was not an automatic hit the palates of most of

my face the crying jordan meme was all over my social media feeds and although i had drifted from my tar heels obsessed childhood i felt unusually bummed out two powerhouse programs with huge followings had just played a game that featured a furious comeback in the final minutes a magic game tying shot by marcus paige north carolinas senior guard and of course jenkinss buzzer beater after the game paige choked up at the news conference and carolinas fan base let out a long sigh for a player it had cheered on for four years the game felt as if it had been scripted to hit all the nerve endings of what makes us care about college sports and if the quality of the actual play was not up to par no one but the most hardened sports wonk would have noticed quality of play does not have to be an expression of nostalgia but thats almost always the underlying sentiment like so many other slogans weve been hearing this year theres an unspoken condemnation of the inadequate present compared with some vaguely glorious past college basketball whose new season tips off this month used to be relatively immune from these sorts of comparisons nobody could watch say the duke maryland games of the early which featured eight or nine future pros and were contested in front of rabid crowds and a national television audience and persuasively argue that the game was better when jump shots required two ungainly seconds of setup before being fired from the hip progress was implicit that has changed over the past two years now there is a movement to make college basketball great again the doomsayers will tell you that the sport has become too slow and mechanical and low scoring thanks to coaching that banishes improvisation and enforces deliberate often excruciating to watch play the complaint began to ring during the season when everyone from mark cuban the owner of the dallas mavericks to jay bilas an espn announcer whose twitter feed offers the best running commentary on college basketball spoke up to say that it was in dire need of change the case was most clearly laid out by sports illustrateds seth davis he blamed the incessant timeouts fouls that dragged out the ends of games control freak coaches and physical defense davis drawing on the work of ken pomeroy the quant who has all but single handedly brought sabermetric rigor to college basketball provided a lot of statistics to support his case most notable overall scoring had reached its lowest point since and concluded with an edict until the pace of change speeds up dramatically this once beautiful game will grind to a halt last year in an attempt to reverse some of these trends the n c a a reduced the shot clock to seconds and told officials to make calls that would reduce physicality and ease freedom of movement the results were mixed teams played faster and scored more and with greater offensive efficiency but interest in the sport at least judging by tv ratings and overall attendance stagnated those who would restore or fix the quality of play may sound progressive but theirs is ultimately an argument based on a couple of flimsy assumptions that a higher scoring game is a more popular game and that anyone not paid to watch hundreds of college basketball games a year can really tell the difference between teams averaging points per game and those that score maybe the best counter to the false belief that low scoring equals poor play can be found at the university of virginia coached by tony bennett over the past three years the team has gone despite ranking consistently in the bottom third in scoring in the atlantic coast conference bennetts teams slow down the game into a half court battle that allows them to capitalize on their defensive strengths on offense they tend to pass the ball around the perimeter for the first seconds of each possession patiently waiting for their opponents to slip up which they usually do theres some truth to the whole fun fast play thing bennett told me recently but what i say is that its more about quality whether its higher scoring or lower scoring and if theres success with what youre doing youll draw attention to why it works his team shows that success determined by victories defines quality a random tv viewer who happens upon a virginia game in which the halftime score is typically in the and low might see confirmation that college basketball is in crisis if he or she didnt know that the team was winning so much if the quality of the play on the court hasnt become worse then why do some consider the game to be in decline one factor is simply that there is now so much more college basketball on tv and therefore a much wider range of quality to watch and judge espn which heavily promoted college basketball during the late and early has increased its focus on big time college football ilan ben hanan vice president of espns college programming emphasized to me that while the network was still fully committed to college basketball the focus has been spread around to showing more teams in more markets generally speaking college basketball has become a tonnage in quantity play ben hanan said the tonnage is not itself a problem but it exposes more teams to scrutiny bad games played by bad teams always existed they just werent on television all the time college basketballs exposure to the public at least on the national level used to be limited to big name programs and the drama of tournament
the tunnelsescapes under the berlin wall and the historic films the jfk white house tried to killby greg mitchellillustrated pp crown television viewers expecting the usual programming on nbc on dec were greeted instead with a minute documentary film depicting in startling detail the escape of east germans who had fled through a tunnel under the berlin wall it was hardly an accident that the network ended up with such great footage nbc had financed the project giving the students who led the excavation the equivalent in todays dollars of about in exchange for exclusive rights to film them digging their way from a former swizzle stick factory in west berlin into the communist east the broadcast was sponsored by gulf oil the kennedy administration had opposed airing the documentary on top of the safety concerns and ethical questions raised by the payments the white house argued that nbc was dangerously heightening tensions between the two superpowers at the peak of cold war anxiety as bobby kennedy the presidents brother and attorney general summed it up that was a terrible thing you people did buying that tunnel but for the nbc correspondent piers anderton the subject was irresistible and the peril integral to the drama this was history in the making greg mitchell writes in the tunnels cinma vrit danger at every turn day after day happening right in front of the cameras eye one might call it something new for tv a reality show filmed at the front line of the cold war the book chronicles the mad moment between the building of the berlin wall in and the cuban missile crisis over a year later when residents of the divided german capital were gripped by an obsession with tunneling after the east german government decided to block the flow of refugees streaming into west germany with barbed wire and concrete people jumped from windows and roofs crawled under the wires climbed over the barriers and crashed through checkpoints behind the wheels of trucks as border guards shot to kill the need for new approaches became apparent one obvious solution was to go under instead of over or through the wall according to mitchell work began on roughly tunnels of which fewer than were successful but those few successes were touted in the press with photos and testimonials stoking a sensation nbc and cbs competed to see which would be the first to film a tunnel for their news programs even as hollywood beat them to the punch with a feature film called escape from east berlin mgm built a plaster replica of the wall in west berlin that was yards long and became a tourist attraction knowing that filming near the real wall would draw the attention of east german sentries the filmmakers used them as unwitting extras a crew recorded the guards flashing their spotlights across the border talk about realism the director robert siodmak exclaimed mitchell the author of several books on politics and history could have written a light riff with such strange satire ready material but he has chosen a serious approach lengthy forays into transcripts of president kennedys deliberations with his advisers provide context but drag in places as do accounts of the drudgery of long hours in damp underground passageways but mitchell quickly wins the reader back with his tense descriptions the most dramatic are the moments when the diggers were about to find out if they had blindly burrowed up to the right basement floor and succeeded in keeping their plots a secret or were about to stare down the barrels of border guards rifles and long prison terms or even death in spite of the financial support of the television network the nbc tunnelers led by three students a german and two italians nearly didnt make it boulders blocked their path forcing exhausting detours two different leaks nearly ruined their underground passageway with floods and they risked exposure at every turn by a stasi agent siegfried uhse who had infiltrated one of the main groups in west berlin dedicated to rescues the greatest strength of the tunnels is in the details the hand cranked world war ii era field telephones the diggers used to communicate underground a joking sign on the ceiling of the tunnel that read achtung you are now leaving the american sector uhse had been caught by the east germans smuggling cigarettes fewer than six packs but that was all the leverage the stasi needed to turn him into an informant of devastating effectiveness days after finishing the book i could not escape one of mitchells images of a hat with a small hole in it landing softly on the western side of the border while its owners dead body fell back into the east waiting for the guards to hurry it out of sight for those who see walls as the answer to policy problems this book serves as a stark reminder that barriers can never cut people off entirely but only succeed in driving them underground
christopher rea is a literary and cultural historian at the university of british columbia a year old native of berkeley calif he has written on major figures in modern chinese literature including qian zhongshu and yang jiang his new work the age of irreverence a new history of laughter in china shows how the early century inspired a flowering of comedy farce cursing and satire in it one finds interesting parallels to today especially in how people stick it to authority academic books do not always reflect their subject matter studies of sex for example are notoriously unsexy but mr reas book is funny beginning with its hilarious executive preface it even carries a blurb by eric idle of the british comedy troupe monty python in an interview mr rea discussed cursing as a spectator sport the invention of humor and his debt to monty python what led you to write about chinese humor i grew up watching monty python and the marx brothers i loved the zaniness the silly gags the outrageous conceits and later grouchos double entendres in college i discovered that chinese is a fantastic language for wordplay so when i started delving into literary and cultural history the question in the back of my mind was did china have anything similar to the pythons or to vaudeville china isnt usually thought of as a funny place state repression is one reason for that chinas leaders are deathly afraid of ridicule and the china story has for various reasons tended to emphasize suffering struggle and grievance this is whats so refreshing about writers like qian zhongshu who had an ear for wordplay a nose for ingenious disingenuousness and the guts for scorched earth satire china in the early century my books focus was to put it mildly a rough and tumble place but it fostered a whole industry of mirth populated with cultural figures from hack jokesters to respectable writers slumming it as humorists it seems that many chinese humorists back then turned to cursing why for a couple reasons first a print culture boom made disputes public as never before now youre taking down your adversary not in a teahouse but in the newspaper slights and sarcasm quickly escalate to name calling and character assassination writers with a penchant for funny insults became famous as renowned revilers ming ma cursing celebrities if you will second early century china was a violent place of rampaging militarists political assassinations foreign invasion and crushing poverty many critics felt that extreme conditions called for extreme rhetoric hypocrites traitors and wimps became objects of contempt can you share an example that could be printed in a family newspaper in when the northern warlord cao kun bribed his way into the third presidency of the republic of china wu zhihui one of the founders of the chinese nationalist party called him the sperm president wu reportedly explained this epithet as follows if a man could turn each of his sperm into a human in one go cao could have just had his millions of descendants elect him and saved all the money he spent on bribes what was the role of the writer lin yutang who coined a term for humor youmo lin yutang was out to break a language barrier chinese had words for serious talk and funny talk he claimed but nothing in between existing chinese terms for humor were tainted with associations like abusiveness triviality or cynicism youmo would symbolize a new type of talk that was at once engaged and amusing more than that youmo was a new outlook china was in crisis but lin wanted his countrymen to be self confident enough to face it with a smile and humor would enable him to be a critic of the government without getting shot your book mentions the invention of humor but it wasnt that humor didnt exist in china previously right right most of my book is about cultures of humor in the decades before the when proponents of youmo essentially reinvented humor as an idealized moral concept looking further back you have collections of jokes amusing stories and anecdotes comedic verse and essays performing arts featured slapstick interludes banter and stock clown roles and theres no shortage of bawdy sexual humor like li yus the carnal prayer mat lin yutangs view was that people had either forgotten about this side of chinas past or had repressed it song dynasty thinkers had suckered everyone into thinking that confucius was uptight when in the analects hes actually making self deprecatory jokes and kidding his disciples the humor crowd dug up a lot of oldies but goodies while introducing a slew of foreign humor and their own creations how did people respond to the promotion of humor it was a hit the press dubbed the year of humor and the term youmo has stayed with us since but chinese humor writers had traditionally been on the defensive when they cracked jokes theyd say it was just a way to pass the time over a cup of tea the reflex was to belittle humor the moderns too felt they had to justify what they were doing lin yutang wanted it to be o k to be funny without losing face but he acknowledged that the general prejudice was that no one except a clown would condescend to crack a joke in public what are some of your favorites from this period the shanghai writer xu zhuodai who went by the pen name master of the broken chamber pot studio was a master of farce and a trickster extraordinaire hes a good one for hoaxes ye qianyus pioneering comic strip mr wang is inspired works by lao she lin yutang and lu xun are justifiably famous and one major discovery was a series of essays curated by qian zhongshus teacher wen yuanning in short profiles of public figures like one whose real profession is to be a celebrity what does this
before this month new balance was lucky if it generated a few hundred reactions to posts on its facebook page now the sneaker companys page is flooded with impassioned commentary and it has found itself compelled to make a statement distancing itself from white supremacists it started when matt lebretton the companys vice president for communications told the wall street journal last week that we feel things are going to move in the right direction under donald j trump mr lebrettons comments were made in the context of mr trumps opposition to the trans pacific partnership a trade deal that new balance says will hurt its production of shoes in the united states while rewarding competitors that make more of their products overseas some consumers however saw that comment as a full throated endorsement of mr trump and reacted immediately circulating images that showed new balance shoes being burned or thrown in the trash that led the brand to clarify its position through a statement in which it noted that it publicly supported the trade positions of hillary clinton bernie sanders and donald trump prior to election day that focused on american manufacturing job creation it also posted a statement to facebook saying from the people who make our shoes to the people who wear them we believe in acting with the utmost integrity and we welcome all walks of life but that was only the start over the weekend the daily stormer a website rife with anti semitic anti gay hate speech and white supremacist language derided the complaints and championed new balance as the official shoes of white people encouraging readers to buy them the ensuing support from white supremacists and other members of what is known as the alt right led new balance to distance itself from such commentary and address the nature of its remark about mr trump new balance based in boston wrote on its twitter and facebook pages on monday night that it does not tolerate bigotry or hate in any form and that a recent comment about trade policy was taken out of context it added as a year old company with five factories in the u s and thousands of employees worldwide from all races genders cultures and sexual orientations new balance is a values driven organization and culture that believes in humanity integrity community and mutual respect for people around the world on facebook the post has attracted more than reactions and hundreds of comments some lauding the company and others from supporters and detractors of mr trump criticizing its response the company did not immediately respond to requests for comment on tuesday the daily stormer responded with a claim that new balances denouncement was a hoax in a post on tuesday that turned into an anti semitic rant

los angeles porsche or tesla the valet asks the question hastily humbly eyes not quite meeting those of the contemplative man standing before him frank ocean has been staying at this secluded hotel here for a while now long enough that when the valet spies him coming down the front path he knows the routine on this night its the tesla the model x s u v with the gull wing rear doors inside the dash looks like the helm of a spaceship with a center console map display bigger than an ipad that once on the road mr ocean never consults its been more than a year since hes had a steady home most of his beloved cars are in storage he moves from city to city hotel to hotel in a couple of days hell be in new york looking for an apartment a day after that hell turn four years ago he released channel orange a clever sinuous supremely confident deconstruction of contemporary soul and announced that his first love had been with a man in the subsequent months he was nominated for six grammys performed at the ceremony and toured the world and then he was gone not quite a full disappearance but something like it what had appeared to be the beginning of a stunning ascent instead curled into a question mark finally this past august mr ocean returned and with a bounty a visual album streaming online endless followed by another digital album blonde complemented by a glossy magazine boys dont cry distributed at pop up shops in four cities but apart from a lighthearted note and a couple of photos posted on his tumblr mr ocean didnt speak publicly having emerged from the ether with fanfare mr ocean returned to it quietly his mystery intact not that you would be able to sense the swirl of curiosity that surrounds him by his demeanor during conversations over two days last month edited excerpts are below he was preternaturally calm consistently forthright reflexively self aware and wryly funny this has been the case for years it made him something of an outlier when he emerged as part of the rabble rousing odd future collective and an outlier still when he catapulted into pops top ranks a group of people not much given to pensive remove over the past three years his absence from the pop troposphere a void interrupted only by the occasional collaboration tumblr post or paparazzi shot has felt like a position statement against celebrity culture while simultaneously guaranteeing that mr oceans fame turbo boosted by fervent curiosity would grow even wider his exile began in earnest in he was living here in a glass walled apartment high over sunset and vine with a panoramic view of south los angeles but the city was choking him people had stolen money from him there were physical sorts of things going on in the streets and he grew concerned about the management of his affairs it started to weigh on me that i was responsible for the moves that had made me successful but i wasnt reaping the lions share of the profits and that was problematic for me i had in the midst of all of this this feeling of isolation he added within my circle there was a lot of places i thought i could turn that i felt like i couldnt turn to anymore so he left hopping a plane to london a city where he barely knew anyone with only a duffel bag full of clothes and a backpack carrying the precious hard drives holding all of his music theres a fine line between a sane escape and running away did you feel you were on one side or the other of that i never thought about it like that i always thought about it like if your house is on fire you need to get out of the house did you feel that certain things in your career also hadnt gone the way you would have liked certain moments were drawbacks for sure now i look at things differently but at the time yeah audiences in excess of five million people on national tv i was always reluctant to do those things except in cases where they had this nostalgic significance to me like performing at the v m a s being tapped to perform at the grammys me saying yes to those things had a lot to do with how those things made me feel before i was actually in the business and just wanting to be rubbing shoulders with those people and being seen at those places i still was reluctant and sort of skeptical of those things because i questioned whether or not i was prepared i feel like the public knock on you is that you want to be anonymous or you want to be in some kind of retreat from the spotlight sometimes im fascinated with how famous my work could be while im not so famous super envious of the fact that daft punk can wear robot helmets and be one of the most famous bands in the world while also understanding that will never be my situation its too late its hard to articulate how i think about myself as a public figure ive gotten used to being frank ocean a lot of people stopped me on the street when i hadnt put music out in a while literally would yell out of an uber frank where the album has dating been difficult for you in this period of increased celebrity i think normal would be the word whatever that word means which is usually nothing im in a very different place than i was four or five years ago with all that stuff different in my relationship with myself which means everything theres no like shame or self loathing theres no you know crisis have you been in love since then since

the clock has started for one of the most eagerly awaited market debuts of that of snapchat the popular messaging service the social networks parent snap inc has filed confidentially to go public with an eye toward being valued at more than billion people briefed on the matter said tuesday that would make snap the third most valuable technology company at the time of its market debut after alibaba and facebook the company is aiming to begin having its shares traded as soon as march though the final timing for an offering has not been determined the confidential filing made with the securities and exchange commission before the presidential election last week comes amid a relative drought in the market for initial public offerings there have been offerings of companies with a market value of more than million in the united states so far this year down percent from according to data from renaissance capital a successful debut of snap could help revive that market encouraging other technology companies to go public it would be the first top tier unicorn silicon valley lingo for private companies valued at billion or more to go public next year unlike uber airbnb or the lender sofi however snap has a main business that is not subject to a web of government regulations that make a public listing complicated a snap share sale is also expected to eschew the complexities of previous technology initial public offerings like googles in still like google facebook and other tech companies snaps recently amended corporate charter shows that a different class of stock would enable its top executives including its co founder evan spiegel to maintain control even after the service is publicly traded yet snap will encounter intense scrutiny from potential investors as rivals try to encroach on its turf by copying some of the photo messaging services signature features in august facebooks instagram rolled out its version of the snapchat stories photo and video service a spokesman for snap declined to comment on the filing which was reported earlier by reuters founded in a stanford university dorm room in snapchat has become a darling of the tech world as it has grown from a simple disappearing messages service into a digital video phenomenon its lofty goal is to essentially become the online generations equivalent to television it has built up its popular stories service in which users upload photos or videos and share them with followers and it gained new levels of popularity after rolling out features like lenses which lets users transform their likenesses into cartoon dogs silly faces or taco bell tacos paid for by sponsors such has been the popularity of snapchat that media organizations have rushed to establish beachheads on the service even the white house has set up a snapchat account and president obama has given an interview on the companys in house political show analysts have estimated that snap which began its advertising business less than two years ago could reach billion in sales next year up from more than million this year snaps financial information will be known when its offering filing is publicly disclosed if the company decides to go ahead with a sale of its shares the confidentiality of snaps filing was made possible by the jumpstart our business start ups or jobs act of which permits companies with less than billion in revenue to conduct much of their preparation for an i p o away from the glare of public scrutiny twitter gopro box and even the english soccer club manchester united have filed confidentially for stock listings in the united states in this way under the law companies must publicly disclose their offering documents some days before they start pitching the proposed share offering to prospective investors in what is known as a road show the investment banks morgan stanley and goldman sachs have been hired to lead the offering people briefed on the matter have previously said unlike some private companies snap has had no trouble raising money on the private markets so investors were not given preferential treatment regarding how many shares they will get in the event of a public offering according to corporate documents filed in delaware this sets snap apart from offerings from square and box both of those companies had to give some of their private investors special deals that diluted other early shareholders when square went public last november some investors received an additional million shares which came at the expense of other investors similarly when box went public in some of the companys earlier private investors were entitled to extra shares snapchat will certainly be an indicator of whether there is a big pile of investor cash ready to go into the market said doug bontemps silicon valley banks managing director of corporate finance but snapchat is unique its growing quickly is doing some interesting things

phil jacksons description of lebron jamess business partners as his posse in an interview published by espn on monday drew an angry response from james who took offense at the racial connotation of the word the dispute between jackson the knicks president and james who plays for the cleveland cavaliers and is one of the n b a s most visible players also left knicks forward carmelo anthony in the uncomfortable position of having to answer questions about a sudden feud involving one of his bosses and one of his good friends the espn interview was a wide ranging q and a in which jackson talked about the state of the knicks the criticism of his management of the team and his relationship with anthony but james took exception with jacksons description of the group of friends who travel and work with him as his posse james and maverick carter his close friend and business partner both took offense at jacksons use of the word carter told espn com he was bothered because of the idea that jackson said it because james and his friends are young and black he can use that word james said he had lost respect for jackson as a result of the comments we see the success that we have but then there is always someone that lets you know how far we still have to go as african americans james told reporters in cleveland i dont believe that phil jackson would have used that term if he was doing business with someone else and working with another team or if he was working with anybody in sports that was owning a team that wasnt african american and had a group of guys around them that didnt agree with what they did i dont think he would have called them a posse but it just shows how far we have to go but it wont stop us from doing what we need to do as a group james carter and two other high school friends rich paul and randy mims founded l r m r management company a decade ago the agency handles marketing and representation duties for james and other n b a players the company has been successful since its inception positioning james as one of the top athletes turned entrepreneurs of his generation in the espn interview jackson responding to a question about jamess decision to leave the miami heat and whether he could imagine magic johnson leaving pat riley and the los angeles lakers or michael jordan leaving jackson and the chicago bulls turned his response back around to james when lebron was playing with the heat they went to cleveland and he wanted to spend the night jackson told espn com they dont do overnights teams just dont so now spoelstra a reference to the heat coach erik spoelstra has to text riley and say what do i do in this situation and pat who has iron fist rules answers you are on the plane you are with this team you cant hold up the whole team because you and your mom and your posse want to spend an extra night in cleveland jackson did not respond to jamess remarks tuesday he left knicks practice without speaking to members of the news media and did not respond to an email while posse is defined as a group of friends or associates keith gilyard a professor of english and african american studies at penn state said he could understand why james took offense the cultural definition of the word has shifted toward defining drug cartels or in cultural terms the group of hangers on that surround a celebrity what were talking about is a rhetorical moment and one of the things thats interesting about rhetoric is sort of the study of who can say what to whom and under what conditions or can say what whom and under what conditions gilyard said the word in and of itself is never neutral it never means the same in all contexts and when the word is used publicly as by jackson instead of in a private conversation its connotation changes gilyard said when you have an official or executive that uses that language that makes its way into mainstream circulation it has a different meaning he added meaning shifts depending on contexts with jackson unavailable it left anthony a close friend of jamess to answer questions about the subject anthony agreed that he considered posse a loaded term and he said that he would not want his group of friends or family to be referred that way but anthony declined to ascribe any assumptions or intent to jackson do i think he meant it any kind of way anthony said i really dont know i dont think he did i would hope that he didnt sometimes phil just says things and he says the first thing that comes to mind and then probably is in his office right now regretting it i dont know when it comes to phil you just never know whats going to be said whats coming out it depends on whos listening people take it the right way or people take it the wrong way you just never know when it comes to phil i just dont understand him talking about lebron right now in november i dont understand that
post truth has been named oxford dictionaries international word of the year vanquishing a politically charged field that included adulting alt right brexiteer glass cliff and woke the use of post truth defined as relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief increased by percent over last year according to analysis of the oxford english corpus which collects roughly million words of spoken and written english from various sources each month katherine connor martin the head of united states dictionaries at oxford university press said it surged most sharply in june after the brexit vote and donald j trumps securing the republican nomination for president making it an unusually global word what we found especially interesting is that it encapsulated a trans atlantic phenomenon she said often when looking at words youll find one thats a really big deal in the u k but not in the u s the term whose first known usage in this particular sense was in a essay in the nation magazine citing the iran contra scandal and the persian gulf war does not represent an entirely new concept but it does ms martin said reflect a step past truthiness the stephen colbert coinage that merriam webster and the american dialect society each chose as its word of the year a decade ago truthiness is a humorous way of discussing a quality of specific claims she said post truth is an adjective that is describing a much bigger thing its saying that the truth is being regarded as mostly irrelevant oxfords word of the year is chosen to reflect the ethos mood or preoccupations of a given year but also to highlight the fact that english is always changing last years winner wasnt a word at all but the face with tears of joy emoji in the laurel went to vape some of the items on this years shortlist may prove ephemeral like coulrophobia extreme or irrational fear of clowns which surged after a rash of reports of scary clowns that belongs to a really interesting class of words labeled rare in the dictionary that are usually only trotted out when people want to say theres a word for that ms martin said others like alt right seem likely to have more staying power though that term has come under semantic attack from some on the left in recent days those critics have stepped up arguments that it as an overly cute perhaps even post truth euphemism for white supremacy ms martin said that oxfords definition an ideological grouping associated with extreme conservative or reactionary viewpoints characterized by a rejection of mainstream politics and by the use of online media to disseminate deliberately controversial content was a particularly difficult one to research and write in general she said it is not used as a simple synonym for white supremacy though some who embrace the term do openly acknowledge its usefulness in softening and selling extreme ideas what i would say as a lexicographer she said is that in choosing whether to say alt right or white supremacist its important to know what you mean
bangkok many expected there would be tears at the rajamangala national stadium on tuesday when thailand played australia in a world cup qualifier only a month after the death of the host countrys much loved king but it was a little surprising that they came at the end of the minutes the national anthem accompanied by images on the video scoreboard of the monarch king bhumibol adulyadej attending soccer related events was sung with somber gusto a crowd that had once been told that cheering would not be allowed instead offered loud appreciative support but it was only after the final whistle that thailands coach kiatisuk senamuang could not hold back his emotions any longer shedding tears after his team which had lost all four of its group stage games had fought australia the reigning asian champion to a tie it was emotional kiatisuk said i want to thank the king and i want to thank the fans and media for getting behind us all the way i am just disappointed we could not get the points but this point can bring happiness to the thai people australia has been a member of the asian football confederation since but its trip to thailand presented perhaps its most unusual match the a f c did not exist when king bhumibol took the throne in and with the government initiating an official yearlong period of mourning after his death in october tuesdays match almost did not go ahead after king bhumibols death the countrys professional soccer league ended its season with three games left to play with final positions settled by whatever ranking each club held at the time there were calls to play the qualifier against australia behind closed doors or in a neighboring country on oct it was announced that the match would go ahead but with no cheering permitted on nov that restriction was lifted replaced by calls for respectful behavior i think it is important we pay respect to the people of thailand due to the passing of the king and understand that it is a difficult time for the whole country coach ange postecoglou of australia said as visitors here we are mindful that while there is a game of football to be played there are more important things to be addressed with the end of the first month of mourning passing just before the game the public intensity for it in bangkok had seemed to drop perceptibly the passengers on bangkoks metropolitan rapid transit system were still not dressed as colorfully as usual and they occasionally bowed to the in train video monitors showing scenes of the kings life but slowly life also was returning to normal public television stations were able to show commercials again the annual loy krathong festival had gone ahead the previous day albeit without the usual fireworks and it was announced that christmas and new year celebrations could proceed as well but with the entertainment levels toned down out of respect in soccer however it is difficult for fans to tone anything down an official at the football association of thailand acknowledged that once it was announced that the game was on there was never a possibility of enforcing a no cheering policy especially with about australian supporters both visitors and expats expected to attend as it was there was a smattering of jeers from the blue shirted home fans before kickoff when the traveling supporters some of whom wore black ribbons on their gold australia shirts started a chant but generally the atmosphere was genial while the traffic was typically terrible with the usual motorcycle taxis ferrying fans from the nearest but still distant stations fans sat on the grass outside the concrete stadium receiving candles to light before kickoff there were still bottles of beer being drunk but the prematch atmosphere was a little more subdued than usual with some supporters all in black even if most still sported the usual blue we respect thailand and the fact that the king has passed away said michael huckle who was visiting from melbourne but he added that he was happy the restrictions on cheering had been lifted that was he said never realistic once the game starts the emotion flows especially when you score a goal he said football is not tennis it is built on emotion the thai players were offered a bonus by their soccer associations president somyot poompanmoung of million baht if they defeated australia i know that anything can happen in the match but i want them to play with their heart somyot said i dont want them to play for money i want them to play for his majesty the king it was a tall order thailands team may be improving but australia is one of the continents powerhouses and when mile jedinak who plays his club soccer in england put the visitors ahead with a penalty after nine minutes the day was looking ominous yet thailand with a fully domestic based roster responded with two goals from the hugely popular striker teerasil dangda a famous win was in the cards until a second hotly disputed penalty kick in the minute again converted by jedinak gave the socceroos a tie it was the least thailand deserved thailand played really well postecoglou australias coach said we knew that in these special circumstances they would play with a lot of passion and they did just that the home fans applauded the players off the field the journalists applauded the coach into the news conference and both were applauded back into the emerald hotel by hundreds of happy supporters when they returned there after the game we wanted to put a smile back on the faces of thai fans and we did said kiatisuk who added that he and his team were not giving up on dreams of qualifying for the world cup despite taking just point in their first five games it is not over he said

it has been said before but it bears repeating twitters biggest problem is twitter when the social media site was created its founders thought it could be the water cooler or town hall for the world it was a nice thought what they probably never anticipated was that twitter would become a meeting place for all sorts of people you would never want to meet at the water cooler even in its early days tech writers used twitter to call one another out about their coverage who got what story first and why they got it all wrong was it juvenile of course but it was usually harmless what happens on twitter today critics would argue isnt so harmless from racist trolls to terrorist recruiting to gaslighting todays popular way to describe lying so often that people cant quite tell the truth anymore twitter has some serious issues but give twitter credit for one thing its executives realize they have a problem on tuesday the company outlined new ways to report or hide offensive content in related news google said on monday that it planned to crack down on fake news sites that rely on its adsense advertising network to turn fabrication into a profit making venture that both companies are taking a hard look at how their services are being misused shined a harsh light on facebook where mark zuckerberg the chief executive dismissed the companys problem with fake news posts despite the reported misgivings of some of his own employees but by late monday night facebook did add language to the guidelines of its ad network spelling out that fake news sites were barred from the ad network to be clear that doesnt mean theyll disappear from facebook mr zuckerberg must run in different facebook circles than the rest of us

on saturday jackie chan a legend in martial arts cinema finally received an oscar those movie buffs familiar only with mr chans appearances in blockbusters like the rush hour trilogy and shanghai noon may not realize just how long a career the hong kong native has had as an actor director and producer mr chan who began acting when he was very young has wowed audiences the world over not only with the balletic high kicking drunken master techniques in his early kung fu movies but also with the complex action sequences and comedic timing that gave his career a long arc and he has broken many bones doing it he said since he has done his own stunts according to imdb the online film website he has appeared in films as an actor but if you count his directing producing and writing as well his film credits may number well over as he noted when accepting the honorary oscar after years in the film industry making more than films i break so many bones finally this is mine he said shaking the golden statue in his acceptance speech a beaming mr chan told a story about a time his father asked when he was going to win an academy award dad i only make comedy action movies mr chan recalled saying he told how he had become obsessed with the award after seeing one at the home of sylvester stallone and recounted his disbelief upon hearing that he had finally received it mr chan was among a roster of artists to receive the honorary academy award whose recipients were announced in september its given to celebrate extraordinary achievement and exceptional contributions over the course of a filmmakers career and it was roundly celebrated on social media a comment from lucius hale a year old from kristiansand norway was typical im really glad that jackie chan got an oscar he said that man has been part of my life so long and his movies are so goood others celebrated mr chans status as a trailblazing asian actor in american films it was difficult to find anyone on twitter questioning whether mr chan had earned the award but for anyone who has doubts about mr chans skill onscreen here are five clips that together illustrate some of his most impressive work the scene is from drunken master a breakout film for mr chan which became a cult classic in the united states years after its release in hong kong the actors remarkable physical abilities are evident in the scene but so too are his comedic skills demonstrated both through the fighting scenes and his exaggerated facial expressions the movies he made in china showed him as a canny comedian whether he was in the midst of a fight scene or just reciting canned dialogue heres a scene from the end of mr chans breakout success in america rush hour in which he starred with chris tucker among other martial arts mr chan has long been a master of his own brand of zui quan which is sometimes referred to colloquially as drunken fist or drunken style kung fu its a kind of martial arts in which a person imitates the posture and clumsiness of someone whos had a little too much to drink though its ideal for comedy and action films its can also be useful in combat an article in vice in explained the styles real life advantages the great strength of drunken boxing as a trick play or philosophy is as a mask for actual fighting ability mr chans success paved the way for other martial arts stars from china to break into hollywood three years after mr chan first experienced success in america with rumble in the bronx the chinese actor jet li made his first appearance in an american film lethal weapon mr li went on to become a star in his own right and he and mr chan teamed up in for the forbidden kingdom this clip shows their fight from the film mr chans abilities as an action star were not confined to fight scenes he was extraordinarily adept at navigating space in all its forms as the video a montage of clips of free running and other types of sequences shows before mr chan was a star he was an acrobat and a stuntman who worked with another legend bruce lee on the film fist of fury in an interview with inside kung fu magazine mr chan explained that much of his physical skill was intuitive partly because he had started basic physical training when he was or years old after all those years it becomes very natural he said its actually very hard to tell you how i train because i just know what to do when i lose my balance you just know how to get it back so this way when i do a stunt i do get hurt sometimes but less than some other people tony zhou the movie buff who cocreates the clips on the youtube channel every frame a painting narrates this clip an analysis of mr chans ability to combine action and comedy in the clip mr zhou illustrates mr chans depth of knowledge about film more generally including directing and editing commenting on his framing choices and camera angles he also elaborates on the difference between movies shot in hong kong where mr chan was often given months to get scenes right and those made by american directors which sometimes obscure the actors genius
its a great time to get your period today girls and women are talking openly about menstruation a topic long considered taboo they have even put periods on the public agenda demanding free feminine hygiene products in public restrooms and tax free tampons and pads some are also challenging the methods women have used to cope with periods rejecting disposable pads and tampons altogether instead they are using menstrual cups reusable pads special underwear or nothing at all to be sure these alternative methods of menstrual management represent just a fraction of the billion global market for period products while they arent for everyone they are catching on among some women who say the alternatives make menstruation more hygienic less costly more discreet and less wasteful andrea velzquez learned about a tampon alternative the reusable menstrual cup from a friend three years ago and hasnt bought a box of tampons since the major selling point for her was cost savings menstrual cups range in price from to and are replaced about once a year by comparison an annual supply of tampons and pads costs about if you add it up you end up using a good chunk of money on tampons and pads she said while tampons and pads are designed to absorb menstrual fluid and be thrown away the cup is made of flexible silicone and is worn inside the vagina to catch menstrual blood the cup is emptied washed and reinserted twice a day the cup also appeals to ms velzquez because its discreet she no longer has to walk home with a big box of tampons in a clear white bag or hide tampons up her sleeve especially once i entered the work force i remember finding a way to sneakily bring them into the bathroom she said carinne chambers co founder and chief executive of diva international which makes the divacup said most consumers seem to learn about menstrual cups from one another a lot of women think theyre relatively content with their options because its all theyve ever known ms chambers said theyre not necessarily looking for something new other options include reusable cloth products including thinx period underwear a moisture wicking absorbent underwear that is washed and reused and is sold for to cloth pads like those sold by lunapads and gladrags consist of a holder and a set of absorbent fleece inserts which should be changed every two to six hours because they are made of breathable material they resist strong odors the companies also sell small carrying pouches with separate compartments for used and fresh inserts reusable pads cost to nora lovotti was intrigued when she saw ads for thinx period underwear on the new york city subway this summer for me at this point i take birth control and my period is relatively light she said i was getting to the point where i felt like tampons were kind of excessive thinx markets its underwear as either an alternative to or a backup for disposable feminine products made with rayon or bleached cotton they are made up of three layers an external nylon layer a moisture wicking antimicrobial absorbent and leakproof gusset and an inner layer of cotton some women opt for reusable products because they worry about long term exposure to the chemicals in bleached products others are concerned about toxic shock syndrome a rare bacterial infection associated with superabsorbent tampon use for ms lovotti the risk of toxic shock although very low still nagged at her i did have a friend in college who had toxic shock she said in the back of my mind i was always concerned thinx also has gained attention on social media because it has featured sawyer devuyst a transgender male model in its ad campaign mr devuyst said that for about five years between his coming out as transgender and beginning hormone therapy he continued to menstruate while changing a pad or a tampon in a mens room might cause embarrassment or even endanger a transgender man wearing period boyshorts that resemble boxer briefs might make an alienating process a little easier mr devuyst said a lot of people dont realize that some men do get their periods because its just not talked about mr devuyst said in a video a more extreme rejection of mainstream period products comes in the form of free bleeding the method gained attention when the musician kiran gandhi crossed the finish line at the london marathon in bloodstained leggings she had gotten her period the night before and decided that a tampon would be too uncomfortable to wear through the race and she used the moment to make a statement i ran with blood dripping down my legs for sisters who dont have access to tampons and sisters who despite cramping and pain hide it away and pretend like it doesnt exist ms gandhi wrote on her blog after completing the marathon tampon free i ran to say it does exist and we overcome it every day maggie whalen a longtime divacup user said she realized that there were days during her cycle when she had a lighter flow and using the cup was irritating now on those days she forgoes the cup entirely ive kind of started experimenting with it she said miki agrawal chief executive and co founder of thinx said that new interest in alternative menstrual hygiene is part of more accepting attitudes about periods as a natural biological function women now look at their uterine lining and really feel empowered by it rather than shamed by it said ms agrawal
al shihr yemen when fighters from al qaeda seized control of a stretch of southern yemen in they looted millions of dollars from the central bank spreading such fear that other banks shut down but during the year al qaeda reigned al omgy brothers money exchange kept running its business here in the coastal town of al shihr it held accounts for the national oil company disbursed salaries for the yemeni government and earned the praise of local officials for providing needed services during a tough time and if members of al qaeda wanted to open accounts too well the company could not really say no according to muhammad al omgy who runs the money exchange with his brother said the united states was not impressed this month the united states treasury department designated the brothers and their company as having provided financial services to or in support of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula which is widely considered to be the terrorist groups most dangerous branch any of their assets subject to united states jurisdiction are blocked and americans are generally prohibited from having transactions with them during an interview in his office here mr omgy acknowledged that his company had provided financial services to al qaeda we had no other option but to comply with them he said they were the rulers of the city but he denied the treasury departments charge that he was a qaeda member describing his ties to the group as a business relationship that had ended they withdrew their money before they left the city he said the case of the omgy brothers is a small but telling account of the chaos that has engulfed yemen the southernmost country on the arabian peninsula and the arab worlds poorest state since when protests erupted against the previous president ali abdullah saleh much of the state has collapsed and armed tribes and militias have taken control of significant territory in rebels from the north known as the houthis stormed the capital sana forcing the government into exile and dividing the country the houthis now control the northwest including the capital where they have struggled to exert authority over what remains of the government much of the south and east are held by forces backed by persian gulf nations and are nominally loyal to the exiled president abdu rabbu mansour hadi so much upheaval has often left struggling yemenis to deal with whichever armed group has most recently taken control and so it was in april when qaeda fighters seized territory along yemens southern coast and turned to the omgy brothers for their banking needs mr omgy was so upset by the charge against him that he invited an employee of the new york times to his office in al shihr to tell his side of the story his headquarters bore testament to the businesss success with green marble floors comfortable sofas and central air conditioning a luxury in a country where millions struggle to find enough food much less power to charge their phones three new lexus sport utility vehicles were parked outside the brothers opened their first money exchange in and now have offices across yemen that work like banks holding accounts and performing inexpensive money transfers mr omgy said i received the news from social media and news sites mr omgy said of the americans designation of him as a qaeda member i have never financed qaeda activities nor joined the organization he did however acknowledge doing the groups banking after the militants seized the area the brothers closed their offices he said but reopened because none of the banks would the local branch of yemens national oil company maintained an account as did the civilian council that helped run local affairs even the government relied on the company to get salaries to its employees according to yemeni officials the united states said in its designation that a qaeda official in charge of taxation had held an account with al omgy from which he sent money to militants around yemen it also said that early this year al qaeda ordered the oil company to transfer more than million to al omgy to support terrorist activities mr omgy said he had been forced to give the militants accounts we opened the accounts when they threatened us he said then to pay their taxes the oil company and local businessmen would ask al omgy to transfer money from their accounts to those of al qaeda he denied that the company had paid al qaeda a percent commission on all transactions as the united states also charged but said that individual qaeda members could have transferred money through the company we have branches everywhere he said we could not reject their orders he dismissed the rest of the united states charges that he had smuggled arms for al qaeda and that his brother had raised funds for the iraqi insurgency i have neither political nor religious affiliations he said staying open had been the only way the company could provide services for others he said including the yemeni government which the united states considers an ally against al qaeda the government asked us to turn to al omgy said saeed bahmran who works for the education ministry in al mukalla a nearby city also seized by al qaeda al omgy has branches everywhere and we can get our salaries at anytime even at midnight mohammed sharem the director of the local branch of the national oil company during al qaedas control said our relationship with al omgy is strong and it is an excellent company he said government owned gas stations deposited their profits directly into the oil companys

moscow president vladimir v putin of russia and president elect donald j trump spoke by telephone for the first time on monday agreeing to review what both consider the poor state of relations between the two countries according to a statement from the kremlin the two agreed on the absolutely unsatisfactory state of bilateral relations said the statement and they both endorsed the idea of undertaking joint efforts to normalize relations and pursue constructive cooperation on the broadest possible range of issues the issues discussed included trade and economic ties as well as combating terrorism mr putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate mr trump last wednesday sending him a telegram about an hour after he had emerged the victor but the two men have not met nor had they spoken previously mr putin repeated the congratulations over the phone the russian president said he hoped that moscow could build a collaborative dialogue with washington on the bases of equality mutual respect and noninterference in the others internal affairs the release said the two men also discussed syria in the context of the need to work together in the struggle against the no common enemy international terrorism and extremism the statement said although mr putin maintained studied neutrality during the presidential race the state run news media which answers to him clearly pulled for mr trump among other issues mr putin blames hillary clinton then secretary of state for the mass demonstrations that greeted his return to the presidency in after mrs clinton lost the flagship state television news broadcast took to referring to her as the blonde woman during the campaign senior united states security officials accused russia of hacking the computers at the democratic national committee headquarters and releasing emails that proved embarrassing to the clinton campaign mr putin denied any state role in the hacking the russian government was one of the few around the world that was openly gleeful about the american election result with members of the state duma the lower house of the russian legislature breaking into applause at the announcement the united russia party loyal to mr putin dominates the duma mr trump and mr putin developed something of a mutual admiration society during the election particularly after mr trump suggested that crimea which moscow annexed from ukraine should belong to russia and that the united states should ally itself with russia and the syrian government of president bashar al assad to fight the islamic state mr trump also suggested the united states might dilute its support for nato which russia considers a main threat much of the brief statement from the kremlin about the telephone call echoed previous statements that mr putin had made about his goals for relations with washington including a return to pragmatic mutually beneficial cooperation mr putin openly endorses the idea that the world should return to the era when two superpowers assumed a general responsibility for global stability and security some analysts however have suggested that mr trump is unpredictable and the traditional republican penchant for painting russia as a dire threat could still emerge the putin administration is hoping that the west will lift sanctions imposed over the crisis in ukraine on the phone call which the kremlin said was arranged by mutual consent the two men agreed to stay in contact and to meet at an unspecified date in the future earlier mr trump described the note on his victory that he received from mr putin as beautiful for its part russia has continued its glowing tributes to mr trump as a paragon who triumphed in what is repeatedly depicted in the russian media as the swamp of american politics the main weekly news program on state television every sunday night tends to focus mainly on the united states with dmitry kiselyov the anchor suggesting this week that europe follow the american lead in replacing its leaders under president trump mr kiselyov said the american government would finally drop what the russian anchor called its annoying slogans about human rights and democracy russia has a lot of trust in trump he said
beijing it took all of five minutes for wang lei a gruff veteran of the peoples liberation army to start humming and stomping his feet the curtain had just risen on the long march a new opera celebrating the early days of the chinese communist party and a rifle toting chorus of performers dressed as soldiers was rushing onstage at the national center for the performing arts in beijing we come from different places they sang as they took their places some wear straw sandals some wear gowns some are barefoot some are hungry we differ in status but we have the same aspiration to join the red army to change the world mr wang seated next to me in the upper balcony closed his eyes in bliss these are the songs of our homeland he told me at intermission they might be lost now but they reflect the true feelings of the chinese people these are triumphant times for the communist party president xi jinping the general secretary governs with seemingly unobstructed authority the balance of power in asia and the pacific appears to be shifting in chinas favor extreme poverty especially in rural areas is nearing eradication and yet the communist government seems intensely vulnerable at times as it confronts a slowing economy and a society in the throes of staggering change in a country still working to find its place in the world the party whips up nationalism as an elixir lately it has gone into overdrive inventing new forms of agitprop across china this fall the party is turning the obscure anniversary of a cherished political touchstone into a cause for passionate celebration it has been years we are told again and again since the end of the long march the mile retreat of communist forces that established maos pre eminence and gave the party its soul more than people died in the march which began in but the bravery of the soldiers inspired generations of chinese people to rally behind the party and its leader on television long march soap operas documentaries and variety shows abound tour agencies offer packages retracing the soldiers routes students put on virtual reality goggles to relive famous battles joggers use a long march themed fitness app to measure their steps against the red armys in beijing it is impossible to miss the patriotic fervor outside my office a giant led screen flashes every few minutes with scenes from red star over china a new mini series about the long march at home in beijing on a recent saturday night i was bombarded with long march coverage on nearly every tv channel on one network a troupe of child performers dressed in gray military uniforms sang of the power of the bright red star to shine through the generations on a financial channel commentators offered analysis of the economic impact of the march president xi has been making the case for a new long march using the anniversary to rally the public and warn against creeping complacency especially among the young a nation that forgets its origins will find itself in a blind alley he said in a speech late last month on the whole the spirit of the propaganda campaign is unambiguous chinese citizens should seek to emulate the ideals of self sacrifice and perseverance that the soldiers of the long march embodied above all the messaging makes clear people should show unwavering loyalty to the communist party the long march allowed the red army to escape defeat at the hands of the kuomintang forces of chiang kai shek in southern china the communists regrouped in the north before going on to victory in the civil war in anne marie brady a professor at the university of canterbury in new zealand has challenged the official narrative which portrays the march as a victory for the communists and a turning point in their efforts to win over the public pointing to testimonials of foreign missionaries captured by communist soldiers she argues that it was instead a humiliating moment in which red army soldiers ransacked villages and abused peasants but by invoking the journey she said mr xi is betting that the partys idealized version of history will resonate across generations this is a heroic narrative that is meant to inspire young people in china professor brady said xi wants to remind people what is unique and distinctive about china and to ask how did we get to where we are today what is this journey that were on what are we aiming toward mr xi has used the long march more expansively than his predecessors linking it to his signature slogan of a china dream a call to build a prosperous more powerful nation with a deeper respect for traditional culture the propaganda might help rally the public behind the party as it asserts chinese military might abroad in the disputed south china sea and elsewhere and the chinese government has also tried to draw connections between the long march and modern day social issues a book released in conjunction with the anniversary promotes the red armys support for gender equality a concert to mark the anniversary showed the red army being greeted by an adoring crowd of ethnic minorities a stark contrast to the ethnic tensions that plague parts of china today including tibet and xinjiang some hope the long march will become a call to arms that helps china overcome challenges such as a slowing economy and rampant social inequality nowadays the younger generation is very fickle and impetuous said xie haishan an employee at a social welfare organization in beijing who attended the opera and a long march museum exhibit many people are shortsighted and lack the kind of commitment seen during the long march thats what we need nowadays the long march opera in development for four years is a highlight of the governments unfolding spectacle featuring a cast of nearly and a cymbal heavy score

frank lampard announced monday that he would leave new york city f c when his contract expires at the end of the year ending his late starting and sometimes exasperating two year m l s tenure lampard was among the first players signed by new york city f c before it joined the league for the season and he was touted as an experienced midfield leader with a championship winning rsum but lampard spent considerable time on the sideline nursing injuries he appeared in only of n y c f c s matches over two seasons which made his battles with fitness not his goals his m l s legacy it was not all nagging injuries and light jogging on the side though when lampard played well he could still dominate matches and find the net at one point last summer he scored eight goals in eight games including a hat trick against colorado on july unfortunately for lampard some fans never forgave him for delaying his arrival for n y c f c s inaugural season to finish out the premier league campaign at manchester city the decision was an embarrassment for all involved it was shrouded in secrecy belatedly leaked to the news media and accompanied by the surprising revelation that lampard had not actually been under contract with m l s when he was introduced as the leagues big new signing nearly two weeks passed before lampard released a statement reaffirming his intention to join m l s by midsummer but the damage had been done regardless of how well he would play the doubts about his commitment to his new team and its league had been baked in on monday in comments released by n y c f c lampard thanked the team his teammates and the fans i have very much enjoyed my time he said and i am very grateful to have had the opportunity to play for such a great club and in such an incredible city lampard is probably not the only former england international walking toward m l s s exit door los angeles galaxy midfielder steven gerrard a former england teammate of lampards who joined the galaxy from liverpool in july posted a photo of himself above the los angeles skyline to his instagram account on sunday with the caption i will miss you la like lampard gerrard will be out of his contract at the end of the year the galaxy who were eliminated from the playoffs in the conference semifinals a week ago had made no official comment on gerrards future with the team
donald j trumps election victory was powered in part by forceful opposition to what he described as an economic and political system rigged against the american people for the benefit of shadowy forces in the news media the banks and the government president elect trump and his allies often describe that system with one word globalism it is a word that conjures many images none of them good shuttered factories unchecked immigration and a distant cabal that believers say controls the economy and the media analysts who track extremist groups in the united states have expressed alarm at the use of the word by the president elect they say it carries multiple meanings from benign to sinister and often serves as a dog whistle for racist anti semitic and antigovernment conspiracy theorists globalism is a principle driver for the fears that animate the radical right in the united states said ryan lenz the editor of hatewatch a blog published by the southern poverty law center it is the enemy ultimately globalism is often used as a synonym for globalization the system of global economic interconnection that has been critiqued for decades by liberal groups like labor unions environmental organizations and opponents of the international monetary fund and the world bank but for the far right the term encapsulates a conspiratorial worldview based on racism xenophobia and anti semitism according to mark pitcavage a researcher at the anti defamation league lauren southern a host on the right wing canadian media site rebel media explicitly rejected its use as a synonym for globalization in a video she posted online in september she said the word meant rule by autocrats such as president obama former president george w bush and the united nations who value the false flag of diversity and unchecked immigration from the third world globalists almost always sneer down their nose at tradition disdain national culture laugh at religion and generally despise the west while holding a creepy affection for the third world she added they want open borders cheap labor and antinationalism to benefit their business and political visions and are all too willing to shaft the little people to achieve it breitbart news the hard right website run by stephen k bannon mr trumps newly appointed chief white house strategist frequently attacked globalism and so called globalist elites during mr bannons tenure there but no one may have done more to popularize the idea of a globalist conspiracy than alex jones a far right radio host who commands an online audience of millions through his infowars media empire he has been called the most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary america by the southern poverty law center among his claims the sandy hook school massacre in newtown conn was a hoax and the sept terror attacks were an inside job mr jones posted his own definition of globalism to youtube in in his trademark shout he described it as a global digital panopticon control system engineered by shadowy corporate and political elites he called it the total form of slavery the host who has enthusiastically supported mr trump hailed the republican as a george washington level historical figure mr trump who appeared on his show last year has in turn heaped praise upon mr jones your reputation is amazing mr trump said i will not let you down you will be very very impressed i hope and i think well be speaking a lot so what is mr trump talking about when he talks about globalism his spokeswoman hope hicks provided a definition in an email before the election last week far right groups in the united states began to refer to globalism at the end of the cold war when it replaced communism as an idea that was an ever present danger to the nation mr pitcavage said they have also referred to it as the new world order and soon they saw its tentacles everywhere the shape of that conspiracy had distinctly anti semitic overtones in part because many of communisms foes had historically seen communism as inextricably linked to judaism mr pitcavage said members of the far right became fixated on prominent jews like the businessman and philanthropist george soros those conspiratorial beliefs were bolstered when former president george bush celebrated the end of the cold war in a speech by saying it was the dawn of a new world order his use of the phrase was taken as proof by many that a globalist conspiracy really was afoot it was very easy for them especially because he was the one who said it to take that ball and run with it mr pitcavage said from that point on the phrase became the short hand for that kind of globalism conspiracy theory the terms multiple meanings have made it a powerful political tool and mr trumps and his allies frequent references to globalism have drawn in a wide and varied audience anti globalism is a very efficient net to unite disparate parts of the right from the mainstream to the extreme said brian levin the director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at california state university san bernardino professor levin called globalism the defining folklore and narrative for the racist right but said it had also become a convenient boogeyman to explain the various declines that the united states is perceived to be in globalism was an important theme in the final weeks of mr trumps campaign for example when he told a rally in florida in october that his opponent for the presidency hillary clinton had sat at the heart of a globe spanning conspiracy with international bankers to plot the destruction of u s sovereignty the anti defamation league criticized the speech for evoking classic anti semitic themes conspiratorial talk has continued after the election mr trump referred to a plot against him again last thursday when he complained on twitter that anti trump protests were the work of the

as health and care leaders we believe passionately in the nhs one of this countrys proudest achievements since its creation in it has constantly adapted to improve care for patients today is no different staff in health and social care do a superb job treating record numbers but they are under pressure as our nations needs increase rapidly there are also new opportunities to improve care by making practical changes to the way the nhs works the good news is that nhs bodies and local councils have come together for the first time across england to develop shared long term proposals to improve health and care in the communities they serve based on collaboration not competition their aim is to make real world improvements for patients making it easier to see a gp providing more specialist care in peoples homes speeding up the diagnosis of cancer and offering help faster to people with mental ill health the nhs has begun to set out its own stall to meet the challenges of the future we have a good plan in the five year forward view and are beginning important conversations with the public about how to make its vision a reality through sustainability and transformation plans now is not the time to go back to the drawing board instead we hope that all who value our health and care system will support local leaders getting on with theimportant task at hand sir andrew cash dr amanda doyle sir andrew morris david pearson the guardian is right to expose the scandal unfolding regarding plans for the nhs in many areas of the uk local campaigners have mounted vociferous opposition to try to protect vital services such as consultant led maternity and a e many are also promoting save our beds campaigns to try to preserve hospital beds in places with poor public transport links although people are allowed to speak at local forums or respond to glossy consultation documents they wonder whether anyone is really listening to their concerns it feels as if there is a hidden agenda and that the lives of those who live in locations with scattered populations and poor infrastructure are not important it may be the case that jeremy hunt and the government are trying to shift the responsibility on to those working at local level but local people know where the blame lies further investment in the nhs is vital the alternative is unthinkable the plan to save by must be abandoned gillian telford as a former nurse and now a grandmother i completely agree with cumbrian campaigner annette robson that thousands of people including mothers and babies will die if further nhs cuts go ahead the feasibility examination of the policy must have told the government at least some of this it is no surprise that mothers along with other carers are taking action we are defending the children we have carried for nine months given birth to and raised invested our hearts and minds in and others in our families and communities you report that theresa may told a health chief to ensure hospital closures did not become a big issue in the newspapers but she cannot hide the widespread opposition caroline barker centralised health services impose greater demands upon remaining hospitals as catchment areas and their populations increase so do hospital workloads but there is little present evidence of any hospital having capacity to serve more people hospitals are required to have capacities to provide ambulance and a e services not only to individuals but sometimes to large numbers of people affected by industrial accidents large fires multiple vehicle collisions bridge and building collapse storm damage or by river or sea flooding and the additional transferred workload of a centralised hospital shutting down not an unprecedented possibility is clearly beyond conception the proposed centralisation easy on paper diminishes essential services of whatever kind and for contingencies of whatever cause at times when immediate assistance is essential and close by james lewis when simon stevens announced the five year forward view he said it would cost he said he could make savings in this time and needed more from the government as the commons health select committee has shown the nhs is not getting the that jeremy hunt insisted it was getting over six years and as the bma says savings are to be made using stps hospitals are in deficit because the tariff has been set too low to cover costs and they cannot control the demand for a e services or the flow of patients trapped in hospital because of lack of social care gps have had their share of the nhs budget cut and are buckling under the strain which increases pressure on emergency services the chief executive of nhs providers chris hopson told the health committee that stps would not work because there were insufficient funds thinktanks such as the kings fund and nuffield foundation also say that the nhs needs more money one would hope that a prime minister who promised to fight against the burning injustice that if youre born poor you will die on average nine years earlier than others would accept that the nhs and social care need more money we spend of our gdp on health while france and germany spend if we spent another we would have another each year to spend on health wendy savage so nhs england says that sustainability and transformation plans are to drive genuine and sustainable transformation in patient experience and health outcomes of the longer term what a wonderful double meaning our patient experience in north devon will be transformed alright but not by a fairy godmother and the health outcomes will be transformed as for example women in labour are forced to travel for anything up to two hours to receive obstetric care the government is insulting our intelligence over social care on which the stp sums depend so heavily by discharging patients from hospital more rapidly
as our south west train pulled out of busy vauxhall station tim farron pleasant manner daybreak coffee preston accent set out his case for what the richmond park byelection is about any byelection any kind of election is about what the electorate says its about he said we were heading for richmond station travelling against the morning peak travel flow it was the liberal democrats leader thought the seventh time he had struck out for the famously handsome london suburban town since his party picked a candidate to try to boot the famously handsome zac goldsmith out of his famously handsome richmond park parliamentary seat my sense is that heathrow expansion was of course the big thing that everyone talked about in the first week farron went on he had a point of course indeed the byelection is only happening because goldsmith chose to keep a promise he made to richmond park electors when challenging the then lib dem incumbent susan kramer during the general election campaign that he would if elected resign and re fight the seat as an independent should a conservative government go back on the promise that had been made by the then shiny new party leader david cameron in that if he became prime minister heathrow airport would not be expanded no ifs no buts but goldsmith isnt the only candidate against expansion the lib dems as a party are too and while labour appears in favour despite the reluctance of its leader its richmond park hopeful is not farron argued that it is the seats electorate that has pushed the airport down the pecking order of issues though given that the tories arent running a candidate leaving the case in favour of expansion unmade in local hustings or media debate its hard to see how it could have gone anywhere else its not off the agenda but people dont seem to think this byelection is going to shift the dialogue on that because all the candidates are against it farron reasoned whereas the thing that is going to have the most lasting and significant impact on peoples lives is brexit and the nature of it if it happens note that pregnant if the lib dems historically super europhile and down to just eight mps have said that unless the government promises british voters a second referendum on the deal it strikes at the end of negotiations over the terms of britains withdrawal from the european union it will vote against the triggering of those negotiations through the formal mechanism of article of the lisbon treaty with this stance farrons party is effectively seeking to claim the who voted to remain in the eu as their own thats nationally of course in the borough of richmond upon thames remain took a massive of the vote one of the highest shares in remain backing greater london the scope for the byelection to be or be seen as being a sort of local referendum on the brexit one is down to goldsmith representing one of the boroughs two constituencies being a noted leaver moreover he is one who has sustained damage to his formerly almost saintly reputation thanks to his shockingly negative and deservedly disastrous london mayor campaign just a few months ago which sought to create anxiety over his labour rival sadiq khan being muslim it also offers the lib dems hope of recovery from its recent miserable electoral decline goldsmiths defeat of kramer in was the start of the collapse of a strong lib dem position in this region of greater london where the party has since lost three more of the five seats they once held to conservatives they also lost control of richmond council to the tories in kingston went the same way four years later sutton council and the parliamentary constituency of carshalton and wallington are all thats left of the old orange riviera across the capital as a whole the party has just councillors out of and one member of the strong london assembly they are though taking heart from a generally increasing vote share in borough byelections since the general election and from gaining a richmond council seat in the neighbouring twickenham constituency last july with labour in parliament all over the place on brexit farron hopes to build nationally on the big swing they secured at the witney byelection in october thats why hes been willing to trundle from vauxhall through clapham junction and putney to richmond so often outside the destination station lib dem activists handed local commuters a four page spoof of square mile free sheet city am to alarm them on their journeys into town britains brexit black hole bellowed the front page along with a snapshot of nigel farage and his giant gob and the news that ukip backs zac on the pavement candidate sarah olney sought engagement shes lives locally and works as an accountant at the national physical laboratory in nearby teddington a world renowned metrology centre that means its good at measuring thing dimwits it appears need not apply though it was cold olney was sunny bright despite the surrey comet richmond is in that zone of ambivalence where the metropolis and the home counties meet reporting that her husband had worked for heathrow between and on terminal the lib dems say the project had already been signed off and that olneys husband has subsequently turned down work connected with plans for a third runway at the airport on the wide pavement a man of south asian appearance with a professional manner and businesslike attire talked to olney for an animated couple of minutes about brexit and his disquiet over the goldsmith mayoral campaign which tried to persuade hindus and sikhs to reject khan before dashing for his train the candidate then stood with farron for a smart phone video shoot its eight days until a byelection that could change the direction of our country her leader said next stop a short
a close friend was going through a terrible time this summer as she cried to me on the phone in her lunch break or over coffee at the weekend i tried to be the best friend i could i told her to focus on the friends and partner who love her suggested therapy and exercise to alleviate her stress and gave her advice as to what she might say and do to change her situation ive always prided myself on being a good listener maybe ive got one of those faces partners friends colleagues even strangers at the bus stop seem to want to confide in me this year i started volunteering for a charity that provides fortnightly face to face confidential listening sessions for people i liked the idea that lay people such as myself could be trained with professional support to use our compassion and ears to help a fellow human being in distress on day one in my first training session i realised to my horror that i wasnt a very good listener at all all the habits that i thought made me good at it all that advice i was giving my friend was just getting in the way each session brought new revelations and useful lessons since putting those lessons into practice with my friends and partner ive seen what a difference it can make as my trainer pam tells me i have seen people in severe emotional distress feeling like the only way is down but they talk and cry and i just listen verbalising their emotions helps them see things more clearly being listened to makes us feel valued it makes the listener feel valued too there are several ways to approach a difficult conversation here are a few how to listen to a friend who is downthe first step pam says is being aware of the barriers if your friend is feeling low even expressing sympathy can get in the way we think its helpful to say i know exactly what you mean i went through something similar but thats talking about your own feelings rather than allowing your friend to tell you what its like for them when a person wants to express their pain your experiences arent relevant to them a similar common mistake is to leap to offer advice before being asked giving advice is not listening and often its not helpful pam adds it shuts people down if you feel a responsibility to fix your friends problems relinquish it if your friend is feeling low even expressing sympathy can get in the waythe hardest habit for me to break was the instinct to turn the conversation round to the positive it took a while for me to understand that if a friend is in a dark place the most compassionate thing we can do is to climb down into that place and sit with them for a while if a person trusts you enough to talk about their distress trying to cheer them up is like shutting them up you are dismissing and trivialising their feelings pam says give them the space to say how bad they feel and stay with it swerving away from it talking about a silver lining can signal you dont want to hear it focus on your friend and their words thinking too much about your responses can be detrimental sometimes my minds whirring and im so busy thinking about what to say that i leap ahead pam explains so i make a constant effort to calm my mind down and tune into what is being said it is possible when you know how to say a lot without saying anything at all just being a calm presence can give someone the trust and confidence to open up to you she tells me your body language should look engaged perhaps leaning forward and be open to making eye contact but also sensitive to people who might find it unnerving adopt a soft caring voice but beware pam warns theres a fine line between sounding warm and gentle and sounding patronising and pitying dont talk down to anyone just show genuine interest your most important tool she says is silence dont be afraid of silence learn to hold it although it may feel uncomfortable to you it wont to them theyre working through painful thoughts and feelings so dont rush them people will start opening up if you dont interrupt how to listen to your partnerthe closer you are to your partner the harder you have to work to truly listen to them says susan quilliam relationship coach and author of the relate guide stop arguing start talking that security history and intimacy being able to finish each others sentences treating your partner as if he or she is a part of yourself can mean our listening gets a little fuzzy theres a kind of mutual dependency and mental enmeshment that means you really have to struggle hard to listen to your partner as if he or she is a stranger quilliam estimates that most couples will genuinely talk and listen to each other for only minutes a week and that this can have a huge impact other people see your public selves a loving couple in a functional partnership but somewhere in your heart you know theres something wrong you dont feel heard and neither does your partner there is a way back to find it quilliam says you need to re establish the habit that was there when you fell in love with each other when there was nothing better than listening to your beloved explain who they are she suggests reclaiming minutes every day when you are both alone and can sit on the sofa and listen to each other for five minutes each set an alarm to go off at the end she calls this one way listening where one partner is given all the focus so the listener can
amid the hustle and bustle of freetown they instantly caught the eye a group of about college students stopped outside the courthouse formed a line and began to protest public dissent can be a hazardous business in sierra leone even when expressed in a peaceful manner and the mood reflected as much while some smiled and held their picket signs high others were noticeably tense heads down and eyes darting between the dozens of police that had been weaving in and out of the crowd since the demonstration began they knew they werent supposed to come they hadnt requested police authorisation and even if they had it wouldnt have mattered thats why they had to protest volunteers who fought ebola for sierra leone one year on read morewe have a sister a first year sociology student at our university who has been arrested for sharing a post on social media calling on us to protest against the rising petrol prices said as kamara a law student at freetowns fourah bay college he held a sign reading free expression in one hand and a smaller one with free teresa in the other she was exercising her civil rights which the democratic process our own constitution guarantees her he continued passionately were here today to stand in solidarity with teresa and make our voices heard so we can let the world know the true state of things in our country it is our right to do so theresa mbomaya was arrested on november for forwarding a message in a student whatsapp group that while promoting a forthcoming demonstration also implied that any vehicle trying to disrupt it could be set on fire she was detained for five days before in the hour preceding the solidarity demonstration a volunteer coalition of lawyers successfully negotiated her release there is a culture of fear in sierra leone because people know that if you protest youre going to be intimidatedemmanuel saffa abdulai society for democratic initiativesmbomaya has been charged with incitement and the government has released a statement calling for social media forum moderators to be held criminally responsible for content posted to their pages regardless of authorship the students say their protest which was allowed to continue unimpeded is just the beginning of a larger movement to protect free expression in sierra leone in the past two years the countrys ruling party has shown a worsening often violent intolerance for public criticism and with an year civil war in the rear view mirror a culture of silence often deters would be protesters from publicly airing their grievances but in the past week mbomayas case has quickly evolved into a cause clbre that bolstered by the countrys grim economic conditions has become the epicentre of a growing social movement calling for unobstructed freedom of expression whichever way the court rules in mbomayas case civil society and human rights groups expect profound implications for the future of expressive freedom in sierra leone for better or for worse since the height of the ebola outbreak opposition members protesters activists and journalists have been jailed beaten teargassed or shot for publishing material or staging demonstrations deemed critical of government policy groups thought to oppose the ruling party are routinely denied applications to conduct their programmes while pro government groups are permitted to carry out similar business even some who have obtained prior permission for events from the police have been subjected to raids there is a justifiable culture of fear in this country because people know that if you come out to protest youre going to be intimidated in one way or another and its unlikely anyone will stand up for you said emmanuel saffa abdulai head of the society for democratic initiatives a civil society group and the main organiser for the renaissance a group of politically active professionals who recently applied to protest against a hike in fuel prices police denied their request but that denial sparked what is being called the blackmonday movement with supporters wearing black every monday to express their discontent for the national state of free expression it also inspired mbomaya to promote a student protest four days later a move which although having led to her arrest has quickly propelled both blackmonday and the renaissance into the national spotlight even demonstrating at malcom x park in philadelphia they will tell you you have to operate within particular timespresidential spokesman abdulai bayraytaywe want to demystify this process abdulai said the world is not going to end because the government is annoyed with you for protesting they can lock you up for a few months or shoot you dead but life goes on they cant do that to everyone abdulai is among a bipartisan group of lawyers who as their own form of protest have agreed to represent mbomaya pro bono they say the public order act the law that paved the way for the arrests of mbomaya and many others is too vague and contradicts the expressive rights outlined in the countrys constitution it also was implemented by the former president albert margai who later tried to reorganise sierra leone into a single party dictatorship the public order act says that you should not publish information that is perceived to cause fear in the population said francis kaifala who is leading mbomayas defence team at that time sierra leone was moving towards a dictatorship and the government wanted to control everything we were a fledgling democracy then but its and weve had many years to develop there are many aspects of that law that we dont believe would hold up against the constitution because frankly they belong to the dark ages presidential spokesman abdulai bayraytay responded that active laws need to be respected as long as they are still in the books pointing to americas often sweeping anti terror policies by way of example he said demonstration permits are handled exclusively by the police on a case by case basis independent of any
racism is a serious problem within the lgbt community and needs to be addressed despite the determination of many minority ethnic lgbt people to do just that it is not happening how can i be a bigot when i am myself a member of an oppressed minority is a prevailing attitude among some white lgbt people but another far more pernicious reason is that the lgbt world revolves around white gay men to the exclusion of others the rainbow flag is whiter than it appears texas bill could force teachers to out students to parents lgbt activists fear read moreim sexualised for my skin tone and never treated as a person saif tells me the community is trained to accept a white masc muscled gay man and the rest of us are not really accepted or one of their own its not the individual he blames but being conditioned by a community that venerates the sexual image of a white gay man according to research by fs magazine an astonishing of black men of asian men and of south asian men have experienced racism on the gay scene this manifests itself in numerous ways some are rejected because of their ethnicity on the other hand some are objectified because of it on dating sites and apps profiles abound that say no asians or no black people casually excluding entire ethnic groups its like a bastardised no dogs no blacks no irish signs as anthony lorenzo puts it on apps like grindr writes matthew rodriguez gay men brandish their racial dating preferences with all the same unapologetic bravado that straight men reserve for their favourite baseball team homi tells me he has persian ancestry and is sometimes mistaken for being greek italian spanish etc once at a nightclub he was relentlessly pursued by a fellow patron eventually he was asked where are you from when homi answered india the man was horrified im so sorry i dont do indians indians are not my type historically lgbt publications been dominated by white men and have neglected issues of raceand it is not simply a western phenomenon luan a brazilian journalist tells me his country has a eurocentric image of beauty and there is a cult of the white man which is absurd given more than half the population is black or brown others speak of their experiences of being rejected by door staff at lgbt venues michel a south asian man tells me of being turned away because you dont look gay and being called a dirty paki he says it has got worse since the orlando nightclub massacre where the gunman was muslim and then theres the other side of the equation objectification malik tells about his experiences of what he describes as the near fetishisation of race the rejection of people based on ethnicity is bad enough he says but it can be just as gross when someone reduces you to your ethnicity without consent when dating hooking up his arab heritage was objectified and stereotyped by some would be lovers even down to presuming his sexual role when the royal vauxhall tavern a famed london lgbt venue hosted a blackface drag act chardine taylor stone launched the stop rainbow racism campaign the drag act featured exaggerated neck rolling finger snapping displays of sassiness bad weaves and other racial stereotypes she says after launching a petition against the event she received threats of violence white lgbtqs who are truly against racism need to step up and take ownership of what is happening in their community she writes lgbt publications are guilty too historically theyve been dominated by white men have neglected issues of race and have portrayed white men as objects of beauty dean stopped buying mainstream gay magazines two years ago the only time they would write about people of colour is when they had done something homophobic he says the gay media is completely whitewashed there has been positive change in recent months one leading black gay journalist tells me but only because of the work of ethnic minority lgbt individuals holding magazines to account setting up their own nights across the scene and using social media blogs podcasts and boycotts to force change while lgbt people are much more likely than heterosexuals to suffer from mental distress the level is even higher among ethnic minorities undoubtedly racism plays a role as rodriguez puts it seeing dating app profiles rejecting entire ethnic groups causes internalised racism decreased self esteem and psychological distress james baldwins giovannis room an antidote to shame read moremany of the rights and freedoms that all lgbt people won were down to the struggles of black and minority ethnic people at the stonewall riots for example non white protesters the least that white lgbt people can do is to reciprocate and confront racism within their own ranks shangela an actor tells me that racism from the lgbt community hurts more because its coming from people that im meant to share a kinship with the far right movements on the march across the western world are consciously trying to co opt the lgbt rights campaign for their own agenda muslims are portrayed as an existential threat to gay people particularly after orlando there are those who only talk about lgbt rights if it is to bash muslims or migrants as a whole american white nationalist websites now sell lgbt pride flags along with the confederate flag this week milo yiannopolous a gay attention seeker who has become an icon of the us far right was at the centre of a media storm because a platform to speak at his old school was withdrawn in the netherlands the anti immigrant right was led by a gay man pim fortuyn until his assassination in france reportedly a third of married gay couples support the far right national front the struggle against racism has of course to be led by people of

the evisceration of the independent commission against corruption and its commissioner megan latham has been a long time coming new south wales politicians of all stripes have traditionally put their hands on their hearts and declared their support for a squeaky clean public administration three cheers for icac yet in their heart of hearts they have feared and detested the countrys most formidable corruption busting body two liberal premiers fell foul of icac and during the recent operation spicer investigations into electoral funding at least liberal mps were banished to the crossbench or into oblivion as a result of their involvement with tainted donors other senior liberal party figures such as paul nicolaou and nick di girolamo were also unhappily caught up in operation spicer but were not found to have acted corruptly icac commissioner megan latham resigns after pressure from baird read more the wounds run deep especially after barry ofarrell shot his premiership to death by providing an incorrect answer to the commission in a separate but related matter icacs parliamentary oversight committee dominated by politicians from the right of the spectrum soon got to work its job was ably assisted by two other factors icacs inspector the former judge david levine and the commissions attempted investigation into allegations against senior crown prosecutor margaret cunneen which ended up being stuck down by the high court while she waged a personal war against icac commissioner latham cunneen was in thick with conservatives in the upper house such as the reverend fred nile who also sat on the oversight committee levine also batting from cunneens end of the pitch came up with a whole pile of recommendations that would have effectively defenestrated icacs functions as a public investigator cunneen levine and the parliamentary committee gave rise to an imperfect storm with the rightwing media bellowing like banshees levine recommended an end to corruption investigations conducted in public while the former icac commissioner david ipp remarked the whole raison detre of icac is the exposure of corruption the idea of exposing corruption behind closed doors is oxymoronic the inspector also wanted an exoneration protocol so that those who had been found corrupt by icac and who had not been convicted of a criminal offence after a trial could apply to the supreme court to expunge icacs findings it was left to bruce mcclintock sc who along with former chief justice murray gleeson had conducted a review of icac in to carefully explain that icac makes corruption findings on the balance of probabilities while the dpp has the job of prosecuting and if possible securing convictions beyond reasonable doubt much of what icac discovers through its coercive powers cannot be admitted in criminal proceedings so it can be no surprise that findings of corruption can be made while criminal convictions either dont proceed or dont succeed mcclintock submitted to the parliamentary committee thus it is inevitable that a proportion of cases where icac finds corrupt conduct will not result in any prosecution even though its findings were appropriate on the information available to icac that does not mean that the person in question did not engage in corrupt conduct still less that the person is innocent in the end the government and labor members of the parliamentary committee agreed to airbrush levines two major recommendations secret hearings and exonerations to arrive at a three commissioner icac where all investigations would be conducted in secret unless the chief commissioner and one other agreed otherwise additional safeguards have been included in the new act that amount to a backdoor version of an exoneration protocol new guidelines for the conduct of public inquiries have to be formulated along with prior disclosure to anyone under investigation of all the available evidence and time for responses to be formulated icac overhaul passes new south wales parliament despite scathing criticism read more no adverse findings can be made without first giving the affected party a right of response and for that response to be included in the final report people whose conduct attracts critical observations but no formal adverse findings cannot be identified in the responses these measures are a shift towards greater protections for those in the frame and remove much of the rough and tumble in the hunt for the truth it should suit the politicians and the business interests that pull the strings no end premier mike bairds claim that his new legislation is just a reflection of the bipartisan recommendations of the parliamentary committee is disingenuous to a fault importantly the labor members of the committee did not support the requirement that commissioner megan latham lose her job and if she wanted it again she would have to make an application to require the commissioner to put her hand up for her job while she has been investigating members of the governing political party and while findings involving senior liberals are still pending shows the extent to which the fix is in if she had chosen to do so her appointment would have to be approved by the coalition controlled parliamentary committee how do you think that would work the intemperate cross examination of latham by members of the committee on things like the commission issuing a press release announcing the cunneen matter had been referred to the dpp and her right to refuse to answer questions on operational matters gives us a clue in fact the committee can veto the appointment of any commissioner ie politicians can blackball anyone who looks like having the constitutional fortitude to be able to put a broom through the augean stables of the state the old icac has been abolished replaced by a new body with legislative mechanisms that make it much more politically responsive we also got a look at the vengeance that accompanied these changes cunneen was in the presidents upper house gallery on the afternoon the legislation was passed it was reported that she watched as mike gallacher spoke in favour of the bill
somehow donald trump manages to dumb down everything somehow he manages to lower the bar to the point where he can play by a different set of rules and somehow the media and elected officials just shrug their shoulders and walk away by his own admission the president elect is negotiating business deals at a time when his predecessors were you know filling cabinet positions and transitioning to power he met with his indian business partners and the trump organization signed a kolkata deal last week as trump tweeted earlier this week prior to the election it was well known that i have interests in properties all over the world only the crooked media makes this a big deal he explained this in more detail if not entirely coherently in his interview with the new york times ive built a very great company and its a big company and its all over the world people are starting to see when they look at all these different jobs like in india and other things number one a job like that builds great relationships with the people of india so its all good its all good is indeed trumps approach to mixing his business and political affairs the law is totally on my side he claimed meaning the president cant have a conflict of interest to be clear profiting from the presidency would not be a quaint conflict of interest this is not about whether trump favors one country or president over another gives a contract to one company or another or spends more time making money for himself than he does boning up about policy there are laws on the books about us businesses influencing foreign officials with payments or other inducements the law is called the foreign corrupt practices act and its goal is to stamp out bribery by any us citizen bribery is what the law calls favors and payments given to foreign officials in exchange for business deals not a conflict of interest payments and favors going the other way into the pockets of the president are so clearly corrupt that they were forbidden by the founding fathers in the constitution the so called emoluments clause prohibits gifts and titles from foreign powers as follows no person holding any office of profit or trust under them shall without the consent of the congress accept of any present emolument office or title of any kind whatever from any king prince or foreign state its this clause that leads to exceptional red tape around any and all gifts received by the white house and every other department from a homemade quilt to a rolex watch everything is detailed declared and surrendered officials can only keep the gifts up to a value of if they repay the us government this process will be hard within the world of international real estate where foreign powers can grant gifts ranging from planning permits to investments from sovereign wealth funds the list is almost endless now we dont know if donald trump discussed his buenos aires investment with president mauricio macri of argentina but we do know that his daughter ivanka now running the family business was on the call we dont know if there was any suggestion that president mauricio macri could expect any benefits for himself or his country spokespeople for president macri and president elect trump have denied reports about the mixing of trump business and politics on the call but we do know that the long stalled buenos aires project is now moving forward news that emerged just three days after the call between macri and trump for a president who has refused to release his tax returns the need for transparency is not exactly clear in any case the fact that were even having this discussion tells you something profound about the trump presidency before it officially begins trumps promise to his voters was that he was incorruptible because he was so independently wealthy that nobody could touch him he knew how to drain the swamp because he had lived in it for so long buying off begging politicians for so many years that it made him sick this argument was always a stretch but clearly many voters bought into his pitch just two weeks since the election its obvious that trump has no interest in separating his personal wealth from his political agenda the damage caused is not confined to public confidence in the united states government being leader of the free world is not a casual concept that cold war phrase encapsulates the long prized notion that the united states is a beacon of freedom and democracy for the world as his own transition came to an end president elect kennedy best summed up the notion in his final address in boston in january i have been guided by the standard john winthrop set before his shipmates on the flagship arbella years ago as they too faced the task of building a new government on a perilous frontier we must always consider he said that we shall be as a city upon a hill the eyes of all people are upon us the eyes of the world are on the trump transition right now they see a president elect who lost the popular vote by more than million votes and almost percentage points this is a difficult notion of democracy to explain to a world struggling against authoritarian regimes where votes are routinely ignored and discounted the work of democracy promotion by the national endowment for democracy established by reagan is immeasurably harder as a result of the election the work of spreading corruption free government has become just as hard as a result of trumps business dealings if a sitting president can enrich himself while in office then why cant a president of a developing country set up his own businesses to do the same why should they not do both after all as trump told
a wonderful and wide ranging discussion of an immensely complex and emotionally charged issue some final thoughts fighting corruption forcing the hand of policy makers and developing community based responses to poverty are vital to elephant survivalhuman elephant conflict cannot be avoided but we can try to control how humans reacta network of parks and wild lands is needed to allow elephants to roam naturallystamping out demand and the legal market in china is going to be difficult but the government appears to be serioushope for the future is not lost but it is probably limited to small pockets of land an entirely self indulgent question i will admit but thats my prerogative this excellent panel give us measured hope for the future november many countries afraid it will not possible we often forget central and west africa where elephants are in many areas doomed if we cannot stop the current elephant poaching crisis your grandchildren will probably be able to see wild elephants only in a handful of african countries in the eastern and southern africa tiny islands of elephants surrounded by oceans of people simonhedgeswcs november but unless we all redouble our efforts to combat poaching build community support for conservation reduce hec reduce trafficking and dramatically reduce demand for ivory the number of places with significant numbers of wild elephants functioning as they should will be very much smaller than now but there is real hope kenyadan november think so karl because high value tourism areas will be maintained they might be private however like ol pejeta and lewa in kenya unfortunately in getting to them you and your kids will drive through or fly over farms and livestock grazing lands because people have eradicated the wildlife you know what the word in english is for pest animals with no value vermin current policy is in effect making wildlife vermin from the perspective of rural african communities monicawrobel november i think that with increasing momentum to listen to the elephant specialists talking about the species we can get ivory under control and poaching significantly lessened and i strongly believe that if we do want simply islands of elephants but connected migrating herds we have to plan this now and in the next years while we have something to work with this applies in asia too where the iucn asian elephant specialist group just met last week for all of those people who have or are going to have grandchildren the question is back to you all are you with us we need you to make your desire known to politicians and help us fund the work until the governments and corporations step up their funding and stewardship for elephants and their habitat asian elephants are monica wrobel whose organisation elephant family focuses on asian elephants paints a frightening picture of the future monicawrobel november the past years of asian elephant populations have been wiped out without action this iconic animal could be facing extinction within decades which is why this species is listed as endangered they now number as few as across countries in asia with probably occurring in india habitat loss and fragmentation of populations are causing declines and then the results of that such as train strikes are killing them as well as hunting however retaliatory killing for crop raiding such as by electrocution traps hooked up to the mains wires or setting out poison bait such as poisoned pineapples are killing what these superb wild giants have been reduced to crop pests especially in places where people have settled and have no history of living with or knowing how to live with elephants dan stiles also thinks things are looking bleak kenyadan november destruction and fragmentation is the obvious answer it remarkable how well they done in india and sri lanka when you think of the population pressures unfortunately it looks like poaching for ivory is on the increase in india and carvers are still churning out the ganeshas and saraswatis i read how various states are planning corridors etc heres what can be done says wrobel monicawrobel november asia though we have hope by protecting and keeping habitat areas connected and working with both rural communities and experts alike to understand more where elephants need to move and what they need to eat we can lessen the interaction between people and elephants and help people co exist safely we can work with governments and companies to rationally plan where land change will occur but we need to resource that research and those experts so they are ready with the answers so there is hope but we need to act now importantly as we attempt to get control globally on the battle against ivory and illegal poaching in africa we are learning tremendous lessons to be applied in africa to protect space and empower people to allow our spectacular largest land mammal still have room to roam our biggest project at the moment with other ngos is our corridors campaign http elephant family org what we do campaigning corridors on email wim kerkhoven asks why we cant use funds from tourism to support local communities so they dont turn to poaching theres just not enough to go around says andrea crosta november africa there are working examples of involving local communities in the way you suggest it simply a drop in the ocean there are million and millions of poor people and just a fraction of them is actually blessed with tourism and you need just a few poachers and a couple of traffickers or brokers to create havoc there s a huge human toll behind the ivory trade and poor exploited people are a big part of it rahul raman november the same situation here in india even with tourism the number of poor people who actually benefit from it i e whose lives are uplifted by its effects is a very small number whatever the solution is it has to be more
this bloodbath of an election a friend emailed me like watching someone get murdered another said over the phone and this in an email from a veteran of the vietnam war the third vietnam draft dodger is now commander in chief welcome to the full flowering of the era of trump which began with that now mytho epic glide down the escalator at trump tower where trump commenced his candidacy with these historic words when mexico sends its people theyre not sending their best theyre sending people that have lots of problems and theyre bringing those problems with us theyre bringing drugs theyre bringing crime theyre rapists and some i assume are good people if ever a monument is erected to the trump presidency then surely these words shades of gettysburg will be carved into the marble walls along with blood coming out of her wherever fifty bucks a steak and i would bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding in true demagogic fashion trump bypassed the head and spoke directly to the gut to the biles and bubbling acids of raw emotion he said things that many civil temperate americans hardly dared to admit we carried in ourselves were hardly aware of just how deeply we resented our own niceness how angry our interior lives with all this stuff bottled up years and years of internalized micro aggression from a culture that kept insisting on diversity inclusiveness tolerance many discovered just what a drag political correctness was all these years and to be free of it freed from this code that was jamming us up that was relief akin to a lung puncturing primal scream from the start trumps rallies had the air of the tent revival that same hot thrum of militant exorcism and ecstasy lets not fool ourselves a friend wrote i cant stand anything but cold honesty right now this is not a repub winning the election which would be bad enough this is white supremacy winning calm down were tempted to say its really not that bad stances are taken things get said in the heat of a campaign and we could take heart in the newly gracious conciliatory trump on display for several days after the election then came the news that steve bannon the erstwhile chairman of the trump campaign who bears a striking resemblance to otis the town drunk on the old andy griffith show was named senior counselor and chief strategist for the incoming trump administration the mainstream press still feels compelled to explain the term alt right but we know already we know we know we know white nationalism aka honky purity along with thick glistening lardings of apocalyptic racism and a style sense that falls somewhere between springtime for hitler and queer eye for the straight guy prior to his gig on the trump campaign bannon spent four years as chairman of breitbart news which he proudly declared to be the platform for the alt right as breitbart chairman bannon presided over such headlines as gabby giffords the gun control movements human shield birth control makes women unattractive and crazy and two weeks after a white nationalist murdered nine members of a bible study group at a black church in charleston south carolina hoist it high and proud the confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage find myself not sleeping at night a friend wrote the first president endorsed by the ku klux klan noted another then there was obama being obama on the day after the election we have to remember that were actually all on one team a mans character is his fate as heraclitus said and what a strange twisted fate indeed that barack obama cerebral disciplined cool ever seeking to reconcile and accommodate has had to deal with an opposition that very much regarded him as not on the team there was the birther movement for starters the closet muslim conspiracy theories the terrorist fist bump founder of isis teenage crack dealer hanging out on the corner all this damage hes done to america is deliberate said marco rubio during one of the republican debates which is a laugh if obama wanted to trash the us all he had to do on taking office in was sit on his hands and let the hot mess of the bush economy continue its meltdown to oblivion but the issue is bigger than any particular president after his post election all on one team remark obama continued the point though is that we all go forward with a presumption of good faith in our fellow citizens because that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant and functioning democracy this goes to the heart of the matter the american system of constitutional government is founded on deliberate fragmentation of power the separation of powers and checks and balances that we all learned in high school civics for government to be effective for government to meet the needs of the people the us constitutional order requires a healthy measure of good faith cooperation among the players this good faith began to fray in the early as gop leaders in congress newt gingrich and tom delay chief among them declared war on all efforts even from those in their own party to govern from a stance of bipartisan cooperation democrats in gingrichs world of moral absolutes were the enemy of normal americans gingrich and his allies were fighting no less than a civil war with liberals and as he declared in a speech to the heritage foundation this war has to be fought with a scale and a duration and a savagery that is only true of civil wars and so began the constitutional hardball and scorched earth tactics that have characterized the past quarter century of american politics you may recall the gingrich orchestrated government shutdowns of and over budget disputes and the impeachment of bill clinton for lying about a blowjob in more recent times
he must be disappointed by that typo in the first line of the email that was my first thought when the following landed in my inbox it might sound shocking and threatening but i didnt feel shocked or threatened this was just another day on the internet where people disproportionately women people of color and queer people are harassed abused bullied intimidated and threatened its what writer umair haque describes as a ceaseless flickering hum of low level emotional violence the women abandoned to their online abusers read moreat around the same time someone i assume the same person signed me up to a mailbot service which meant i received thousands of unsolicited email newsletter sign ups within a few hours thankfully gmails spam filters learn quickly but it took a minutes of flagging messages to clean up my inbox a mild irritation meanwhile on twitter someone else was sending me pornographic gifs and asking whether penis size really matters for a lady i blocked him as im sure i will have to block many others in the future in a tedious game of whack a troll i would love to say that this is atypical but its not in fact id go as far as to say that this feels entirely pedestrian just your regular run of the mill rape threats and dreary dick pics for one of my colleagues normal is dealing with racial slurs or having her profile photo edited to have jew horns for a male colleague its people telling him to commit suicide or saying they want his kids to die if we complain about these microaggressions were either overreacting or feeding the trolls but if we dont speak up were letting them get away with it paralysed by this dilemma we fall back on swatting the antagonists away like flies and perhaps as a coping strategy telling ourselves that its normal most of the time the flies are few and far between but you only have to look at the relentless campaigns of hate against public figures like ghostbusters actor and comedian leslie jones olympic diver tom daley or games developer zoe quinn to see what happens when the flies form a swarm it becomes overwhelming exhausting and incredibly difficult for the individual or the police to make case by case judgements on what constitutes a credible threat if youre in the media you are familiar with how things work online but for an average person these types of interactions could be terrifying said whitney phillips author of this is why we cant have nice things so how did we get here and what should we do about it many cyberbullies are aggrieved middle aged white men who feel like they werent given the fantasy life they were owedbailey poland author of hatersdetermined bullies have always found ways to antagonize others but digital tools have given them new powers fifty years ago if you wanted to wind up a co worker you could write anonymous messages and leave them on his or her desk you could tease that person but there would be no archive and it couldnt be amplified it could potentially be upsetting but it wouldnt be indexed in google search said phillips its the ability of google search to index abuse or what she calls ambivalent play that changes the ethical stakes your online history follows you around meaning those targeted struggle to move on and have a fresh start trolling and cyberbullying have been part of the internet since its inception a side effect of anonymity and unfettered free expression both critical pillars of the web once restricted to niche forums and chatrooms with their own codes of conduct ubiquitous social media has brought it into the mainstream there used to be so few people occupying those digital spaces and the people who were were a lot more homogenous than what you see now said phillips more homogenous means more white and more male it isnt just teenagers in their parents basements a lot of them are otherwise very well adjusted normal adult men with wives and children and full time jobs said bailey poland author of haters many of them fall into the camp of very aggrieved middle aged white men who feel like they werent given the fantasy life they were owed they tend to take it out on people who are happy successful or present in a way that makes them feel uncomfortable thats not to say that white men dont get harassed online but that harassment is more frequently directed at members of historically underrepresented populations whose voices have not always been privileged the people who have always had their voices taken seriously tend to be the antagonists said phillips arguing that it comes from a sense of disenfranchisement the trump effectits that same sense of disenfranchisement that propelled donald trump to the white house with a campaign that normalized identity based antagonism he says absurdly offensive degrading things about women and people of color and specific groups whether thats mexicans muslims whatever he says these terrible things and that normalizes hate speech in mainstream discourse its so normal to open up cnn or any news app and see bigotry says phillips the tenor of discourse that trump and his associates have been engaging in has emboldened some people to say we are in charge now and we can say whatever we want adds kate miltner a phd student at usc annenberg school of communication and journalism trumps locker room comments about sexually harassing women are a reflection of the normalization of violence against women sexual threats and rape threats are a form of domination that has been used against women for all of time it ties into seeing women as not fully human and having their value contingent on whether or not they are worthy of raping said poland the media in an effort to draw attention to the bigotry ends up amplifying it some
a magnitude earthquake has struck off the coast of fukushima the site of devastating quake and resulting tsunami at tuesday local time the japan meteorological agency said the quake was an aftershock to the earthquake the largest since that quakes immediate aftershocks the jma warned that another large quake could be expected within the next few days and people in the region have been advised to remain cautious for the next week tsunami warnings were issued for the fukushima and miyagi prefectures with waves at sendai port recorded at high the warnings have since been downgraded before being cancelled although residents are still advised to avoid the shore at the fukushima daini nuclear power plant the reactor number spent fuel pool pump stopped operating at as a result of the quake

evacuation warnings japan earthquake tsunami waves surge up river todays quake was an aftershock of the magnitude earthquake the japan meteorological agency has said but what is the difference heres a handy explainer from the southern california earthquake center seismologists label an earthquake as an aftershock using two guidelines first the earthquake must occur within an aftershock zone which is usually defined as the region within one fault rupture length of the mainshock rupture surface or the area defined by seismologists based on previous aftershock activity second it must happen within this zone before the seismicity rate in the area returns to its pre mainshock level an earthquake that meets these two specific criteria is considered an aftershock pointing out that tuesdays quake was an aftershock of the earthquake the japan meteorological agency also warned that another large quake could be expected within the next few days people in japan have been warned to remain cautious for the next week the magnitude quake was the largest earthquake in the region since the magnitude quake in and some of its immediate aftershocks the japan meteorological agency has said that

its been three years since protesters gathered on the streets of kiev to demand an end to a government they believed was no longer fit for purpose the demonstration triggered a chain of events that led to russia annexing crimea and war in eastern ukraine thousands have been killed and million people displaced but as russias foreign policy interests shift to syria and the baltics we have asked young ukrainians how the past three years have been for them and what they think the future holds when euromaidan started i knew i had been ready for it all my lifewhen euromaidan started i knew i had been ready for it all my life finally a solution to ukraines rotting post totalitarian kleptocracy more than million of us gathered in kievs central square and together we felt strong enough to make ukraine a country where people would choose to live i joined the protests and spent day and night in the headquarters of the resistance where it felt like the future of ukraine depended on whether our wooden shields would withstand the attacks of the government riot police i translated news into english from the barricades and helped coordinate media efforts occasionally i would go home and sleep i opened my own website euromaidan press to tell the story of what was happening i wanted to provide an alternative narrative for the english speaking world one different from the russian press who branded us the nazi junta and called us dangerous nationalists and radicals but three years on i am left feeling that ukraine is treated as no more than a diplomatic pawn a country that has always been bullied by both former soviet occupiers and modern global powers the western media also treats ukraine as an object the thing that made relations with russia go sour but there are other stories to be told like our citizens still having their rights oppressed and the daily information war we continue to fight with russia alya shandra kiev i refuse to hate the people who want to separate from usi am originally from starobelsk in eastern ukraine my mother is a native russian who doesnt speak ukrainian and has never been to a ukrainian speaking city my father is a traditional ukrainian and has vowed to be first in line to volunteer if an army if the pro russian rebels comes to town my town was russian speaking and i grew up feeling that russia and ukraine were two countries with a common history fairytales and culture but after the war i am no longer able to understand the situation as clearly there is so much propaganda trying to pit one side against the other but i refuse to hate the people who want to separate from the rest of the country as im from the luhansk region i understand its not that they think ukraine is bad its just that they believed their lives would be better in russia dasha prokaza lvivpeople think one day we will be brothers and sisters again we wontthe most frequently misunderstood thing about ukraines relationship with russia is that one day we will be brothers and sisters again my city of odessa witnessed a big tragedy on may when pro russians attacked a pro ukraine march i was on my way to a football match but i stopped by to see what going on i had a camera and as i was running between the two camps bullets stones and molotov cocktails started to fly on the corner of the main street in odessa deribasovskaya someone called me by name and i took a few steps towards him moments later a man was killed on the spot where i had been standing by the end of the day the death toll had exceeded more than two years have passed and the official investigation cannot determine who was responsible for sparking the violence or why the authorities did nothing to stop it spreading journalists have tried to make sense of what happened as have independent experts but we still dont have official closure history shows us that it is difficult for people recover from conflicts if there have been a large number of victims especially if those responsible have not been held to account but without this how can we be friends iryna kyporenko odessaobama and stalin are seen as dictators who killed millionsobama and stalin are identical both bloody dictators who killed millions of people and hillary clinton is a heavy user of drugs these are two commonly held beliefs among ukrainians who rely on pro russia sites for their news when i was a student we learned about the propaganda of nazi germany and the soviet union but such propaganda is now an everyday reality in ukraine my father a native ukrainian has recently retired from the russian merchant navy after years he used to listen to western rock music and travel the world now he believes joseph stalin and ivan the terrible were great leaders who should have monuments erected in their honour when i suggested stalin was responsible for millions of deaths he claimed that obama was a bloody dictator too ukraine has banned russian state tv on the basis of the disinformation and propaganda it promotes a move russia called a violation against freedom of speech but everything is available online anyway my friend has just returned from the conflict in donbass where he says no one watchesukrainian channels only stuff from russia and the so called donetsk peoples republic for some it feels likes russian tv is creating a fantasy narrative to destroy ukraine but for others its a version of events they have come to believe as russian journalists often say every situation can be seen as truth from one point of view and a lie from the other natalia steblyna odessathis

were going to wrap up our live blog coverage for the day heres a summary of where things stand trump continued to meet with potential administration picks at trump tower no new picks were announced trump aide kellyanne conway said that more trump picks would be announced soon and could come this week a possible homeland security pick kansas secretary of state kris kobach was photographed at the weekend going into a meeting with trump carrying exposed documents that described plans to question high risk immigrants about sharia law and the constitution a spokesman for argentinian president mauricio macri denied local reports that trump had spoken with macri about a trump business project macri said he also spoke with ivanka trump but again not about business his spokesman said im very confident he is not breaking any laws he has various lawyers accountants and advisers who tell him what he must do and what he can conway said of trump a federal court in wisconsin ruled that the republican controlled legislature had engaged in unconstitutional gerrymandering in a redistricting the court deferred on recommending a remedy an update now to that last block uki goi in buenos aires

say hello because he met her when she was just a kid they did not speak about it the president doesnt speak about city building permits pavlovsky told the guardian earlier this hour we published a report by uki goi for the guardian that a spokesman for argentinas president has denied that donald trump asked for a business favour in their first phone call after trump was elected president we would now highlight a separate passage from the report ivanka trump spoke on the call with president mauricia macri macri told a japanese newspaper but despite such setbacks the relationship remains close enough that president macri spoke with ivanka trump during last mondays phone conversation in the call i also talked with his daughter macri told the japanese newspaper the asahi shimbun i have known her since her infant days ivanka trumps role in her fathers transition and presidency have attracted controversy because trump has said he will avoid conflicts of interest in his business dealings while president by turning his companies over to his children a safeguard that does not work as well if his elder daughter ivanka is in the room for top level meetings as she was when trump met with japanese prime minister shinzo abe last week or if she is sitting next to trump when he gets off the phone with a foreign leader so that she may take the call jennifer epstein ivanka trump

paul dirac had an eye for beauty in one essay from may the british nobel laureate referred to beauty nine times it makes four appearances in four consecutive sentences in the article he painted a picture of how physicists saw nature but the word beauty never defined a sunset nor a flower or nature in any traditional sense dirac was talking quantum theory and gravity the beauty lay in the mathematics what does it mean for maths to be beautiful it is not about the appearance of the symbols on the page that at best is secondary maths becomes beautiful through the power and elegance of its arguments and formulae through the bridges it builds between previously unconnected worlds when it surprises for those who learn the language maths has the same capacity for beauty as art music a full blanket of stars on the darkest night the slow movement of the mozart clarinet concerto is a really beautiful piece of music but i dont print off a page of the score and put that on my wall its not about that its about the music and the ideas and the emotional response says vicky neale a mathematician at oxford university its the same with a piece of mathematics its not how it looks its about the underlying thought processes brain scans of mathematicians show that gazing at formulae considered beautiful by the beholder elicits activity in the same emotional region as great art and music the more beautiful the formula the greater the activity in the medial orbito frontal cortex so far as the brain is concerned maths has beauty just like art there is common neurophysiological ground says sir michael atiyah an honorary professor of mathematics at edinburgh university ask mathematicians about the most beautiful equation and one crops up time and again written in the century by the swiss mathematician leonhard euler the relation is short and simple ei it is neat and compact even to the naive eye but the beauty comes from a deeper understanding here the five most important mathematical constants are brought together eulers formula marries the world of circles imaginary numbers and exponentials the beauty of other formulae may be more obvious with e albert einstein built a bridge between energy and mass two concepts that had previously seemed worlds apart maggie aderin pocock the space scientist declared it the most beautiful equation and she is in good company why is it so beautiful because it comes to life now energy will have mass and mass can be put into energy these four symbols capture a complete world its difficult to imagine a shorter formula with more power says robbert dijkgraaf director of the institute for advanced study in princeton where einstein was one of the first faculty members one of the reasons theres almost an objective beauty in mathematics is that we use the word beautiful also to indicate the raw power in an idea the equations or results in mathematics that are seen to be beautiful are almost like poems the power per variable is something that is part of the experience just seeing a huge part of mathematics or nature being described with just a few symbols gives a great sense of elegance or beauty dijkgraaf adds a second element is you feel its beauty is reflecting reality its reflecting a sense of order thats out there as part of the laws of nature the power of an equation to connect what seem like completely unrelated realms of mathematics comes up often marcus du sautoy a maths professor at oxford has more than a soft spot for riemanns formula published by bernhard riemann in the formula reveals how many primes exist below a given number where primes are whole numbers divisible only by themselves and one such as and while one side of the equation describes the primes the other is controlled by zeros this formula turns these these indivisible prime numbers into something completely different says du sautoy on the one side youve got these indivisible prime numbers and then riemann takes you on this journey to somewhere completely unexpected to these things which we now call the riemann zeros each of these zeros gives rise to a note and its the combination of these notes together which tell us how the primes on the other side are distributed across all numbers more than years ago the ancient greek mathematician euclid solved a numerical puzzle so beautifully that it still makes neale smile every time it comes to mind when i think about beauty in mathematics my first thoughts are not about equations for me its much more about an argument a line of thinking or a particular proof she says euclid proved there are infinitely many prime numbers how did he do it he began by imagining a universe where the number of primes was not infinite given a big enough blackboard one could chalk them all up he then asked what happened if all these primes were multiplied together x x and so on all the way to the end of the list and the result added to the number this huge new number provides the answer either it is a prime number itself and so the original list was incomplete or it is divisible by a smaller prime but divide euclids number by any prime on the list and always there is a left over the number is not divisible by any prime on the list it turns out you reach an absurdity a contradiction says neale the original assumption that the number of primes is finite must be wrong the proof for me is really beautiful it takes some thinking to get your head around it but it doesnt involve learning lots of difficult concepts its surprising that you can prove something so difficult in such an elegant way neale adds behind beautiful processes lie beautiful mathematics well some of the time hannah fry
for someone who made his career writing about and founding media organisations rafat ali is surprisingly downbeat about what they can achieve if anything the trump election has shown that we are ascribing too much value to what media can do he says a week after donald trumps victory it has its role it has to continue to do its role its even more important today but the view that it will somehow change the world and change peoples minds or give people the right path its just too much to ask hes not alone in doubting the extent of the established medias influence following an election result which almost no outlet predicted and very few supported but in the post election autopsy many commentators have said at least some of the blame should be laid at the door of facebook and its fake news filled filter bubbles ali shares their concerns particularly about the parallel world where people have no connection to reality in which many millions of us citizens appear to live just the fact of what they believe about muslims that hillary is doing this or obama is doing this its just crazy but he says many of the complaints from those working in tv or newspapers stem from an unrealistic belief in their own impact i think that while obviously this is a huge problem we are trying to get out of media way more than its capable of giving he says its not like if the majority of the media goes away or a big proportion of the media goes away that suddenly people are going to miss it ali has first hand experience of the impermanence of media from paidcontent his first company which lasted not much more than a decade he launched the site in taking what was then a relatively novel approach by applying lessons from one part of the media such as the recording industry to other areas such as newspapers which were grappling with the disruptive powers of the internet it was acquired in by guardian media group for an undisclosed sum in the millions of pounds it was run as a standalone business and ali stayed until before leaving to travel the world for two years in early gmg sold paidcontent to another digital media site gigaom which later that year shuttered the brand and itself closed in meanwhile ali had returned from his trip with a plan to apply paidcontents connecting the dots approach to the world of travel and in the summer of he launched a business called skift with travel journalist jason clampet while most of those writing about the travel industry were focused on one sector such as airlines or hotels ali based his plan on the realisation that travellers simply see an end to end process of getting around the world that seemed to leave a gap for a media organisation taking a more holistic approach while writing in a less stuffy more accessible way than the established trade press in the early days ali who operated as skifts chief executive planned to use the sites reporting as a foundation from which to sell data about travel starting with the way it was marketed online however things did not go to plan and while trying to drum up investment in he hit a brick wall i wasnt able to raise the round he says it was the most humbling six months of my professional career we were three months away from running out of money we were or people at that point we had a famous as in famous in our company moment when we went to iceland for our first off site it was a very seminal moment for us as it was supposed to be a celebration of us closing the round ali and the team tried to work out how to continue growing without any outside investment the answer was to drop plans to sell data and focus on more established ways of making money in skifts case research events and advertising two and a bit years later ali says the business is now profitable with double digit revenue growth heading for upwards of a year within the next months traffic is not huge around million visitors a month but skifts priority is its list of email subscribers which stands at more than the company now employs close to people mostly at its new york headquarters and is expanding into europe with hires such as a uk editor based in london though he chose to build his second company around travel ali did not stop wading into arguments about the travails of established media companies including the guardian he says most mainstream outlets are operating more like drive by media where you hope and pray you show up in a feed but he doesnt pretend to have all the answers i dont have a prescription for any of those people he says its hard always even in our business which is doing very well people say oh my god you guys are doing so well and i say yes then i look back thinking holy shit if they knew how hard it is to build a media company its always going to be hard and trumps victory is going to make things harder not just for the media but also the travel industry which ali says is facing a huge challenges from the insular ideologies that are taking over western politics i think trump has already said a lot of things that will enervate people coming to the us even if he does half the things he said it will have a bad effect on the travel industry his rhetoric stands directly opposite to what the promise of travel stands for the most progressive expression of human curiosity fringe is the new mainstream it is worrying for everyone especially for europe which sits at the centre of immigration issues is there
the autumn statement on wednesday will be the first time in years george osborne will be nowhere in sight for a major fiscal event there will be many who breathe a sigh of relief at that alone but his presence will be heavily felt not least as the budget last march contained a black hole as the decisions he had made for the previous six years started to catch up with him however it also poses the first major test for the new chancellor philip hammond i ask him a simple question will you genuinely change course on the economy it is a simple yes or no question but it defines the entire approach he takes to this years autumn statement if the brexit vote taught us anything it is that many people are demanding change the chancellor and the prime minister may want to blame brexit for our current economic plight but as a recent leaked treasury document shows the damage to public finances was done before the referendum brexit has simply exposed the fact that the last six years were wasted and that the tory economic policy they supported every step of the way has failed so many in our country the budget in march was a prelude to wednesday when the tories are set to fail by their own measure breaching their own fiscal targets set out in the conservative manifesto they said they would cap welfare spending and yet they have breached their own cap while punishing working families they said they would increase business investment with huge corporation tax giveaways but it is decreasing and companies are sitting on huge cash piles not investing yet most of all they have failed because they did not equip our economy for the challenges that brexit poses the tories have no answers to meet the task ahead last week i gave a speech in which i said we now need a positive approach to brexit let me be clear i will continue to oppose a hard tory brexit that is because the tories want to take a trump lite approach with a minuscule increase in infrastructure investment a pernicious immigration policy the destruction of workplace rights and environmental protections alongside a race to the bottom in taxes for the rich and in wages for the rest of us labour will oppose them every step of the way in parliament and insist on full accountability for their negotiating positions as a democrat i respect the referendum result not to do so would sow even deeper divisions within our society but that does not mean we cannot use the period of the brexit negotiations positively to work with our socialist social democrat and progressive friends in europe to construct a new relationship based upon solidarity co operation and democracy labour has long argued that there are aspects of current single market regulations that should be reformed the brexit negotiations provide an opportunity to work with european partners to advance those reforms such as state aid rules and enforced deregulation and privatisation labour will press the government to take up that opportunity we must move the debate on from the divisions of the referendum and bring people together we must look to the future not the past the tories have no more a plan for our economy than they do for brexit it is why their handling of the brexit negotiations has descended into a shambles and why theyre now making up deals factory by factory as the foreign secretary said it looks like a tory brexit will be a titanic success in addition they still put the rich ahead of the rest of us by making working families pay for the giveaways to a wealthy few for instance of the population are getting a tax cut worth a year on average while cuts to universal credit will leave more than two million families on average of a year worse off austerity was always a political choice not an economic necessity that is why we need an autumn statement that is on the side of working families and with polices that are equipping our economy for the future the autumn statement must meet labours three tests first we need a credible fiscal framework which is crucial not just for the public finances but also to help us to invest in our economy so we can create jobs and growth the government should target a balanced current budget five years ahead and separate capital expenditure from day to day spending to best do this they should replace the fiscal framework with labours fiscal credibility rule we would also set up a national investment bank with a regional banking network it would mean we could invest properly in our country and start to address regional inequality in contrast the governments commitment to the northern powerhouse has always been a media exercise just like the now forgotten big society the government is only paying lip service to people in the north of england but it cant continue to just re announce old schemes it needs to deliver on them the fact that only one in five projects in the infrastructure pipeline is in construction shows that the government has not been meeting its own promises the hull selby rail electrification plan has been cancelled in the last few weeks and the government is failing to commit seriously to develop for the north of england labour wants to set up a bank of the north so that we can channel the vital funding and investment that the region needs second we need actual support for those in work on low and middle incomes who will struggle as prices rise the chancellor can start by introducing a real living wage he needs to provide honest solutions to the childcare crisis furthermore he should reverse the giveaways to the wealthy and reverse those cuts such as universal credit and employment and support allowance to low and middle
i dont remember exactly how old i was when i first discovered but i was quite young maybe or i grew up in louisville kentucky and there was a wonderful independent bookstore in town a place called hawley cooke where since i was a bookish kid i spent pretty much every friday night this store had a section dedicated to lesbian and gay literature tucked away in a back corner and each time i went i would spend a few sweaty minutes there before i snatched a title and carried it to another part of the store to sit and read i have mixed feelings about lesbian and gay sections in bookstores now but it was a wonderful resource for the pre internet kid i was as a student in kentuckys public schools which means i wasnt getting much of a literary education i didnt have any idea what names to look for i chose books almost at random based on their titles i guess or their covers a method that led me to edmund white yukio mishima jeanette winterson baldwin its hard to overstate what those books meant growing up in the american south or the solace i took from them and from their vision of queer life as possessed of a measure of human dignity it didnt matter that that dignity was so often the dignity of tragedy it was still a kind of antidote to shame the whole novel is a kind of anatomy of shame of its roots and the myths that perpetuate it of the damage it can doshame is one of the central subjects of published in and recounting a tormented love affair in paris between the american narrator david and giovanni an italian bartender but thats not stating it strongly enough the whole novel is a kind of anatomy of shame of its roots and the myths that perpetuate it of the damage it can do and also of its arbitrariness since as rebuttal to any claim that shame might be some natural accoutrement of queerness the belief that lies at the heart of davids malaise the novel offers the fact of giovanni who seems immune to shame or at least to the shame that plagues david and it is this freedom that makes him available to the joy and love david finally believes men cant share with one another that was the balm of the book when i first read it the sense it gives that the tragedy it recounts is anything but inevitable the result not of some ineluctable dynamic of same sex desire but of the limitations of david a grievously damaged man i read again in college and once more after that several years later when i considered assigning it to my high school students in ann arbor michigan i read it again recently because i was asked to speak on it which i had been asked to do because it has often been referenced in discussions of my own novel i knew that i owed the book a great deal and its a debt im eager to acknowledge but i hadnt realised until this recent rereading which was also the first time i read the book as a novelist just how much i had learned from it i had never studied fiction before i wrote my first novel all of my education in craft was of this unconscious kind an imitation of things i admire in the books i love i remembered of course the narrative elements my book shares with james baldwins an american narrator abroad overcome by feeling that for all its force runs hot and cold desire wrangled with ambivalence but i was struck this time by formal and stylistic strategies i think i must have first encountered in the book i hadnt read henry james when i discovered and so i suspect this was the first time i had encountered a novelist tracking jamesian microclimates of feeling something baldwin does throughout the novel to great effect theres a marvellous moment just before david and giovanni meet when david moves through a crowd of men excited by the presence of the new bartender it was like moving into the field of a magnet or like approaching a small circle of heat but what i admire most in the book is its peculiarly lyrical conception of time the novel is framed by present tense scenes set at the end of the drama in the night before giovanni is going to be executed this frees baldwin from any of the sometimes clunky strategies of narrative withholding and suspense all of the books major plot points are declared in the first pages we know that david has abandoned giovanni we know that davids ex fiancee hella has returned to the united states we know that giovanni has been sentenced to die theres a strange kind of pleasure in disclosing so much of the story up fronttheres a strange kind of pleasure in disclosing so much of the story up front placing the point of telling here gives baldwin access to the entire narrative at every point allowing him to move freely back and forth across the entire timeline of the action on the first page of the book david casts forward into the future imagining the bus ride he will take to paris on the second he remembers meeting hella immediately after this first scene the book dives into the deep past of davids childhood this rather extraordinary freedom with time is put to very moving effect at several points in the novel perhaps most of all when in giving a sense of davids few happy weeks with giovanni baldwin both holds time in abeyance and allows us to track its passage he does this by means of a generalised flyover narration of a typical day morning noon and night that is interrupted by scenes in which we can hear the pleading of an increasingly agitated and perplexed
one day during his last year at primary school jon adams drew a picture of a street in portsmouth the city where he still lives the scene he drew had no people in it but its representation of everything else suggested a talent beyond his years the headteacher happened to see the picture and said he wanted to put it up in the schools entrance hall and that was an honour adams says particularly for someone who didnt think they were any good because theyd been told they werent any good every day adams was asked to write his name on the back an instruction that threw up a choice he had difficulties with writing and he knew his class teacher could be cruel if i asked for help i knew what he would say oh he cant even spell his own name what rubbish is that so i did it myself the teacher called adams to the front of the class i went up gave it to him he held it up in front of the class and then he tore it up he said hes spelled his name wrong hell never be anything this happened years ago in recent years adams has been treated for post traumatic stress disorder caused at least partly by that episode and how long it lived on not just in his memory but in his understanding of the world and his place in it the story says a lot about the inhumanity that was once rife in the british education system but it also shines light on what its like spending a lot of your life being not just misunderstood but routinely insulted someone telling you youre no good every day worms its way inside your head adams says inside you know youre all right so theres this conflict going on since april adams has known that he has asperger syndrome or to put it another way that he is autistic ten minutes online will tell you that adams condition comes down to a so called triad of impairments to do with social interaction communication and imagination or what some people call flexibility of thought although the fact that adams is a prolific artist suggests that in his case that last criterion might be misplaced since many diagnoses of autism have also included a range of sensory issues among them aversions to certain textures sounds smells and tastes as well as a deep dislike of sudden noise in adams case these seem to blur into a complex kind of synaesthesia he understands music as something he can touch and experiences the colour yellow as a profoundly unpleasant taste like mould adams sometimes talks about his condition in front of an audience and there is one question that always comes up it goes my sons eight he sits in his room all day he does lego he does complicated drawings he wont talk to anyone else how do i make him socialise well you dont hes made his world one day hell show it to you dont let him grow up thinking that the way hes thinking and what hes doing are faulty jon adams was formally diagnosed at the age of at an nhs clinic run as an offshoot of cambridge universitys autism research centre after he was referred there by his gp the initial spark had been a meeting with the centres founder and director simon baron cohen who had spoken with adams at the cheltenham literature festival adams had begun to realise what sat under a lot of his experiences at the time the biography that accompanied his work as an artist included the words probably autistic from may until june he worked as the research centres artist in residence immediately afterwards a specialist gave him his formal diagnosis a process that involved an interview and something akin to a questionnaire i got the letter through saying i scored out of autistic traits and i had aspergers adams says i meet baron cohen in a crowded starbucks near st pauls cathedral in london where he wryly comments on the mixture of chatter clattering cups and muzak for a lot of autistic people this would probably be hell and casts his mind back over the years he has been thinking about and researching autism he started working with six autistic children in a special unit in barnet north london in fifteen years later he set up the cambridge research centre two years after that in he opened a clinic dedicated to diagnosing autistic adults my son received a diagnosis aged three he had fixations with particular music or places traits i recognise in myselfthere was a growing awareness that autism wasnt just about kids he tells me i was receiving more and more emails saying my sons an adult but hes never fitted in might he have autism an adult couldnt go to a child and adolescent clinic so where were they meant to go if they went to a learning disability clinic and they had an iq above theyd be turned away so these people were like a lost generation that was a phrase i used a lot the national autistic society estimates that there are currently around people living with autism in the uk more than one in every of the population some of these people have learning disabilities some are what the medical vocabulary terms non verbal or unable to speak others are so called high functioning a sub group that includes those with asperger syndrome the condition named after the austrian paediatrician who in the worked with a group of

my boss is bullying me and undermining my confidence but what can i do about it my boss doesnt like me im not sure why and have given up trying to figure it out but its making my working life miserable she undermines me in front of the rest of the team interrupts with irrelevant asides when im trying to lead meetings leaves me out of meetings i should be included in and makes threats that i might lose my job or someone else more junior might lose theirs if i dont do some often irrelevant task i am desperate to leave but feel so undermined by her bullying favouritism and passive aggressive behaviour that i feel worthless useless and unemployable she likes to remind me that i am lucky to have a job i have worked here for years but now feel trapped in a vicious circle what should i do jeremy saysyou dont know why your boss doesnt like you and id be fairly certain she doesnt either shes a bully and bullies are irrational unhappy creatures who derive strange pleasure from humiliating others particularly in front of an audience some bullies achieve their ascendancy through force of personality your boss does it by abusing her seniority in saying this im not asking you to understand her let alone forgive her im saying something more important its the ultimate aim of bullies to intimidate their victims to such an extent that they begin to believe they somehow deserve to be bullied that they are inferior worthless beings and thats exactly whats happening to you you say you feel worthless useless and unemployable and yet you must know youre none of those things in the years youve worked in this place presumably before the arrival of this monster you will have been a confident competent contented person that is at heart who you still are so you must fight very hard not to succumb if she senses you have it will give her still further pleasure and shell even see it as in some way justifying her behaviour i would hope that those in authority will soon recognise the malign influence this person is having and will take steps to remove her but you cant wait for that you need to be deliberately consciously defiant defy your boss by looking at yourself in the mirror and promising yourself that you wont let her win then with all the old confidence that you can muster go out there and find yourself another job readers say keep a detailed log of all incidents and keep all relevant documents even post it notes my lawyer advised me this when i was in a similar situation it didnt stop me from having to leave but i got a much better deal because i had proof of everything aranzazu the only solution is to get out sad and unfair but sometimes life is like that but you can look for other jobs up hill and down dale with no time pressure as an aside once you start looking you will probably find the stress flows away you will have control of the situation captaingrey i was in this situation with a boss who continually described me as difficult to like a cold person impossible to get along with and i really sympathise in the end feeling i was on the verge of a nervous breakdown i simply quit i didnt have anything to go to but felt i had to for the sake of my health i had savings i could live on for six months a plan for low paid work if i couldnt find something else and an alternative plan for retraining in the longer term the day i walked out was one of the happiest of my life the relief was incredible and i felt much better about myself almost immediately in the end i got a job within a month its only in hindsight that i recognise just what a bad mental state id got myself into and i dread to think of the damage if i had stayed i know it is a risk and for some is financially impossible but if there is any way at all you can do it then get out join a union if you havent already and wait until you are entitled to representation keep a log including details of possible witnesses with the help of your union submit a grievance detailing what you are complaining about and what you would like your employer to do about it intermax my secondment is failing as im being denied the it training i desperately needi have recently been promoted to team leader the second rung of the in house managerial ladder i had been working towards this for a year before i finally got my opportunity its on secondment for two months and will get made permanent if it goes well i explained in my interview that although i have a basic knowledge of the in house computer systems i dont have the knowledge that the other team leader or the manager has since i have been promoted i have had to text or ring one of them each shift in order for help i explained that i wanted training and needed it to be able to do my job but have been told its going to be difficult to find the time now things are going wrong and i am unable to fix them there have been occasions where they havent answered the phone and ive been completely stuck and been reprimanded for it on the next shift if this continues i cant see the secondment being made permanent from either side as i dont want to take the job permanently if this is what is to come jeremy saysi suspect youre being just a little too polite and hesitant because you dont want to make a fuss or seem to be looking for
students at city university of london home to one of the countrys most respected journalism schools have voted to ban the sun daily mail and express from its campus the universitys student union voted to ban the newspapers at its annual general meeting on thursday night in a motion titled opposing fascism and social divisiveness in the uk media the motion said the titles have published stories that demonise refugees and minorities have posted islamophobic stories and all actively scapegoat the working classes they so proudly claim to represent it added that freedom of speech should not be used as an excuse to attack the weakest and poorest members of society and that the titles publish stories that are inherently sexist the motion while largely symbolic is embarrassing for the university which runs one of the uks top journalism programmes campaigners claim victory after lego stops daily mail promotions read moreless than of the universitys student population attended the meeting where the motion was passed to ban the newspapers in their current form the motion added that the ban could be extended to other media organisations with the sun daily mail and express titles merely used as high profile examples the students union said there was no place for the papers on campus or university properties although it was unclear how the ban would be enforced a number of journalism students are looking to pull out of the union in protest against the decision which they believe harms the universitys reputation many graduates go on to work at the sun mail and express titles in some capacity are they going to try and stop students carrying newspapers and will lecturers no longer be able to use or refer to them said one student speaking to the guardian the union has resolved to promote among the student body the active pressuring of the newspapers to cease to fuel fascism racial tension and hatred in society professor suzanne franks head of the department of journalism at city university said that students would continue to be allowed access to the three newspapers students on our journalism courses value being able to access the views of publications and broadcasters across the industry and the department will continue to enable all these opportunities she said we combine professional skills training with a concern for professional standards and the importance of fair impartial and ethical reporting is at the heart of our courses yusuf ahmad president of the city university student union said that the attendees at the meeting had debated and passed motions a number of motions passed are committing resources of the union and will need the further consideration of the board of trustees he said before commenting directly on the motion to ban the three newspapers the union is currently unaware of any outlets on campus selling the mentioned media publications as with all motions the union will be considering how it implements this index on censorship chief executive jodie ginsberg said the union should not be trying to dictate what students could read people should be free to choose what they read rather than banning things we should be encouraging people to voice their objections to views and opinions they dont like george brock former head of citys journalism department and current lecturer said the move was in his personal view foolish illiberal and meaningless the students in the class i was teaching today were furious and understandably so at gesture politics from a fraction of the student body he said they understand that the answer to journalism that you may not like is to do the journalism better during the meeting another motion titled why is my curriculum white was passed attacking the university as the primary motor in reproducing this ideology of whiteness the union has resolved to take an active role in decolonising the curriculum and start asking where are our black lecturers the student unions move follows the high profile campaigning group stop funding hate pressuring businesses to drop their commercial relationships with the same three newspapers because they run divisive hate campaigns last week lego announced it would not run any more promotional giveaways with the daily mail the danish toymaker which had been giving away free toys with the newspaper took the decision after the campaigning group took up the cause of british parent bob jones who had written to it raising concerns over its tie in with the newspaper which ran articles attacking the three high court judges who made a legal ruling on brexit earlier this month stop funding hate has also targeted companies including waitrose john lewis and marks spencer who have refused to withdraw their ads and the co operative group which has said it was reviewing its policy the match of the day presenter gary lineker has given his backing to the stop funding hate campaign and recently asked walkers crisps to reconsider advertising in the sunover its anti refugee stance lineker had tweeted his anger at newspaper coverage of the handful of child refugees who were brought into britain from calais last month the sunresponded by labelling lineker a jug eared leftie luvvie and calling for the bbc to sack him he tweeted brick by brick with a link to the campaign the sun has previously been boycotted by numerous student unions over its now dropped topless page three images however debates over free speech on campus have extended well beyond newspapers in january online publication spiked released its latest free speech rankings for universities finding that of institutions were carrying out some form of censorship up from a year earlier concerns have been raised over attempts to no platform speakers with views deemed unacceptable to segments of the student body as well as attempts to create safe spaces within universities where criticism is discouraged however students groups have argued that those studying have a right to do so in an environment where they are protected from persecution and abuse
it took several months and a little help from some dancing clowns for juju on that beat to become a viral meme it started off as the tz anthem challenge in which kids had to replicate the dance moves performed in a video clip made by year old zay hilfigerrr set to music that he had co written by the end of this summer everyone from seven year olds in snapback caps to teenage girls in sumo suits had filmed themselves taking up the challenge and it took atlantic records just five days to turn tz anthem into juju on that beat a tune that could make both them and the songs creators a whole lot of money the song which borrows its beat from crime mobs knuck if you buck and whose chorus is a series of playful dance instructions was written in a few idle moments by hilfigerrr and year old zayion mccall juju on that beat juju on that beat its hook demands using a term the pair made up after taking inspiration from recently coined dance moves like the whip and nae nae now slide drop hit dem folks dont stop aye running man on that beat they uploaded the song to youtube with an accompanying dance video where it caught the attention of fresh the clowns a dance troupe from detroit with an impressive social media following once their version of the dance began to gain traction high school junior hannah talliere followed suit with a video tweet that has since between retweeted more than times from there the song and the challenge blew up facebook twitter pinterest thats the short version for young people who engage with viral trends on a daily basis to explain its trajectory in this way is completely unnecessary for those who do not the whole thing can sound like another language one that the music industry is scrambling to learn i emailed hilfigerrr and mccall a few questions their answers were about as cheerfully brief as you might expect from a couple of teenagers with far better things to be doing we wrote it for fun they reply when i ask if the idea of becoming a viral meme was in their minds when the song came about and what i ask was more important in making it go viral the song or the dance both are very important in other words they are not particularly interested in dissecting the intricacies of viral fame or overthinking something that they created for their own amusement as far as hilfigerrr and mccall are concerned it just is the business side the ability to take notice of and commodify a type of music which now moves faster than ever is down to the record label that snapped them up when the pair were signed by atlantic records the song was not even available to download within five days of them signing on the dotted line it was up on itunes it soon reached no on the billboard hot and it is now slowly climbing the uk charts entering the top last friday more startling are the online stats the track itself with no video uploaded by mccall has had nearly youtube views while the official video has had nearly but the real proof of its reach lies in the challenge videos the dancing clowns have had more than views a compilation of people dancing has had nearly views a four year old dancing to the track on the ellen show has had views scores more videos have topped the million view mark meanwhile at the time of writing juju on that beat has had just short of plays on spotify facebook twitter pinterest juju on that beat is the latest in a string of songs to have become memes in the last few years some such as finatticzs dont drop that thun thun went viral several years after the tracks initial release in that instance the songs sudden surge in popularity was down to a twerking trend on vine the recent demise of which may have lasting repercussions for the way memes spread then there is silentos watch me the track that inspired the irreverence of juju on that beat like hilfigerrr and mccalls release it featured catchy lyrics and a distinctive imitatable dance and its video has had more than a billion views on youtube the biggest memes such as harlem shake become inescapable recreated by sports teams and celebrities if catchy lyrics and copyable dance moves were enough to spawn a meme record companies would have been able to churn out viral hit after viral hit but it is not that simple if someone or some entity can crack that code and harness the power of memes says shontavia jackson of drake university iowa who has published award winning articles on memetic theory they could unlock the ability to reach millions of people social media entities may be countering some of this with their new algorithms and methods of disseminating content but viral information may be impossible to contain rebecca black certainly has no idea why friday the song and video her mother paid a record label a modest sum to produce in late went viral aged at the time black was thrust into a sea of vitriol and mockery peppered with the occasional show of enthusiasm for what was essentially a harmless earworm in the space of just a few days friday has now had more than views on youtube and more than dislikes for black being part of a viral meme was never the intention nor was it an easy wave to ride i was just too young to really process it she says putting on a brave face and acting as if i was totally ok was the only way i knew how to cope with it i can see now how tough it was

political echo chambers obama said that we live in an age with so much active misinformation that is packaged very well and looks the same whether its on facebook or on tv if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made then we wont know what to protect we wont know what to fight for and we can lose so much of what weve gained in terms of the kind of democratic freedoms and market based economies and prosperity that weve come to take for granted he said these comments come after facebook ceo mark zuckerberg rejected the crazy idea that fake news on the social network

in some ways it should not come as a shock given the horrific stories that have already poured forth from the media showbusiness and music industries about institutionalised abuse of children in the and early but we may never become inured to the numbing dizzying dislocation that has been prompted by andy woodwards startlingly brave disarmingly matter of fact account of how his childhood was stolen by a convicted paedophile football coach employed by crewe alexandra and several other clubs during the and to read woodwards account is to be reminded that this was likely to have been no isolated case and that there are likely to be more perpetrators and others possibly many others who were similarly affected it is naive to think that football with its similar cocktail of glamour ambition power and opportunity could not also be a breeding ground for those wanting to prey on boys who would do almost anything to make it as a professional andy woodward it was the softer weaker boys he targeted read moreindividual heartbreaking cases down the years act as a reminder of the particular risks in sport where young charges are entrusted to coaches with huge power over them for long periods of time the risk has been perceived as particularly acute in individual sports such as swimming and athletics but woodward by waiving his anonymity reminds us that there may yet be another grim chapter as yet unexamined in one of english footballs darkest periods among the many disturbing things about woodwards account is his assertion that barry bennells reputation was common knowledge around a club with a hard won and longstanding reputation within the game for youth development but no questions were asked visit any of the shiny multimillion pound academies that now proliferate at premier league clubs and which hoover up hundreds of kids every year from the age of five and six and it is harder to believe that a paedophile could operate in plain sight at that level child protection systems are in place and todays academies are in some ways more like schools in terms of the environment they offer and the professional structures in place the football association in one of the many important jobs it does beneath the visible tip of the iceberg on to which is crammed the fa cup and the soap opera of the national side has a child safeguarding unit that oversees a pyramid of paid and voluntary personnel across all affiliated clubs at youth level all involved believe it would be harder for a bennell to operate with such impunity today but that does not mean it could not happen when bennells name first emerged as being linked with child sex offences in a channel dispatches in the fa did not even have a proper screening programme for grassroots football a glance at the copious material on the fas website is testament to how much has changed yet that should not lead to any complacency if anything woodwards decision to tell his story must be an urgent call to arms not only as he hopes in giving others similarly affected during that era the courage to come forward but also in forcing football to look in the mirror and assess whether it is equipped to properly face up to what may have gone on in the past and ensure that it cannot happen again in the future that extends to everything from fully backing schemes put in place by the professional footballers association which runs hour helplines for current and former players to continuing to support sporting chance the clinic founded by tony adams and peter kay who died in has sadly never been busier in helping former players tackle a range of demons there will be those in football who say it is wrong to turn up too many stones wrong to cast aspersions too widely they will point to the balance between the horrors unearthed by operation yewtree on the one hand and on the other the collapse of operation midland the question marks over which highlight the dangers of a scattergun approach that sprays suspicion in all directions but if woodwards bravery is not to be in vain football owes it to all those who might have been affected to provide a mechanism and a framework for them now to come forward and tell their stories laying the groundwork for any criminal prosecutions that may follow there is another eternal lesson for football in all this woodward also talks about the that exists within the dressing room walls and how hard it can be to break beyond that neil warnock sad and sickened to hear of abuse suffered by andy woodward read morethroughout those years at crewe so many people used to talk about it other players would say directly to my face i bet he does this to you we know he does that there was all that dressing room bravado then outside the club it was never discussed he said thats how football worked back then we can talk about it within these walls but we keep it watertight and it doesnt go any further nobody wanted to break that circle of trust whether that was a product of the times a symptom of the fact that the subject of child abuse could at times be treated with a kind of awkward nonchalance that now seems completely alien or still persists in football today is a subject for debate what is unarguable is that dressing room culture remains a powerful force often positive sometimes benign too often toxic on all sorts of issues from sexuality to race the pressure to fit in and not to rock the boat can be overwhelming none of this should spark a moral panic but given the disparate patchwork nature of the thousands of sports clubs strung across the country it should act as a reminder if it was needed of the responsibility on all of
chess has dropped almost completely from the public eye in the four decades since bobby fischer and boris spassky waged their cold war proxy battle in reykjavik this months world chess championship match in new york city will do little to reverse that course despite the organizers best intentions but early returns suggest the taut showdown between champion magnus carlsen and challenger sergey karjakin may not be as straightforward as initially suspected it marks the first time new york has played host to a world title match since when garry kasparov retained his title against viswanathan anand on the floor observatory deck in the south tower of the world trade center for the past week carlsen and karjakin have faced off in a sound proof studio within a sleek purpose built arena on the third floor of the fulton market building only four blocks east from where the towers once stood a one way mirror allows spectators to watch the players in action by themselves save for two silent arbiters lending a terrarium like feel to the spectacle prices range from for general admission to for vip lounge access where ticket holders can suck down vodka cocktails and rub elbows with grandmasters financiers and the odd celebrity woody harrelson an avid player himself spent most of the first two days taking challenges from passers by on the outdoor balcony overlooking the east river while carlsen and karjakin faced off inside the best of games match began on friday with each contestant awarded one point for a win and a half point for a draw so far carlsen and karjakin have drawn all four games theyve played and enter thursdays fifth meeting deadlocked at all whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion earning the winners share of a roughly prize fund inside the brain of the man who would be of chess read morecarlsen who is was already regarded as the worlds best player even before he saw off anand for the championship in chennai three years ago and is the closest thing to a star in the sport today hes done ads for porsche modeled for g star raw alongside liv tyler and lily cole and enjoys a massive presence in his native norway where nrk is broadcasting the games in prime time he is handsome and media trained perhaps overly so giving off the air of an unthreatening playboy his peak rating of is the highest in history a point frequently cited by those who have called him the greatest player ever karjakin earned the right to challenge for the title in march by making it through the candidates tournament in moscow where he defeated a series of higher ranked opponents among them brooklyns fabiano caruana he was born in ukraine where he became an international grandmaster at years old but adopted russian citizenship in he is married with a son an avowed supporter of vladimir putin and the invasion of crimea and speaks with a stutter that surfaces more in english than his native tongue he is ranked ninth in the world karjakin is a player in the classical mold known for his resilience carlsen is known for his adaptability which enables a flair for the unpredictable not commonly seen among top players carlsen has practically no weaknesses the russian said at last weeks pre match press conference before more than one hundred credentialed media any expectations of the political intrigue and paranoia associated with the sports golden age were not disappointed israel gelfer the vice president of the world chess federation spoke on behalf of the governing body only because fide president kirsan ilyumzhinov was barred from entering the country due to his ties to the syrian government and the central bank of syria at one point carlsen fielded a question over the rumors that hed enlisted microsoft for cybersecurity consultation over concerns karjakins team were trying to hack his preparations no fewer than two questions were posed about fischer spassky never mind that carlsen and karjakin were years away from being born when thematch of the century took place this time around in new york the chess eventually went off no doubt to the organizers relief and it didnt take long for the first surprise carlsen handling the white pieces played the seldom used trompowsky attack in fridays first game a seldom used opening hed later confess was at least partially inspired by the name of americas newly minted president elect the norwegian played fast and it seemed like hed outprepared his rival but karjakin managed to scratch back to force a mostly forgettable draw after moves karjakin played the far more familiar ruy lopez in saturdays second game prompting a morphy defense from carlsen that also ended in a draw this time on the move after sundays rest day the players reconvened for game a white knuckler of a contest that saw karjakin recover from a misstep on his move before defending brilliantly as carlsen tried to press his advantage and draw first blood but after seven tense excruciating hours karjakin managed to salvage a draw when the champion missed a move in the endgame that would have assured checkmate moments later they agreed to a draw after moves that left a short turnaround for the following days game where karjakin recovered yet again to force a move marathon that ended in another draw and kept the match level the resilience that carlsen had praised on the eve of the match has proven the critical talking point as the match enters the middle act sergey has studied the game very well is very knowledgeable and most of all hes extremely resilient in defense hes very very good in finding resources even in difficult positions finding positions he can defend for me its a matter of when i get the chance ill try to punch him until he finally knocks over it seems inevitable that carlsens blows will find their
in his first televised interview as president elect donald trump gave a glimpse into his plans for large scale deportations he suggested his administration would initially target million undocumented immigrants for removal people who he branded criminals gang members drugs dealers but even a cursory analysis of trumps target number of deportations shows that he will have to deport far more than undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes the incoming trump administration will try to implement the harshest immigration regime in presidential history with his closest advisers making clear they will seek to expedite these deportations and those deported are likely to include a far greater number of those who have lived in the us for years perhaps experts warn even those who are in the us on temporary visas or green cards the us already deports vast numbers of undocumented immigrants during the first six years of his tenure barack obama deported two and a half million people under the guise of ridding the us of criminals gang bangers and people who are hurting the community obamas rhetoric was somewhat misleading a new york times investigation found that two thirds of those deported by the administration by had only minor criminal convictions or none at all this underlies the impossibility of trumps pledge there simply are not enough people who match his description as serious criminals to deport and many speculate the targets he wants to reach will mean not only dramatically broadening the scope of deportations to meet targets but also seriously curtail any oversight within the system its important to point out that obama was actively trying to deport a record number of people and even he hit two and a half million over two terms said grace meng a senior immigration researcher at human rights watchs us program so the idea of to million whether its immediately or even within a couple of years would require a system that really defies our imagination of what a fair system might be in the absence of official data the migration policy institute estimates about of the roughly million undocumented migrants living in america are likely to have a criminal conviction with only projected to hold a felony conviction since november the obama administration has actively targeted this cohort of individuals they have drastically reduced the number of interior deportations those involving apprehensions that occur away from the border and usually involve individuals who have lived in the us for years by activating a priority enforcement program this program sees immigration and customs enforcement ice agents prioritise undocumented arrestees picked up by state or local law enforcement who are found to have serious felonies gang affiliations or terror suspicions but even under this new policy ice data obtained under the freedom of information act by researchers at the university of iowa and reported here for the first time highlights that a tiny fraction of total deportations in involved individuals convicted of a violent crime while were deported with no recorded criminal history at all to get to to million will mean a dramatic rewriting of who or what is a criminalprofessor karthick ramakrishnan uc riversideto get to to million deportations will mean a dramatic rewriting of who or what is a criminal and rewriting that definition in a way that involves acts most americans would not consider to be a crime said professor karthick ramakrishnan an immigration researcher at the university of california riverside and author of framing immigrants it would also mean considering not just undocumented immigrants but people here who are on temporary visas or green cards that have committed minor crimes like shoplifting or dui trumps advisers have now acknowledged their net will need to widen and have started explaining that the administration will seek to deport not just convicted criminals but also those accused of a crime or gang affiliation as well as those charged with minor immigration violations such as illegal re entry some have argued that trumps new immigration regime could simply use the tools left over from the so called deportation machines created by both the bush and obama administrations but the sheer scale of trumps project and the perceived desire to act quickly will probably require legislative action through congress to enhance and expand the effectiveness of these devices in august trump pledged to restore the secure communities program the precursor to the priority enforcement program which was utilised by both the bush and obama administration until the program allowed federal authorities to conduct broader less targeted sweeps of undocumented arrestees held by local authorities and allowed ice agents to request that local jails detain suspects past their release date in order to allow more time to transfer them to federal detention facilities in the same speech trump also pledged to expand agreements between ice and local law enforcement which allow local police officers to carry out certain functions of immigration law enforcement directly ice reportedly credited these partnerships with identifying more than potentially removable aliens between and according to politifact but local law enforcement officials most notably the maricopa county sheriffs office in arizona were routinely criticized for discriminatory policing and as a result the obama administration substantially rolled back their use in trumps promise to expand or reinstate both these programs is a strong indication the new administration will significantly intensify interior deportations but these removals have markedly declined since obama entered office from in to last year as the outgoing administration particularly in its second term focused on deportations at the border many of which occur through an expedited removal process that requires no hearing in court this sharpening of the interior deportation machine will leave a number of institutions in the crosshairs for reform said conservative analysts close to trumps transition team first the trump administration will probably focus on streamlining civil immigration proceedings in court said dan stein president of the federation for american immigration reform the different kinds of changes that would be made in

around our town and shot off to join the loop that collects commuters from all the main commuter towns and takes them to london it must be some computer system that efficiently sorts passengers going to the same place into carriages and accelerates them alongside the commuter loop so they can slot seamlessly into an empty carriage space without it slowing down i only bought an economy ticket my boarding would have been faster had i booked a larger single carriage but i had no need they are subsidised for the physically impaired i had booked a ticket to london on my smartphone so when i was close to london the route on my phone detailed that i was soon to decelerate off the commuter loop to be parked in a tram station however the next carriage was travelling further afield and i saw it accelerate onto the main loop that takes passengers around the whole country marvellous virtual reality tele work liam mullenthe future of transport is virtually around the corner trains tubes and

collective consciousness socialised fleet of self driving electric cars john robertthe economic and ecological rationale for the present use of cars is weak they spend the majority of the time idle and are typically used by single occupants optimally cars would be active and full for the maximum amount of time up to that necessary for their maintenance recharging and cleaning under this model cars congestion and pollution would all be significantly reduced this can be realised by a socialised fleet of self driving electric cars within modern cities comprised of the following elements integrated into existing road transport systems the hailing of cars through apps and appropriately distributed machines a coordinating algorithm with three key inputs extant arrival destination requests expected arrival destination requests and car pit stops at given intervals routes based on these data points would maximise average travel time while guaranteeing that no journeys fell below a set minimum travel time the data on which expected requests can be mapped is effectively self generating a product of past request meta data a control hub which observes the system in real time to modify the coordinating algorithm in response to emergencies traffic and aberrational system use while updating users via social media and apps pits for the regular recharging cleaning and maintenance

jrgen klopp has defended wayne rooneys late night socialising and described this generation of footballers as the most professional the game has seen all the legends we love and admire drank like devils and smoked like crazy the liverpool manager claimed who once wore a santa claus mask to avoid photographers on a christmas night out nights out aside wayne rooney is not fit enough for southgates england barney ronay read moreklopp offered support and sympathy for the manchester united captain after he apologised unreservedly to the football association for being photographed at a wedding reception in the early hours of sunday rooney along with the rest of the england squad had been given time off by gareth southgate following the world cup qualifying win against scotland on friday night and had also been told he would not start the friendly against spain on tuesday the fa has reminded rooney of his responsibilities as england captain and is reviewing its policy of giving players free time on international duty after allegations of drinking but klopp believes there has been a huge over reaction to photographs of rooney at the wedding reception and it is unreasonable to demand a monastic lifestyle from footballers at all times what i can say is i feel really for the players klopp said i know were all on the sunny side of life we earn a lot of money and do the job we love but at the end maybe it comes as a surprise that we are also human beings too sometimes were invited to weddings birthdays or whatever and we can play the professional role still no we dont drink or if you smoke please stand yards away because i dont want to be a passive smoker that is not how life works this generation is the most professional generation of footballers not only in england but england has ever had all the guys all the legends we love and admire drank like devils and smoked like crazy but they were still good players no one does it any more i dont know anyone now we had a christmas party after losing against watford in december last year and i had to fill peoples glasses its about timing when you are in the wrong time at the wrong place and its not good as a professional i have no idea where wayne was but im pretty sure its not really serious it is the not nice part of our life our life sounds like a big catastrophe when things are not perfect but its not like that sometimes it is good to have a situation like this you can fine the player and do something good with the money for the team or the kit man or whoever klopp suffered a similar experience to rooney when manager of mainz in his team were bottom of the bundesliga at the christmas break and having been persuaded to join his friends on a night out klopp came up with a novel idea to avoid being photographed or so he thought the liverpool manager recounted we had points and we were last in the bundesliga table we had a christmas break and friends of ours wanted to have a party in the city nobody could see it was me because i had a mask on a santa claus mask i didnt feel too good but i needed a little bit of help and i went out i did it then there comes a point when you are a little bit drunk so i lifted the mask and the next thing there is a picture the next day bild printed the picture and said that is how klopp celebrates being it was not that i celebrated but that was the picture it happens and you go on it is not really big the photographs of rooney appeared at a time when the player is struggling to retain his place for club and country but the liverpool manager insisted the united captain is not the only player to drink on a day off from my point of view i dont know much about it but i am pretty sure it is nothing the german national team were in rome and i saw some pics of them in a restaurant they had no glass in their hand but do you say they didnt drink thats how it is we live life under a glass we know it most of the time and we function but sometimes not in one two three weeks no one will remember what happened so why make a big thing of it klopps thoughts were echoed by the everton manager ronald koeman who has spoken to his captain phil jagielka after he was photographed on the night out with rooney but believes the bigger problem is social media i spoke to phil this morning not only about this but about other aspects of football koeman said he was there and he had a drink but it was after the match and the behaviour of phil was not bad everyone has to understand how dangerous social media is you have to always be an example to young people as a football professional but that is my opinion in general it happened more years ago than it does now but there was not social media then liverpool visit southampton on saturday seeking to extend their lead at the top of the premier league but could be without adam lallana after he sustained a groin injury in englands draw with spain it will be close klopp said the liverpool manager also insisted he had no concerns that philippe coutinhos head could be turned by frequent reports in spain linking him with a move to barcelona the in form brazil international claimed klopp is content with the direction liverpool are heading and will only improve at anfield he said the club is not a problem our owners are not
patrickas the old saying has it good cheap fast pick any two this is particularly true for windows laptops where dozens of companies are competing mainly on price things are different for apple as the only supplier of macbooks it can do what it likes this includes doing things its users dont like such as soldering ssd and memory chips to motherboards and dropping magsafe sd slots and standard usb ports from its latest macbook pros this would be suicidal in the windows market where buyers can switch suppliers in seconds of course different users want different things so the big suppliers lenovo dell hp asus acer etc have different ranges for different market segments dell for example makes three ranges for consumers three ranges for business users and the vostro range for the soho market it therefore caters to budget price sensitive buyers prestige quality conscious buyers and performance oriented pro buyers macbooks dont fit this kind of scheme theyre over engineered consumer laptops with enough performance for most professional purposes not many windows laptop manufacturers can charge pro prices for consumer designs though microsoft is having a go as a result you will have to compromise however you can find windows laptops that are comparable to macbooks in many respects but cheaper just look for the various prestige consumer ranges such as dells xps hps spectre and asuss zenbook apple pricesapple has just released new macbook pro laptops there are three versions of the macbook pro with intel core processors and of memory at and there are also new macbook pros with core processors and of memory for and all prices include vat but not port adaptors or applecare support you havent given me a budget but halving apples cheapest new macbook pro prices would suggest a range of to this is in the same ballpark as the survivors from the old ranges macbook airs at and plus the macbook at which i assume you will also consider laptop optionsthe dell xps and are the most obvious alternatives to macbooks unfortunately they are at the top of this price range you can still get an old model xps for but that has a core with only of memory the latest version has a core of memory and a ssd for if you go for a ssd at youre only saving on a new macbook pro the dell xps is better value you get a core of memory nvidia geforce gtx graphics with of video memory and a ssd for it has a thunderbolt port two usb ports hdmi and an sd card slot its also small and light for a machine with a screen it measures x and weighs this compares with x and for the new thinner and lighter macbook pro which costs more hps spectre range offers similar features to dells xps range except that all the laptops have touch screens that you can rotate to enable tent or tablet operation the cheapest model is the hp spectre this has a screen a core processor of memory and a ssd for you can upgrade to an hp spectre with better screen resolution x instead of x plus a core and ssd for again this is not much cheaper than a macbook pro yet again the hp spectre is better value for only more you get a screen a core with intel iris graphics of memory and a ssd in a machine even at its still cheaper than the new macbook pro cheaper and cheaperyou could also look at the lenovo thinkpad which is a robust professional laptop that starts at the main attraction is that you can customise it from a menu with a huge range of options you could get one with a core of memory nvidia geforce with a ssd and windows home for and that includes three years of on site service upgrading the second battery from to would add another upgrading the ram to would add upgrading the cpu to a core would add the asus zenbooks may also appeal because of their apple style aluminium unibody construction though theyre really aimed at macbook and macbook air users the zenbook with a x screen core of memory and ssd is good value at pc world has the similar for and you can find many other models if you shop around possibly the cheapest just about viable option is the lenovo ideapad which is a step down from the zenbooks all the various models have x pixel screens and of memory the cheapest on lenovos website has a core and a ssd for while the most expensive has a core and a ssd for however john lewis has a silver one with a core for so that might be worth a look of course there are hundreds of cheaper windows laptops starting at less than it just depends how far you are willing to drop your standards chips cost money so below a certain point price reductions may be coming from compromises on the quality of the case keyboard trackpad and screen if they break you just buy another why not a desktop you mention that youre open to either a laptop or a desktop if so you could get more power and better ergonomics by buying a desktop i covered this last week in which desktop pc should i buy for working from home if you went for a lenovo thinkcenter you would have many of the same options as when configuring a thinkpad laptop you would also be able to add your own upgrades immediately or after another five years or whatever if you dont need to replace your laptop in a hurry you could wait to see whether apple brings out a new version of the mac mini next year the current model was launched in and hasnt been updated for more than two years its not really expandable the memory is soldered in and not very good value but
a man who uses misogynistic language and has been accused of sexual assault is soon to become the president of the united states of america for feminists desperate to see the countrys first female president the result was devastating how could someone with such disregard for womens rights become leader donald trump boasted about being able to freely grope women because he is famous and by the end of the race different women had come forward to accuse him of sexual assault he also suggested during his campaign that women should face some form of punishment for having abortions before backtracking and saying states and congress should take the lead with lawmaking on this matter after the publication of a video in which he describes grabbing women by the pussy experts and many non experts predicted that hed lost the female vote but this turned out to be incorrect it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their actionslauraaccording to cnn exit polls of white women voted for trump those without a college degree supported trump over democrat candidate hillary clinton by nearly two to one white women with a college degree only narrowly voted in favour of clinton by six percentage points by contrast of black women and of latinas voted for clinton some feminists are finding it difficult to comprehend why women werent so offended by trumps misogyny that they voted for clinton en mass we interviewed women across america to find out why they voted for trump and why they describe themselves as feminists heres what they said laura a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or expected she thinks and makes her own choicesgovernment worker laura who lives in the much fought over state of florida voted for trump she describes herself as socially moderate financially independent and educated every female i know either friends or co workers except for one voted for trump i want to show it was not only men or non college educated citizens that voted trump i am an economic conservative who is registered as a non party affiliate i feel that trump has the best economic polices to create jobs and therefore rebuild the economy i truly thought the video of trump was as its been dubbed locker room talk having two brothers boyfriends and a fiance i can make an educated guess that all heterosexual men have bragged about their exploits with women to another man at some point i believe in equality between the sexes i have the right and capability to make my own decisions and live the life i choose for myself because i am a feminist i know and exercised my right not to be put in a box or voting group and to freely think and make my own judgment as to who i thought would be the best candidate for president it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their actions a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or expected she thinks and makes her own choices i thought the sexual allegations were unsubstantiated and therefore equivalent to rumours and campaign mudslinging if these women had truly been assaulted why wait until one month before the election to come forward to the press not the authorities i thought it incredibly hypocritical to characterise him as a sexual predator when we know for a fact that bill clinton is one and hillary helped him cover it up through libel and slander of the women who did come forward this didnt change my opinion about him except for maybe a more sympathetic attitude and feeling that the media was treating him unfairly a persons gender has no bearing whatsoever in their qualifications for a job including the presidency hillary was not clear as to what her policies as president would be except to maybe continue with the same failed practices her policies would not have helped our depressed and stagnant economy i believe trumps plans for job creation benefits everyone including minority groups i also ascribe and have for a long time to a more isolationist foreign policy alyssa im not going to vote for somebody because of their gender or race trump voter alyssa a mother of two boys who is currently not employed calls herself a feminist on most things but she is fiercely opposed to voting for someone based on gender alone instead she backed trump who shares her own beliefs including not raising taxes her home state of ohio a mix of rust belt big city appalachia farmland and suburbs more white and less educated than the national mean voted for trump at some things i would be a feminist but it doesnt mean i vote for someone because she has a vagina ive always voted republican and always support the party they pushed a female candidate through to break the glass ceiling of a perceived gender equality biasheatherat the end of the day the video of trump did not affect my support for him what he says and what he does dont matter in those senses because im looking for somebody that has the same beliefs as i do in running a country at the end of the day were all sinners and we all say things like this it isnt uncommon we act like the president of united states should be some holy person we can go through all the us presidents and you will see sexual dysfunctions in all of their personal lives even hillarys husband had an affair at the end of the day my husbands sex life does not involve his work life and my sex life does not involve my day to day life these women that came out about trump could have been hoping for media attention or maybe just simply paid by hillary to make her criminal issues look

zealand herald what happened was there was a bit of a discussion between my office and his office on the saturday about a call we werent strictly sure when
lets suppose for a minute that the trump transition has some organizing principle beyond the chaotic conflicting impulses of a megalomaniac what do the first two appointments of president elect trump as well as the first week of his transition to power tell us about his forthcoming reign at first blush trump seems to have squared two competing desires with reince priebus as his chief of staff trump is placating and controlling his own party now ruling both sides of capitol hill the rnc chairman is perfectly plugged into the messy politics of the republican leadership with steve bannon as his chief strategist trump is placating the pitchfork mob that helped sweep him to power bannons role inside any organization is traditionally the keeper of the ideological flame in case anyone was still confused about trumps ideology bannon is chairman of breitbart a sewer of racist and sexist excrement but nothing in trumpistan is that neat in the brief time the great orange leader has presided over the semi public enterprise of his presidential campaign we know he has a track record of tolerating the kind of internal rivalry that ends up in ritual slaughter his first campaign manager corey lewandowski warred openly with his second campaign manager paul manafort and the same goes for the third and fourth people to fill those roles kellyanne conway and steve bannon himself chaos is trumps coin of the realm the only complex situation he seems to manage with some consistency are his tax avoidance schemes the bannon priebus announcement was carefully constructed with bannons appointment ahead of priebus such formalities do not go unnoticed in the corridors of power of the nations capital where the pecking order is the only game in town of the two bannon is by far the superior operator having turned breitbart from a cult into a powerhouse of white nationalism needless to say this is not a positive development for an immensely diverse nation with a long history of racial violence priebus for his part has shown his house of cards talent by staging the coup that ousted his former boss michael steele priebus seized the job of rnc chair just after steeles rnc swept the board in the mid term elections but with no experience in the executive or legislative branches of government priebus is hopelessly out of his depth at best hes a party hack who will follow the orders of his friends on capitol hill at worst hell drown as he attempts to manage the west wing the federal bureaucracy national security crises washington politics the venal media and a president who has returned to twitter all of which makes him easy pickings for bannon who is offensive in every sense of the word according to sworn testimony by his ex wife bannon is so virulently antisemitic that he insisted he didnt want his girls going to school with jews not for nothing as the anti defamation league gone public with its opposition to his appointment the coming bannon priebus cage fight is only one side of the struggle for power inside the administration for the real influence lies in the hands of trumps children and son in law already jared kushner husband to ivanka has reportedly ousted the head of the transition the hapless and gormless new jersey governor chris christie ostensibly christies downfall was because he is embroiled in the scandal known as bridgegate but the proceedings about the closure of the george washington bridge have been rumbling for three years a more likely scenario is that christie could not be trusted with such a powerful transition job because he presided as us attorney in new jersey over the prosecution of kushners father blood is so much thicker than water especially inside trump tower with so many competing fiefdoms the trump presidency has already sown the seeds of its own chaos can these people successfully navigate their way out of a paper bag never mind the confirmation process that could doom their own administration in case people have forgotten with full control of congress and at the height of his popularity the newly elected president obama stumbled repeatedly with nominees whose tax returns were questionable and who seemed too cozy with corporate power perhaps president trump can help his nominees dodge their tax questions by ordering the irs to audit them all as quickly as possible as for his desire to drain the swamp of corporate influence those promises are now being managed by a small army of lobbyists who control his transition how clueless is team trump according to the wall street journal they had no idea the entire west wing would evacuate on inauguration day next year that they would have to appoint every single member of staff except for the permanent help tending to the building and grounds as a result president obama intends to spend more time helping his successor understand the scale of what hes about to take on the first black president is going to help train the white president whose campaign was built on questioning his own citizenship obama started his presidency winning the nobel peace prize but he ends it deserving some kind of sainthood like all good shakespearean tragedies the trump presidency is presaging its own collapse at the height of its glory the priebus bannon family disputes will corrode the west wing from within they are the manifestation of a leader who projects certainty but cannot decide if he wants to repeal all of obamacare or keep parts of it if he wants to end abortion rights or force women to travel to get abortions if he wants to bring the country together or end the wave of racist intimidation that is being spray painted across our schools and churches the republican establishment may think they can manage trump through priebus but they are about to discover that this dumpster fire of a campaign just turned into a brushfire of a transition
guardian contributor susancalman november everyone for taking part in this webchat if you take nothing from this experience please remember the following things number one number two grey anatomy is brilliant number three being emotional is fine number four things will get better see you soon orkney mrszombie asks guardian contributor susancalman november think that was because of the show i was doing rather than fear of standup i tend to do shows that are about something and can get quite emotional sometimes people are frightened of emotion i am not i cry quite a lot almost constantly in fact crying right now always the kind of standup who will show how they feel about things that is not a sign of weakness to me it a positive thing i am absolutely fine i have five cats shanecois asks guardian contributor susancalman november think it fair to say that this has not been the best of years however sometimes things get worse before they get better so what we have to do is steel ourselves for a while in the hope that sunshine comes after the rain which is also the title of one of my favourite dance track but yes it been quite awful has it why do you watch some grey anatomy that always cheers me up james mcgeorge asks guardian contributor susancalman november there was an apocalypse i would try and find clare balding she seems to me to be cheerful during adversity but also a very sensible woman who i could rely upon during stressful times she can also as i understand ride a horse and that will probably become the main mode of transport in the future i cannot ride a horse therefore i would require to be taught by clare balding jamesbranch asks guardian contributor susancalman november apologise sincerely i did have it marked in my diary hope all is well at the press conference mccaffepj asks guardian contributor susancalman november hardy has made me laugh more than anyone else has at times on the news quiz the sexual tension between the two of us is palpable at times but i also enjoy working on sorry i have a clue with tim brook taylor and graham garden and barry cryer barry often phones me for a chat of an afternoon and he is a delightful and hilarious man in every way barry still listens and watches comedy avidly and will often call me to tell me about something he seen because he keeps up to date he sharp and pointed and satirical and i could listen to his stories all night james mcgeorge asks guardian contributor susancalman november happiest moment of my life was when i married my wife we had previously become civil partnered and as soon as the law came in to force we went to glasgow city chambers just the two or us and the registrar and upgraded to full marriage having fought for equal marriage most of my life the idea that it had finally happened was mindblowing we went to the pub afterwards and had a quiet drink just celebrating what we had achieved i never thought growing up under section that it would ever happen in my lifetime it was a great day for equality in this country claphamblackcoat asks guardian contributor susancalman november that a funny joke i never heard that one before i have tried for many months to tell people that not ruth davidson just because we are both scottish lesbians does not mean we are the same person in the same way i am not rhona cameron although i did have a lovely time on the night of the final brexit debate thanking people for how good my performance was with sadiq khan so just to reiterate for a final time i am not ruth davidson vammyp asks guardian contributor susancalman november feel i should start my answer with a confession i am in many ways the most gay woman who has ever lived but i have feelings for andy murray which are very very wrong i think he is the most attractive man i have ever seen in my life i saw his mother judy during the edinburgh fringe and hid behind a bin because i did want her to meet me looking like i was looking i think he is the most extraordinary man feminist sportsman and all round hunk of burning love that i have ever seen i have never met him and worried that if i do i will launch myself at him like an exocet missile so the answer to your question is i rather go for a pint with the paperclip because i do know how i would behave if i actually met my future husband david burdon asks guardian contributor susancalman november take it you are referring to my performance on go bit where i was appalling at chuckie egg in my defence when i was younger i used a keyboard to control the characters and in this tv show i

millions of people reading this webchat will get on board mackal asks guardian
almost half of adults have not yet made a will according to research carried out for by co op legal services it found that just had put down in writing what they wanted to happen in the event of their death its not a job anyone relishes but if you die without leaving a will you could leave costs and complications for your loved ones to deal with alongside a great deal of heartache theres a common misconception that only the supremely wealthy need a will but everyone should have one even if youve not got much to give says hannah maundrell from website money co uk writing a will doesnt have to cost a fortune and it wont take long whatever your circumstances its definitely worth doing if not you risk leaving your grieving family with a whole host of problems funeral costs can see you digging deep but small directors ease the pain read moreco op legal services found several reasons why people put off writing a will with saying they have nothing to leave not wanting to think about death and simply not having got around to doing it other concerns include the time it might take and the amount it might cost the idea of not wanting to think about death is a big sticking point with many people still not comfortable discussing it talking about dying wont make it happen says toby scott from the dying matters coalition it can feel a bit morbid at first but knowing youve got your plans and affairs in order can be a great relief you can then get on with living the life you have safe in the knowledge that everything is in place for loved ones what happens if you die without a will it can leave surviving loved ones in a real mess says scott it can cause problems that take a long time to sort out and can trigger arguments that can split families apart the reality is if you die without a valid will you will have no say in what happens to your estate in this scenario the law decides the legal term is intestacy under the rules of intestacy your estate will be divided among certain blood relatives in accordance with a strict order of priority which may not be in line with your wishes while these rules were updated in october in a bid to offer more protection to close relatives certain groups have not benefitted hayley north chartered financial planner at rose north says if you are not married your partner has no entitlement to anything even if you have children together step children and step grandchildren also do not automatically inherit so a will is particularly important for cohabiting couples as well as those who have remarried and have complicated family structures also it doesnt just ensure that the right people benefit immediately after your death it can allow you to make sure that a new partner stays in your home when you die but that your children will still be in line to inherit it can feel a bit morbid but knowing that your affairs are in order means you can get on living your lifetoby scott dying matterswith this paperwork in place you can also make sure more of your estate goes to your loved ones rather than into the chancellors coffers in avoidable inheritance tax in addition you can use this document to set out who will be your executors the people who will oversee the distribution of your estate you can even use your will to set down your funeral wishes if you have young children the other critical thing is who will be their legal guardians says north however it is vital to have the conversation with friends and family long before this is required when should you write a will another reason commonly cited by people for not having made a will is that they are too young to think about it in reality it is never too early steven cameron pensions director at aegon says none of us knows what the future holds so the earlier people start inheritance planning the better protected their loved ones will be a will can be revised later if necessary or written to take into account certain changes you expect for example if you are living with a partner but think you may get married you can have wills written in contemplation of marriage inserting this means a will is still valid after you marry of the strangest wills of all time read moreshould you do it yourself if your affairs are very straightforward you could consider buying a diy kit wh smith for example sells them from elsewhere which offers a self service will writing package starting at for an unmarried person and for mirror wills for a couple other online will writing services include affio co uk and rocketlawyer co uk you need to think very carefully before opting for one of the cheaper diy options without legal assistance according to co op legal services around a quarter of the wills it sees in its probate and estate administration department are diy documents of these approximately a third are deemed ineffective in some way this could include ambiguity in the wordingand misunderstanding of legal terms and in some cases wills have not been witnessed this can result in an estate not being distributed as the person intended says james antoniou from co op legal services it can also have a significant impact on the length of time it takes to administer an estate its also worth noting that anyone can set themselves up as a will writer so it is important to ensure you are using a specialist legal professional who is regulated and insured north from rose north adds while using a solicitor is more expensive than going down the diy route it will ensure that everything is set up correctly and could
wednesday november its another big week for me and my cancer but its wednesday so its day and things are really hotting up before the us election weve got a good show ive managed to persuade piers morgan as one of the few british journalists who actually knows donald trump to speak to us from his car while hes filming in florida for itv and hes really interesting about what the media have and critically havent understood about the donald piers is also one of the people from the worlds of journalism and broadcasting many of whom if im honest i really cant claim to know especially well whove come forward to make my life easier by offering good wishes and positive thoughts and if my experience is anything to go by if you know anyone with a cancer diagnosis dont hesitate just drop them a line to let them know youre thinking of them genuinely appreciated all the show went well i think but im still suffering from occasionally quite acute fatigue i blame the radiotherapy as i didnt get anything like this in the course of seven cycles of heavy duty chemo also since the radiotherapy im really only able to sleep on my back the doctors reckon this might be because of the impact of the radiotherapy on my diaphragm which mightve been clipped by the high energy x ray beams anyhow alls well with the back sleeping malarkey except that at around five on thursday morning i get the first signs of an unmistakable and potentially very painful condition kidney stones i was first diagnosed with them more than years ago and every now and again since a new one would get stuck in my kidney and kick off a bout of renal colic the name given to the excruciating pain that can come with them this time a couple of painkillers see it off but stand by if you can face it for what happened a few days laterthursday novembermy first day on the new treatment paclitaxel and ramucirumab and my first visit to what one of the nurses laughingly described as business class otherwise known as the ppmdu so at there i am being shown into the unit discreetly hidden from the regular nhs day unit ill be visiting later for my paclitaxel infusion and guess what it looked very similar to its nhs equivalent and while were on the subject of business class the seats were actually identical staff were great of course and i got my first dose of the very expensive ramucirumab which the nhs currently wont finance the treatment was first class and as ive previously indicated ive no problem with the principle that i should pay for it as the nhs should be protected from additional unfunded treatment costs i choose to avail myself of but i still struggle with the royal marsden taking a markup simply to supply an already very expensive drug which by the way is already standard treatment as part of second line chemotherapy for my cancer in the us and charging a private patients day rate as a whole day for a treatment that takes just over an hour ive taken to calling it my very own cash for treatment scandal i hope theyre putting the money to good use which is perhaps something worth looking into anyhow having received my ramucirumab i was escorted back downstairs to rejoin the rest of the human race in the nhs mdu and do you know aside from having identical seats to upstairs i think there might actually be more space down here but time to get reacquainted with the cold cap this as its name suggests is a rubber cap attached to a refrigeration system that rapidly cools the wearers head thus reducing the risk of hair loss that some chemotherapy drugs otherwise more or less guarantee it doesnt work for everyone but it really worked for me over seven cycles of chemo and to be honest a few quizzical looks from other patients more used to seeing women using it and the endurance test that is the first minutes of wearing it as it literally freezes your scalp was a very small price to pay of course id forgotten how hard it would be and very nearly took it off but in the end the name of the new machines they now have at the marsden paxmans true and a well timed traquiliser from the staff got me though it and so far i still have hair on my head saturday novembertoday would turn out to be one of the most difficult since i was diagnosed back in march and none of it to do with my cancer or its metastases directly for a start i have been suffering with constipation which once it gets to or days as it has for me can become almost painfully uncomfortable then there was the discomfort under my right ribs put down to my liver playing up or more likely another hangover from the radiotherapy and to cap it all was the recurring renal colic from my age old kidney stones and their appalling sense of timing and heres the twist the painkillers co codamol a mixture of paracetamol and codeine tend to work less effectively over time but critically make you more constipated to cut a long story short saturday was a bit of a perfect storm in increasing discomfort and waiting until enough time had elapsed to allow me to take more painkillers which a no longer quite do the job and b make the you know what worse as a result i cant leave the house and have no desire to eat or drink and its the latter thats set to provide the biggest twist of all tuesday novemberdue at marsden for pre chemo blood tests preparatory to the next dose of new chemo due thursday by now after such a dreadful weekend i can
saturday night live began its first post election episode on a sombre note kate mckinnon dressed as hillary clinton singing several verses of leonard cohens hallelujah and playing piano im not giving up and neither should you she said at the end but then it was time for dave chappelles return to television with a standing ovation from the crowd for those people who remember chappelle mostly from first or reruns of comedy centrals the chappelle show and not his transcendent ahead of its time standup comedy you missed out go watch killing them softly and then come back to this recap chappelle couldve just stood up on that stage and bullshat his way through a staff written monologue and you wouldve laughed but he didnt it was vintage and it was real and here are the words that he said i didnt know that donald trump was going to win the election i did suspect it seemed like hillary was doing well at the polls and yet i know the whites you guys arent as full of surprises as you used to be and i think i speak for all of black america when i say that we are all praying for omarosa i dont even know what shes doing in the news i havent see white people this mad since the oj verdict im not saying im enjoying it im just saying ive never seen this before chappelle explained i watched a white riot in portland oregon on television the other night people said they did worth of damages every black person was watching that like amateurs im staying out of it he vowed im going to take a knee like the san franciso quarterback kaepernick let the whites figure this out amongst themselves weve been here before i dont think its even the most important thing were dealing with dont forget all the things that are going on shootings he said then riffing on how the pulse nightclub shooter was rumoured to have a grindr account you cant even go to the goddamn zoo without seeing a shooting out there he added they shot a gorilla in my local zoo and the cincinnati police said that shooting that gorilla was the toughest decision this department ever had to make i said you about to see a lot of n s in gorilla costumes in cincinnati why do we have to say that black lives matter he asked rhetorically now i admit thats not the best slogan but mcdonalds already took you deserve a break today i get its kind of catching because everyone else is biting it he said even the police bite it blue lives matter what was he born a police that is not a blue life thats a blue suit you dont like it take that suit off find a new job cause im gonna tell you right now if i could quit being black today id be out of the game returning to trump chappelle had a confession to make i feel bad saying it im staying in a trump hotel right now he revealed i dont know if hell make a good president but he makes a swell hotel suite im telling you that housekeeper comes in the morning cleans my room and im like hey housekeeper grab a big handful of pussy say you know boss said it was ok he also admitted that unlike some of his other wealthy black contemporaries hes not leaving but is going to stay to take advantage of the tax breaks first time i got some money it didnt work out like that he said most unlikely thing happened ever the first black president came out of nowhere like come on everybody lets start thinking about everyone else aw no n i just got this money i didnt think you was possible as a topic though trump remained irresistible trump went to go see obama last week you see that did you see trumps face when he came out of that meeting he asked the audience trump got sonned he looked shook he looked like he got shook but even chappelle couldnt resist an appeal to the emotion of the week at the end of his monologue did you need a skit fine the first skit was a too real look at a brooklyn results watching party at which chappelle played the only black guy in the room the white guests started off quite optimistic as the polls closed while chappelles character was increasingly cynical for the white guests who continue drinking and popping xanax to get through the results play against their beliefs in america while affirming chappelles cynicism at when in real life it was clear that clintons path to a win was incredibly narrow chris rock appeared i dont get you ladies he said the country is women if the country was black wed have a tonne of black presidents flava flav would be president cecily strongs character said oh my god america is racist chapelles reaction oh my god i think my great grandfather told me something like that but he was like a slave or something i dont know aidy bryants character echoed strongs saying i cant believe it why arent people turning out for hillary the way they did for barack obama chris rock had a response maybe because youre replacing a charismatic year old black guy with a year old white woman thats like the knicks replacing patrick ewing with neil patrick harris at the end as one of the actors declared the election the most shameful thing americas ever done rock and chappelle laughed and laughed for the second skit chappelle in a call back to the trope of his comedy central show in which he stood on stage and introduced his sketches stood on stage and introduced a sketch featuring many of the characters from his show as part of a homage to the walking dead
picture the scene a us air force f falcon has come down over syria the pilot is being held by islamic state which threatens to behead him video shows the pilot being tortured in a cage while the terrorists taunt new us president donald trump the pilots family plead for the white house to save him the drama is dominating the hour tv news networks its a media storm what will trump do answer nobody has a clue trump lacks military experience he has never served in the armed forces nor does he have any background in diplomacy what trump does have by all accounts is a short fuse a tendency to shoot first and ask questions later his predecessors would have played for time appealed to local allies or pursued deniable back door talks while examining options for a rescue but president trump is different unused to the awesome responsibility of the oval office under fierce pressure to act enraged by isiss personal jibes infuriated by accusations of dithering and determined not to show weakness it is easy to imagine trump making a wrong hasty and disastrous call with a few hot headed words translated into situation room orders trump could not only lose the pilot he could plunge the us inextricably into the quagmire of another middle east war there are grave doubts about trump inexperience volatile temperament and macho instinctsgrave doubts about trumps inexperience volatile temperament and macho instincts also apply in other global hotspots where a us presidents actions or inaction are always critical and sometimes lethal here are five dangerous flashpoint issues that could suddenly and unpredictably test the novice presidents judgment cool and common sense in the first days of his tenure syria and iraqthe isis hostage scenario is not wholly imaginary in january last year a royal jordanian air force pilot muath al kasasbeh was captured and burned to death in a cage by the jihadis after negotiations for his release failed similar repeat incidents involving us european and arab members of the anti isis coalition and local forces are becoming more likely as the endgame in the fight against the isis caliphate approaches the battle is being fought out on two main fronts one is the siege of mosul northern iraqs principal city trump has criticised the conduct of the campaign which involves the mainly shia iraqi army kurdish and sunni arab militias backed by us special forces commandos but he has not offered an alternative strategy much the same holds true of the attempt to seize the isis headquarters in raqqa in northern syria trump says that defeating terrorism is a top priority and he will bomb the shit out of isis but nobody including him appears to know what this means in practice if the battle goes badly will he escalate will he carpet bomb cities where millions of civilians live is he prepared to deploy us ground forces what will he do if as seems possible both sieges become bogged down or isis begins mass daily executions of civilians trump is also silent about turkeys significant military intervention in syria and iraq and its parallel fight with the kurds president recep tayyip erdoan wants two things from trump an end to us support for the kurdish peshmerga and the extradition of fethullah glen a cleric exiled in the us who he blames for last summers failed coup with isis on the back foot and the iraqi and syrian governments weakened the turkey kurd feud could explode at any time as the protagonists try to redraw national boundaries and compete for territory and resources russia and eastern europetrump has raised expectations that he can repair the us rupture with russia but a reset will come with a price in the first instance vladimir putin russias authoritarian president will want a relaxation or scrapping of punitive sanctions imposed after russia annexed crimea in to dismay in europe trump has suggested he may agree putin also seems likely to get his way in syria where russian forces have pushed his client bashar al assad to the brink of victory in aleppo and elsewhere trump has made no serious objection to russian actions in syria even though the un says they may constitute war crimes he seems content to have assad remain in power or even to treat him as an anti isis ally however the regimes renewed use of chemical weapons for example new russian atrocities or a suddenly escalating humanitarian and refugee catastrophe could all trigger a new crisis that blows up in trumps face forcing him to move against putin the idea of no fly zones and civilian safe havens still has backers if trump goes down this route he could end up directly confronting russias military the european allies cannot do much about trumps syria insouciance but they will strongly oppose him if he tries to run down the nato alliance as he has suggested russian pressure on natos easternmost members in the baltic republics poland and bulgaria in terms of political meddling disinformation cyber attacks missile deployments and military exercises is reaching new heights influence peddling and destabilisation operations are increasingly reported in moldova montenegro and elsewhere in the balkans eastern ukraine remains a ticking timebomb any of these flashpoints could ignite at any time in trumps first days european governments want to present a strong united front but trump seems more interested in buying russia off by acquiescing in putins reclamation of former cold war spheres of influence trumps disdain for the eu he loudly applauded britains vote to leave and critical european reaction to his election notably in germany and france point to a possible us europe schism down the road if it happens trump will have helped putin achieve a long cherished russian strategic objective shattering years of euro atlanticism chinabeijing shows no sign of backing away from its expansionist policies in the south china and east china seas it is busily transforming reefs and
for years the us and britain have underwritten the open global trading system partly because of a stubborn and correct belief in the merits of free trade partly out of self interest as beneficiaries of globalisation and partly because strategically it spreads democracy peace and capitalism they have spearheaded successive rounds of tariff cuts and multilateral trade deals and stood by first the general agreement on tariffs and trade and its successor the world trade organisation to keep the system honest they have cut regional trade bargains promoted the european single market and above all kept their markets open despite other countries notably china gaming the system for their own narrow advantage the consensus in both countries was that the wider gains transcended any localised pain no longer the americans voting for the anti trade america first trump have consigned all that to history and the unintended consequence of brexit will mean the same for britain the system that underpinned our collective prosperity is about to be trashed it brought national and international benefits including an avalanche of inward direct investment into both countries powerful international financial and business service sectors rising global living standards and the economic and democratic transformation of asia but both countries manufacturing sectors have taken disproportionately heavy hits drive round the ailing industrial towns of south yorkshire or ohio and compare the economic and social landscape with that of dsseldorf munich shanghai or shenzhen decade of consistent manufacturing trade deficits have exacted a cruel toll this year working class voters across america and britains rotting industrial heartlands delivered their verdict no more plants moving abroad no more closures because of cheap imports no more sales of great companies to foreigners no more stagnating blue collar wages no more immigration it may be that there are jobs and great prospects aplenty in the burgeoning tech and service sectors in the big cities driven by global trade but they dont care they are hurting and nobody has taken decisive action to help them the votes for trump and brexit mark the end of an era and a new dark age of closure protectionism and nationalism leading tory brexiters will insist that this is a travesty of their position they want britain to access more global trade and not be imprisoned they crazily claim by the confines of the slow growing european union and its bureaucratic inability to cut aggressive trade deals with the rest of the world they live in a dreamland if they feel that the rest of the world is more committed to free trade than europe while eu membership did not hold back germany from being among the worlds major exporters in any case apart from the promised closure of borders to immigrants that is not what their voters want as nigel farage always better understood than any of his tory allies he cordially despises working class voters in south yorkshire and the west midlands want the same as their counterparts in pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin after all it was those three states with their tiny vote margin which gave trump the electoral college votes for victory he might be a billionaire but he is or at least styles himself a blue collar billionaire blue collar industrial workers dont benefit from free trade and immigration as he has consistently said for months in the teeth of opposition from the republican mainstream who remain free traders his movement as he called it wants to stop both trade exchange and intermingling are the lifeblood of humanitybuild that wall along the us mexican border was one of the most insistent chants at his rallies along with the forced deportation of million illegal immigrants but more importantly for the international trading system trump wants to withdraw from the north american free trade agreement between the us canada and mexico which he casually dismisses as the worst trade deal in history he also wants an immediate halt in negotiations for both the transatlantic and trans pacific trade agreements and unilaterally he wants to impose swingeing tariffs against the rules of the world trade organisation from which he is prepared to walk away on chinese imports which account for half of the uss trade deficit thirty five per cent tariffs are promised on mexican imports the remaining free trade agreements the us has signed are to be reviewed or abrogated cumulatively the impact would be devastating killing multilateralism by exposing the already enfeebled wto as helpless inciting chinese and mexican trade retaliation and destabilising the entire global system of trade and finance optimists say that trump the president will be much more cautious and realist than trump the campaigner his talk on trade should be seen as threats to produce more fairly balanced agreements not a tearing up of the world system maybe but there cannot be a complete divorce between campaign rhetoric and policy he believes what he says and nobody in his close coterie is going to urge caution not dan dimicco his senior trade adviser who has promised a potential withdrawal in the first six months of the trump presidency from every major us trade deal if it cannot be shown actively to benefit the us the era of trade deficits is over he says it will be lets talk but otherwise we put tariffs on another intimate walid phares has said trump will go back to ground zero on every trade deal such as the one with south korea that the president elect described as job destroying and wants to revoke trump has already given a commitment that on day one he will declare china a currency manipulator as a precursor to introducing up to tariffs on chinese imports these positions are not posturing they represent a deeply held view that the us does not need trade except on terms that put america first the idea that successive american administrations have negotiated deals loaded in the us interest is impossible to concede because how else would
that doesnt leave us with a whole lot to say except that australia will resume bowling tomorrow in the same difficult position that they would have started in today that is runs behind needing another five south african wickets before knowing the scope of the task ahead best case they can run through south africa and face a recoverable deficit of around then bat well enough to set a decent target worst case quinton de kock and temba bavuma will push the lead out to or more and australia will be knocked over once again for an innings defeat these are very difficult times for a team that seems to be unprepared to play test cricket in any kind of difficult batting conditions ill leave you with adam collins piece from after play finished yesterday which may be the only guardian article to lead off with referencing the early sketch show full frontal geoff out well see you tomorrow on the obo in the meantime heres an excuse for a report of the days proceedings rain washes out day two of

for each of the next three days so that means a start local time australian eastern daylight savings variety on monday tuesday and wednesday i also have to credit mitchell starc with actually making a decent joke in another radio interview conducted in the rain its a lovely day if youre a duck i guess some interesting points in that sutherland chat hes a pretty straight shooter compared to many administrators whately wants to know if the scheduling and preparation was awry with very little first class cricket before the tests the south africans have had the same preparation that weve had counters sutherland if you draw that comparison the team that were playing against hasnt had any different preparation so the difference is in the fundamental quality of the teams on the field when asked if they had considered replacing rod marsh as chairman of selectors immediately after he announced he would retire next year sutherland says no but is measured in his language to avoid hollowly saying that the selectors have been doing a great job the pair also discuss whether steve smith needs more support as a young captain whether test cricket has enough support itself in balance with commerce whether this is a crisis point that will bring drastic change or whether ca will try to hold things steady whether tasmania will keep getting test cricket the television is now screening australias world cup win over south africa brings to mind the comment yesterday from crickets most comprehensive online video archivist rob moody my youtube channel is turning out to be quite the

hear the full audio here still raining at bellerive obviously jim maxwells usual description of bowlers coming from the antarctic end is especially apposite in todays meteorological circumstances for those of us shivering in hobart the australians may well be enjoying a break from being humiliated on the field heres a great little note from reader ian forth on the current situation not sure if this helps but the ecb were in a similar situation to australian cricket in their solutions were wide ranging central contracts community engagement being the headlines for a fusty crew the first class forum did vote for change what they couldnt fix was a lack of national success and hero personalities coincidentally or otherwise however the team improved and the likes of flintoff and

did hillary clinton lose the election because she is a woman the answer is no but the reasons behind that no are complicated its certainly impossible to dismiss the presence of extreme sexism in the campaign the media narrative of a battle between a hard working highly qualified woman and a pussy grabbing man donald trump demonstrated over and over again that he loathes powerful women who do not bend to his will and so did many of his supporters much of his criticism of clinton often through taunting and bullying had strong sexist undertones and yet misogyny was not the reason that clinton was defeated she lost because lower and middle class white people wanted dramatic change and these voters felt that in spite of her gender she offered them more of the same during the election much was made of the extra pressure that clinton was under to conform to expectations of appearance and behaviour she received extreme attention to the way that she was dressed and groomed especially in contrast with the dishevelled and orange presentation of her opponent suspicion was cast on the meaning of her controlled delivery suggestions were made that she lacked passion as if passion could only be demonstrated through red faced screaming at baying crowds though her passion was evident as was her intellect it is true that clinton sometimes seemed a bit anodyne not because she is anodyne but because the nature of the campaign limited her means and forms of expression a woman politician whose appearance and delivery matched those of donald trump would be unlikely to be elected to city council a woman who made the error of referring to people supporting her opponent as deplorables people who screamed for walls to be built on borders and for people to be lynched was excoriated while her male opponent suggested that they come after her with guns none of this was fair in a country that holds fast to values of freedom everyone should have an equal opportunity to speak their mind and indeed wear bright orange foundation if that is a look they want to go for but this is not the reason that clinton lost like many leftwing women i went to my polling place on tuesday wearing a trouser suit and a nasty woman t shirt the hours long queue was packed out with mothers who had brought their small daughters to watch them vote for the first woman president the scene was almost enough to make it seem that the election was about seeking a long delayed victory for feminism but this was a side effect it was a media friendly narrative harnessed by clintons campaign strategists to enhance her brand rather than what the election was really about if the head of state can treat women like objects why should any other american man feel he should behave differently clinton won the popular vote probably by more than a million she was we need to remember the candidate of choice for most voters that is why it is essential to look more deeply into the numbers the reason that clinton lost the electoral college and in turn the election was that she failed to appeal to enough white women especially in decisive states my moderate excitement in clintons candidacy was not shared by a majority of women who look like me or clinton herself trump won the votes of of white women they were voters whom clintons campaign team likely believed were an easy win because of her calls for pay equality leave for new mothers and investment in young children and for her oft stated belief that womens rights are human rights but clintons campaign missed the mark with them those women who voted against clinton did not do so because they are sexist or because they dont believe in womens ability to lead and achieve they are themselves leaders and achievers instead they voted against her because they believe that her party has given them their families and their communities short shrift in trump however they have a future president who threatens to withdraw their rights who claims to aim to roll back roe v wade to take a womans right to choose out of the constitution and to institute some kind of punishment for women who terminate pregnancies trumps promise to repeal the affordable care act on his first day in office means that unwanted pregnancies will become harder to prevent with coverage withdrawn for women to get contraception provided free or at low cost in addition to policy it is impossible to overlook the impact that this most misogynist president will have on american social norms donald trump has boasted about committing sexual assault and has a dozen women with evidence that his boasts were more than just locker room talk he has called women pigs and dogs said that putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing and agreed that his daughter ivanka was a piece of ass he has described a woman who was breastfeeding as disgusting even if many women voters didnt care that trump disparaged clintons appearance her stamina her presidential look her ability to satisfy her husband they might be affected by their country being led by a man who behaves as trump does if the head of state can treat women like objects why should any other american man feel he should behave differently i know that we still have not shattered that highest glass ceiling clinton said in her painful concession speech on wednesday morning but some day someone will hopefully sooner than we might think right now how soon will that be progressives must be diligent to ensure that the enduring narrative of clintons failure does not centre on her gender only then will the democratic party be able to accomplish the drastic reform it needs to build a legitimate strategy to take back the white house in blaming sexism is
it is no use pretending donald trumps presidential election victory is a disaster for the united states and the world it is at least in part a victory for prejudice and fear for ignorance and spite it represents the triumph of economic nationalism and introspection over internationalism and the global good it is a victory built on fabrications because of this trumpism will ultimately fail confounded by its contradictions and its immorality it will be defeated but correcting this deformation will not be easy it will take time and the damage will be considerable many explanations have been offered for hillary clintons defeat last week all have an element of truth for some she was an uncharismatic figure the democratic base was uninspired and many stayed at home doubts surrounded her past conduct not least in respect of the clinton foundation in many minds she represented a discredited political establishment there was about her candidacy an off putting sense of entitlement there was her husbands inescapable ambiguous legacy and clinton was a woman reaching up to a place of power no woman has ever gone a mostly unspoken misogyny undoubtedly played a part in her downfall more broadly the complacency of the democratic party and americas liberal left too comfortable after eight safe years of barack obama did clinton a great disservice the party and its elected representatives badly misread the mood of the nation so too for the most part did independent pollsters and the us media they initially dismissed trump as a clown and then proceeded with honourable exceptions to give him too easy a ride all these factors contributed to clintons demise but they are not the whole story trump won because he successfully tapped the alienation and disillusionment of white voters men and women who comprise of the electorate and turned out for him in large numbers as polling breakdowns show the determining factors were not education or gender not age religion or geography not trumps sexual predations or clintons fbi entanglements they were race and colour linked to economic distress trump exploited a feeling among whites from all backgrounds urban suburban and rural that obamas multicultural multiracial tolerant inclusive and open outward looking america was not working for them there were significant numbers of people who felt their grievances were no longer being listened to by a centrist party that had loosed itself from its blue collar moorings as thomas frank said in these pages last week the democrats went from being the party of decatur to the party of marthas vineyard and they did so at roughly the same time that the republicans were sharpening their deadly image of the liberal elite part of the constituency that switched to trump was railing against a sense of being overlooked during eight years of president obama race unquestionably played a part when trump shrieked his slogan make america great again what he was really saying was make america white again when he spoke about curbing immigration and building a mexican wall when he demonised muslims minorities and people from foreign countries he does not know or trust when he vowed to scrap international trade deals that he claims are destroying jobs in the midwest when he railed against selfish allies who do not pay their way the subliminal message was always the same fear of the foreigner in americas midst trump conjured the illusion of a return to a simpler homogenous monocultural society of secure employment safe neighbourhoods and agreed values no wonder african americans latinos and other dark skinned minorities are frightened no wonder us relations around the globe are in turmoil and rightwing european populists and hard brexiters are celebrating no wonder observers speak of the end of the west and the demise of liberal democracy trumpism has stormed the shining city on a hill betrayed the founding fathers who stood tall for human dignity and universal rights and now presages an isolationist america made in trumps image a beacon of discrimination and malice there are the peculiarities of the american electoral system to consider too hillary clinton won a majority of the popular vote but was handsomely beaten in the race for electoral college votes and too little attention was paid to the effect of a decision by the supreme court in when it struck down a key part of the voting rights act of by a five to four vote what this did was allow nine states with long records of voting discrimination such as georgia louisiana mississippi south carolina to no longer seek federal approval to change their laws the effect was seen last week as the explained consider what has been happening in north carolina a battleground state with a history of racial discrimination in voting republican lawmakers and officials have gone to remarkable lengths to drive down turnout among black voters who disproportionately favour democrats there were numerous other examples across the country including stringent voter id rules that the federal government had stated earlier this year had a disproportionate effect on minorities for the so called leader of the free world to allow legalised voter suppression is beyond irony what supporters and opponents alike are about to discover is that trumps appeal like the blue collar billionaire himself is two faced much of what he promised on the campaign trail will not be delivered or will be so watered down as to make no difference trump says he will cut taxes raise public spending and slash the federal deficit thats impossible all at once trump says he will renegotiate or scrap nafta and other free trade treaties but his conceit that this will help uncompetitive carmakers in detroit or steel makers in ohio is implausible he says he will slap swingeing tariffs on chinese imports but he knows the geopolitical and commercial realities mean he will not he says he will make america strong and honour its friends then kowtows to vladimir putin the wests most formidable strategic
since trump won as is to be expected after a shock election result the blame stick has been hurled far and wide hitting everyone from white women to black women to poor people to white men to hispanics to the musical hamilton and the polling guys like nate silver silver especially is targeted because his model predicted clinton had a chance of victory other models in the new york times and huffington post had clintons chance much stronger it has led to fights and debates over who was right or more precisely least wrong oddly this argument over the models had begun before the election day with silver and huffington posts ryan griff having it out over the relative worth of their models there was a lot of back and forth and a lot of people tweeting about it seriously who gives a damn im not blaming silver or any poll aggregators for the result that would be silly but as they now occupy a major part of the media we should be honest poll aggregation has become everything it hated and is actually worse for coverage of elections and politics that what it replaced do blame the media trumpland is a place where truth does matter katharine murphy read morepoll aggregators in the us and in australia sprung up on blogs in the mid as a response to the then stupid reporting of polls chief political writers would report on two percentage point shifts in newspoll as massive news one week and a fortnight later a shift back of two percentage points as separate massive news all the shifts were explained due to things the journalists to be true because they more than we did about what really was going on the poll aggregators instead realised that individual polls were erratic and that most of the commentary was about statistical noise rather than actual shifts in voters preferences they instead bundled all the polls to come out with a less noisy number and at the time i thought their analysis a welcome addition that changed the coverage for the better journalists became more statistically aware and now always mention margins of error and talk of the trend but the overarching problem of the poll reportage was not that it was inaccurate but that it occurred at all reporting of polls automatically converts the coverage into a horse race that coverage is a massive media failure and poll aggregators greatly increase the failure now i love data and i dont pretend that what i do is somehow beyond criticism as katharine murphy has written the election result should have all in the media realising their work is making little or no difference but polls are not economic or social data they dont record how many sales or prices or even estimate employment they record the feelings of people about what they might do in a week month years time but they do convey a sense of fact they are quantitative and thus they tempt you into thinking they are more true than a qualitative report numbers dont lie and so you get seduced i was guilty of it even throughout this year while i was writing against them and arguing with friends about how pointless the polls coverage was i would check the website to see what the percentages were its tough to resist and the problem is this love of data has made the horse race coverage seem legitimate hard news and as a result the performance of polling has come to define the performance of election coverage this is not merely a us phenomenon we saw it here in australia after the election when media outlets tried to explain why they got it wrong but polling coverage is not hard news it is entertainment disguised as hard news many polling aggregators like silver originally used their statistical knowledge to analyse sport and such data crunching is perfect for sport sport statistics involve things that have actually occurred runs scored tackles or turnovers conceded rather than opinions it allows sports supporters to play the role of coach because in effect such data analysis gives a reader greater understanding of the coachs policies but political polls dont do that rather than coaches they transform us into campaign managers but managers insidiously removed from reality we look at polling maps and data and think oh the poll numbers are weak in pennsylvania and wisconsin but looking good for hispanics aged under but what the hell does that mean what does a weak poll in wisconsin tell us does it mean a better health policy needed immigration reform a different candidate its great for conversations over a beer but awful for covering an election political polling coverage is actually a step removed in a way that analysis of sporting statistics is not we see this in the analysis suggesting clinton ignored wisconsin she didnt hold one rally there and those loudly decrying that she only started going to michigan in the last couple weeks immediately we go into a campaign manager mindset it traps us into thinking about the ground game the advertising buys the rally numbers and locations of the candidate on various days as though that actually matters to the voters and as if reading about such things actually helps voters make a decision we think like a campaign manager but one with no interest in policies or voters other than as numbers on a map it was bad enough when you had the chief political writer interpreting the polling data like moses come down from the mount but it is even worse when you have whole teams devoted to the polls for the numbers and hype about the models are all geared towards convincing us that their numbers are more factual and the analysis behind it more trustworthy than that done by the old rube churning out copy about the latest point movement in newspoll look at the graphs
when respectable commentators tell us the crisis will blow over they are usually right most of the time the shock passes and the status quo reasserts itself most of the time men of the world can lie back in their comfortable chairs and guffaw at the chicken lickens who thought the sky was falling down but most of the time is not all of the time and it most certainly is not our time in the revolutionary years of and those who said we would soon be back to normal were historys fools this year is a revolutionary year for the radical right it is at once predictable and extraordinary that authoritative voices are telling us to keep calm and carry on despite all appearances to the contrary donald trump is just a traditional conservative they say as they prettify venality and sanitise hatred great opportunities lie ahead splutters boris johnson trumps british twin the constitution will bind him and the media will check him others insist as they show they have no idea of how weak serious journalism has become like playing russian roulette those trying to minimise the shock of the revolution in american politics may be lucky trump may not have meant what he said in the campaign and will settle down to a presidency of indolent corruption they cannot possibly know the revolver wont explode however and are being dishonest when they pretend they can the rest of us should ignore them and concentrate on what we know for sure we know that a man who talks as if he was born to lie who carries grudges like a gangster whose sexual rapacity propels him to demean and assault women who admires the putin kleptocracy and who wants to impose bans on adherents of a global religion is now the president of a great power we also know that faced with an election they had to win americas liberals were too unpopular to stop him will donald trump destroy america read moreif we were just talking about the united states we could concentrate on the shocking irresponsibility of the democratic party in running an establishment candidate in a country that was sick of the status quo it is bizarre to see people who condemn cultural appropriation engage in political appropriation but maybe us leftists are right to think that a portion of trump supporters were secretly on their side and a more radical democrat would have won them over unfortunately this is not just an argument about the wretched clinton campaign not only in america but across the democratic world liberals and leftists are becoming used to waking up in the early hours and learning that they have lost again they did not expect the conservatives to win the british general election or the british to vote to leave the eu they didnt see trump coming they wont see le pen coming poland may be the future in a country that had a centre left government within recent memory not one member of the polish parliament now calls himself or herself a social democrat or socialist debate is between the internationalist right in opposition and the authoritarian nationalists in power theirs may be our future too to suffer such calamitous defeats and not feel the need to change is to behave as irresponsibly as the us democratic party it is a myth that trump and brexit won because of overwhelming working class support nevertheless they could win only because a large chunk of the white working class moved rightwards debates about how to lure them back ought to reveal the difference between arguing with and arguing against your fellow citizens which most middle class leftists have not even begun to think about you can only argue against committed supporters of trump if they believe all mexicans are rapists and muslims terrorists you cannot compromise without betraying your principles fair enough but before you become self righteous you must accept that the dominant faction on the western left uses language just as suggestive of collective punishment when they talk about their own white working class imagine how it must feel for a worker in bruce springsteens youngstown to hear college educated liberals condemn white privilege when he has a shit job and a miserable life or google the number of times straight white males are denounced by public school educated women in the liberal media and think how that sounds to an ex miner coughing his guts up in a yorkshire council flat emotionally as well as rationally they sense the left or at least the left they see and hear is no longer their friend they are men and women who could be argued with if the middle classes were willing to treat them decently you might change their minds you might even find that they could change yours instead of hearing an argument they see liberals who call the police to suppress not only genuine hate speech that incites violence but any uncouth or inappropriate transgression its not enough to moan about the new right resist it nick cohen read morefor too many in the poor neighbourhoods of the west middle class liberals have become like their bosses at work they tell you what you can and cant think they warn that you must accept their superiority and you will be in no end of trouble if you do not in spain his great poem on political activism wh auden concluded with these grim lines we are left alone with our day and the time is short and history to the defeated may say alas but cannot help or pardon george orwell made an uncharacteristically incoherent attack auden had said earlier in the poem that soldiers fighting in the spanish civil war must engage in necessary murder and this proved he was a dilettante warmonger although necessary murders are what soldiers commit auden came to agree and disowned his poem for suggesting the ends justify
for years america has toyed with the idea of a woman becoming president this year for an all too brief moment it looked as if the idea might become a reality but the dream of a female president has remained just that a disingenuous myth america occasionally serves up in fictions but never permits to spill into its facts instead of witnessing the landmark moment of a woman moving into the oval office we can now see the all too real misogyny that became a feature of the presidential campaign bedding down in the corridors of power when donald trump called hillary clinton a nasty woman in the final debate only a few days after a series of recordings revealed him admitting to a series of sexual aggressions and assaults many people thought it was the end of his bid for the presidency instead social media during election night revealed trump supporters male and female voicing the diehard view that a woman is simply not capable of being president too weak to stand up to foreign leaders and the military the sucker punch for those of us who believe that this particular woman was spectacularly more ready for the white house than her grossly underqualified and abusive opponent is that as has historically been the case once again a female candidate did not carry even the female vote a staggering of white women voted against clinton and for the man whose statements and attitudes brought misogyny kicking and screaming into the light facebook twitter pinterest hillary clintons concession speech in fullwhen clinton conceded the presidency she tried to offer hope to the women especially the young women of america i know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling but i know someday someone will and hopefully sooner than we might think right now of course we may not think that right now because right now the media is focusing its attention on white male economic and racial disempowerment it is not interested in the disempowerment of women but that is also the story of this election which was fought over a series of fictions myths and outright lies for two solid years the media engaged in spreading half truths and misinformation about the first serious female candidate for president for a few days after we learned that trump likes to grab women by the pussy the mainstream media began admitting how many of the derogatory stories swirling around clinton were misogynistic how many were literally trumped up fictions but then the fbi intervened and the story reverted to its misogynistic mean relentlessly informing the american electorate that clinton is duplicitous dishonest untrustworthy it was character assassination and it worked anyone who still believes these claims are factual and on the evidence some million people do should consider how closely they resemble the stories that have always been told about female politicians both real and fictional to do so is to realise that it is time to stop suggesting as some commentators are doing that clinton failed us the truth is we failed her to understand a culture you must know its stories taking a hard look at some of the tales weve told about the idea of a female president can teach us a great deal about this election as well as those to come the women who have become american presidents in the history of fiction are not quite as vanishingly scarce as they are in reality but theyre not exactly numerous and until very recently the fictions were as presumptively white as the candidates just women have mounted a serious bid for us president three of whom made it to a major partys national convention although only one secured that nomination five became third party candidates and two became major party running mates both of whom lost we have had three female secretaries of state one female speaker of the house but no woman has ever been elected to the executive branch of the american government the idea of a woman in the white house has always prompted the same responses it is either a joke a disaster or a cheat clinton was endlessly called crooked hillary to shouts of lock her up although her crimes always varied had she murdered vince foster or ron brown had she covered up wrongdoing in the deaths of americans at benghazi stolen millions or was she in fact beelzebub it didnt matter what mattered was the idea of illegitimacy most stories imagine a female president who lies cheats murders or sleeps her way into office or inherits the roleour fictions about women becoming president have always worked to invalidate the very idea take for example the novel co authored by a former speaker of the house and avowed enemy of clintons newt gingrich which tells of a woman who becomes americas first woman president and chooses politics over national interest resulting in a benghazi style attack its title now gingrich has been tipped for a cabinet appointment because propaganda works in neither history nor fiction are there more than a handful of stories that imagine a female president who could ascend to the highest office in the land honestly through merit and hard work instead she either lies cheats murders or sleeps her way into office or she inherits the role passively from a man fictional depictions of a female presidential candidate on the actual campaign trail are even rarer this may correlate with the fact that as clinton herself noted she was always more popular in office than while running when female presidents are imagined they are in office thanks to a fait accompli of some kind which is also delegitimising power was handed to her or she inveigled her way into it either way its crooked just like hillary serious fiction is a club into which women presidents arent admitted they are segregated by genre cropping up primarily in satire or science fiction female presidents
observers cite voter anger at an entitled political establishment and an ever wealthier and privileged elite gridlock and dysfunction in washington international tensions and economic dislocation and distress to explain his victories in the primaries and now in the general election theyre not wrong over the course of the campaign trump threw fuel on all these hotspots still more critical to his success he nailed the white male support that would put him over the top in electoral votes on by his continual attacks on the legitimacy of the nations first african american president his targeting and denunciation of undocumented immigrants and muslims and his overtly sexist remarks about women but after writing a book about donald trump his father and his grandfather i think other factors played a pivotal role for starters theres a trump family culture of ruthlessly pressing any advantage stretching the truth and pushing the legal and ethical envelope to the max trumps german immigrant grandfather who operated restaurants in gold rush era seattle and the yukon amassed a nest egg by offering miners alcohol food and proximity to women his father greatly increased the family fortune by exploiting loopholes in new deal government subsidies he tapped to construct middle income housing in brooklyn and queens and trump used a billion dollar loss of borrowed money and four corporate bankruptcies to build a global brand and avoid paying personal income taxes for nearly two decades that family culture also includes an adherence to the success oriented theology of dr norman vincent peale author of the bestseller peale was the pastor of marble collegiate church where trumps parents attended services where trump and his sisters married and where funeral services for their parents took place in his book peale emphasises the supreme importance of self confidence a notion that trump has not merely embraced but weaponised with a winning at all costs scorched earth approach that has more than fulfilled his own fathers fierce injunction to be a killer in every pursuit among many results are a remarkable litigation history according to as of mid trump had been involved in more than lawsuits including dozens that are still active and a political campaign characterised by an unprecedented level of venom and vitriol but trump has also contributed his own special flourishes linguists found trump was second only to hillary clinton in terms of how feminine he soundedfor example his much ridiculed hair for years it has been a highly effective trademark a humanising bit of vanity that made him the peoples billionaire rather than a remote tycoon and on the campaign trail his coiffure made him the perpetual centre of attention as with the traditional circus clowns big red nose trumps bouffant blond combover cued audiences that at any moment he might do something entertaining and that it was permissible to laugh even cheer if some sort of antisocial activity occurred for a clown this includes antics like hitting people with a baseball bat or dumping water on their heads for trump it was likely to be a vicious taunt a preposterous exaggeration even a suggestion to rough up protesters behaviour that would ordinarily be considered unacceptable but was now tolerated even celebrated because it could be explained away as only a performance a joke or one of trumps favourite phrases truthful hyperbole ultimately however trumps success may have hinged on his voice i am your voice he declared in his acceptance speech at the republican national convention in july and there is more to that claim than might have been apparent at that moment let me lay it out curiously despite his obsession with showing that he is the most powerful person on earth his speech doesnt have the archetypal tough guy edge in part this is because as the reported during the primaries linguists found he was the second only to hillary clinton in terms of how feminine he sounded moreover when measured by non verbal cues like gestures facial expressiveness and statements posed as questions he came in as the most feminine of the entire field but perhaps even more importantly it is also because of the way he sounds although hes shown hes more than capable of shouting in classic rabble rousing style more often than not what comes out when he opens his mouth is not traditional alpha male talk in contrast to both the hyper belligerence of jean claude van damme and the chilling rasp of clint eastwood trumps speech tends to be in the middle range even slightly high pitched not effeminate but despite his guarantee in one debate as to the adequacy of his genital endowment not testosterone laden either this low key verbal tone might seem unimportant at most a meaningless distinction overshadowed by his relentless aggression and braggadocio in other words not a big deal but its effect is a big deal instead of insistently bellowing or pounding his chest like an arnold schwarzenegger hes tapping into a different stereotype the counter intuitive strongman who tosses off some of his most devastating comments with a malevolent sneer think marlon brando or robert de niro who make their point not by shouting theyre going to blow your head off but by hissing that youd better cooperate if you want to see another sunrise moreover trumps speech is hardly bristling with complexity rather his vocabulary is extremely simple almost to the point of being childish and his use of incomplete thoughts and sentence fragments has an unmediated stream of consciousness feel it is this combination the hint of menace beneath the surface added to what appears to be an unpolished immediacy that millions of listeners take as evidence of trumps authenticity and spontaneity indeed the way he talks reminds them of the voice inside their own heads a rich and sometimes dark stew of conversational snippets and memory scraps random phrases and half thoughts and by extension it somehow seems as if theyre hearing the voice inside his head
world leaders have begun congratulating donald trump on his election win as people around the world anxiously wait to see how their country will engage with the new us president the order in which trump spoke to leaders around the world has sparked speculation as to how he will shape his foreign policy in the hours after his victory speech trump spoke to egypt ireland mexico israel turkey india japan australia and south korea the uks theresa may was on the list more anti trump action planned after second night of protests across us read moreegypts president abdel fatah al sisi was the first to have a conversation on how to foster closer diplomatic ties with the us australias prime minister malcolm turnbull discussed trade regional security and how to defeat isis a key promise in trumps election campaign but although the german chancellor angela merkel and the french president franois hollande offered support they labelled his leadership a period of uncertainty we asked people around the world to tell us what the situation looks like from where they live how their governments are responding to trumps victory and how they think his leadership will affect their lives egyptegypt and the us will probably grow closer but as citizens we will suffer from trumps endorsement of our president sara engineerwe live in a police state where students activists and journalists disappear or are jailed the obama administration had been putting pressure on our government to improve human rights and freedom of speech but i doubt donald trumps administration will do the same this is evident from our current presidents eagerness to connect with trump i hope he hires a team that understands the complexities of the middle east it is evident he does have a cluesara egyptboth hillary clinton and trump are heavily disliked in the middle east by muslims and arabs while trump is openly hostile to muslims and clueless about the region hillarys policy as secretary of state has been very deliberate and damaging to the region despite her partys more tolerant and inclusive tone having gone through a very similar election scenario in egypt in where both candidates were hated i was not very surprised by the outcome the democratic party underestimated trumps popularity and the dislike for hillary i feel a lot of votes went to trump out of spite for hillary perhaps if a different candidate had gone against trump the outcome would have been different just like what happened in egypt it looks like the american population is now sharply split in half with each side demonising the other i think thats the most dangerous thing that can happen to a country having racist intolerant people in power might make it easier to challenge them as they are now out in the open but healing the rifts in society is much harder i simply hope trump will become a president for all us citizens as is his duty and reign in the hateful extremist tendencies displayed by white americans i hope he hires a competent team that understands the complexities of the situation in the middle east and worldwide as it is evident that he does not have a clue chinapotential trade conflicts but he will use his business wisdom to deal with it boyang beijingi feel great about the result its a tremendous win for the masses for those who were constantly ignored by political elites in washington i like trump a lot because he knew the real problems of the country rather than just chanting politically correct slogans the us is divided now probably more divided than when i worked there for three years that happens when you are obsessed with gay rights and minority rights but forget to promote the most basic right of living a better life for the majority he will be a great president if he improve some of his rhetoricboyang chinathe pivot to asia plot and the tpp are now dead trump is likely to be a more pragmatic figure than obama so sino us relations will improve theres going to be some trade conflicts if trump lives up to his word about china but i believe he will use his business wisdom to deal with it china will have an easier situation and a stronger influence in the region a win win cooperation between these two countries could benefit humankind i wish that trump could be more presidential he will be a great president if he improves some of his rhetoric i hope that he can get along with china indiawe have a lot of supporters for trump mostly from far right parties mithun keralato say the result was shocking would be an understatement victory of an alt right fanatic like trump in a country known around the world for its liberal virtues and principles is something that adds to the swerve of the world to the right he adds on to the list of rightwing politicians such as recep tayyip erdoan in turkey vladimir putin in russia and of course narendra modi in india maybe we are witnessing the gradual transition of the world into a global conflict in india we have a lot of supporters for trump mostly from far right parties its another moment of jubilation for them maybe the consequences for foreign policy will be beneficial as trump has publicly shown his admiration for modi and his way of governance but his temperamental nature makes trump truly unpredictable so we will have to wait and see as long as he doesnt turn rhetoric into reform i think the world will be safemithun indiain southern india where im from most of the people have a similar opinion to me but in the northern areas of india the stomping ground of the ruling rightwing opinions may differ the philosophy of gandhi of a mutual peaceful coexistence which was even enshrined in our foreign policy until an ideological regime change is something i firmly believe
the question of what constitutes an independent artist in is a slightly vexed one is it still someone signed to an independent label or have advances in technology changed the traditional definition what is an independent label anyway does a small label financially supported by a major but left free to make its own a r decisions count or are they just lapdogs of the evil music industry in a world where jme can make the charts apparently without any of the traditional blandishments of the music industry no label no manager no publisher no pr as his twitter biog boasts are the truly independent artists the ones who go it entirely alone self producing and releasing everything they do if you self release your music with the aid of a bit of cash from another source youtube or a streaming service or sponsorship from a drink or clothing company does that compromise your claim to independence you could argue about it for hours but perhaps its best to say that in independence is something less to do with your financial arrangements or means of distribution than with a certain spirit the artists in the list below veer about wildly in terms of commerciality its not too much of a stretch to imagine abra or lil yachty in the top a little harder to picture the same thing happening to anenons improvisation based blend of electronica and jazz or indeed cabbages recent ep uber capitalist death trade spotify linkbut the one thing they have in common is that they dont sound like people who have been told what to do by other people who think they know what makes music successful in that sense they are at odds with the kind of artists you tend to find in the bbc sound of polls or the brit critics choice shortlist the big hitters that major labels have decided are going to make them a lot of cash a lot of that music sounds like the result of extensive market research with literally inevitable results it plays it safe closely resembling stuff people are already buying so this years hotly tipped alt rock band sounds remarkably like last years most successful alt rock band this years big new singer songwriters sound remarkably like last years big singer songwriters influence of wafty electronica and all this years pretender to the mainstream pop throne seems to have used exactly the same songwriters producers and auto tune settings as the star they are trying to knock off their perch you cant blame big record labels for playing it safe these are tough times for the music business but caution leads to ossification if you are looking for a reason why huge swathes of the charts sound remarkably homogenous as if you could swap the names of the artists responsible around and no one would really notice then there it is perhaps the commercial success of skeptas chart topping mercury winning konichiwa an album that self evidently hasnt been focus grouped into existence might cause a rethink of this approach perhaps not either way in the meantime here are new artists independent in the sense that they are acting on impulse and instinct doing what they want rather than what they are told alexis petridisabra interactivephotograph david levene for the guardian hair makeup maria asadi using mac cosmeticsin one long breathless rush abra is telling me the story of the teenage rock band she was once a part of it was with my ex and all his roommates and it was she recalls when we would fight it was always like band practice is off band practice is on but our shows were really good super intense and passionate and i had this really good chemistry with the guitarist who my boyfriend and so she clocks my surprise and laughs i know right we didnt play many shows speaking to abra is an almost completely different experience to listening to her music on record she can be raw and unflinching putting her emotions on the frontline over a skeleton of minimalist electro r b it is music that chimes with her mysterious online persona in which she styles herself as the darkwave duchess and refuses to reveal her real name or age yet here she is now giggling away through stories of acid trips and teenage distress with precious little guard up getting a grip on just who abra is can be tricky because it seems to have taken her some time to work it out too growing up as the daughter of church missionaries she spent formative years in south london new york and atlanta living a displaced life in which music art and books were the only constant her strict religious upbringing meant that listening options were reduced to christian music in church she would often cry at the stacked harmonies or old folk songs which inevitably left her feeling like something of an outsider among her peers i couldnt bring up scarborough fair to someone in my third grade class she laughs they werent listening to that yet she accepts now that these unique influences shaped her sound today which absorbs old and modern influences from gospel to avant r b via chicago house britney spears and smooth pop just listen to the stunning crybaby or indeed any song from this years mini album princess and you will likely be floored by the mix of rhythms chiming synths and soulful topline melodies it is music full of nods to the past that nevertheless sounds thoroughly modern there are two musical events that seem to have greatly shaped abras career the first was while suffering depression as a teenager when she would sit on her bed crying and listening to the radio one day the station was playing christmas songs and i said to myself i know this sounds cheesy but i said if theres anything out there that believes im worth a damn
detroit based digital artist molly sodas latest book project was borne of instagram but not in the way you might think when the multimedia artist noticed her photos being removed from instagram for violating the community guidelines she teamed up with co curator and artist arvida bystrm and put out an open call for submissions of photos banned by the network the resulting project the book pics or it didnt happen is due out early next year their subversive project is interesting for its range of imagery banned images include everything from nipples and pubic hair to a woman wearing a hijab and holding an iphone despite building a name for herself in the art world largely through networks like tumblr and instagram soda says that she regularly thinks about the fact that those platforms dont have her career interests in mind when designing their networks policies i dont feel like instagram as an app necessarily owes me anything soda explains im willingly using these social media platforms but the internet has set itself up in this guided and streamlined way where everyone follows these rules in order to facilitate whatever it is theyre trying to promote meanwhile these platforms are huge corporate entities with an entirely different set of interests i dont think many creators realise the reality of what theyre dealing with including myself indeed as the internet economy is maturing this nascent tension between big internet platforms like instagram youtube twitter and facebook and the creators that provide them with content comes into focus platforms need users to create content which elicits the kind of engagement that is attractive to advertisers users need the platforms to reach wide audiences and potential revenue streams but they want it without fear of censorship however since few brands want to be sandwiched between racism and pornography its up to platforms to figure out how to find the sweet spot of policing their networks without prompting frustrated creators to move on to their competitors laura chernikoff is the executive director of the internet creators guild which was formed earlier this year to represent the interests of creators to big internet companies she says that one of the primary ways this tension manifests is through opaque user guidelines or the lists of rules which outline what content is liable to be removed or demonetised in response to criticism around content removal last month facebook publicly admitted that observing global standards for our community is complex and announced that they would be allowing more items that people find newsworthy significant or important to the public interest even if they might otherwise violate our standards in september youtube weathered a backlash from many high profile creators when it tweaked its notification process for content that is deemed advertiser unfriendly spawning the hashtag youtubepartyover chernikoff explains how the controversy perfectly displayed both sides of the debate the guidelines themselves are very broad and are being enforced by an algorithm without a lot of clear information about what youtube is looking for people think it has to do with tags metadata and titles but its not known exactly how it works chernikoff explains however its easy to understand why the guidelines have to be broad it is youtubes platform and they need to make it a safe space for brands which is a huge part of whats going on here chernikoff notes that compared to other more impenetrable social networks like facebook youtube has been reaching out to creators and nurturing them though sources say it would be unlikely for youtube to outline their exact criteria for content removal and or demonetisation because then itd be easier to thwart a spokesperson for youtube contacted by the guardian pointed to an example of that a recent announcement that every creator who has joined the partner programme can get answers via email from a real person at youtube within one business day using snapchat to give a voice to sexual abuse survivors read morewhile our policy of de monetising videos due to advertiser friendly concerns hasnt changed weve recently improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators the spokesperson went on to say creators are the lifeblood of youtube and were totally committed to ensuring their growth and success so whats a creator who wants to make a living on the internet without fear of their business model being pulled out from underneath them to do chernikoff says across networks many creators are realising the need to diversify their portfolio and not limit their business model to one thats entirely dependent on a single social network be it an ad revenue share model such as youtube or a more indirect brand building route such as instagram indeed prominent youtubers such as philip defranco have spoken publicly about intentionally tapping other revenue streams which can include merchandise direct crowdfunding brand deals and other partnerships to financially underpin their channels frankie greek is a snapchat journalist who frequently speaks about these trends and helps brands make sense of them as a consultant she said much of creators discontent stems from how much the internet has changed in a short amount of time there was a time when the

an estimated of americas million armed forces personnel are stationed abroad there are an estimated us service personnel dotted about the middle east but the us does not release precise information on all their locations global mapafghanistanafghanistan barely featured in the election campaign but when donald trump takes office he will not be able to ignore what is now americas longest war thousands of us troops are still stationed there the security situation is deteriorating as the taliban threaten cities and consolidate control of rural areas and isis has joined the war although american forces are not officially in a combat role have died there this year making it a deadlier theatre of operations for the us military than iraq or syria the taliban responded to the us election result by calling on trump to withdraw americas troops but advisers will warn him that without the backing of foreign airpower and other military expertise the country is likely to fall to the taliban his strong stance on fighting isis and islamic terrorism means he is unlikely to hand control of a country where thousands of american troops died to a scarcely less hardline group he has also expressed concerns about nuclear weapons in neighbouring pakistan trump has repeatedly called for us allies to pay more towards their own security but there is almost no cash to be had in afghanistan which is already largely dependent on foreign aid for its budget and is one of the poorest nations in the world he is likely to be stuck then with the multibillion dollar bill for the us presence and support of afghan troops emma graham harrisonbaltic statesthe baltic states are nervous about whether a trump administration would defend them in the event of a russian attack in july trump told the new york times he would not necessarily come to the aid of lithuania latvia and estonia unless they had first stumped up enough cash into nato coffers nato has recently been ramping up its military exercises in the baltics in response to what it sees as a growing kremlin threat in december the us airborne unit is due to train with latvian troops at a former soviet military base but it is unclear if such us led exercises will continue there is also uncertainty as to what will be trumps russia policy the fear is that trump will effectively concede eastern europe to moscow as a sphere of influence this would give vladimir putin russias president a free hand to create havoc in the baltics raising the spectre of cyber attacks subversion of democratic elections and even covert russian invasion similar to the events of in east ukraine and crimea luke hardingcanadathe possible impact of a trump presidency on trade is the main worry of canadas goods and services exports go to the us representing of the countrys gdp and jobs trumps promise to renegotiate nafta which he called the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere has alarmed ottawa but analysts point out that much of the two countries trade is also governed by world trade organisation rules and the us ambassador to canada has said canada would be willing to look again at the agreement in a gesture of goodwill towards the new administration canadians are also worried by trumps views on climate change and the consequences not just for the un paris agreement but bilateral pacts such as the deal struck by barack obama and the canadian prime minister justin trudeau to limit methane emissions from the oil and gas industry trump could prove positive for the canadian oil industry suffering like many from low prices transcanadas planned keystone xl pipeline carrying oil from alberta to a us terminal in nebraska was rejected by the obama administration after six years of review trump has said he would approve the project which would give canadian oil companies easier and so more profitable access to international markets if it were resubmitted as long as the us benefited from its construction and got a share of the profits jon henleyfrancetheir world collapses ours is being built tweeted florian philippot a front national vice president and marine le pens righthand man as trump headed for victory trumps win certainly makes a president le pen more plausible more than polls in the last two years have consistently shown her finishing second or winning the first round of frances presidential elections on april after that conventional wisdom says le pen will be heavily defeated in the run off stage by her rival at present likely to be the veteran centre right former prime minister alain jupp who is seen as a safe pair of hands after two hugely unpopular presidents some le pen policies particularly that of taking france out of the euro simply scare too many voters and current polling says le pen would lose to jupp backed by an anti fn front rpublicain after brexit and trump we know polls can be wrong for them to be wrong by percentage points would be extraordinary but the same factors that drove trumps victory are clearly in play in france le pen as the countrys president cannot be completely ruled out especially if jupp does not make it to the second round jon henleyiranall eyes are on how trumps presidency will play out vis vis last years landmark nuclear deal which was widely praised as a triumph of diplomacy that averted the risk of another war in the middle east despite his speech in march to the pro israel lobby aipac during which he said his first priority was to dismantle the disastrous deal with iran it is still unclear what path trump will follow in office he has contradicted himself on the deal previously conceding that it would be hard to rip it up without european support trumps lack of credibility among traditional european allies of the us led some to think that his victory would be unlikely to cause much trouble
argentina avoid crisis talk after brazil beating as media lament catastrophe read more coutinho and neymar star for brazil to leave argentina flailing in qualifying read more well thats it coach tite and brazil make it five straight wins and argentina continue dwelling in their own downfall there was nothing about this match that should suggest they can do anything against colombia next week even if they are at home the entire brazilian squad energized and inspired by carlos alberto as he looked down from heaven delivered a performance that would make the legends of the extremely proud before this match the last time brazil played in belo horizonte germany had embarrassed them at the world cup in now they have a new memory edgardo bauza meanwhile has a lot to think about was higuan really the best choice to start where is the relentless pressure or the grit and desire we are so accustomed to seeing when we watch albiceleste answers better come fast because a hungry colombia is coming to town thanks for tuning in and ill see you next time min thats it brazil win convincingly a masterful victory min a great ball wide to neymar who finds costa but argentina just about clear it from the box messi who hasnt touched the ball in a while can only admire at his barca teammate and the way he leads the selecao neymar really is a sight to behold when he leads his nation messi finally gets the ball and dribbles towards the box but deflects wide min firmino hits the post after a great cross coutinho comes out for douglas costa a great performance from the liverpool man firmino again enters the box but otamendi just about clears it this is truly shambolic by argentina and ironically enough they could really benefit from another argentinian manager who instills a lot of grit and energy ricardo gareca but hes busy managing peru min firmino replaces gabriel jesus manchester city fans are going to be spoiled with the things he does a great no and hes only min wow neymar close to making as he breaks through the center and into the box but his second touch is too heavy and the ball goes out brazil chanting ole now and its going to be a long flight back to buenos aires min there are shades of the old brazil here with lovely one touch football i actually cant remember the last time messi touched the ball or even made a significant contribution albiceleste look to penetrate brazils box but a stout defense takes it right back min aguero gets fouled just outside the box but nothing materializes there are minutes left and there is nothing about this match that says argentina will get a goal let alone come back brazil look composed and really loving their football di maria looks exhausted and needs to be subbed min neymar and brazil are just having too much fun right now and higuan doesnt like it as he fouls the barca man argentina are losing the match and their heads on the process brazil in complete domination in other news peru is currently beating paraguay in asuncin first away win since i might explode after im done here just warning you min well this time around paulinho doesnt miss and makes it game over as he capitalizes on a cross from the right hand side this is huge argentina are losing currently out of the top next match is gigantic min wow this game should be over gabriel jesus once again finds paulinho who rounds the keeper all he needs to do is score and its over but zabaleta saves it on the line neymar gets fouled by funes mori freekick to brazil a great attempt by dani alves but its saved by romero min neymar fouls funes mori and once again tite has to warn his players to calm down brazil have taken on the high press approach knowing that argentina is rattled messi finds aguero but its offside this is bauzas biggest issue not being able to figure out how to encourage rapid movement inside the box min brazil start the second the same way they ended the first with relentless counterattacking aguero who replaced perez draws a yellow card as marcelo cant stop him on the right hand side another messi taken free kick this time a good ball in but cant be met by anyone min peep and were back well its clearly cruise control for brazil right now as argentina are getting rocked by the counter its all going badly for bauzas team im sure aguero will come in the second half straight away min what a great pass by gabriel jesus who cuts through the argentinian defense and feeds neymar who calmly puts it in corner wow min what a great cross by ms from the left hand side and it just cant be met by higuan who was too slow to react argentina are finishing this half strongly with all the action in brazils half they just cant find the back of the net thanks john ha ha you know what at times you would think that is the case but its due to the fact that alves and marcelo push so high up when in possession i agree with you a special goal question is my tv playing tricks on me or are brazil playing a john fearon via email min another free kick for argentina as messi gets fouled outside the box this is an almost perfect angle for la pulga but he drives it against the wall if it carries on like this it wont be long until we see aguero on the counter neymar takes it all the way into the box from the right hand side but instead of delivering a low cross he shoots it himself and hits the post min as argentina decide to press brazil stick to
as emily colvin a transgender woman living in the heart of missouri watched the election results pour in on tuesday night her mind began to race with fear it was time for her to find a self defense class she thought and maybe to purchase a gun with the united states emerging from one of the most bitterly divisive presidential races in its history throngs of americans find themselves deeply distrustful and even fearful of the winner donald trump but few groups have expressed dismay and fear as uniformly as the nations trans people who already report discrimination harassment and violence at rates starkly higher than the general population on wednesday those who spoke to the guardian saw trumps election as destined to hobble their movement after years in which their acceptance grew by leaps and bounds and they said they feared an immediate cultural reckoning ive got the safety net of being white so why am i so worried about trump emma brockes read morecate brenner a trans woman on long island said she was absolutely terrified for trans people and their movement by wednesday morning it seemed as though every trans person she knew had gone into mourning a friend of hers in california posted on social media about going back into the closet it might be safer passing as a straight cisgender person said this person who spoke to the guardian on condition of anonymity im scared they continued ive been out and proud for most of my life with supportive people around me ive never had to deal with this kind of fear before their fiance is also frightened to live openly as a transgender person were both scared to continue we didnt know before how we wanted to define ourselves if we even wanted to now were scared to even have the conversation we are all traumatized said colvin in her online network of trans friends the general reaction that im seeing is oh my god how are we going to protect ourselves trumps administration is expected to usher in a sea change after several years in which transgender rights activists notched critical victories in the culture and government between and the number of americans saying they knew a trans person grew from one in to one in three the obama administration in its final years took the controversial and unequivocal position that federal anti discrimination laws applied to the rights of trans people there were far reaching consequences for schools which were required to allow trans students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms aligned with their gender identities and for entire industries such as health insurers those gains made amid a hail of controversy now seem at risk trump seldom mentioned trans issues on the campaign trail but his running mate indiana governor mike pence first emerged on the national stage after signing an expansive anti lgbt measure into law and the republican party at large has made its near total opposition to trans rights clear on wednesday morning pence seemed to confirm that the trump administration would not place penalties on schools that fail to accommodate trans students as obama did washington has no business intruding on the operation of our local schools pence said in an interview he gave to the arch conservative radio host james dobson republicans are also poised to repeal the affordable care act and with it an anti bias measure that prevented many health insurance plans from discriminating against trans policy holders on wednesday mara keisling the director of the national center for transgender equality rejected the notion that trumps victory represented a terminal setback for the movement trans people have spent decades educating their classmates and their families and their co workers and the people they worship with about who they are keisling said the government can maybe take back some of the policy advancements weve had but they cant take away the dignity weve created for ourselves the freedom weve created for ourselves still keisling conceded this slows us down this hurts a lot on wednesday morning her group heard from trans people across the country who were scared and angry this has got to be terrifying for many trans people were going to have to be strong in the face of some really terrible stuff colvin is worried about her access to hormone therapy in a world without the affordable care act known as obamacare a student who was at one time homeless and suicidal she credits her healthcare which includes psychiatric therapy with her survival im worried about our ability to change our names she continued im worried about laws that protected trans kids gianni a trans man who wished to be identified only by his first name found himself wondering what would happen if he lost his healthcare coverage or his insurer stopped covering his hormone therapy he doesnt believe theres any way he could afford his transition treatments out of pocket he was worried for his safety too im mixed race and im transgender and i feel like im in a big hole right now and im scared gianni said as tuesday night gave way to wednesday morning trans lifeline a national hotline for transgender people in crisis saw its normal call volume triple trans folks are frightened that they wont be able to work or access healthcare or get travel documents updated said greta martela the hotlines director and founder colvin witnessed a trans friend post about having suicidal thoughts on facebook the comments section pulsed with supportive messages and her friend sought help from his home in sacramento mark williams tweeted that he was fearful as the father of a transgender child a bully and a bigot is at the helm with a man who doesnt believe in lgbtq rights as his second in command williams told the guardian im worried that the people who voted them into office will take the fact that they won as an affirmation
britains national newspapers registered their profound shock at donald trumps victory over hillary clinton with pages and pages of coverage the daily telegraphs front page called it the election that shook the world while the daily mirror showed the statue of liberty clasping her face and a headline asking what have they done in lengthy editorials leader writers sought to make sense of what the times referred to as the most dramatic insurgency in american political history politics will never be the same said the times it was a political earthquake that the american political class could not bring itself to imagine the guardian also called it a global political earthquake contending that president trump is the shock heard round the world the financial times believes it marks a thunderous repudiation of the status quo while the daily telegraph sees the vote as the shattering of the liberal consensus by antipolitics every paper has views on why it happened of course and there is a considerable and somewhat surprising measure of agreement across the political spectrum the times points out that trumps base white working class men was bolstered by white women with college degrees plus nearly one third of asian and hispanic voters for all of them trump was the change candidate and that change is scary with the threat to impose stiff tariffs on chinese and mexican imports even so the times thinks britain may do well because trump has far more affinity with and affection for these islands than mr obama trumps victory was said the daily telegraph americas brexit moment his campaign was based on being the outsider who would give the political establishment a bloody nose trump is not a rightwinger in economic terms and on social policy he has mostly adopted liberal positions nor is he a leftwinger because he believes in low taxes and has been strident in his comments about immigration but his protectionism is problematic it would help no one said the telegraph least of all those americans who want mr trump to improve their lives it continued from britains point of view upholding the special relationship is more important than ever in the wake of the brexit vote none the less if president elect trump is to be true to the spirit of brexit that he has invoked then he must lead an america that reaches out to the rest of the world and does not retreat into an isolationist shell the daily mail reads trumps win as a revolt against a complacent liberal elite that includes but is not confined to media pundits the bbc bienpensant politicians and the massed ranks of luvvies it was an unmistakable warning to the wests we know best political class who have nothing but contempt for the ordinary people whose interests they profess to hold dear the paper continued they simply fail to understand voters rejection of all the isms beloved of the left or trumps appeal to the most enduring ism of them all old fashioned patriotism and that left had displayed the same stunned reaction to brexit why because voters were fed up with having their concerns about mass immigration ignored and were sick to death of a political class bailing out super rich bankers while family budgets were relentlessly squeezed for the mail the result is a warning to all liberal elites including the french germans and those who seek to frustrate brexit of the penalty for ignoring the electorate the sun urges people to calm down arguing that trumps crazier ideas should be reined in by experienced republican party advisers anyway it thinks he has some solid economic policies and could forge a new era of dialogue with vladimir putin whom he admires ah yes and he is also a fan of brexit like the mail it sees an equivalency between the vote for trump and the vote to leave the eu contending that smug lefties should condemn less and seek to understand more do they not grasp that for years voters with falling wages were ignored by politicians in washington or westminster the daily express which views every current event through its obsessive loathing for the eu is relieved that trump backs brexit the express registers its delight that nigel farage has cosied up to trump and believes it is a great relief to have a friend in the white house who respects the special relationship and is ready to put britain at the front of the queue the daily mirror as its brilliant front page indicates is downcast at trumps victory a tragedy not just for america but the rest of the world it says the keys to the globes most powerful democracy have been handed to a man who is a serial liar sexual predator and overt racist anyone who cares about the wellbeing of the united states where inequality is rife and racial tensions run high should be alarmed those who care about global security the international economy climate change and human rights should despair the mirror finds trumps domestic agenda such as his plans to dismantle obamacare expel muslims and build a wall on the mexican border distasteful it also believes he poses a risk to world security the global economy and nato but the mirror believes it necessary to understand why he won he spoke to those left behind by globalisation stuck in low paid and insecure jobs and fearful for their families future the independent believes trumps election is part of a revolution sweeping through the developed world but argues that although the brexit trump phenomenon is powerful and new it does not mean that centrist liberal politics is dead however if centrist liberalism is to survive it must learn some deep lessons and renew itself the wrong response to defeat is to blame the american voters for their stupidity or prejudice just as the wrong response to the brexit vote was to deride leavers a successful and confident liberalism has to

harnessed anti establishment anger read more politics as unusualbarack obama will host president elect donald trump at the oval office on thursday the two will meet at the white house at et as will the current and future first ladies michelle obama and melania trump hillary clinton looks set to become the second nominee to win the popular vote yet lose the electoral college in the past five presidential elections and bernie sanders has issued a statement about trumps win donald trump tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment economics establishment politics and the establishment media people are tired of working longer hours for lower wages of seeing decent paying jobs go to china and other low wage countries of billionaires not paying any federal income taxes and of not being able to afford a college education for their kids all while the rich become very much richer to the degree that mr trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country i and other progressives are prepared to work with him to the degree that he pursues racist sexist xenophobic and anti environment policies we will vigorously oppose him thousands of anti donald trump protesters shut down avenue in front of trump tower photograph spencer platt getty imagesprotests in us citiesthere were peaceful demonstrations on wednesday night against the trump victory and the rhetoric employed by the now president elect during the campaign most protesters dispersed in the early hours of thursday in new york city several thousand people marched from union square to trump tower on fifth avenue blocking streets and prompting police to assemble hasty barricades at least four arrests were made when marchers were moved on to trump international hotel and tower on central park west in downtown chicago several thousand people marched to that citys trump tower chanting not my president and our bodies our choice thousands of demonstrators were also reported in boston heading from boston common to the massachusetts statehouse other demonstrations have been taking place in philadelphia san francisco los angeles oakland seattle portland and washington dc where a crowd massed outside a newly opened trump hotel and others gathered outside the white house smaller marches were reported in st paul minnesota richmond virginia kansas city omaha nebraska and austin texas globallyasia pacific markets staged a huge recovery after an election day wobble as the region followed the lead of the us and europe there has been a rush of interest from americans in emigrating to new zealand in the past hours the website of immigration new zealand received visits from the us a huge rise on its daily average of and you should knowreports that donald trumps website no longer carries his statement promising a ban on muslims entering the us are correct but not as intriguing as they might seem a glitch discovered by social media users on polling day that allowed anyone to create their own banners on the press releases page was swiftly shut down by trump techs but the fix seems to have been taking down the whole page so no muslim ban press release but no press releases at all and yes the simpsons did predict president trump but those widely circulated pictures of cartoon trump at the presidential podium not from years ago but from last year after he announced his candidacy president donald trump meets homer simpson in photograph fox animation as president elect trump will see the daily intelligence briefings that are sent to president obama former us secretary of state madeleine albright has been talking to the bbc today programme about what happens now it is my hope that when he is given his full intelligence briefings and sits in the oval office and listens to people with foreign policy background then he will understand that statements such as the ones that he made are dangerous for the united states and that he will see that the world is not a zero sum world and that we have to and will need to cooperate with others when america talked about america first before it did not lead to the best results and so my hope is that he is a smart man and that he will absorb the information when he sees it the main thing for the president of the united states is to remember that he is president of the united states and that our interests vis a vis what the russians are doing are very important and that our friends and allies in central and eastern europe have been our friends and allies for a very very long time protests are quietening now as parts of the us tick over into thursday in new york crowds have pretty much disappeared the marchers in chicago have dispersed with just a small group remaining of the several thousands earlier reported demonstrations in oakland its still not there are still going weve had no more reports of arrests a lot will be written about how trumps victory represents a backlash of rage from the white working classes writes hadley freeman heres an alternative take weve heard enough of white rage now oh sure listen to the grievances of enraged voters but understanding them is different from indulging them and the media and politicians in the us and uk have for too long conflated the two encouraging the white victim narrative and stoking precisely the kind of nasty race baiting campaigns that led to brexit and trump both campaigns promised to turn the clock back to a time when white men were in the ascendence and both were fronted by privately educated false prophets such as nigel farage and trump absurdly
ufc welterweight champion tyron woodley is an african american athlete in the modern age of sports activism he does not take this responsibility lightly he grew up in ferguson missouri and that fact alone gives him a voice on racial matters for it was his town his neighborhood his very street where michael brown was shot and his body lay for hours baking in the summer sun as a young black man in ferguson he was racially profiled pulled over needlessly by police and once thrown in a paddy wagon with a group of friends because he says we looked like we were up to something he wrestled at the university of missouri where last november the football team went on strike in support of a black students and forced the schools president to resign he is proud of what the football players did at his alma mater but more importantly he sees the power their protest gives men like himself african americans with fame money and success to speak about topics like inequality he believes they need to use it regardless of consequences in september he listened to donald trump rambling on about ferguson as if it was some flaming ghetto and not the racially mixed suburban st louis town he knows this angered him and so he said he got to keep ferguson out of his mouth so i can keep my fist out of his mouth his comments were dutifully reported by tmz who ran a picture of him with a clenched fist and a headline that said he threatens trump his words made headlines and a few days later a crowd of mostly white fans booed him in madison square gardens theater during a press conference for saturdays ufc jon jones stripped of ufc title after one year doping ban upheld read morewoodley seemed startled by the reaction was he being booed for saying he might put is fist through trumps teeth or because hes a diligent wrestler and therefore less exciting than his kickboxing opponent stephen wonderboy thompson or because he takes months off between fights drawing criticism that he didnt deserve the ufc fight against robbie lawler that got him the title it leads some like fellow welterweight contender belal muhammad to say i dont know why the hate woodley cant help but wonder if it is something else something deeper something that still holds back black fighters in a sport that should be colorblind i think that this is my personal opinion but sometimes african american athletes are considered overly cocky he says i have some that are blatantly true about african american athletes in our sport and if i mention those thing then all of a sudden im whining im playing the victim im race baiting or its somebody else but i dont think it matters he continues because at the end of the day im the champion of the world im a successful individual and maneuvering in a culture where there are some racists i still find a way to get to the top whether i go around or weave through the wonderboy fight is the biggest of woodleys career billed as the co main event of ufc just below conor mcgregor v eddie alvarez and it has his name glowing on the garden marquee hes exactly the kind of fighter the ufc should want to promote a christian family man with four children a burgeoning acting career and a series of broadcasting jobs and yet he cant shake a feeling that as important as hes become he isnt as free as the lighter faces surrounding him on the cards promotional poster at the ufc press conference woodley watched mcgregor eviscerate the rest of the card with torrents of profane insults screamed into the roar of an adoring crowd that sees such bombast as part of mcgregors irish charm mcgregors act amused woodley even as he rolled his eyes through some of the rants mcgregor is a good businessman and he respects that he has a saying more drama more commas so if mcgregor wants to heap clever putdowns while the money falls all around them by all means let him holler but woodley knows he cant be mcgregor throwing bottles and spewing swear words doing so would only make him the angry black man and the boos would only come louder then name me one african american mixed martial artist whos been able to get away with the amount of talk conor has he says name me one you cant rampage jackson came to the ufc with a brain he came to the ufc with a huge following from being in asia with pride he was a personality before he came to the ufc you dont see them putting marketing money behind him to blow him up have you seen jon jones taken in any direction have you seen any african american athlete that appeals to the urban market actually bring that market to the mma for years woodley never made ferguson a part of his identity he figured nobody had heard of his hometown and he found it easier just to say he was fighting out of st louis but then darren wilson shot michael brown and a neighborhood erupted there were riots and looters and buildings on fire in some ways he was conflicted he knew what it was like to be a young black man in ferguson the way the police come down hard sometimes where the greatest crime an african american kid might have was the color of his skin those things are true they are happening and ferguson is notorious for it he says and yet it was also the place where he was raised the community he loved he knew every bit of that town having lived in some of the poorest sections as well as the best it hurt him to sit it burn he knew exactly the rage that many of the
in the long run i have hopedavid colorado a lifelong republican who voted for hillary clintoni am very disappointed about the result but i cant be despondent i am by nature an optimistic person so as the evening wore on and it became clear that trump was going to win i started thinking about what is actually going to happen after this in the beginning there will be dark moments and things will happen that are not good for our country or for the world im sure that the affordable care act wont survive for example but then i believe that the republicans will start to realize that they didnt really get what they wanted trump after all isnt a republican he has made that clear he just agrees with them on some things or claims to i think the first half of trumps term will go very badly for the republicans voters will become disillusioned and the midterm elections in will be disastrous for them democrats will probably end up with control of both houses of congress well get a new supreme court justice but im not worried about whether theyll be too conservative i would be more worried that they wont be qualified in the long run though i have hope i believe in checks and balancesdan california voted for donald trumpits done voted shortly after polls open on tuesday and i voted for trump reluctantly no disrespect intended to the third party candidates but a vote for an alternate candidate is in reality a vote either trump or clinton so i was faced with a vote for an incompetent or a crook i chose to vote for the incompetent in the end it wasnt the emails that sealed the deal it was the remaining hope that checks and balances would modify the impending chaos the system of checks and balances appears to be in position to better counter trump than hillary trump has already lost substantial support among the gop so he cant count on either the existing supreme court or congress to ignore him then there is the press what we see is a press overwhelmingly anti trump a vote for hillary means we can not count on the press to honestly and diligently keep the public informed of hillarys potential malfeasance nor at this point can we count on the institutions of government to counter hillary in any meaningful way so i voted for the candidate likely to lead us into the weeds without opposition the establishment underestimated the publics ragegeno pennsylvania voted for jill steinwell i think were all astounded instead of bushs predictable fifth term were facing nobody quite knows what i never thought this was a serious possibility until today but the establishment apparently made a misjudgment in underestimating the publics rage after decades of being impoverished to benefit the since the primary was rigged against the only semi progressive major candidate this was the next prominent way to give the democrats a well deserved heave im not exactly shocked at that but dismayed that so many of my fellow citizens still refused to look outside the two party duopoly or help the greens reach federal funding levels the impetus is understandable this is a rejection of the two party status quo more than an actual endorsement of trumps racism or anti intellectualism but the forces hes unleashing are volatile and damn scary as always the bigger struggle starts after voting positive change only comes from public action so theres arguably a better chance for it now than under a democratic president if theres no actual policy coming from the oval office theres space for saner voices to shape it itll be tough but at least the citizenry seems ready to seriously push back the campaign got younger voters surprisingly engaged and proved that candidates dont have to be owned by corporate money if enough ers remember the power lies with us we may have a fighting chance after all i am ashamed of how this plays with the rest of the worldsarah florida voted for hillary clintonhillary clinton lost this election because sexism enabled voters to perceive the most qualified candidate in the world as someone more reprehensible than bar none the most despicable person who has ever sought the presidency because the contingent of mostly older white americans overlooked empathy for minority groups due to their own positions of privilege because of voter apathy because we watched brexit happen and refused to heed its warning i am ashamed of how this plays with the rest of the world ashamed of my state in particular and dread what consequences it will bring the fallout of supreme court turnover alone will last long after his term is done it should go without saying that a president should not threaten the wellbeing of certain citizens as a main selling point in his campaign and my heart goes out to any individual who feels unsafe i know the cold fear you are experiencing the only way we can think to proceed is to brace for a prolonged fight ahead of us the man slated to be president has built his platform on harming the vulnerable and shouting over the voices of the oppressed if you find this rhetoric deplorable if you are kind then seize any opportunity to defy it do not wait to speak out until they come for you to clinton your loss is the nations loss i am sorry they were too blind to see the america im waking up to today scares memonica vermont voted for hillary clintonin my wildest dreams i never would have thought the public would swing so wildly away from reason as to elect someone like trump i grew up in a working class latino family im a liberal but my father was conservative ive been a single mom working multiple jobs to keep a roof over my daughters head and struggled to make ends meet

controlled asian stocks and the us dollar dropped after news of a likely trump win and bounced back slightly overnight but all eyes on the market this morning this live blog is now closed please join us over at our new campaign live blog where well be covering the fallout from the election all day donald trump wins us election the world reacts live read more irans president hassan rouhani reacted to trumps win by saying that it would not change the trajectory of his countrys foreign policy and that the uss credibility among the international community had already diminished reports saeed kamali dehghan the us election results will have no impact on the policies of the islamic republic the iranian cleric said during a wednesday meeting with his cabinet according to the semi official isna news agency because of wrong policies the position of america in the international community and worlds public opinion has diminished and the uss growing rift with europe and the world will exacerbate that position the countrys foreign minister mohammad javad zarif meanwhile said that the us had to continue respecting last years landmark nuclear agreement whose fate rests much in the hands of the new american president america has to implement the international obligation it accepted under the nuclear deal he was quoted as saying by the semi official tasnim news agency while on an official visit to romania earlier on wednesday a spokesman for irans atomic energy agency said that tehran would continue abiding by the nuclear accord despite trumps win tasnim cited behrouz kamalvandi as saying that iran is prepared for all kind of change and that the country would continue implementing the barjam iranian acronym of the joint comprehensive plan of action or the final nuclear accord tasnim which is affiliated to the elite iranian revolutionary guards saw donald trumps win as a vindication for the iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who said last week that the american businessman appeared to be the one saying the truth about the state of affairs in the us referring to trump khamenei said last week what is interesting is that the person who spoke more candidly attracted more attention from the people of america because that man spoke more candidly and more openly the people of america paid more attention to him the other party clintons camp said that he is adopting a populist method why populist it is because the people were watching him and they saw that what he was saying was correct they saw it in the realities of their life human values have been annihilated and trampled upon in that country there is racial discrimination in that country fouad izadi a political analyst sympathetic to the conservative camp in iran said trumps presidency would be better for iran than that of clintons the only advantage of having trump over clinton in regards to iran is that he would have much more difficulties in bringing together the international community in order to make obstacles for iran he told tasnim analysts such as izadi think that pressure on iran in the past was because obama had managed to persuade the uss european allies to rally behind washington in imposing sanctions on iran they think trump lacks the credibility to do so in case the nuclear deal falls apart donald trump has updated his twitter bio to reflect his new position trumps twitter bio photograph twitter jeremy corbyn mp leader of the labour party in the uk gave the following statement many in britain and elsewhere will be understandably shocked by donald trumps victory in the us presidential election the rhetoric around it and what the election result means for the rest of the world as well as america trumps election is an unmistakable rejection of a political establishment and an economic system that simply isnt working for most people it is one that has delivered escalating inequality and stagnating or falling living standards for the majority both in the us and britain this is a rejection of a failed economic consensus and a governing elite that has been seen not to have listened and the public anger that has propelled donald trump to office has been reflected in political upheavals across the world but some of trumps answers to the big questions facing america and the divisive rhetoric around them are clearly wrong i have no doubt however that the decency and common sense of the american people will prevail and we send our solidarity to a nation of migrants innovators and democrats after this latest global wake up call the need for a real alternative to a failed economic and political system could not be clearer that alternative must be based on working together social justice and economic renewal rather than sowing fear and division and the solutions we offer have to improve the lives of everyone not pit one group of people against another americans have made their choice the urgent necessity is now
during the brexit debate one comment stuck in my mind and seemed to resonate with people on both sides of the argument responding to expert claims in june that brexit would damage the uk economy leave campaigner michael gove delivered a line that sent shivers down the spines of our colleagues in all fields people in this country have had enough of experts four months on we can start to see the results of the vote to leave the european union the markets are volatile the future is uncertain and many of us are left trying to figure out what has caused the big divide in our country disillusionment austerity and misinformation have all been blamed for the polarised result so what does this mean for science for centuries britain has been at the forefront of science and engineering science is not just part of our heritage it is part of our future the uks competitiveness and economy depend on it but when mr gove made this statement it made me wonder if our relationship with experts and scientists was changing mr goves comments are believable since trust in many sectors has declined sharply in recent years the financial services compensation scheme says that trust in the financial sector was shattered by the recession trust in charities has also dipped from a rating of out of to since with people citing reasons such as aggressive fundraising tactics and the collapse of kids company as the cause of this dip trust in mps also fell after the expenses scandal according to ipsos mori these events have shaken confidence in the people and institutions we considered to be experts are scientific experts next to undergo a sharp decline in trust what could this mean for the uk and our place in the world at the british science association we monitor the relationship between science and society and its complicated on the surface trust in scientists is very high more people trust scientists to tell the truth than the police or the clergy according to ipsos moris veracity index the institute for government also found that most of us want experts to be involved in policy decisions and for their evidence to be used by politicians delve a bit deeper and you find that this trust is less robust than it first seems our research shows that only of the population actively seek out scientific information media content or events around are open to science but dont actively seek it out and completely avoid it with most of our citizens disengaged from science is their trust in experts resilient this low level of engagement suggests that our relationship with science and expertise is based largely on blind trust we allow scientists and scientific institutions to get on with their work often with public funding without much questioning or scrutiny we rely on science to police itself but who can blame us when science is so inaccessible an academic article in a non open access journal can cost more than to read funding decisions are made behind closed doors and many scientists are not recognised or rewarded for their engagement with people outside their profession this blind trust has been analysed by sociologist anthony giddens as civil inattention many of us have no choice but to trust experts because it is difficult to challenge people who have more specialist knowledge than us events such as the mmr controversy gm food protests the bse crisis and climategate then come as a shock to those in the scientific establishment who are not used to being challenged from these examples its clear that people get involved and question things when they matter to them or when their trust in others is eroded on the back of a public outcry over mps expenses charity fundraising and the financial sector new regulators have been established to push for responsible conduct but its not yet clear whether the recent drop in trust for these groups will force them to re evaluate the way they function it has taken a crisis in these areas to force good practice back in the world of science many of our colleagues and partners are concerned that a scandal will destroy the seemingly fragile trust many have for researchers and experts at the british science association we think its time to get ahead of the curve and make some radical changes were working to enable people to access question and scrutinise research we think its a fast track to accelerated innovation a democratic society and stronger citizenship we want to see a population that is keen to actively engage as critical friends with institutions that are open to challenge and scrutiny we organised the huxley summit to bring non scientists into the leadership and decision making structures of science we hope that by bringing together leaders from across our society we will blur the lines that separate science from business politics media and the arts with provocative talks from speakers such as rt hon the lord david willetts former science minister dame sally davies chief medical officer karen blackett chair of mediacom and sacha romanovitch ceo of grant thornton uk we hope the summit will spark the conversations i believe are needed to move our country forward in these uncertain times all of the summit speeches will be made available online so that these conversations can continue we named the summit after thomas henry huxley a self trained biologist who in gave his ferocious support to darwins theory of evolution at the bsas annual meeting crucially the debate included voices from science alongside those from religion and other areas huxley fought for a radical new idea against a powerful establishment built a network of supporters and pushed for what he believed in we hope the summit will provide a platform for leaders of innovation to spark debate and build trust in the century we at the british science association envision a world where everyone can

unexpected win which he said had proven that journalists and intellectuals were the true demagogues who were anchored to a world that no longer exists grillo also pointed out trump had been called sexist homophobic and populist much like the five star movement but that the establishment had failed to realise that people no longer read newspapers and did not watch television for news the real

eu leaders are planning a meeting in december to discuss brexit without the british prime minister the guardian has learnt the uks global diplomatic and security influence is at risk if it cuts itself off from the single market and continues to denigrate foreigners one of britains most senior civil servants has warned as patrick wintour reports sir simon fraser who was permanent under secretary at the foreign office until last year said britains position near or at the top diplomatic table was at stake after the vote to leave the european union he said there is already evidence of potential self harm in our behaviour to foreign people the reported spike in hate crime the insensitive comments of some british politicians and the shocking press coverage of the legal judgment on article i hope our political leaders will show more skill and wisdom in the next chapter of our european relationships than over the last decade which was strewn with diplomatic errors and misjudgments anti gay laws in commonwealth countries are totally out of date highly inappropriate and should be changed the uks deputy foreign secretary sir alan duncan has said anne turley a labour mp is pressing the government to increase the penalties for animal cruelty offences noting that research shows people who harm animals are more likely to go on to commit crimes such as domestic abuse thats all from me for today thanks for the comments theresa may was not invited to a european union summit in bratislava soon after she became prime minister she will have to get used to it eu leaders are planning a meeting in december to discuss brexit without the british prime minister the guardian has learnt donald tusk the president of the european council wants the eus remaining member states to discuss brexit around the time of an eu summit scheduled for december according to two brussels sources the british prime minister would attend the eu summit but would not be invited to separate brexit talks the third time the uk has been excluded from leaders talks since it joined the bloc in eu leaders met without david cameron soon after the brexit vote and held the summit in slovakia without theresa may in september the meeting is a sign the are intensifying preparations on britains eu exit ahead of article which may has promised to trigger by the end of march once the uk fires the starting gun on talks the eu will spend four to eight weeks drawing up detailed guidelines for negotiations a list of red lines that could cover everything from the single market to the status of gibraltar that work hasnt started yet but tusk wants to start preparing the ground one senior eu diplomat told the guardian the guidelines would be a trade off between speed and precision if the guidelines remain flexible they are easier to adopt if they are very detailed they are likely to take more time brussels diplomats are keenly following brexit fallout in the uk some say they have been shocked by the uk media response to the high court decision on parliaments role and the governments limited defence of british judges the welsh governments law officer has strongly criticised the attacks on the brexit high court judgement and explained why he wants to be able to make representations at the supreme court hearing assembly member mick antoniw counsel general for wales said the judgement had been deliberately misrepresented by some he said there are those who have deliberately chosen to misrepresent the facts to challenge the independence of the judiciary one of the cornerstones of our democratic parliamentary system the reporting of this judgment in some newspapers was frankly a disgrace and an insult to the good name of journalism the democratic structure of the uk and indeed this assembly is built on a foundation of the rule of law and the independence of our judicial system the tragic recent history of europe is littered with examples of countries that overthrew the rule of law and undermined the independence of the courts that road is not a democratic one and leads only in one direction i would hope those who may have made comments and statements in haste will want to reflect explaining to the assembly in cardiff why he wants to appear in person at the supreme court hearing antoniw said i consider that this case raises issues of profound importance not only in relation to the concept of parliamentary sovereignty but also in relation to the wider constitutional arrangements of the united kingdom and the legal framework for devolution i think it is of paramount importance to emphasise at this point that despite the political furore surrounding it and the frankly alarming tone of much of the press coverage as the high court itself said this case involves a pure question of law it is not concerned with the merits and demerits of leaving the european union and the politics surrounding that the sole legal question at issue is whether the uk government can as a matter of constitutional law use the prerogative powers to give notice of withdrawal from the european union in seeking to intervene in any appeal the welsh government will seek to reinforce the importance of parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law core established principles of british constitutional law antoniw emphasised that the welsh government was not seeking to reverse the result of the referendum he said having outlined what the case is about i should also make a comment on what it is not about the first minister has made crystal clear and i repeat that sentiment now the welsh government respects the result of the referendum and this is absolutely not about overturning that decision the legal commentator joshua rozenberg has posted a good story on his facebook page he says that liz truss the lord chancellor and justice secretary is being sued by six high court judges for
a report into the met polices investigation into an alleged westminster paedophile ring has identified failings the most grave failings identified included officers misleading a judge to get search warrants believing the complainant known as nick for too long publicly stating the allegations were credible and true and not closing the investigation sooner the main complainant whose allegations led to the met investigation has been referred for criminal investigation the man known only as nick will be investigated by northumbria police regarding an allegation of perverting the course of justice five police officers have been referred to the police watchdog the ipcc including det asst commissioner steve rodhouse the senior officer in scotland yards investigation rodhouse released a statement saying he did not believe he or any of his officers in operation midland had committed any misconduct the met commissioner bernard hogan howe accepted there had been serious failings and publicly apologised to lord bramall and harvey proctor who were among those accused he also apologised to lady brittan the widow of leon brittan who was also accused proctor said that he had accepted hogan howes apology but lamented the irreversible impact on his life and that of his friends and family the nspcc warned that the report could prevent victims coming forward in future harvey proctor said he has accepted an apology from hogan howe but that the inquiry had had an irreversible impact on his life family and friends today without prejudice i accepted an unreserved apology from sir bernard hogan howe the mps commissioner in respect of operation midland however i have informed him the detrimental impact of the investigation on the life of my family friends and myself was irreversible this apology does not detract from the adverse effect and hurt of operation midland on my life and me personally i hope the police in such cases in future will always test the credibility of a complainant before someone is thrust into the public limelight my efforts in challenging the metropolitan police service from the beginning over months ago have not been for selfish reasons but in the hope that anybody now and in the future can be spared the trauma that i have experienced i regret that it has taken someone in a high profile position albeit unwanted to make an impact but it is a moral victory for all potential defendants from all walks of life i am proud of the little role i have played i hope the police will learn from this so the glaring mistakes identified from operation midland will not be repeated i have always had huge respect for the policing of our country and admiration for the work police officers do this is undiminished i hope the home office will look at these matters carefully and bring forward proposals to amend the current system where a complainant even a fantasist and liar can be given life long anonymity and financially benefit while the alleged suspect is routinely fingered and named by the police and in my case left destitute harvey proctor photograph jonathan brady pa the nspcc has expressed fears the report could prevent victims coming forward a spokeswoman for the charity said lessons must be learned from this sorry episode and it is extremely disappointing that this report has not been published in full it takes unimaginable bravery for victims to come forward we are concerned that this reports recommendations could undermine the confidence of victims to do so and we cannot allow it to result in a return to the dark days when we looked the other way and failed to confront the horrors of abuse and bring those responsible to justice it makes very difficult reading for the metropolitan police who despite good intentions at the outset failed to admit they had got it wrong when it became clear that the allegations were unfounded the closure of the investigation amid immense media fanfare did a huge disservice to those who have been abused in childhood and risked denting the publics willingness to take action to protect children henriques said it was unlikely that the government would pass an anonymity before charge law because it would enrage tabloid editors however the government should pass an anonymity before arrest law he said in another recommendation which will be challenged by some in the media henriques says police should not release any details such as age or where a suspect lives to the press or the public before an arrest bail search or interview of a suspect at present the age and the town where a suspect lives is often disclosed to the media henriques also reviewed another investigation operation vincente an inquiry into a separate allegation that lord brittan raped a year old woman the retired judge found it involved a grave error of judgment and it was obvious while the peer was still alive that there was not enough evidence to charge him he said it was also manifest that he was very poorly i am in no doubt that he should have been informed during his lifetime that no action would be taken in response met commissioner sir bernard hogan howe said the case against brittan should have been told before he died that the cps full code test had not been met and that there was no intention to prosecute him leon brittan photograph pa deputy assistant commissioner steve rodhouse the senior officer in charge of operation midland is one of five officers referred to police regulator the ipcc in the light of todays report rodhouse has responded in a statement he said i do not believe that i or indeed any officer within operation midland have committed any misconduct while it is right that lessons should be learned from operation midland i want to emphasise that my colleagues and i investigated the allegations made with the best of intentions indeed i am grateful that sir richard himself recorded that the operation midland officers conducted
impartiality lies at the very heart of good journalism avoiding bias is something on which respectable media outlets pride themselves this is laudable as robust debate is vital for a healthy media and by extension an informed society but when the weight of scientific evidence points incontrovertibly one direction doggedly reporting both sides equally can result in misleading coverage the bbc provided a high profile example of this in coming in for harsh criticism in a trust report which singled out their undue attention to marginal opinion on the subject of man made climate change among other issues despite the overwhelming scientific evidence that human activity is driving climate change the report found that several bbc shows fell victim to an over rigid application of editorial guidelines on impartiality resulting in far too much airtime for climate change deniers a follow up report published in concluded that this key conclusion still resonates today this situation known as false balance arises when journalists present opposing view points as being more equal than the evidence allows but when the evidence for a position is virtually incontrovertible it is profoundly mistaken to treat a conflicting view as equal and opposite by default with respect to man made climate change the bbc is far from the only outlet skewing their coverage in the name of balance and global coverage on climate science remains exceptionally off kilter with the scientific consensus part of the problem is that good science reporting requires a keen understanding of scientific method and the importance of evidence in the absence of this dubious views can perpetuate in andrew wakefield held a press conference claiming a link between autism and the mmr vaccine these allegations received scant attention from dedicated science journalists who were familiar with anti vaccination tropes and acutely aware of the paucity of evidence for wakefields claims anti mmr activists instead targeted their stories at non science journalists selling them as human interest pieces this strategy was devastatingly effective as author and academic ben goldacre recounts a staggering of science stories in were mmr related with over of these pieces penned by non science journalists in goldacres words suddenly we were getting comment and advice on complex matters of immunology and epidemiology from people who would more usually have been telling us about a funny thing that happened with the au pair on the way to a dinner party editors and writers who lacked knowledge of the requisite science fell into a default assumption that two mutually opposed views must have equal merit but the lack of evidence for such ominous claims was still rather telling and investigative journalist brian deer began to scrutinise wakefield deers work eventually exposed financial conflicts of interest and unethical conduct and in time wakefields mmr claims were exposed as false since then a wealth of data has continued to show the mmr vaccine to be completely safe the consequences of the needless panic however were anything but faced with conflicting reports and unable to gauge their respective veracity parents opted to not vaccine their children with deadly results and an on going resurgence of measles worldwide none of this is intended to pin the blame for these deleterious consequences on journalists and media outlets alone but the fact that anti vaccine activists could exploit the ideal of impartiality is a worrying one the assumption that good journalism requires mutually opposed views to be treated as equally valid simply doesnt hold when the overwhelming weight of evidence points resolutely in one directionit does however require a certain amount of expertise to gauge this and for media outlets discerning between valid science and pseudoscience can be a difficult task journalists are under tremendous pressure to produce engaging copy with tight deadlines one way of reducing false balance and poor reportage is to put scientific experts in direct contact with those covering the story and organisations such as the science media centre and sense about science have had considerable success in such endeavours i strongly recommend that scientists register their expertise with these groups to help stem the tide of misinformation scientific public engagement is helpful but the question of when and how to engage is rife with complications i encountered this recently when an irish radio station asked me to discuss the anti vaccine documentary vaxxed with its star the aforementioned andrew wakefield the producer claimed a rival broadcaster had offered him a slot with a sympathetic host and no counterpoint and that there was strong local public pressure for him to appear i grudgingly agreed to provide a counter with the caveat that i would be allowed articulate why giving him a platform to air discredited views was itself unethical the experience was a frustrating one predictably generating more heat than light this is the crux of the issue with false balance no matter how noble the intention of media outlets presenting science and pseudoscience in an adversarial format gives a false impression that an issue is scientifically contentious worse again it gives free rein for dubious motivations to masquerade as scientific opinion whether the issue is vaccination climate change alt med or anything else presenting an evidence free belief as being on equal footing with an established scientific understanding is corrosive to public understanding i asked scientist author and broadcaster simon singh for his take on this unfortunate trend and in his view such media requests are as time wasting as they are inept every situation is different but i am increasingly declining interviews about say homeopathy because it is not my job to provide false balance and thereby justify bad journalism most recently a bbc local radio station wanted to have a jolly chat about cupping in light of its use by olympic athletes i declined because the piece was inevitably going to be simon says it is rubbish cupping therapists says it works for some people patient says it worked for them hosts says that opinion is divided but isnt
until recently black friday was the must do shopping event for british retailers keen to cash in on the mass of frenzied shoppers looking for a bargain but the chinese version singles day held on november and created to celebrate single people is gathering pace potentially presenting a bigger opportunity for british retailers than its us counterpart the sheer scale of the market was spent on singles day in combined with the acute chinese appetite for british goods has opened up a significant new sales avenue last year topshop saw its sales surge by over compared to singles day in these results clearly indicate how impactful this online calendar moment has become and as a key focus market for the brand we see as a great way to raise brand awareness and conversion in china says a topshop spokesperson topshop is not alone in seeing the annual event as a chance to gain a foothold in the chinese market more british retailers are cashing in on the worlds biggest online event says jason yu general manager of kantar worldpanel china using e commerce as a way to enter the market is relatively low risk approach and they can understand better the appetite of the chinese consumers and learn how to operate in china without substantial investment in opening stores alibaba group the e commerce giant which trademarked the term and made singles day synonymous with people treating themselves to gifts last year recorded sales of during the hour event meifang chen international business development at alibaba group echoes yus thoughts if a british retailer wants to enter the thriving chinese market and engage with its consumers delivers both excellent product accessibility for consumers and massive exposure for brands cashing in on the shopping bonanzait is an approach taken by waitrose which partnered with chinese marketing and logistics specialist avenue to start exporting to china in april this year selling through the royal mail shop on chinas tmall although weve had a modest introduction into the market the potential for waitrose in china is huge says nigel roberts waitrose growth and development manager singles day is a big occasion for consumers and businesses in china and has the potential to give the products we offer more exposure and provide another opportunity to test demand for our brand waitrose has already expanded its product offering from items to more than on tmall and its first singles day will doubtless provide more valuable insight into what tickles the fancy of chinese consumers chen says part of the success of singles day comes from the diversity of products on offer last years broke eight product sale world records these included selling litres of milk mobile handsets watches and televisions it is certainly all embracing consumer healthcare start up make a dent ventures sells tint its teeth whitening product to chinese consumers via tmall mark curry founder and director at mad ventures says singles day will act as both a great launch pad to showcase tint to the chinese market and as an opportunity to drive trial of the new product curry was formerly a senior buyer at boots which participated in black friday with huge success but he acknowledges the potential of singles day to eclipse the event in importance it is common knowledge that black friday is now the highest grossing sales day in the uk but this may get superseded by singles day because the concept of gifting feels a lot more meaningful than an arbitrary sales day building awarenessyu also believes singles day will gain the edge on black friday in part because more british retailers are beginning to sell their wares via tmall according to kantar worldpanel approximately of chinese consumers already shop in the e commerce stores and given that singles day presents an enormous opportunity for retailers to present their offers to the chinese shopper we believe eventually it will become a bigger opportunity though it may take years for british retailers to build more online awareness a key point is knowing what to discount and by how much during the event independent british jewellery brand lily charmed works with avenue and began trading in china over two years ago it is also gearing up for its first singles day director jonathan lee says the company will heavily discount its range to ensure a decent share of voice among all the other discounts available on that day rightly or wrongly consumers are not only searching for but expect deep discounts so you have to give them what they want says lee unlike any other country its only because of the sheer scale of the chinese market that we can offer such discounts others such as multi website retailer the hut group which has been investing in the asian market for over two years and has participated in singles day before will be running offers including off haircare and up to off skincare wing chan group marketing director at the hut group says the company has previously seen massive spikes on singles day in china and expects to see at least double the sales on beauty products compared to last year the holland barrett franchise is also confident the company began trading on tmall a few months before singles day last year generating close to in online and offline sales during the event it is hoping to hit the mark this year with alibaba alone racking up sales of on singles day in up on its likely that revenues this year will rocket once again this year attracting international brands the pickings could be rich for british retailers going forward chen points out that singles day is bigger than the entire black friday weekend including cyber monday and says the increase in the number of international brands joining has been significant with dyson coming on board in and macys hugo boss and united biscuits joining the event in he attributes some of its success to the growth in technology

concerned at the lack of access to the attorney generals documents he says arguably the government is wilfully obstructing the senate mckim goes to this point contained within the report over access to documents the committee has sought access to any documents and correspondence which would clarify the nature of any consultation that occurred with the solicitor general it has made requests for information from the attorney generals department that are relevant to the terms of reference this includes an order for the department to produce documents sent on october the department has advised the committee that it has provided relevant documents to the attorney general and that these are still being considered with a view to the attorney general making a claim of public interest immunity the committee is concerned that the attorney general has only been prepared to provide documents that could in some way be construed to substantiate the assertion that the direction was substantively discussed at the meeting on november despite other participants contradicting this claim the committee has not been provided with any of the documents it has asked for pertaining to the direction in his submission the attorney general refers to handwritten meeting notes taken by his staff which merely refer to the process of obtaining advice as defined by the direction and guidance note no documents have been produced to substantiate the actual consultation process and drafting of the directionmckim wants a senate select committee created to assess whether they are reasonable claims it is time for the senate to stand up and be counted because we are being treated by contempt by the government mckim says he is talking to labor and other senators about the issue he gives no indication whether he has the numbers for the committee the opposition and greens dominated the senate committee so there is always a dissenting report from government members government senators say the inquiry set up by labor destroyed the career of the solicitor general this is from the dissenting report during the course of the inquiry government members came to the conclusion that the position of the solicitor general had become untenable the solicitor generals subsequent decision to resign was in the view of government members of the committee commendable and perhaps an unavoidable consequence of the public inquiry government members regret that this inquiry set up by the labor party to attack senator the hon george brandis attorney general of the commonwealth of australia has in the end destroyed the career of the solicitor general who was himself appointed by the previous labor administration government members of the committee are concerned that the majority on the committee have used the senate committee process and thereby the taxpayers indulgence to pursue a partisan political agenda recommendation the senate disallow the amendment to the direction or the attorney general withdraw it immediately and that the guidance note be revised accordingly recommendation that the attorney general provide within three sitting days an explanation to the senate responding to the matters raised in this report recommendation that the senate censure the attorney general for misleading the parliament and failing to discharge his duties as attorney general appropriately senator ian macdonald is criticising gleeson for telling the committee hearing details about advice he has given without the permission of his clients ie the ag he says the sg is a senior public servant and should abide by the rules of his job paul karp pratt brandis said not just that he consulted but that he consulted with the solicitor general auspol auslawnovember paul karp pratt the attorney general was not informed the direction was wrong in
it was while gareth southgate was looking ahead to englands game against scotland and reiterating the importance of emotional control in these fixtures that his mind went back to euro and the kind of sketch that probably felt perfectly normal then bearing in mind the identity of the man around whom the story revolves those were the days when paul gascoignes team mates felt a collective sense of duty to help in the carefully chosen words of southgate calm him down or to be brutal about it get him out of our hair for a couple of hours and one ploy was to send him fishing in the afternoon with david seaman knowing the only occasion when englands most talented player could be guaranteed to sit still was if he had a fishing rod in his hand on the day of england scotland it was out of the question and gascoigne a rangers player at the time was hyped to the point his team mates were starting to think he might spontaneously combust im not sure emotional control was his style southgate recalls with an element of unmistakable fondness so bryan robson made him a little fishing rod with a line dangling from it not a real fishing rod but something they created out of the stuff they found in the medical skip and there was gazza sitting on the side of the big bath in the wembley dressing rooms with his fishing rod pretend fishing because that was the only time he ever relaxed jack wilshere back in england squad to face scotland and spain read moregod knows what he was actually fishing for but presumably whatever might have been floating in the bath which was probably more pleasant before the game than it was after funny but that was the sort of bizarre thing that would go on when gazza was around it did the trick bearing in mind gascoignes contribution to a victory included an expertly manoeuvred up and over to put colin hendry on his backside followed by a right footed volley past andy goram for what was later voted the goal of the century in one television poll the celebration was not bad either lying on the ground while his team mates squirted drink into his mouth to re enact one of the more infamous nights involving englands players only he could have done that celebration southgate says i mean how does it even cross your mind oh yes got to do the dentists chair that goal will feature prominently in the video montage the football association has put together on southgates request for englands players before fridays world cup qualifier and an occasion the caretaker manager is absolutely determined will not pass with the opposition having a better understanding of the sporting enmity that exists between the sides one story southgate recalled was of the wembley crowd cheering patrick kluiverts consolation goal in englands defeat of holland their next match at euro after the scotland win on the basis it meant the dutch qualified on goal difference at the expense of scotland the video regales englands finest moments against the old enemy going back to the with an unapologetic bias that means the players will not be getting a history lesson about jim baxters ball control or the scottish invasion of wembley it does not southgate confirmed feature any keepy uppies or anybody sitting on the crossbars southgate it may be no surprise to learn was not among the players who accompanied gascoigne to a hong kong club having been given a free night by terry venables and were photographed in various states of disrepair strapped into a leather chair while tequila was poured down their throats the man now angling to become englands full time manager is willing to admit it was a close call that was the night terry had cut the squad southgate says he had left out ugo ehiogu wisey dennis wise peter beardsley and a couple of others rob lee and jason wilcox i had got pally with stuart pearce and i said to him were having a night out with the lads he said nah in my experience of england if you go out for a drink its as if nobody has ever drunk before in their lives my advice is swerve it id just got in the squad sometimes advice like that is good twenty years on southgate bristled slightly when it was put to him that england post euro and scotland years since competing in a major tournament had never met with the two teams at a lower ebb history sometimes paints a slightly rosier picture of the past he countered there have been tournaments in the past when we havent qualified there have been matches and tournaments when i was growing up with defeats that were considered the worst ever i was with gordon taylor the chief executive of the professional footballers association on saturday and he said i can remember losing to america and everybody was saying the same thing then maybe we colour the past with a different view but i dont think englands games in the past were always as great as our memories think they were the point remains that the qualifier is one england dare not lose on the back of a traumatic few months and however much southgate tried to argue his own position was immaterial it is a huge occasion for him personally given the common perception that he will be offered the job full time on the back of a strong performance the last game at wembley was an incredible atmosphere probably as good as ive seen at the new wembley he said recalling englands win in august its a special fixture these are the games you want to be involved in and if i go back to my days working as a tv broadcaster the viewing figures will be five times that of a premier league
yeah get a picture of the horse the winning horse but what we really want is drunk chicks any particular sort of drunk chicks yeah chicks off their faces with their skirts over their heads or their face mashed into the grass or spewing into a de bortoli gift bag or mounting bins assaulting cops or simulating fellatio with an empty pringles container or falling over just get em falling over preferably on each other get tonnes of them they want to run them in uk too ok and the blokes if a chick is mounting them or if they are covered in rubbish like literally all over and an ibis is eating their face off oright the shackles of the rape survivors leading a new wave of activism read moreim imagining a conversation between a tabloid news editor and a photo agency ahead of melbourne cup day the real sport is not the horse race anymore its the drunk chicks after its the hot lukewarm and cold messes ive not read an interview with the jockey who won the cup but ive seen at least two interviews with the year old bin rider a racegoer who climbed on to a bin and pretended to ride it like a horse pictures of her went viral on the internet she told the daily mail its just so embarrassing all my familys going to see it i loved her she looked like she was having fun and she wasnt hurting anyone but she had to take down her social media accounts after receiving nasty comments from strangers after the pictures were published she told the daily mail she did not expect to be photographed while at the cup lol how naive she was a woman having an uninhibited good time of course in this day and age without her consent she would be photographed put on the internet and publicly shamed throughout history public shame has been used to punish women who had not preserved their honour in a primitive pre technical age the criminal was place in a public seat in a town square for instance where they could be subject to scrutiny judgment and the mob after the second world war women had their heads shaved and were paraded through the towns of france and germany as a punishment for consorting with nazis shaving the heads of women as a public humiliation has biblical origins and has been used as a punishment in europe since the dark ages nakedness or semi undress was often packaged as part of public punishment the exposed body itself becoming another site for shame now women who are seen to have abandoned their honour are shamed in the global public square of the internet the photographs are taken from angles which emphasise exposure from the front when she is on the ground and her skirt has ridden up or from the side when her dress straps have fallen down her shoulders and her chest is partially exposed women who may have agonised about their outfit spent a tonne on their hat and hair are as depicted in these photos brought low by their own hand often the photos are devoid of context have you tried wearing uncomfortable shoes for hours on end and then walking through the turf you dont have to be drunk to fall over even gina rinehart fell over and the photographers were there to capture it just as they captured her pre fall showing off her curves in a white dress on the internet we are invited to scrutinise and judge these degraded women the comments section below is a good place to throw metaphorical rotten fruit im sure there were lots of men getting trolleyed but type drunk people at the melbourne cup into a search engine and the majority of pictures will be of women where are the blokes where is the equal opportunity shaming as a society were used to the drunk man at the races at the football at the pub but the drunk woman still holds our attention and in some quarters is still blamed for any crime committed against her while intoxicated complicated feelings are unleashed french philosopher rene girard was writing about societys need for a scapegoat years ago the scapegoat is a representative who must be subject to violence in order to restore order out of chaos societies need for somebody to blame is deeply coded he could have been writing about the internet age when he wrote they are all going to gather against the same opponent they gather speeds and ultimately one victim must be killed and this is what i call the scapegoat we have to have a scapegoat on melbourne cup day because we get off our collective tits and the results can be ugly its good to have someone who is perhaps in worse shape than us whom we can hide behind on melbourne cup day we create an environment all around the nation that is conducive to people getting really drunk the melbourne cup bin rider told the daily mail that free champagne on the day had contributed to her inebriated state the birdcage the posh enclosure at the melbourne cup is a drunks dream with an unlimited open bar and specialty cocktails if you are with friends trackside or in the carpark it is considered good hospitality to have an inexhaustible supply of alcohol you can be a thousand miles away from the melbourne cup and alcohol is still flowing we create these conditions for drunkenness and then expect women to self regulate and act like something from the in the ladies lounge sipping quietly on their shandies well that horse has bolted if drunk women at the races so shocks us then shouldnt we dig deeper and ask why it is that we celebrate in this way and why it is that we drink too much and why is booze and sport intertwined and why
donald trump lies like he tweets erratically at all hours sometimes in malice and sometimes in self contradiction and sometimes without any apparent purpose at all the guardian has catalogued more than falsehoods made by the republican nominee over the last days and sorted them according to theme hillary clinton has been caught in more than a dozen falsehoods of her own for instance about her email practices and her past support for the trans pacific partnership but clinton often makes her falsehoods in dense legalese making them hard to pin a motive on many could as easily be errors as lies careless exaggeration or deliberately misleading claims trump on the other hand will say wrong when he hears his own quotes his own lawyers met him in pairs to counteract his lying court documents show he has invented false statistics fictional videos and sex tapes and a nonexistent man named john miller to talk about his sex life months of fact checking however reveal methods and whether he means to or not trumps guide to success through lying fbi director new hillary clinton emails show no criminal wrongdoing read moredegrade and destroyfor decades trump has described america and its leaders in apocalyptic terms he thought ronald reagan weak and a disaster he lambasted george hw bush and bill clintons policies and after supporting george w bushs iraq invasion quickly dismissed that war as a mess in trumps world crime is always rising and african americans are living in hell migrants are flooding in and they bring violence civilian and military leaders are always clueless except when they love him we have no idea who refugees or undocumented migrants are and they take our jobs trumps vision of the us has been for decades one of dystopia he even described the as a crisis worse than the great depression but amid all this desolation trump gains three things he fuels doubt and fear leaving people vulnerable he denigrates his opposition en masse blaming the world on them and he raises himself up above the nonexistent wreckage embiggen big leaguelike a man who once took a joke about the size of his hands too hard trump spends a lot of time trying to look as large as possible from his never proven worth to crowds at his rallies and his success in meaningless internet polls this self inflation is pierced throughout by paperwork in march the guardian found that trump valued a new york golf course at in one document and at in a court filing on thursday the new york times reported similarly huge discrepancies in his reported income the washington post has shown repeatedly that trumps boasts of charitable giving have virtually nothing behind them he has also falsely bragged of endorsements from federal agencies and claimed many environmental awards and tried the ploy in reverse he has called the millions his father gave him as a small loan and portrayed his loss in as an example of smart tax avoidance this sort of exaggeration is a common sales technique overstate the value of a product to make it more attractive and assume it will be bargained downward in february trump confessed everythings negotiable about his statements then quickly said building a wall on the southern border was not negotiable the equivalent of a liar saying everything i say is false but not that shout at the messenger facebook twitter pinterest donald trump on hillary clinton and the fbi shes protectedwhenever in doubt trump attacks what he calls the dishonest media accusing reporters of bias inaccuracy and a failure to show the size of his rallies he ignores that reporters quote him extensively call his campaign for comment interview his supporters his rivals campaign and independent voters and experts he often cites news stories about clinton and even praised fact checkers in a presidential debate for catching her in a falsehood at every rally trump says the cameras refuse to show his audience even though his campaign forces cameras to stay within a small pen where they pan to show the crowd as anyone at his rallies or watching online can see only one camera at each event stays fixed on trump the shared pool camera whose footage networks share and which stays on trump so as not to miss his speech last week nbcs katy tur a target for criticism from the podium noted that trump has joked in private with reporters about how he understands how the pool camera works this is a shtick that he does to rile up his base she said to give them an excuse for polls that might not be in his favor to give them an excuse to berate someone thats not donald trump trumps scorched earth insults like his attacks on other institutions try to delegitimize authority and leave only himself in its place but while most americans still respect other institutions that trump has demeaned the press was vulnerable decades of cable news punditry had already diminished opinion of the press and the internet has sapped major newspapers of their powers to compete with openly partisan sites fake news and social media networks trump tried to fill the vacuum conspiracy smoke fire not requiredtrumps most famous false conspiracy about barack obamas birthplace and who started birtherism is only one of many there was ted cruzs father and jfks assassin drawn from a tabloid with ties to trump the climate change hoax that was invented by the chinese the muslims who cheered september the vaccines that cause autism the miss universe sex tape the political correctness of san bernardino the secret muslim president and his secret terror agenda and the antisemitism tinged plot of bankers and the media this category includes what the toronto stars daniel dale calls pointless lies the oddest of trumps falsehoods these claims include an

at a cost of to put a chill in the air during texas rangers games it would surely go down as the sports worlds most expensive air conditioning bill voters in the city that is home to the rangers go to the polls on tuesday to decide whether to finance a new major league baseball stadium that would replace a popular facility that is barely two decades old the election raises the question of how much a team is really worth to its community and whether just a few days after year old wrigley field basked in the world series spotlight stadiums are becoming almost as disposable as their corporate naming rights globe life park then known as the ballpark in arlington opened in for less than when a certain george w bush was the clubs managing general partner local taxpayers were on the hook for most of the cost as the ringer pointed out bush called it a monument to baseball and the team president at the time said it was being built for years it may not last these days the team is emphasising what it lacks air conditioning a retractable roof and capacity crowds the rangers want to move to a new smaller stadium across the street by even though eight years remain on their deal to play at globe life the projects cost is estimated at voters must decide if arlington will contribute through sales hotel and car rental taxes with the team responsible for any cost overruns the heat and humidity can undoubtedly be oppressive and the rangers average attendance this year of was some below capacity even though the team were the runaway winners of the american league west but the park still looks smart and is one of mlbs more visually appealing venues both inside and out with a design that evokes old time charm and texan touches such as giant stone longhorns on the facade the cowboys play only half a mile away at at t stadium arlington funded about a quarter of that arenas cost the perceived shelf life of stadiums is getting shorter and shorter it used to be that if you had a stadium that wasnt at least or years old you had to be crazy to propose building a new one but now all kinds of teams are proposing that said neil demause co author of a book on publicly funded stadiums field of schemes suddenly the idea of whats considered obsolete has gotten reframed he said its really just about at what point do you have the chutzpah to demand a new one andy prior media liaison for the save our stadium campaign expects a close outcome on tuesday last month a wfaa fort worth star telegram poll found respondents were split evenly with for and against only in texas can on a high school football stadium ever be justified read moreim a third generation rangers fan and when i heard the plans on the news way back in the beginning of may early june i was really flabbergasted he said weve had the texas rangers here in arlington for years now its always been played outdoors theres absolutely nothing wrong with the current ballpark its one of the best in the major leagues the cult of the new stadium is not restricted to baseball the georgia dome has twice hosted the super bowl since it opened in but next year it is scheduled to be reduced to rubble the site destined to be a parking lot for mercedes benz stadium the new home of the atlanta falcons nfl franchise in general these days demause said i think theres a little bit more awareness and a little bit more public opposition just because some of the demands are getting so outrageous because the timespans so short i think the fact that the arlington vote is expected to be close is significant because this is a city that has voted before with no problem for stadium subsidies and its a campaign where the rangers and the stadium advocates are outspending the opponents tremendously changing fan expectations the growth in luxury seating and the success of the new retro oriole park at camden yards in the early helped inspire a ballpark construction boom only current ballparks are older than the rangers of the major league stadiums half have been built this millennium if we include suntrust park the atlanta braves new digs from they are leaving turner field after only years also for a smaller venue am i happy that theyre going to have a new ballpark well if it makes them bigger better and more competitive sure but i was stunned when i heard that a deal had been cut fairly quickly and behind the scenes for a ballpark to be built in arlington years and years and years before the current deal ends said michael cramer the rangers president from structure is good viewing lines are good theres plenty of room for concessions and places to sell merchandise plenty of suites it had all of the features that you never would have found in the old breed of ballparks he said to say theyre doing it to be competitive because its hot in texas wait a minute they didnt know it was hot in texas in still cramer understands arlingtons desperation to ensure the club stays in the city and believes it will be able to absorb the costs if i were a voter i would vote for this he said arlingtons mayor jeff williams is spearheading the campaign for a yes vote on november he argues that the plan does not call for new taxes detractors call this claim misleading since taxes that would have ceased would instead continue at issue is not only fans perspiration tolerance levels but the fear that a no will encourage the team to leave dealing a blow to the local economy and the citys prestige williams told the texas tribune
how did donald trump launch his presidential campaign during an episode of the apprentice he rode down an escalator into the lobby of a skyscraper bearing his name trump used his to criticise mexican

the selling of the american self and its dream of a better future began with the declaration of independence and founding father benjamin franklin who once observed that god helps them that help themselves selling and salesmanship pervade american life and literature and exactly years after first appeared it comes as no surprise to find a distorted and sickeningly corrupt version of dale carnegies homespun and inspirational self help manual flourishing in the presidential campaign of donald trump bestselling author of trump indeed continues actively to extol a later carnegie fan for his contribution to the american way of life whatever the outcome of tuesday november theres no doubt that the ecstatic selling of american greatness will remain part of the national psychodrama for years to come trumps diehard supporters are an apt reminder that for many americans the pursuit of happiness is unsatisfying success painfully elusive and failure shameful and or infuriating the hunger for a better future remains a constant feature of the american sociopolitical landscape in the depths of the great depression it was this desperate need that carnegie addressed in carnegies message was to inspire go getting americans to look on the bright side and sell themselves better by the time of carnegies death in more than copies had been sold the book had been translated into more than languages and its title had passed into the language today my paperback reprint from vermilion boasts over copies sold as jay parini a devout student of carnegies work has noted between when soviet communism failed and went through no fewer than editions in a russian translation ideas of success usually make for a bestseller carnegie saw himself as an enabler quoting herbert spencer great aim of education is not knowledge but himself born in the same year as ts eliot embodied the american idea of self or re invention he grew up the son of a failed missouri farmer named carnagey ambitious young dale changed the spelling of his name more closely to associate himself with the great steel baron andrew carnegie a late century household name and embarked on a career as a salesman while also attempting to make a future in the theatre as an actor auditioning successfully for the american academy of dramatic arts theatre life was hard it was at this stage he wrote that the dreams i had nourished back in my college days turned into nightmares but he didnt give up and it was from this pit of despair and disappointment that he conceived the idea of giving courses in public speaking paraphrasing rw emerson a deeply influential american we shall meet later he would say do the thing that you fear to do and the death of fear is absolutely certain by he was in a position to rent carnegie hall and lecture to full houses about his self help techniques his first book followed in and led inexorably through his growing stateswide audience to the key to this new iteration of his optimistic message was its principles each principle was deftly illustrated by carnegies well chosen examples of influential and successful americans in action carnegie left nothing to chance to convince his readers of his wisdom he went to the top of american society in the i personally interviewed scores of successful people he writes some of them world famous inventors like marconi and edison political leaders like franklin d roosevelt movie stars like clark gable and mary pickford and tried to discover the techniques they used in human relations he saw himself as an enabler quoting herbert spencer the great aim of education is not knowledge but action this he declared was an action book as donald trump knows only too well to hook the uncommitted any good salesmans pitch must subtly invite the buyer to risk leaving his or her comfort zone and take a chance carnegie was not afraid to connect his message to new ideas early on in his pitch for a mass audience carnegie mixed a simple american credo with radical european thought he writes sigmund freud said that everything you and i do springs from two motives the sex urge and the desire to be great carnegie also traded in folksy wisdom in the manner of his idol abraham lincoln his first chapter if you want to gather honey dont kick over the beehive encourages a positive warm and optimistic attitude in dealings with others he argues against attacking or criticising people that will only make them aggressive towards you after that successive chapters deal with how to get people to act as you want them to how to make people like you how to convince people of your arguments and finally how to be a leader all this was packaged into carnegies systematic method an important key to his popular success the measure of carnegies extraordinary achievement can be seen in his many imitators the most immediate was norman vincent peale whose keynote sentence could have been written by carnegie if you feel that you are defeated and have lost confidence in your ability to win sit down take a piece of paper and make a list not of the factors that are against you but of those that are for you forget self help we programmed for change read moreunlike carnegie peale was that now familiar american figure a charismatic preacher trading in a crude faith based optimism the officiating priest at the marble collegiate church in manhattan for more than half a century peale first began to promote positive thinking on the radio with a programme entitled the latest edition of declares this book could change your life and specifically offers to enable everyone to enjoy confidence success and joy here in about pages is a succinct expression of the american dream in its purest form from the outset like carnegie peale identifies squarely with the common man his book he declares was written for the plain people of this
the investigative journalist gavin macfadyen who has died aged was founder director of the centre for investigative journalism in london he set up the cij which is funded through charitable foundations in to address what he saw as a worsening media climate for serious in depth and critical reporting and over the following years established its reputation as one of the pre eminent investigative journalism training institutions in the world gavin intended the cij as a refuge for critically minded journalists who want to do adversarial public interest journalism he thought that journalists had become accessories to the powerful rather than acting as a check upon them in his view journalisms role in a democratic society should be to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable it was not surprising that in when wikileaks began publishing documents on the iraq and afghanistan wars and then the us state department cables gavin became a close ally of the group and of its editor and founder julian assange while many of the institutions that profited from assanges revelations later turned on him gavin was steadfastly loyal seeing his role as always to stick up for those under fierce attack from powerful forces gavin and his wife susan benn were trustees of the julian assange defence fund set up to help raise money for assanges legal defence gavins house in london was a salon and refuge for dissidents journalists and revolutionaries from all over the world people often young sometimes difficult would stay for long periods and be fed and housed i love it gavin once told me i come down for breakfast and i dont know who is going to be there he said the previous week that brilliant indian writer arundhati roy had been over with that hollywood actor with good politics john cusack that was typical the cij itself was wonderfully chaotic and breathed with creativity and energy gavin was an arch democrat completely open to anyone and everyone he wanted to stretch the definition of what an investigative journalist is to include artists historians and even architects who use society as their raw material and try to filter information to reveal truth the cij was and remains an open shop born in greeley colorado to marion hall a concert pianist gavin spent his formative years in hyde park chicago he never knew his father and in childhood took his stepfathers surname macfadyen in the he became an activist in the civil rights movement in chicago he participated in the rainbow beach wade ins of that challenged segregation on public beaches and was arrested and jailed while protesting against discriminatory university housing segregated restaurants and in defence of civil rights activists in the south gavin led a convoy of trucks filled with relief supplies to an embattled civil rights outpost in tennessee on arrival he discovered that police fire had pockmarked the truck with bullet holes and on returning to chicago he was informed that fbi agents had raided his house in chicago at this time he met the young bernie sanders then a student at chicago university and exposed him to the world of revolutionary leftist politics by working subsequently as a longshoreman in new york gavin was able to pay for a trip to britain where he joined the international socialists living for a time in the home of one of its leading writers michael kidron he described this as a formative period in developing his political consciousness gavin attended the london school of film technique in and shortly after graduation he formed an independent collective chicago films he filmed the democratic convention in chicago anti war demonstrations and race riots in detroit washington dc and harlem for the bbc as he became more interested in marrying his aesthetic commitment to film with his politics he decided he wanted to make hard hitting investigative documentaries he produced and directed more than documentaries many for granada televisions world in action in countries as diverse as ecuador guyana south africa mexico hong kong thailand the ussr the us sweden india and turkey his investigations covered topics including industrial accidents neo nazi violence in the uk chinese criminal societies the history of the cia watergate election fraud in guyana the iraq arms trade child labour nuclear proliferation and frank sinatras connection to organised crime in gavin left london to work in hollywood he became a close friend of the screenwriter director and producer michael mann and was involved in three of his films as well as motion picture research projects in south east asia and a john frankenheimer film project he joined haskell wexler in nicaragua to make the independent feature latino in he also appeared as an actor in latino as well as two other movies thief and ulterior motives there was little time for small talk with gavin only the big ideas exercised him he would throw his hands up when he got excited by a devious way of getting a story and shout yes yes yes followed inevitably by lets do it being around gavin for any amount of time made you feel anything was possible and that eventually if gavin was around to help justice and the truth would prevail one approach he favoured in the cause of linking social justice activism and investigative journalism was direct action information gathering for example chaining yourself outside the offices of a multinational corporation or department of state and staying there until they gave you the information you needed for your story he was unbreakable in his commitment to the oppressed risked his own life and liberty to stand with them and saw unspeakable acts of human brutality yet at the same time none of it had broken down his ability to love and bring joy to those around him his presence lit up any gathering for many journalists work is simply a job he once wrote their interest is in lapdog confidences and dining with the powerful those

at skys sprawling campus near heathrow sky newss energetic chief john ryley is beaming as he proudly points to the channels new glass box studio which juts out into thin air a storey above the open plan ground floor atrium we are making the biggest investment since sky news began in he says at a time when certain observers say the future of live rolling news is moribund and dead the glass box is a very good illustration of sky challenging the status quo it is a manifestation of the future of non stop journalism a very good physical embodiment of what we are about the custom built studio also provides a symbol of the contrast in fortunes between ryleys news empire which he has run for years and his former employers at the bbc martin baron took donald trump seriously from the read moreuntil july when director general tony hall guaranteed its future speculation had been rife that the bbc news channel might be axed or merged with the bbc world news channel to help find the hundreds of millions in savings the bbc is being forced to make over the next few years does ryley think his counterpart at the bbc the head of news james harding should have axed the news channel to help find his divisions share of the savings i think competition is good so im pleased we have a competitor says ryley after a significant pause daily journalism can be a very tough business i do feel if im honest that over the last months that the bbc news channel has lost a bit of its life and vitality but theyve made a decision that they are putting their editorial focus into their jewels the bbc radio today programme and the bbc ten oclock news he cant help adding one more dig at auntie where he began his career as a graduate trainee in the late saying he felt the today programme was a little slow on the uptake on the airport attack in brussels this year we were lucky we had our correspondent alex rossi at the airport at the time which gave us a distinct advantage he concedes before adding the bbc has fantastic journalists but they have to cut their costs accordingly sky has made its own job cuts with a number of senior journalists and on screen presenters leaving including sunrises eamonn holmes andrew wilson lorna dunkley samantha simmonds and jeremy thompson who retired saying it was time to make space for young talent is there a hint of ageism creeping into a sky which like most media organisations is looking at a younger cheaper digital future we have to sometimes as leaders of news organisations make tough choices about where we invest our money ryley says the quality of our journalism is really important and ive decided to invest our money in specialist journalists we are not at all ageist he points to the likes of dermot murnaghan adam boulton and kay burley who are about his age or older so would he be interested in mark austin who after years is leaving itv news where ryley worked prior to joining sky in the mid avoiding any direct comment on austins departure let alone the possibility of getting him on board ryley cagily keeps his options open we are always on the lookout for bright talent young or old he thinks recent changes at itv news which began a little over a year ago with tom bradbys elevation to news at ten anchor were needed given sky has become what he believes is the second biggest newsbrand in the uk over the past years i quite admired itn and the news at ten team at itv for trying to do something different he says and i think tom bradby and his people tried to do things differently and therefore i applaud it a visit to see the glass box is an interesting experience it puts you in the position of an observer of those working on floors above and below yet also exposes those within to the outside world much like a fish in an aquarium during breaks presenters and visitors need to be wary of the occasional low orbit loops of the cameras that circle the set from above one presenter jokes that the steel frames holding the cameras could do with rubber protectors ryley characterises the creation of the new studio as part of a wider reinvention of sky news which also includes getting our act together with apps and our mobile approach the only way to achieve longevity is to go through renewal he says ten to years ago people would have thought of sky news as purely and only a breaking news service with big red straps across the bottom of the tv nowadays i feel you need to do much more than that the tv news channel is the backbone the production core that generates content for all the different outlets whether it be mobile supply to commercial radio or snapchat ryley says people were at first sneery of skys push on to snapchat but it has become a serious place for news in terms of numbers million people accessed sky content on snapchat discover on the morning of the brexit vote he says that by the end of this year sky will have achieved views on social media and on mobile weekly viewing is up year on year when pressed he admits that like most publishers a relationship with web giants such as facebook can be a two edged sword an attractive distribution platform but with questionable revenue returns for example he says sky supplies facebook live content three times a day but it is early days on how much revenue will come of it i think it has yet to play out he says we along with other news organisations will need to take a hard think about it he also comes
and finally heres the day four match report australian wickets fall as south africa close on first test victory at waca read more another day to south africa then who require just six more australian wickets to wrap up the test today was always likely to be a slog and so it proved first the proteas slogging with bat in hand pushing their already sizeable lead into gargantuan territory the real question though was whether they had the artillery to take australian wickets with an attack shorn of dale steyn kagiso rabada went a considerable way to answering that question taking three top order wickets to place his side firmly in the driving seat the fourth home victim was david warner who was run out by temba bavuma in one of the most brilliant pieces of fielding you could ever witness with australias long tail the end could arrive in a hurry tomorrow but with only rabada looking capable of forcing breakthroughs if he can be seen off it could be a longer day in the sun than south africa

picture a world where no one ever posts anything on social media about nights out or evenings slobbing in front of the tv instead they share details about work meetings or recommendations for accounting apps why because exhibiting exactly this sort of conscientious behaviour on social media could potentially shave hundreds of pounds off your insurance premiums it emerged this week motor insurer admiral announced it was going to use social media to analyse the personalities of first time drivers if their facebook posts indicated they had personality traits admiral could link to safer driving habits and fewer claims annual discounts of up to would be offered via the insurers new firstcarquote product but just before launch the insurer was forced into a u turn facebook said the product would break its terms and conditions which prohibits the use of data obtained from its service to make decisions about eligibility following discussions with facebook the product is launching with reduced functionality an admiral spokesperson announced it will still however ask for access to drivers public facebook profiles before it provides them with a quotation so customers can share some information to secure a faster simpler and discounted quote this is the new world of big data and insurance where social media websites are vast sources of valuable information just waiting to be plundered insurers have been recruiting data scientists and i think it is very likely they are already using information from social media websites to set premiums says gary frost managing director of a software consultancy specialising in data gathering and analysis for financial services firms if theyre not theyre missing a trick it provides extra detail and information which can help improve their risk scoring insurers can access all the data that is posted publicly on twitter and facebook frost says you cant buy access to a private social media profile but insurers can potentially find out all the public information these sites store about you such as who you are friends with your public updates public pages you have liked and posts you have publicly recommended or shared i think it is very likely insurers are already using information from social media to set premiumsgary frost data analystso if you buy a cherry bomb sport exhaust to soup up your vauxhall corsa and talk about it on social media classification and clustering technology is likely to place your profile with a community of higher risk consumers any lifestyle information the insurer can glean about you from any source for example your sexual orientation race religion predilections estimated consumption of alcohol cigarettes and even saturated fat when out socialising could potentially be used to reassess your application and increase or decrease the cost of your premiums mining other informationits not just your social media data that insurers are using however insurers are always looking for new ways of creating an advantage for themselves so they can win more customers and be more efficient says simon mcculloch director of insurance for comparethemarket they will use all the information they can gather about you to offer more accurate pricing and personalise your quotes even seemingly innocuous information can potentially be linked to a higher or lower claims ratio and therefore affect your premium this includes the web browser you use to buy your policy the time of day and month of the year you do so and whether you use a comparison site each time you apply for insurance regardless of how you pay for your policy your insurer is likely to soft search your credit record there are very significant correlations between likely claims and credit scores says kevin roberts director at legal general better credit scores generally result in fewer claims we dont know why consumers shouldnt assume they can control the data they share insurers will look for any previous contact and use that to make a judgment about a new application for example if you visit two comparison websites in quick succession to request quotes all the insurers which offered you quotes the first time will be able to match your profile when you visit the second site and because they know theyve quoted for you previously they may take a dim view of any changes to what you disclose such as your annual mileage id expect that to have a negative impact on your premium it may be seen as indicative of dishonest behaviour says mcculloch similarly if you already hold a policy with an insurer the answers you gave when you first applied may be analysed in relation to the new application for example any disclosures about high value ticket items or burglaries on your home policy may be considered in relation to a motor policy insurers have also found a correlation between callouts on motor breakdown and home emergency policies and claims on motor and home insurance products says roberts so if you are loyal to a breakdown service and make few callouts you may be offered a cheaper insurance policy by any provider with access to that data aa members tend to be a better risk for us says ian crowder spokesperson for the aas insurance arm we know them so can offer discounts they tend on the whole to care for their vehicles and thus are more likely to recognise risks when it comes to motoring the aa is running a driver trial of connected cars to it says identify faults before a breakdown this will involve installing a dongle which will allow it to track drivers behaviour including speeding cornering acceleration braking and high rev incidents and to map what happens where this could inform insurers of potential risk not just about behaviours but the type of roads that are driven on and when crowder says when you apply for insurance firms will already attempt to analyse your whereabouts and the places you travel to companies can obtain lots of information about postcodes from third party sources says toni vitale
in the parallel universe of social media ive discovered that i am a pariah whose society is probably best avoided this isnt a harangue on the need to hold on to our pre facebook values in the face of a virtual onslaught that is threatening to detach us from reality im right into the social media im all twittered up with a few followers who occasionally say kind things about articles i have written as well as a number who are wont to stookie me when they feel ive got it wrong occasionally i resort to blocking people not to protect me you understand but to protect them i know what instagram is and am on the cusp of availing myself confidently of its services soon i can work vines admittedly its taken a while for me to reach a stage where i am comfortable in these surroundings i resisted the urge to join twitter for a few years before finally succumbing weeks before the referendum on scottish independence there was so much bite size mince flying around on pre referendum twitter that i began to feel left out after all i thought my mince is as good as anyone elses i even ordered a few online shops from tesco and now know never to do so while as the russians might say waking up to eight bunches of broccoli six boxes of prunes and enough muesli for an entire yoga class can be a pretty unnerving experience the previous nights good intentions are always skewered by the first icy probes of your hangover and you find yourself wondering if tesco does special deliveries of steak bakes and crispy pancake rolls i also struggle with passwords i thought id be a smart arse and make mine the names of obscure eastern european football teams along with the year of their founding for example i used until i started getting it mixed up with and found myself reduced to creating ridiculous portmanteau combinations such as zenitrostov during this period iwas in virtual darkness and cut off from all my devices i even thought of collecting all my passwords in a single app before realising in a rising panic that i would need to create another password for my password app and that the only obscure league left was the albanian first division its when i dip into facebook that i begin to wonder if my moral centre has shifted to a cold and barren place iexperience feelings of disorientation in this community and am daily fighting a desire to post ironic observations or chilly abjurations about things that matter to close friends and family on my facebook timeline it seems that everyone is living in a world approximate to bambis formative years before the wee mans mother got wasted people post pictures of their dinner and other people post supportive and encouraging comments about it even when it looks like something your dog would body swerve and what is it about cats everyone seems to own a cat except me whats more the cats are filmed doing things such as cooking writing political columns for national newspapers and ordering food shopping from tesco and there are pictures of babies doing all their first things and then sleeping curled up with a cat that is reading them a bedtime story by enid blyton then there are the so called true stories that get posted in a series of meaningful pictures with text running underneath everyone thought that boaby was a drunken auld jaikie who had pissed his talent up against the wall then one night boaby espied a well dressed fellow wandering inadvertently into a bad neighbourhood as two wee shellsuited bams advanced towards the unsuspecting stranger boaby had a moment of clarity and launched his bottle of el dorado at the delinquents along with a string of colourful depredations impelling them to scarper the stranger turned to thank his sozzled guardian angel and each man was amazed at what he saw for the stranger was none other than jos mourinho and boaby was the brilliant young portuguese striker who had gone off the rails after his family was wiped out in a hot air balloon accident you will play for me again roberto and i will make you great said jos so remember everyone that pished auld jaikie whos threatening to rattle your effin balls might be an under world cup winner and have been a former room mate of lionel messi he may be but one act of kindness away from his destiny i mean does anyone seriously believe stuff like this and then there are the little facebook philosophical messages that people share with each other for the purposes of wanting to cheer everyone up never allow anyone to clip the silver wings of your golden dreams live in the sunshine swim in the sea drink the wild air if god is the dj life is the dancefloor love is the rhythm and you are the music i know that these are all well intentioned sentiments and might even make a soul pause before doing something she might regret unfortunately i feel that this is all a vast conspiracy by the forces of the hard right somewhere in the bowels of the headquarters of our security services a group of oxford university electronics graduates is producing all these sunny phrases containing keywords and hidden algorithms that are psychologically designed to keep everyone sleepwalking look bad things happen to everyone thats just life but if you wish for something hard enough all your troubles can be washed away if the government prescribed a regular supply of cocaine for every household the effect would be just the same so in a spirit of generosity and kindness to all my friends and relatives here are some philosophical musings to bring you back to reality he who clips the silver wings of your golden dreams is a true friend live in the rain
latin americagovernments have often preferred republican presidential candidates because they historically put an emphasis on free trade but this time politicians and commentators are lining up to express doubts about donald trump who has alarmed many with his dismissive comments about latinos plans to build a wall on the mexican border and his unpredictable behaviour demtrio magnoli a sociologist and prominent voice of brazils new right said a trump victory would be a geopolitical earthquake trump is the closest the us has gotten to fascism you would have an american president that is nationalist and nativist and we would see mass deportations and a wall being built which is likely since he will most likely not deport million people he predicted this would force mexico to turn more towards latin america and could upset free trade agreements and hurt economic growth trump is so unpredictable and politically inexperienced we have no idea what he will do but he seems authoritarian sexist and contemptuous about latinos said violeta granera of the opposition alliance in nicaragua by comparison hillary clinton is seen as a safe pair of hands who is likely to continue the relatively benign policies of the obama administration carlos lins da silva a senior consultant for the so paulo research foundation said us regional policies were unlikely to see a major change but added the election of trump would at least in the short term cause dramatic impacts on the international system if he puts into practice some of the programmes he is advocating brazil wont come away unscathed for example if he makes the entrance of muslim people more difficult builds a wall between mexico and the us has nato members pay for us defence encourages japan to have a nuclear bomb gets tougher on nafta and other free trade deals all of these ideas would have negative consequences for many countries diplomats said they did not expect a major shift in washingtons latin american policy regardless of the outcome hillary clinton knows brazil better than trump as she has been here before and knows people here but there will not be any substantial change in relations either way because external relations with south america are a low priority for the us said rubens barbosa former brazilian ambassador to washington the country with most at stake may be cuba which has enjoyed a reconciliation with the us under barack obama former cuban president fidel castro weighed in with an article last month in the newspaper in which he awarded trump the medal of mud but the old revolutionary also had nothing good to say about the democrats middle easttrump outraged the arab world with his comments on muslim immigration and regional public opinion certainly reflects this a survey of people in the middle east and north africa found that if they had a vote half would snub both trump and clinton on the fight against islamic state clinton has pledged to never send troops back to iraq and ruled out boots on the ground in syria trump has been less specific about his plan to fight isis but said in march that the us has no choice but to send to combat troops to the region in the survey from the jeddah based daily and pollsters yougov said the us should send troops to fight isis and collaborate closely with russia on syria the rest did not want a us presence on the ground but did feel that washington should be more involved in the humanitarian efforts for syrian refugees arm moderate groups and increase air strikes on isis clinton was most popular with saying she would be the best for the arab world on the candidates policies arab opinion is much more balanced clintons stance on climate change and us israel policy found strong support in the poll but arabs overwhelmingly back trumps stance on abortion and ironically perhaps border controls russiavladimir putin was thrust into an unexpected starring role in this election and whatever the result it will please the kremlin that it has been able to cause so much mischief how much of this was down to direct kremlin meddling we will perhaps never know although the state medias bias towards trump has been fairly clear most russian analysts believe the us is systemically set up to oppose russia and while there is an understanding that trump is an unusual candidate many believe a trump presidency would not change things much other more sober heads are well aware that for all trumps friendly rhetoric as president he would be a much more unpredictable quantity than clinton the devil they know to go on the public rhetoric alone the casual observer would think the russian establishment is banking on trump russian television has been giving airtime to many of trumps claims that the election could be rigged but this is as much to help discredit the us system in the eyes of viewers as it is sincere backing for trump he has been backed not because of his politics but because he is the chaos candidate in the same way russia was also keen on brexit even if clinton wins russia knows that after this divisive campaign us democracy is in for a period of soul searching which will leave less energy and focus for meeting external threats africaif africa has barely featured in the campaign then the continent has in part returned the compliment but though many experts believe the result may not imply any drastic change in us policies in africa there is still widespread anxiety and trump has already alienated many particularly with his apparently racist rhetoric few africans are putting any store on trump if he wins the election that is if he remembers we exist once hes done with mexicans and illegal immigrants wrote gitau warigi in kenyas trumps call for a ban on muslims entering the us received widespread coverage and provoked outrage the somalia based islamic militant group al
there are times in football when you hear a story that sounds so daft so utterly inconceivable that if it happened in just about any other sport you would probably think it might be too far fetched to be true unfortunately this is football land of the absurd and it all fits into the narrative to learn that coventry city under the permanently bewildering sisu regime briefly discussed the idea no kidding of being the first club in england to introduce a textasubstitute option during matches supporters would be given a number they could text at premium rates to say who the manager should take off and who should come on an announcement would be made at the appropriate time about the most popular vote and the manager the poor patsy would be under instructions to comply with the crowds wishes the london stadium an unloved venue resulting from expensive mistakes owen gibson read moreto be fair the idea did not get far but it does you give you an example of the boardroom buffoonery that is prevalent within the sport and it did make me wonder whether the supporters of southampton experiencing the kind of joys the modern day coventry can scarcely imagine ever contemplate how life might have been entirely different but for one of those moments that has sent the two clubs in their respective directions when the story of southamptons success is told it tends to be forgotten that sisu the hedge fund that has brought coventry to their knees was once on the brink of buying the southcoast club and closing a deal that miles north would have spared another club the distress it has endured over the last nine years how close was it to happening very close on october the directors of southampton leisure holdings the clubs parent company voted in favour of accepting the deal that sisu had put forward everything was in place until the proposals were rejected by three of the major shareholders rupert lowe michael wilde and leon crouch to spark a falling out that eventually split the board in two the announcement of sisu taking control at coventry came eight weeks later and within three days southamptons chief executive jim hone the chairman ken dulieu and the commercial director andy oldknow had quit blaming a major difference of opinion between them and certain major shareholders knowing what we do now we can all probably agree which club made the wiser decision and who was offering the best advice even if southampton did have to endure some prolonged pain including a spell in administration and relegation to league one before markus liebherrs takeover began the recovery we see now dulieu was so embedded to sisu he turned up at coventry proclaiming himself to be the man who would save the club and announcing he used to look after security operations in northern ireland orange ken as he became known because of his permatan became chairman then head of football operations and started attracting suspicion when he ordered himself a training kit bearing his own initials he invited himself into the dressing room when the manager andy thorn was giving his team talk and watched one game from the dugout apparently living out some childhood fantasies before the stink it caused led to his resignation he left coventry in the championships relegation zone proudly claiming to have turned the club around and unless someone can tell me otherwise he has not worked in football since it is amazing the kind of people this sport attracts and unfortunately for coventry they have suffered more than most when it comes to the list of those passing through with big ideas little expertise and the general sense that they think running a football club must be a doddle another was leonard brody a canadian entrepreneur and social media guru who joined coventry at the same time as dulieu forming part of the clubs best ever board and in one meeting announced he had a master plan to stop the club haemorrhaging so much money the details are recounted in a splendid new book telling the story of the sisu years in the words of simon gilbert the s award winning chief reporter leonard brody said he had ideas so i said what is your best idea gary hoffman the former vice chairman tells the author that was when he talked about text a substitute i said even if that was allowed under football league rules how do you think thats going to transform the revenues of coventry city another idea was to make a sky blue rolls royce available for wedding hire then at the end of the meeting someone asked if there was any other business and hoffman remembers sisus representative onye igwe raising his hand onye said yes i want to raise the subject of our mascot the club was going bust and he said i think sky blue sam is too fat and its not setting a good example for children thats when ray ranson the former chairman said onye its a fucking elephant we are all probably aware of what has happened to coventry since and why southampton should thank their lucky stars that sisu ended up somewhere else on the one hand there is a southampton side that have just beaten internazionale to show again why they should be regarded as the prime example of what can happen at a medium sized club that applies common sense a sound business structure makes shrewd appointments and understands what a football team means to the local community on the other hand there is a desperate grieving club where the supporters old enough to remember the crumbling terraces of tatty homely highfield road must pine for more innocent times and the scandal runs so deep john sillett one of the great names from coventrys past has shed tears while talking about it publicly coventry have already suffered the indignity of a
picture a child entering the world around the time that a new social networking venture known as thefacebook com is making its own entrance to the world it is and the child is easy to picture her parents have photographed their daughters first breath first smile first spoonfuls and first steps when she reaches school age she is snapped in uniform probably outside the front door and one parent probably her mother shares the image with friends the child learns to read write her name she wins certificates excels at sport when twitter instagram and later vine arrive her public identities multiply she starts secondary school in a few months this child and her classmates will begin to turn and perhaps create their own facebook accounts when they do they will come face to face with their digital shadow they may step into it easily or try to sever themselves from it but it wont let go this pre existent media identity because it has logged their lives from the moment they left the womb some will recognise their digital shadow but what of those whose online identity bears little relation to their sense of self or to the public identity they want to share for years parents have fretted about their childrens posting activities while continuing to post as they wish about their offspring is it time they stopped or at least asked for permission first do parents overshare pictures of their children on social media read moretoday these questions are on the minds of the children at kingsford community school in beckton east london where the and year old members of the debate mate after school club are filing into a classroom on the first floor slinging down school bags and glancing at the motion on the whiteboard this house would ban parents from posting about their children on social media the debate leader writes its kind of weird your parents are still posting pictures of you on social media someone says one boy malachi bows his head and writes a single word on his notepad reputation this is really about consent his friend says do i want to be seen by a larger broader range of people there is a loud hum of agreement and one girl raises her voice parents we dont want them invading our privacy because some of us the only privacy we get is through social media these pupils often discuss social networking sites their attractions and perils but this is the first time they have turned their scrutiny on their own parents and yet parents are the object of an increasingly aggressive interrogation this spring a mother from shropshire called out her sons bullying on facebook only for the post to go viral the criticism of her became so intense she removed it and changed her facebook page and phone number next came the year old mother from balloch scotland whose photographs of her month old daughter in tiny high fashion outfits attracted an instagram following that included khlo kardashian until critics claimed the woman was sexualising her baby she has since locked the account and gone to ground after her came the arizona father who nakedly cradled his naked feverish baby in the shower an image his wife snapped and shared before facebook removed it as offensive excessive sharing about your children has long incited disapproval but recently the disapproval has begun to acquire a proto legal tinge in march french police warned parents against posting photos of their children on social media according to social media analyst eric delcroix the children could soon be able to sue them for posting inappropriate pictures under the countrys privacy laws the treasurer of the uks human rights lawyers association leanne targett parker echoes the idea that it is only a matter of time before children mount legal challenges against oversharing parents you cant imagine it not being something that starts to develop within the next five to years she says i cant see how there be attempts at suing people for putting up posts that theyre unhappy with one day my hair was all raggedy sticking up all over my auntie put iton facebook i was so embarrassed icriedsome parents may shrug off the shaming stories and the

how do i become an agony aunt ive tried using social media but it hasnt workedas you are something of an agony uncle i am seeking your advice on how to become an agony aunt all my life i have helped others with their problems i have tried hard to find out how i can do this publicly i have started my own facebook and twitter pages but have been unsuccessful so far any tips or advice you could offer would be gratefully received jeremy saysid like to know in what way your facebook and twitter pages have been unsuccessful theres nearly always something constructive to be learned from failure but you have more than failure to guide you you say that all your life you have helped others with their problems so you must have some fairly clear ideas about the kind of advice that has been most useful adapting this experience to your online presence makes obvious sense but i imagine youve done this already as for the advice itself a surprising number of peoples problems stem from their failure to see things through the eyes of others they are genuinely baffled and often upset because a friend partner boss or colleague doesnt see things in the same way empathy comes naturally to some but others have to work at it however it can solve or ease a great many differences of opinion as a solver of other peoples problems yourself some degree of empathy is probably your most valuable talent readers say as someone who has worked in a counselling type role my whole life i would say dont in my experience the people who would actually be the best at this type of thing dont do it for a host of rational reasons or cant do it because theyre not journalists or famous journalism is probably the more reliable route because becoming famous is more by happenstance than design being a professional counsellor psychologist or psychotherapist etc may help you see the issues better but you simply wont have enough information to provide anything truly helpful momenta consider volunteering with an organisation such as the samaritans which provides training and support it responds to people who are struggling lonely ill poor in jail or at school anyone who wants to talk being an agony aunt is a niche role and one that is often as much about the adviser than the person asking for help id ask why its that route in particular that appeals pumpkindoge it is about having an appropriate background in publishing a reputation for having a clear thinking balanced approach to issues and a substantial amount of luck starterforten train to be a counsellor or better a psychotherapist itll take years and money but most of all you will be forced to question whether what you do is of any help onalongsabbatical write to yourself for advice if its good advice you will reach your goal if its bad advice maybe choose another path iamtherobotmanhow can i help my daughter to choose a career after she finishes sitting her a levels my daughter is bright but doesnt know what degree to take as she has no clear career plan we have discussed this time and again but she still cant decide she is studying for a levels in biology history and psychology and completed as levels in english and law she enjoys writing and has considered journalism but she is particularly interested in endangered species and greenpeace any ideas on how as her mum i can gently and diplomatically try and set her on an interesting path jeremy saysyour concern for her future is understandable and laudable you just have to be heroically patient its not unusual for those of your daughters age and stage of education to be indecisive about what to do next as the sense of pressure mounts often compounded by would be helpful teachers and parents wrong decisions can be made perhaps the most useful discussion should start with the sort of career she might consider there are some for which a degree in mathematics for example is essential but from the sound of it her interests mean the precise choice of degree course is less crucial her interests in journalism the environment and greenpeace suggest there is no essential degree subject the a levels she is taking are usefully broad and will provide her with valuable qualifications without being restrictive by all means continue to discuss her emerging interests but only if she welcomes such discussions if she shows curiosity about an occupation consider buying her books on the subject but take care she knows they are not intended as a covert form of encouragement even if she appeals to you to tell her what you think she should do resist its important she senses what she wants to do with her life and she will the urgency to do so is not quite as great as it seems readers say her college library should have a wide range of resources on choosing a degree course and careers information she could also take a look at websites such as prospects ac uk which suggests career paths and gives job profiles her mix of a levels could take her in different directions she sounds like the ideal candidate for a gap year not a jaunt to thailand or botswana but time out to try out a fewdifferent jobs possibly to join greenpeace and see what grabs her inpractice for most people the day to day realities of a job affect our enjoyment far more than the title or industry how much will you need to interact with the public how do you feel about eight hours a day in front of a computer how much does money or status matter these are best learned in practice and she can use her experiences to guide her choice the pace of technological change is so rapid and the global environment
a russian frigate armed with cruise missiles has passed through the bosphorus on its way to the eastern mediterranean in a potentially ominous development for the embattled syrian city of aleppo the admiral grigorovich part of russias black sea fleet arrived off the syrian coast on friday as the latest pause in the russian bombardment of eastern aleppo came to an end adding to an emphatic russian show of naval force in the mediterranean unlike the admiral kuznetsov aircraft carrier and peter the great nuclear powered battle cruiser whose arrival in the region has drawn considerable publicity the newly commissioned grigorovich has a fearsome ground attack capability in the form of kalibr land attack cruise missiles three russian submarines from russias northern fleet capable of firing kalibr missiles are also reported to have arrived in the mediterranean five maps that show how the net closed on eastern aleppo read morerussia has used kalibr missiles equivalent to us tomahawk missiles against syrian targets a handful of times over the past year the concentration of forces in the eastern mediterranean in support of the syrian regimes ambitions to retake aleppo from rebel forces suggest they may be used again in the coming few days or hours earlier this week vladimir putin warned syrian rebels and civilians trapped in eastern aleppo to leave the city by friday night when a temporary moratorium on air strikes was set to expire but opposition groups told the guardian that promised safe passages out of besieged areas did not exist as the deadline drew near opposition groups pushed on with an assault on loyalist west aleppo while residents seemed resigned to a resumption in airstrikes nothing can be done nobody can stop the planes bebars mishal an official with the white helmets volunteer rescue service told reuters the kuznetsov battle group paused in its approach towards syria off the east coast of crete on thursday to carry out aviation exercises russian ministry of defence footage showed warplanes taking off and landing on its deck the kuznetsov is carrying about sukhoi and four mig fighter aircraft as well as up to two dozen helicopters although the su have recently been adapted to drop bombs more accurately the plane has never been used for ground attack only the mig is designed for that purpose if the planes are used to bomb targets in syria it would mark the first time russia has used its only aircraft carrier in combat that lack of experience however may limit its usefulness there are very few carrier trained pilots in fact there are more planes than pilots and most of the planes on board are not made for ground attack for naval aviation this is largely a training run michael kofman a russian specialist at the centre for naval analyses a federally funded research institute they havent done anything done anything like this in a long time and its getting heavily covered by the local and international media said peter zwack a retired us brigadier general and former military attache to moscow now at the national defence university they are arriving in the eastern mediterranean right before our election its posturing and secondarily adding capability in syria the visit of its flagship to the mediterranean is also a morale boosting demonstration of military capacity for the russian navy which has not played a significant role in the ukraine or syrian conflicts but which is seen by vladimir putin as vital to russian self image as a global power russias naval presence in the mediterranean is as much about military posture and ability to project power beyond its region as much as the syria campaign in general moscow sees it as important attributes of a great power said maxim suchkov an expert on the russian foreign affairs council and an editor at al monitor covering russian relations with the middle east the importance of image to this naval expedition is illustrated by the fact that russian sailors have spent several days during its mediterranean journey painting its deck bright blue presumably so it looks better in aerial photographs the carrier has had a long and troubled history it was launched in but took a decade to become fully operational it was first called the riga then renamed the leonid brezhnev as the former soviet premier died and then the tbilisi after the georgian capital and then rechristened after the soviet union fell apart and georgia gained independence it was initially armed with a dozen granit anti ship missiles but those have recently been removed to make more space for aircraft the carrier has had persistent problems with its propulsion system based on turbo pressurised boilers which belch out black smoke due to an excess of fuel over air in its engines they have frequently broken down and require the kuznetsov to be accompanied on high seas duty by a tug the ship has spent more time in port than at sea and will be out of action for several years for refurbishment from next year it is accompanied by the peter the great a massive battle cruiser with a fearsome array of missiles but which are designed to hit planes ships and submarines rather than attack land targets a more potent threat from the flotilla sent from russias northern fleet may have escorted the kuznetsov under the surface uk reports quoting british government sources say two nuclear powered akula class and one diesel powered kilo class submarine have been spotted trailing the battle group into the mediterranean at the same time as the kuznetsov left murmansk two destroyers left vladivostok the headquarters of the pacific fleet those destroyers the bystry and the admiral tributs are reported to be off the gulf of aden kofman said that they could be on call in case the kuznetsov encounters engine trouble possibly a plan b for nervous admirals however the bystry has the same unreliable propulsion system the arrival of the grigorovich and the russian submarines armed

scotland yard spent too long pursuing the investigation into allegations that prominent establishment figures sexually abused and killed children and should have ended it sooner the unpublished draft report about operation midland has concluded the guardian understands that the findings of the inquiry about operation midland which collapsed amid controversy earlier this year are more critical than police chiefs were expecting and have sent scotland yard into crisis mode the report by sir richard henriques a retired high court judge is understood to say that inconsistencies in the account of the main witness known as nick compromised the investigations chances of success which meant it was unlikely a criminal case would reach the threshold needed for a court case against any of the suspects the report also criticises decisions and actions by officers involved in the high profile and complex investigation police brace for operation midland report as former suspects call for read morenicks claims led to allegations against public figures including a former military chief lord bramall and a former home secretary leon brittan as well as the former tory mp harvey proctor the report was ordered by the met commissioner sir bernard hogan howe after a furore over police actions and decision making in the case which saw officers obtain warrants to raid the homes of suspects and search their possessions operation midland which cost ended in march this year after the met concluded that there was insufficient evidence to arrest anyone let alone ask prosecutors to consider a charge the findings from henriques have been studied by senior officers and senior advisers at the met since they were delivered four weeks ago in draft form henriques is understood to have concluded in his draft report that the investigation should have ended sooner and it should have been apparent more quickly to police that nicks credibility was too low to form the basis of a prosecution the met says there is no timetable for the publication of limited excerpts but has said it will withhold the full report because it contains confidential and sensitive information it is believed this refers to information about and from exonerated suspects and their accusers some in policing are understood to be concerned that henriques has failed to take sufficient account of important factors that may explain decision making these would include guidelines that were in place at the time about how officers should investigate sex abuse cases and a need to believe the victim unless evidence undermining their credibility emerged on thursday night the met appeared to confirm that criticised officers have raised objections asked if police officers who are criticised have a right of reply before the report is finalised or published in a so called maxwellisation process the met replied this is one of a number of considerations leading up to the publication of the report one source with expertise in the issues involved said just because it is someone from the establishment doesnt mean you can write it off from the outset you have to investigate and if you dont the victim will go to the ipcc independent police complaints commission and it will be three years before you clear your name the decision to raid bramalls home distressing his then ill and now deceased wife elicited considerable public sympathy for the d day veteran and opprobrium for the met the final version of the report is expected to be completed in the coming days the findings are potentially damaging to the mets reputation and the controversy around operation midland has been one of the worst episodes of hogan howes five year commissionership which will end with his retirement in february the claims made by nick relate to the period between and when he was aged between seven and launching operation midland the police said the credibility of the allegations was assessed after a process involving extended questioning of the complainant by specialist child protection detectives in december the then head of operation midland said nicks claims were not just credible but true the met later withdrew the assertion that the claims are true as it faced allegations that it had subjected former public servants to a baseless witch hunt operation midland was launched following the jimmy savile scandal which shook up the criminal justice system and showed it failing victims resulting in the shielding of a prolific offender but the way the investigation was conducted led to vehement criticism of the met from parts of the media the negative findings in henriquess review may lead to more attacks on the force and hogan howe who insists his retirement is not linked to the controversy since receiving the draft report hogan howe has met with bramall to apologise lady brittan is refusing to meet hogan howe until the met shares with her in confidence the portions of the report covering her late husband who served as home secretary under margaret thatcher lady brittan feels it unfair that hogan howe would have full knowledge of the report while she is in the dark the met said in a statement we are giving the report very thorough consideration to ensure that the publication of any material does not compromise any legal process responsibilities or duties of care to any party the force added there are no ongoing proceedings that may delay publication of the report in october claims were made to the met that a group of vips who were alleged to have sexually abused children had also murdered some of their victims by november the met announced that operation midland would investigate the claims and involved detectives from the child abuse investigation command and the homicide and major crime command in december the then head of operation midland det supt kenny mcdonald said experienced detectives from two teams had spoken to nick at length and concluded his accounts were true mcdonald said in december nick has been spoken to by experienced officers from the child abuse team and experienced officers
increasing numbers of people have been warming to the notion that brexit may not have to mean brexit after all this was probably inevitable given that those who voted for it did so for a very wide range of reasons and it is abundantly clear that the cabinet is about as unclear as the rest of us the announcement that the uk government has lost its high court case about article means that subject to appeal it will have to be debated in parliament this presents a golden opportunity for mps to throw a spanner in the works by refusing to vote for article to be triggered without knowing precisely or at least generally what brexit will actually look like whenwe know the awful truth i predict a stampede towards brexit exit any arguments about this thwarting the will of the people needs to be shown up for the nonsense it is it would not be thwarting the will of the who voted against and i suspect a high proportion of those who voted to leave didnt vote for hard brexit having believed some of the lies of leading brexiters perhaps we can still pull back from the brink if parliament is prepared to face the fury of ukip and the tory right two groups that are increasingly difficult to tell apart alan healey the high court decision is not about whether we stay in or leave the eu it is about common sense i have always been a reluctant remainer not against brexit as such i simply believe that the decision was reached in a fatally flawed way partly because the leave campaign never had to explain exactly what leave would mean people were being asked tovote for a blind option we cant turn back time and redo the referendum but at least if there is a full debate in parliament we will get a proper discussion on the reasons for leaving and the options for the future it is highly likely that parliament will vote to leave but at least the decision will have been reached in something close to a proper process this could make a big difference in healing the fractured and politically intolerant mood that has emerged in the country since the vote ken abbott claims that the high court ruling is an attempt to scupper brexit altogether are ridiculous in addition to committing the cardinal sin of defining a word using the word itself the government has also made no sense when arguing against parliamentary ratification of article theresa may has stated rather patronisingly that any negotiator knows you should not show your hand to those on the other side of the table before negotiations have even begun she is correct however it is not implicit that anyone but parliament is able to see our negotiating hand parliament is able to sit in private meaning only mps may be present and no media coverage may take place this was done in when mps debated the anti terrorism crime and security bill parliamentary involvement in brexit will not reverse the referendum result it will simply scrutinise the terms of withdrawal and it can be achieved without showing our hand to the eu gabriel osborne brexit means brexit is a meaningless and unhelpful phrase and todays high court judgment reminds us of this two words one repeated designed to make us forget the constitutional framework and legal process brexit means brexit our constitution despite being unwritten is based in law parliament decided to ask the public their opinion and parliament should decide what to do with this the house of lords must be given the chance to do its job too if it exists at all surely it is for moments like this to intervene and apply perspective in a situation when the government of the day is trying to do something deeply unconstitutional and to ensure that the proper time and consideration is given to a decision with such significant consequences the result of the referendum is causing divisions not just because of how deeply many people feel about the issues or that the result feels inconclusive but because the referendum itself was not put in a robust constitutional framework and as a result its consequences are open to debate kevin olding liam fox and dominic raab dont seem to understand the high courts ruling the nub of the matter is that the executive cannot by royal prerogative alter the rights that british citizens currently enjoy as members of the eu the most important of these is the right to live and work freely in european countries ifwe leave the eu poles and romanians will have that figure reduced from to british citizens meanwhile will have it reduced from to charles turner what a lovely irony having spent months arguing for the return of british sovereignty the brexiters dont seem to like it much roy boffy whether you supported leave or remain the decision of an unelected judge to prevent the prime minister from triggering article is disgusting rarely has there been a clearer example of the establishment frustrating democracy and disrespecting the will of the majority of the people tim raymond if the government fails to overturn the decision to allow parliament a vote on article in the supreme court then they could always appeal to the european courtsteve flatley on november edmund burke spoke as follows to the electors of bristol certainly gentlemen it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union the closest correspondence and the most unreserved communication with his constituents their wishes ought to have great weight with him their opinion high respect their business unremitted attention it is his duty to sacrifice his repose his pleasures his satisfactions to theirs and above all ever and in all cases to prefer their interest to his own but his unbiassed opinion his mature judgment his enlightened conscience he ought not to sacrifice

those who cant rule today try to rule yesterday this weeks demand by labours andy burnham for a show trial of policetactics at the battle of orgreave years ago was a piece of pure politics his rebuff by the home secretary amberrudd was proportionate and wholly reasonable we know what happened at orgreave the police reaction to the miners union picketing was excessive but this fact has been examined fought over and iconised for decades to equate it with hillsborough or bloody sunday is an offence to those who died in those tragedies there were no deaths at orgreave there was violence on both sides but the arrested miners were tried and acquitted that some suffered through being bailed is sadly true of thousands of innocent citizens every year why does burnham suddenly want an inquiry into orgreave back in he was a junior minister at the very home office he now wants to put on trial there was no inquiry then could it be that burnham was part of tony blairs new labour establishment eager to forget the taint of scargillism whereas he now wants to be mayor of manchester orgreave was miserable for those involved but pit closures are history the miners were victims of that history as were workers at the same time in dockyards steel foundries and newspapers protest was understandable and probably inevitable but does burnham really want to go back to subsidising dirty coal public policy and resources should surely go into helping the stranded demoralised communities left behind buy jobs not lawyers who will invest in these places if they continue picking at old sores this was a third of a century ago weve had alder hey climbi and soham what good did they do public inquiry has become a catch all salve to any political embarrassment or lingering grievance no one asks if it really delivers justice which is strictly a job for the courts no one asks the opportunity cost no one doubted that what happened in derry on bloody sunday in was a ghastly mistake the years and spent re investigating it by lord saville would surely have been better spent compensating victims families and on wider community rebuilding as for the three inquiries into the hillsborough football disaster they have still not laidit to rest with calls for yet more criminalinvestigations the supposition that a drawn out judicial inquiry is somehow macho accountability is bizarre the brisk inquiries familiar in the and lasted on average three months by the this had tripled to months the scott inquiry drooled over a relatively trivial issue of arms for iraq for four years to no particular end franks on the falklands took six months in by this year chilcot on iraq had taken seven years and the current inquiry into child sex abuse has become an industry a parody of the genre we have had inquiries into the inadequacies of the child care system for decades there has been cleveland north wales alder hey victoria climbi and soham among many others what good did they do that we need yetanother we do not know if this abuse inquiry under professor alexis jay is to be a court hearing of a number of elderly men or an encyclopaedia of past maladministration all we know is that it has spawned sub inquiries staff and a battery of victim lobbyists meanwhile victims hopes of compensation are inflated and postponed as lawyers pump up each line of inquiry and costs soar isit really sensible to starve a desperately under resourced care service for this circus it seems no longer to matter how long these inquiries take politicians and officials alike have a vested interest in distancing themselves from publicity and blame accountability postponed is accountability denied public inquiries have become a cynical appendix of modern government like honours tsars and special advisers inquiries should be for specific system failure like investigating a political scandal or a dreadful accident they used to be incisive exposures as of the profumo affair the aberfan disaster the brixton riots and the death of stephen lawrence where no other mechanism seemed appropriate such a case today might be the collapse of audit and regulation in the bhs philip green affair all we got was an abusive torrent from the prime minister and mps alike meanwhile there has been no inquiry into the bank of englands handling of the crash or the chaotic state of nhs finances or allegations of bribery by rolls royce and bae inquiries into project cost concealment as with the olympics legacy or hinkley point must presumably await the retirement of the politicians concerned orgreave was

but it is not a given that the fed will hike in december says economist james knightley at ing bank there is little in the statement to suggest that a december hike is definitely going to happen the statement comments that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen while adding the word some to the line that it wants to wait for some further evidence of continued progress towards its objectives this all suggests that things are moving in the right direction but the presidential election is an obvious reason for waiting assuming clinton wins markets are likely to react with relief given expectations of policy continuity this coupled with the reasonably firm growth rising employment and a gradual pick up in inflation should reinforce market expectations for a december rate hike should trump win then this is likely to hurt market sentiment given uncertainty as to what he will actually do when in power it is hard to imagine the fed hiking in this environment we also have plenty more data to come ahead of the december fomc meeting including two more job reports so there are other reasons for caution the fed statement has failed to give much support to the dollar and us markets have struggled for direction after the news the dow jones industrial average is now down points compared to around ahead of the statement the us dollar index has lost to gregory daco fed fomc statement us economy chugging along inflation expectations rising only need a little more progress december ratehikenovember paul r la monica no alarms and no surprises fed leaves rates unchanged but hihts st hike in december uber hawks george and mester dissent wanted hike now november a lavorgna fomc judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen fed remains on track for dec rate hikenovember although there was no rate change today it looks increasingly likely there will be one in december paul sirani chief market analyst at xtrade said with just days to go before election fever sweeps america janet yellens federal interest rate statement held no shocks with rates remaining the same however its becoming ever more likely that yellen will implement a raise early next month following signs that the american economy is gradually picking up steam she made clear in september that a rise before the end of was more than likely and with employment and inflation continuing to strengthen the central bank may get its wish the fed has dropped a reference to inflation remaining low in the near term in september it said inflation is expected to remain low in the near term in part because of earlier declines in energy prices but to rise to percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further this now reads inflation is expected to rise to percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further the fed said in its statement the committee expects that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further inflation is expected to rise to percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further near term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced the committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments against this backdrop the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent the committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided for the time being to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to percent inflation this time there were only two fed dissenters who wanted to raise rates not three esther george and loretta mester eric rosengren who voted for a rise last time has now sided with the majority breaking newsto no ones great surprise the federal reserve has opted to leave us interest rates unchanged just days ahead of the presidential election it said it was waiting for further evidence of progress towards its objectives before hiking anthony cheung awaiting any subtle change in fomc language to hint towards dec hike look out for next meeting or further strengthened november the us federal reserves interest rate decision will be released in less than an hour while most commentators expect there to be no change not this close to the presidential election the prospect of a rate rise in december is thought to be reasonably likely given the recent reassuring us economic data there is likely to be a focus as usual on the exact wording of the fed statement and whether it shows any changes from the september comments at that meeting seven of the fed members voted for no change with three esther george loretta mester and eric rosengren backing an increase any variance here could also give a clue to the likely outcome in december investors have been unnerved by suggestions that donald trump is gaining ground in the us presidential race with one poll this week even showing him in the lead over hillary clinton combined with a slump in oil prices following a record weekly rise in us crude stocks this has pushed markets in europe sharply lower but on wall street the dow jones industrial average which lost points or so on tuesday has not been hit as badly and is currently down just points ahead of the latest us federal reserve interest rate decision meanwhile the vix index
walter hain stumbled into the anti apartheid struggle according to his son the politician peter hain who in wrote a memoir of his father and mother ad wal values duty sacrifice in apartheid south africa peter wrote of his parents at the time in it just seemed the right thing to do in keeping with their values of caring decency fairness and perhaps equally important their sense of duty that was when walter who has died aged and his wife adelaine joined the newly formed liberal party the only non race based political grouping in south africa then living in ladysmith the couple helped to organise the inaugural meeting of the partys local branch and ended up holding it at their home the author alan paton the partys national president attended that first meeting the following year the family moved to pretoria walter worked as an architect while adelaine became an unpaid political organiser she made illegal trips into black townships to visit party members and supported activists who had been arrested helping them to find legal representation and sending food to their families when they were imprisoned when i met the couple in to write an article marking adelaines birthday they gave me a nightmare description of the south africa of the prisoners taken to the jail in pretoria could be sold to farmers as cheap labour and a black servant not carrying his pass papers could be arrested merely for stepping outside his employers front garden as the repression worsened in the early the hains became even more active politically adelaine attended the trial of nelson mandela and his co defendants in pretoria and was at times their sole supporter in the whites only gallery that in turn made the hains the target of a paranoid regime in adelaine was banned a draconian measure forbidding all political activity and making her in effect a non person walter faced the same treatment a year later they were the first couple to be banned and an unprecedented codicil had to be added to their banning order allowing them to communicate with each other walters banning order followed the support he had given to the couples close friend john harris who in had planted a bomb at the railway station in johannesburg killing an elderly woman in his book peter hain alleges the authorities deliberately ignored harriss phoned warning in order to use the resulting carnage for political ends the hains were opposed to violent action because they believed it was counter productive but they remained supportive of harris a fellow liberal party member who had joined the african resistance movement and had come to believe that only violence could shake the apartheid system although he always denied he had intended to kill harris was hanged for murder in april the only white person to be executed in apartheid south africa for political activities the hains helped his wife ann and their baby son during the months of his imprisonment and took them into their home after his death harris had wanted walter to give the oration at his funeral but because walter was banned he was unable to do so peter who was at the time read it instead walters banning order meant he could no longer work as an architect in south africa so in he and his family left for the uk they settled in london where they became prominent opponents of the south african government they supported the anti apartheid movement helping peter with his stop the tour campaign which succeeded in blocking the all white south african cricket team from coming to britain in they also backed their son when he faced a trial for conspiracy in and trumped up bank robbery charges in the south african secret police continued to target activists in exile the hains phone was tapped and in they received a letter bomb addressed to peter but sent to their home it was opened by their daughter sally but did not explode walter was born in durban his father also called walter and his mother mary hailed from glasgow and in had emigrated to south africa where walter sr worked as an engineer in they moved to pretoria and walter attended pretoria boys high school where he developed a lifelong love of sport he also learned to sketch at school a skill he put to good use in the second world war when he joined the signal corps at the age of and took part in the allied assault on italy he kept a diary during the campaign illustrated with pencil sketches in he published them in a book called apennine war diary walter was wounded in the advance but recovered and was assigned to the natal mounted rifles he was still in italy when germany surrendered on may in his book about his parents peter says the war was a profoundly formative experience for his father both changing him and enlarging his perspective on life to one so much broader than that of a home grown young white south african after the war walter took up the place to study architecture at witwatersrand university that he had gained before joining up in though studying in johannesburg he still liked to pay regular visits to his parents in pretoria and on one of those visits while out riding with a group of friends he met adelaine stocks the couple married in initially living in nairobi kenay where walter had found a job in an architectural practice peter their eldest son was born there in it was in nairobi that the hains exhibited the first flickerings of their political rebelliousness india had just got independence walter recalled and a whole lot of british ex indian army people had come to kenya where black people were still kept in their place one of the partners in the firm that i was working for said to me oh we must learn from you south africans

politicians must urgently tackle the increasing ethnic polarisation of many of britains towns and cities according to a senior academic as he revealed figures showing how rapidly the white british population had dwindled in urban pockets across england prof ted cantle who first authored a report into community cohesion after a series of race riots in said his new study showed that in the most extreme cases the white british population had more than halved in two decades segregation in blackburn at an impasse and it is only going to get read morecantle who co authored the report with prof eric kaufmann at birkbeck university of london told the guardian that white british families should be encouraged to remain in ethnically diverse areas to reduce the trend he warned that segregated societies breed intolerance and prejudice adding and we know the opposite is true there is a huge amount of research that shows any form of contact does break down stereotypes the leading academic said he would not describe the trend as white flight because that indicated that people were moving because of ethnic mixing while this research only established the facts and not necessarily the causes white people are leaving urban areas in a disproportionate number and they avoid moving to diverse areas when they do move but we cant say that is white flight because the motivations are many and various he said arguing it could be to do with the dream of a place in the country or an older cohort retiring to rural communities but he said interviews he had carried out in recent years as part of the study had highlighted a sense among some white british people that an area they had lived in was no longer for them in one case a community cohesion officer in yorkshire told cantle he was the first asian to move into a particular street and that within three years virtually every white british family had gone some of those families made no bones about it they said they are moving out because they are moving in he said the research looked at two existing studies and drew from census data from and examining the figures in a way that has not been done before graphthe report authors stressed that the findings were nuanced with more diversity in some areas and different ethnic groups mixing together however when looking at the white british population compared with all other ethnicities together it found increasing polarisation with the steepest decline in the white population in urban pockets where the numbers were already well below the national average some of the largest declines were in slough where the white population fell from to in birmingham where it went from to and in leicester where it decreased from to in one london borough newham the figure was just in the latest data set but the study found even more marked changes when it examined the figures at ward level in one part of the blackburn and darwen authority area of the population was white british down from in smaller council areas in birmingham saw similar declines from to in small heath and from to in handsworth the trend was repeated in parts of bradford luton and across london boroughs green st east in newham had a white british population of in twenty years later is had declined to just while southall green in ealing went from to in the same period meanwhile there were only tiny changes in ethnic diversity in the most predominantly white areas such as barrow in furness mid devon bassetlaw and mid sussex the focus of policy needs to shift this is not just about minorities said cantle politicians and policymakers need to encourage white british residents to remain in diverse areas to choose rather than avoid diverse areas when they do relocate encouraging similar choices with respect to placing pupils in diverse schools in other words to create a positive choice for mixed areas and a shared society cantle called for salesmanship of the positive benefits of mixed areas including the cultural choices and activities weve never sold the idea that mixed communities are more exciting places with more going on he said adding that after the brexit vote there had been a bit of move in the opposite directions with the immediate surge in hate crime but he also argued that some negative practices ought to be stamped out including businesses recruiting workers from single eastern european countries the publication of the report triggered an immediate debate with experts claiming that the diversity in areas with fewer white british families meant segregation was the wrong description it is simply wrong to suggest that inner cities have become more ethnically segregated in fact people are more likely to live near those of a different ethnicity than ever before what is undoubtedly true is that more needs to be done to promote integration and not just in the most diverse areas said the economist jonathan portes however cantles report argues that polarisation between the white british majority and other ethnic groups is a significant fact that requires urgent action cantles research comes after the government was accused of sitting on a major study into community cohesion by dame louise casey the study is thought to include some uncomfortable findings casey whose report has been finalised will warn that successive governments have failed to do enough to tackle the difficult issues raised by cantle years ago she is expected to suggest that faith schools should make their pupils mix with children of other religions in a report that she has promised will be making the difficult choices and telling the truth it is not clear why her review has not yet been published although sources have pointed out that much has changed since she was first appointed by the then prime minister david cameron including the eu referendum result and a new government the government insists the review will
anyone who feared that the ukip leadership contest would get dull following the withdrawal of raheem kassam will be relieved after that with john rees evans ukips reputation for eccentricity is in safe hands he fared badly this afternoon but paul nuttall the clear favourite suzanne evans the most assured media performer and peter whittle all got through the debate without difficulty there was no clear winner but equally nothing happened to challenge the view that nuttall will be most popular with ukip members here are two of the key news lines paul nuttall and suzanne evans the two favourites in the contest disagreed over ukips controvesial breaking point anti immigrants poster evans said she did not like it i didnt think it was racist but i dont like it i think it was insensitive and ill judged but nuttall defended it the point behind that poster was absolutely correct we do need to get control of our borders and there is a deluge of people coming from the middle east and the european unions idea of a common asylum policy certainly isnt the right route to go down nigel farage launching ukips controversial breaking point poster during the eu referendum photograph philip toscano panuttall and whittle both sought to downplay the significance of the rise in hate crime after the brexit vote asked about the increase nuttall said if you look at the hate crime figures they did not go up substantially there has been a slight rise but ive spoken to the police about this that happens after any national event this is nothing out of the ordinary the rise hasnt been that substantial and whittle said that hate crime had been going up anyway he added the only point i would make is that in july after the brexit vote actually a huge amount of hate crime was more related to the terrorist attacks that were happening at the time thats all from me for today thanks for the comments nuttall says he would for some crimes like killing children but it is ukip policy to have a referendum on it if enough people call for one evans says she is strongly opposed to one and always has been and the stefan kiszko case clinched it for her rees evans says he would back the death penalty for people who kill children and paedophiles convicted for preying on children under the age of and thats it the lbc hustings is over i will post a summary soon this entry was corrected on november to more accurately reflect the views of the candidates evans says she would work with whoever won nuttall says if he were american he would probably vote for the libertarian candidate he does not like either trump or clinton rees evans says one thing in trumps favour is that he is not in anyones pocket whittle says clinton is deeply unsavoury with trump he thinks right cause wrong man whittle says putin is a pretty unsavoury character there is an expansionist impluse there but there is in the eu too no says whittle rees evans says he does not really have an opinion about him evans says putin is someone who needs careful handling nuttall says he agrees with evans but russia is not the biggest threat facing the country it is islamic extremism evans says the uk security services have suggested that terrorists could be coming to europe posing as refugees evans says she was angry when she saw child refugees coming to the uk there are children in the uk who are not being looked after properly she says it is reasonable to check their ages rees evans said he recently went to calais his investigation was on bulgarian tv he says many migrants there have sold their homes they spend or there are genuine refugees he says he spoke to refugees but he thinks only three or four of them were genuinely fleeing for their lives rees evans says he has acres there his wife likes organic food and they can grow their own food on their land evans says she would like him to stay involved she would like him to be an elder statesman someone she could consult that is how she used to work with him it would be like alex salmond and nicola sturgeon she says whittle says she would like farage to stay involved rees evans says if you do not like farage you can vote for nuttall because nuttall and evans both favour shunting farage off into the lords nuttall says he has worked with farage for years farage should become the honorary president of the party and if he wants a peerage he should get one after farage wont be an mep he points out rees evans says he wants to introduce direct democracy into the party evans says that is not the case she wrote the party manifesto you cannot make policy like this he says rees evans says that illustrates the problem she does not trust members nuttall says the last time something like this was tried was when labour wrote its manifesto in he implies rees evans idea wont work nuttall says ukip is the only party that has a blanket ban on anyone who has been a member of the bnp joining just because you want to control immigration that does not make you a racist he says evans says she did not approve of the anti immigrant poster released during the campaign she tells the spanish caller she has a beautiful voice rees evans says the media are partly to blame the media accuse ukip of being racist and so after the vote to leave genuine racists thought that people who voted to leave the eu were also racist the media needs to consider its responsibility he says whittle says the london assembly has looked at this hate crime has been going up for some time anyway he says
a russian dissident jailed under a controversial new kremlin law says he is being beaten repeatedly tortured and threatened with murder at the penal colony where he is being held in north west russia ildar dadin says he is the victim of systematic abuse perpetrated by the head of the prison maj sergey kossiev and his staff he alleges that kossiev has told him that if he complains about his treatment he will be killed and secretly buried a kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters on tuesday that president vladimir putin would be informed of the allegations while russian media reported that the regional branch of russias investigative committee would look into dadins claims in response to the letter amnesty international has called for dadins release we are urging russian authorities to end the pattern of impunity for torture and other ill treatment and investigate ildar dadins appalling allegations sergei nikitin the director of amnesty international russia said they must also immediately and unconditionally release ildar dadin and provide him with full remedy for the injustice done to him dadin was jailed in after staging a series of anti government protests he was convicted under a new law which criminalises public assembly and given a three year sentence which was later cut to two and a half in the letter to his wife anastasia smuggled out of prison by his lawyer he described having all of his belongings confiscated and claims two razor blades were planted on him as an excuse to send him to solitary confinement by way of punishment the following day he says kossiev arrived with three prison warders and began to beat him over the course of that day i was beaten a total four times by people at once they would kick me he writes after the third beating they lowered my head into a toilet right there in the holding cell he goes on to describe being cuffed and hung from the ceiling being suspended in this manner brought about terrible pain in the wrists twisted out my elbows and caused horrible back pain i was suspended like that for half an hour then they took off my underwear and said they would bring another prisoner to rape me unless i stopped my hunger strike the prison boss later allegedly told dadin that if he complained his beatings could be made worse and he could be killed and buried under the fence dadin also claims he is being beaten several times a day as well as bullied and routinely humiliated this is happening with the other prisoners as well he writes mikhail khodorkovsky the oligarch who spent years in jail in russia before being amnestied in told the guardian he was familiar with these conditions khodorkovsky said he was locked up in the same penal colony in karelia after being convicted for a second time ildar dadin has finished up in the same prison camp simply for protesting peacefully and for expressing his personal views before i was there in soviet times political prisoners were locked up there too he says its an extremely tough place in recent years the prison authorities specialised in breaking serious criminals using illegal methods im afraid were once more in times where the new task is the intimidation of political activists russian prison officials cast doubt on the claims not one physical injury has been found on dadin said the deputy head of russias prison service valery maksimenko according to the russian news agency interfax russian newspaper novaya gazeta quoted an unidentified local prison service official as acknowledging that physical force had been used on dadin but only when he refused to leave his cell or defied prison guards dadin denies the accusations bill browder the chief executive of hermitage capital investment fund said dadins treatment was reminiscent of that meted out to his lawyer sergei magnitsky magnitsky was jailed and died in prison in after uncovering a tax fraud carried out by senior kremlin officials kremlin pours cold water on chief claims of russian threat read morebrowder said those responsible for torturing dadin should be put on the magnitsky sanctions list introduced by the us and several eu countries the act freezes the assets of russian officials who violate human rights what shocked me is that they hung him up by his wrists it brought me right back to seven years ago when sergei magnitsky was killed browder said i pray it doesnt happen to dadin approximately people went to the moscow headquarters of the federal penitentiary service on tuesday night to submit requests for an investigation into dadins mistreatment a photographer at the scene said ildar dadins letter in fullnastya if you decide to publish this information about what is happening to me then try to distribute it as widely as possible this will increase my chances of staying alive know that there is an entire mafia operating at penal colony it involves the entire administration among them the colonys head major sergey leonidovich kossiev and the vast majority of its employees including the doctors upon my arrival at the colony on september i had practically all of my things taken away from me two razor blades were then planted amongst my remaining possessions and subsequently discovered during an inspection this is a common practice here it gives them grounds to throw all newcomers into solitary confinement to ensure they immediately understand the hell that they found themselves in i was put into solitary without any official orders all of my things were taken away including soap my toothbrush toothpaste and even toilet paper in protest of these illegal activities i went on a hunger strike on september the colony head kossiev came to me with three employees together they started beating me over the course of that day i was beaten a total four times by people at once they would kick me after the third beating they lowered my head into a toilet right
the news is hard to escape these days with many people hearing about world events not just from news websites but also on social media platforms but what impact is this having on children it could be making them more anxious according to the nspccs childline service it reported an increase in the number of children seeking help for anxiety with concern around world affairs such as the eu referendum and syria conflict its thought that the rise is down to a combination of personal and political issues while the charity said others felt it was also partly due to disturbing events seen in the media and on social media we asked parents and grandparents about their experience of this and how they try to calm children down about world affairs young and anxious do your children express fears over global events read moresalley vickers from london my granddaughter loses sleep over terrorist attacksi am a former psychoanalyst working with people who suffered serious trauma and am now a full time novelist my eldest grandchild aged is extremely anxious about political events particularly potential terrorist attacks she has become worried about travelling on the tube in london when she visits me she is also worried about going into big shopping centres because of the threat of bombs and was deeply concerned after the paris attacks she is not at all frightened by any supposed muslim threat indeed she is rather promuslim having many muslim peers which is a good and reassuring aspect of modern childrens education but she is insecure about being suddenly attacked in a place that she previously experienced as familiar and fun she loves coming to london but feels being there is nowadays more dangerous these concerns affect her sleep she has confided she has periods of lying awake worrying about terrorism and reassurances that it will not happen to her do not and in my view cannot dispel her concerns my experience of working with trauma convinces me that anxiety needs to be addressed and not given a superficial bandage of comfort my granddaughter doesnt have a computer or ipod or direct access to the web on her phone but inevitably she sees the news with her parents and hears about whats happening in school from other children who tend to big up scary events inevitably she absorbs often false or exaggerated information from her peers who have access to social media while she cannot check out the truth what they say in my view the current state of the world needs to be discussed in schools as well as at home and the spreading of rumour and gossip about scary events needs to be addressed more fully as a serious element in the school curriculum teachers need to rethink how children are introduced to political world events now there is so much greater access to them more consideration needs to be given to the way social media which can now feed into a bullying process affects children bullying is hardly a novel phenomenon in schools but i dont think we are really up to speed with the way political events can be deployed to terrify the less well informed or the more sensitive there needs to be greater education on civic responsibility for everyone and i believe for the sake of a responsible future society it should start at a younger age children need to be taught to look at the news and public reactions critically and not take them at face value in the way they were once taught to be critical of texts amet akolawin from london my daughter gets more anxious about issues such as global warmingmy daughter who turns eight next week watches the news when i do so in the morning and evening she also watches cbbcs newsround most days we do talk about the headlines a lot she takes an interest in what is going on around the world she does worry about some of the stuff she sees just yesterday at bedtime we spoke about the us election and the wall donald trump wishes to build between mexico and america it lead on to us chatting about the berlin wall and the great wall of china my daughter is very inquisitive so talking about news is an simple way to give her some insight and pass on some of my knowledge she doesnt like watching clips of war torn countries but she will still listen to what the report is saying she is quite sensitive so if there is a piece on syria for example and i think the images are disturbing her i will ask her if she would like to watch something else to be honest she gets more anxiety from topics touched on in school such as global warming and natural disasters we go to visit her gran in sardinia twice a year and much of the news recently has been about the earthquake there she has become very fixated about this and i havent been able to reassure her about her uncle lives in rome so its understandable that she would worry but its definitely made her afraid of something similar happening to her when shes there jessica eaton from staffordshire my sons worry they will end up as refugees and no one will take care of themmy sons who are five and eight had a shocking realisation about three months ago that the war in syria was real they had been in the room with me and my husband when we were discussing the decision to launch airstrikes in syria we were watching footage about the civilian casualties and condemning the decision they have lots and lots of questions about war politics and weapons the boys went away to play for a while and must have got talking because they came back into the living room shortly afterwards very upset saying real people are dying in syria with real guns and bombs they
progress on climate change barry gardiner thinks that the successful ratification of the paris climate accords marks real progress toward a changed energy environment but other events raise doubts in britain the conservative government has approved one new gas fracking project and is supportive of a second in canada the liberal government has approved a massive liquefied natural gas pipeline project slated to become the biggest carbon polluter in the country putting its reduction promises at risk these and other decisions suggest that governments still are not making the connection between promises to reduce greenhouse gases and the need to reduce carbon combustion they still think they can square the circle between energy production growth and carbon pollution reduction they cant and until they understand that paris will go the way of kyoto which canada to its shame signed did nothing to fulfil then formally abandoned keith stotynedmonton alberta canadathe desire for protestmass protests by citizens outraged over aleppo would be tilting at windmills protests by our governments and the media are hypocritical we long ago accepted the us declaration of a war on terror as an appropriate response to a criminal act when we should have criticised the idea of declaring war on a strategy we tolerate saudi arabias bombing of yemen and when dropping bombs on a funeral results in hundreds of death and injured civilians headlines are short lived when the us drops bombs b carpet bombing in vietnam and laos smart bombs over afghanistan iraq bombs by drones wherever the us deems it appropriate in its war on terror there are no calls to boycott the us or any of the companies profiting from its war on terror we accept that our side kills only terrorists when civilians are killed it is a regrettable accident our policy is consistent on the subject of russias annexation of the crimea and the occupation of ukraine we have long ago accepted israels occupation of palestine and its settlement policy as we have accepted chinas annexation of tibet these countries are our political and economic allies with russia however we can afford to be self righteous as a young man in i joined a protest in front of the soviet embassy in berne switzerland as i see the world today ill stay home to watch coronation street andr carrelterrace british columbia canada thanks to natalie nougayrde for posing the question i have often asked myself concerned citizens in western countries will rightly turn out in their thousands to protest against human rights abuses perpetrated by their own governments but these same people seem to care less about similar abuses by other governments which must surely tell those governments that no one in the west cares one jot about dropping bunker busting bombs and carpet bombing civilians and no public figures in the west take any lead in encouraging such protests are they worried about offending these other governments nigel hungerfordhawthorn victoria australiathe allure of bottled wateri spent the summer of at the french italian station concordia high on the east antarctic plateau surrounded by the purest snow on earth but every day the kitchen crew put on to the dining room tables litre plastic bottles of water imported from italy every year tons of this water are imported at great expense why did the personnel prefer bottled water they thought that antarctic snow was too clean its distilled water so it doesnt contain essential minerals so they thought it was unhealthy of course they get plenty of those minerals from the gourmet food on offer but if theyre worried why not take a vitamin pill stephen g warrenseattle washington us your report on bottled water propelled such a thirst i

fascinating article by sophie elmhirst about bottled water it only touched on the actual plastic bottles that end up in many non recycling places my favourite comment is evian backwards naive kay nicholsonsheffield ukdylans nobel prizethanks for including natalie kon yus sober assessment of the problems with the award of the nobel prize in literature to yet another white man the gender bias is staggering and it is in general hard not to conclude that the nobel prize has become a form of european reactionary retrenchment the treatment of brilliant writers from africa or the diaspora is especially shocking no chinua achebe aim csaire or lopold sdar senghor before they died while ngugi wa thiongo gets passed over year after year the three most recent african laureates nadine gordimer j m coetzee and doris lessing who are all white toby greencambridge uk natalie kon yus piece on bob dylans nobel prize that it was just another example of nobels gender bias was outrageous you can question the award on grounds of the suitability or the quality of bob dylans work but to complain so bitterly about the award simply on the basis that dylan is a white male writer as kon yu does reduces the individual himself to nothing more than a skin colour and a gender that is outright racism and sexism to define dylans win only by his race and gender is bad enough it is outrageous when taking into account dylans prominent role in the civil rights movement of the david kettlenorthcote victoria australiadefending the dalai lamaalexandra taverniers remarks regarding the dalai lama and tibet merely parrot the official chinese line she implies that during the period of tibets de facto independence the country somehow regressed but conditions in were no more or less medieval than they had been under the chinese years before more outrageously she suggests that after the chinese embarked on a clean up of tibet hardly in i spent two months there and can attest that ordinary tibetans

its been a long old day and quite a dramatic one as mark carneys future came to a head faster than most experts expected no one really predicted that the boe governor would split the difference between his fans and his critics and plump to do an extra months duty at threadneedle street thats why the decision has been greeted fairly calmly with the government insisting its good news but businesses understandably concerned about what happens in sir martin sorrell probably spoke for many business leaders when he said it was a pity that carney wouldnt be at the helm until whatever you think about the european union theres an argument that its better not to change central bank governors in the middle of the brexit negotiations now the treasury has almost three years to find the perfect candidate to replace carney on july and help steer britain into its post eu future the immediate reaction from the city is still quite positive with the pound up of a cent at bloomberg brexit the pound rose when mark carney said he stay at the bank of england until https t co pic twitter com may find out one day how hard theresa may fought to keep carney or whether this compromise really

decision is now live heres a flavour mark carney to serve extra year as bank of england governor mark carney has ended weeks of speculation about his future by agreeing to stay on as governor of the bank of england until brexit negotiations with the eu have ended in despite being urged by the prime minister theresa may and the chancellor philip hammond to serve a full eight year term at threadneedle street until carney said he would only agree to remain in place for an extra year hestarted in the job in july the governor said in a letter to hammond that he had intended to leave the bank for personal reasons after five years but the altered landscape for the uk following the vote in june to leave the eu had caused him to change his mind mark carney to serve extra year as bank of england governor read moregoodnight and thanks for reading and commenting gw elizabeth martins an economist with hsbc has dubbed carneys decision a halfway house she says i guess that markets would have liked to see a extension and expected it given indications in the media but this will go down better than an earlier departure and howard archer of ihs global insight has given the news two cheers out of three and suggests carneys detractors should rein themselves in now that mr carney has made his intentions clear it is to be hoped that everyone gives the governor maximum support including his critics the uk faces a very challenging period ahead which will be demanding for all policymakers matters will not be helped by sniping at the bank of england governor or making statements that seemingly question at the bank of englands independence some bank of england trivia from newnights lewis goodall lewis goodall if you were wondering this makes carney the shortest serving governor of the bank of england since leslie in the you were ohoctober jacob rees mogg the conservative mp who clashed with mark carney at several parliamentary hearings doesnt appear very happy with tonights news he told reuters that i think the uncertainty was bad but i still think he ought to have gone because of his bias over brexit some pro brexit conservative mps arent best pleased that mark carney will remain at the bank of england until says the city am newspaper one leading tory brexiteer told them that my sense is that if carney is going to stay to he needs to find a way to row in behind the prime minister and start to find a way to be a bit more positive i would like him to stay and do a good job and demonstrate some enthusiasm for leaving the eu seeing as we are going to more here mark sands i got some snap reactions from tories on carney decision to stay it turns out they not all thrilled https t co pic twitter com duncan weldon head of research at

time businesses want stability at a time of economic change particularly at key institutions like the bank of england firms will be reassured that the recent speculation over the timing and nature of mark carneys departure has been put to rest however the governor will still be leaving at a sensitive time for the economy so businesses will want to see a clear and ordered transition plan an interesting reaction from rupert harrison of blackrock the asset manager rupert harrison in classic carney style by choosing years he has managed to ensure that he was right and everyone else was wrongoctober is a former advisor to george osborne who appointed carney in the first place british prime minister theresa may has welcomes mark carneys decision to extend his term at the bank of england by one year mays spokeswoman says the prime minister welcomes the governors decision to stay on beyond his initial five year term this is good news
those of you unfamiliar with the old testament will most likely know the teachings of ezekiel from pulp fiction there samuel l jackson solemnly intones that prophets words before clipping some kids the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men in the walking dead there is a new ezekiel not a prophet trapped in babylonian bondage but a former star of community theatre playing the role of king of an apparently thriving community in post zombie apocalypse usa hes a compelling character with lavish dreadlocks shakespearean regal patter and nearly forgot a tiger on a chain this last trapping of kingly power as you might expect impresses his subjects who believe the hokum that he wrestled the big cat into submission the truth that ezekiel was a zookeeper who found the injured beast alone in a pen after the zombie outbreak and tended it back to health and thence obedience is to my mind hardly less far fetched no matter who doesnt like watching a cgi tiger that said the life of pi set the bar high put a tiger on a raft with a boy on the indian ocean then see what happens what a premise shiva king ezekiels noble pet has its work cut out to eclipse that performance this new ezekiel is beset like his predecessor by inequities of the selfish not least having to produce weekly truckloads of goods for negans darkly evil gang the saviours who we saw at work last week torturing and murdering members of ricks crew for the best part of minutes after that scarcely watchable episode this more contemplative one was a blessed relief but heres the twist when king ezekiel and his horse riding breastplate wearing henchpersons supplied negans hoods with the carcasses of eight kingdom reared pigs as their weekly tribute little did the saviours know the horrible truth those pigs had been reared on zombie flesh i didnt pay attention in nutrition but my guess is that king ezekiel was subtly trying to slay his oppressors with this grotesque pork it was perhaps his application of what the other ezekiel said in the bible about striking down with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers except now its ezekiel whos doing the poisoning its the return of carol the dissembler who we last saw with her brutish husband photograph fox when world weary carol was brought by morgan to ezekiels court to recuperate after serial unpleasantnesses involving the tyranny of evil men she was sceptical about the kingdom but initially confided her doubts only to morgan i enjoyed the resulting return of carol the dissembler who we last saw with her brutish husband smiling impossibly sweetly as she receives the kingdoms bounty breakfast cobbler its like flavour on top of flavour she exclaimed cod enthusiastically after being offered a meal by an underling we were eating possums out there she was faking it of course really she thought the kingdom was a joke a cosy lie that distracted king ezekiels subjects from the unbearable reality of human life that has become nasty brutish and most likely short what made this episode so effective was that both carol and morgan arrived at the kingdom beset by their own existential crises she was despairing over life what is the point of surviving if it just brings more killing and death he was wondering if he could and indeed should rejoin the path of non violence after recently killing one of the saviours to stop him murdering carol in a particularly fine scene ezekiel called carol on her despair he told carol the dissembler that he recognised her type whats that saying he asked her never bullshit a bullshitter he realised she despised the kingdom but thought she needed to understand how it works before passing judgment the marvellous khary payton as king ezekiel flitting between speeches that were more merrie england than post apocalypse georgia and then into down home demotic explained that his kingdom worked on the principle of the platonic noble lie he had no real royal lineage no true heroic exploits but none of that mattered if he was to be an effective ruler why people want someone to follow its human nature they want someone to make them feel safe and so he did ezekiel even arranged the slaughter of the pigs out of his subjects earshot so the squeals didnt freak them out and he didnt confide the truth about the compromising deal hed cut with the saviours he was or at this point seemed to be a good man as the other ezekiel put it blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brothers keeper and the finder of lost children this latter day ezekiel then ruled a kingdom that is an oasis of seeming civilisation walled against the surrounding barbarism it had allotments livestock a little school a choir even fruit baskets to welcome guests like carol in this year of bob dylan becoming nobel laureate how fitting that the kingdoms choir was rehearsing his bobnesss dont think twice its all right that song of farewell to a lover who wasnt all that carol and morgan both arrived at the kingdom beset by their own existential crises photograph foxthe choir sang it aint no use to sit and wonder why babe quite so aint no use wonderin just get on with living perhaps that was why morgan found a role at the kingdom training a young man called ben in aikido this martial virtuosity with a staff and perhaps in his code of never killing humans carol refused to be so readily co opted into the kingdom youre a joke she sneered at ezekiel out there its real perhaps but suggested ezekiel life
fbi obtains warrant to search clinton aides laptopthe fbi has obtained a warrant to investigate emails found on a laptop used by clinton aide huma abedin as part of its investigation into the democratic presidential candidates use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state the move came as the senate minority leader harry reid said the fbi director james comey may have broken the hatch act which bars federal officials from using their official authority to influence an election by his decision to send a letter to republican congressional committee chairs on friday announcing the new development that showed clear intent to aid one political party over another reid said adding a claim that comey was not releasing information linking the trump campaign to russia

a tumbling pound is the defibrillator shock that britains ailing exporters desperately needed to halt their terminal decline thats the message repeated on an almost daily loop by economists for brexit now that sterling has lost almost a fifth of its value against the dollar and about against the euro since the referendum it follows that the eu referendum vote was the best thing that could happen to the economy almost overnight manufacturers have found the price of their goods abroad have dropped making them more competitive they just need to let the currency work for them revving up production safe in the knowledge they can undercut their rivals it is a narrow economic argument that uses germanys exporting prowess as a template this success is all about exporting upmarket cars trucks and machine tools to china brazil and the middle east german goods are well designed and reliable of course they also come with the added bonus of being priced using an artificially low rate of exchange gifted by the euro it is safe to say the rest of the world would be far less interested in german products if they were still priced in deutschmarks no matter how reliable or well designed they were they would simply be too expensive with the euro in place germany has kept manufacturing at the heart of its economy accounting for about of its national income the uk manufacturing sector accounts for less than john mills the labour supporting businessman has long campaigned for a lower pound in his most recent pamphlet the exchange rate he outlines the costs of going back to an era when a strong currency created a large balance of payments deficit and a cascade of side effects from weak investment through to low productivity and stagnant wages the central premise of his argument is that once a relatively low exchange rate is established investors and businesses have a clear view of the better profit margins on offer from exports and will invest more in the latest machinery and industrial processes manufacturers that scramble day to day in a desperate bid to remain part of supply chains beyond the already world beating car aerospace and pharmaceutical industries will take risks that mean productivity jumps in leaps and bounds britain needs a sunny postcard from the future now that the immediate effects of a low pound are making life difficult for consumers import prices are rising and already feeding into shop prices weve seen the early signs apple added to the cost of its latest macbook pros and unilevers prices including for marmite leaped by more than at morrisons consumer confidence surveys have dipped in the last month after a post referendum bounce and might deteriorate further should the two things people covet the most the latest mobile phone and a new car increase in cost once the currency hedges that keep prices stable run out we import all the phones and a majority of the cars we buy so prices are going to rise some time after christmas if not before yet the chances of mimicking germany are slim firstly there is the currency itself we have a floating exchange rate against the rest of the world which means it goes down in the bad times and up in the good times why would a manufacturing company bet on the currency staying low when a recovery in the uks fortunes will send it back up again neither the treasury nor the bank of england has expressed an appetite for managing the pound it is impossible they claim arguing that japans experiment with driving down its currency has run out of steam after only a couple of years all it took was for the big investment funds to be spooked by chinas slowdown in for money to flood into tokyo pushing up the yen to almost where it was before the experiment started japans answer was to flood its financial system with yet more central bank money hoping that would depress the currency china responded with a devaluation of its own which the authorities can stealthily carry out by diktat regardless of market sentiment closer to home the european central bank has despite its denials used its funds as part of an unofficial programme of currency suppression for the last two years these examples show something else everyone is at it not just the uk they all think the remedy for their ailing manufacturing companies is a swift devaluation and they are better placed to do it and maintain it without making cataclysmic decisions like leaving a free trade bloc theyve belonged to for years a look at the texbooks and recent analysis by the international monetary fund would say that any cut in the exchange rate should boost the supply of goods for exports but can we hand on heart say british boardrooms and investors are in any way primed to exploit this lets set aside the comments by the trade minister liam fox that britain is too fat and lazy to grab the chance offered by a low pound and new trading routes britain has shown it is better than that but how after years of decline when energy costs are three times what they are in the us or china when the banks are still risk averse after almost going bankrupt eight years ago when the nations non immigrant population is ageing and skills training is sliced as part of more general austerity cuts can the uk manufacturing sector say it is poised for action john mills would pull all the levers of the state to keep the pound low and offset any side effects its a jigsaw puzzle of measures that needs all of the pieces to be in place its a tall order you only need to look at what happened last week in texas to highlight the difference between the uk and some of its european neighbours austrian steelmaker voestalpine group one of
prime minister matteo renzi swore that italy would rebuild devastated towns and villages across central italy that were rocked by a magnitude earthquake on sunday morning saying the area represented the soul of our country it was the most powerful earthquake to hit italy since striking a blow to the regions of marche and umbria just days after they were hit by two other earthquakes it also frightened and displaced thousands of already jittery residents who have seen the ancient structures and walls in their towns including the san benedetto basilica in norcia which is considered a sacred site crumble into heaps on the street we will rebuild everything the houses the churches the shops we are dealing with marvelous territories territories of beauty renzi said the epicentre of the latest earthquake was about miles south west of perugia and close to the town of norcia which had also been hit by wednesday nights quakes there were no reported fatalities in the wake of the quake on sunday although it was even more powerful than the earthquake that hit laquila killing more than people and worse than the august earthquake that killed hundreds in amatrice there were about a dozen injuries with one person described as being in serious condition emergency services pulled three people from the rubble in tolentino a town in marche main roads to the affected areas were closed some impassable due to large boulders falling to the ground in the rocky mountainous terrain were safe alberto rendina the owner of a bar in norcia told la stampa this morning my wife was late opening the bar and was saved the family was at home but had been sleeping on the floor near the door in preparation for any eventuality rendina said residents in visso a town of in marche told sky tv that their homes are no longer there the bedroom has collapsed into the living room one resident said a man looked stunned as he was asked question by a journalist on television and could barely answer as he fiddled with a crate holding his dog which he put in the back of a pick up truck regional officials in marche warned that the earthquakes could lead to residents being displaced requests for some beds have been made to hotels along the adriatic coast but we think this number will rise marco manfredi the chief of the ancona unit for confcommercio the italian business association told la stampa the earthquakes in august and earlier this week had already displaced about said paolo bazzurro professor of hazard and risk assessment at the university institute for superior studies in pavia but he said the number would rise that there have not been any deaths is partly due to the fact that many houses were not inhabited after the quake on wednesday also there were many that hadnt been inspected yet so people would not have received an order to return home bazzurro said with the winter drawing in housing people will be much more complicated he added saying more aftershocks or other earthquakes could be expected in the next days and weeks while there was relative relief that the area was spared mass casualties there were other losses that were devastating centuries old structures including the cathedral and basilica of san benedetto in norcia a century church that was built to honor the patron saint of europe saint benedict was reduced to rubble as was a tower and st augustine church in amatrice news of the basilicas destruction was confirmed by benedictine monks in norcia who reported it on twitter in a statement on sunday morning the monks said they were safe because they had temporarily moved their monastery after augusts earthquake in amatrice but that there were looking for victims who might possible require the sacrament of last rites given to people close to death the statement posted below an image of the ruined basilica said may this image serve to illustrate the power of this earthquake and the urgency we monks feel to seek out those who need the sacraments on this difficult day for italy the quake was strongly felt in rome where it temporarily shut the citys metro lines to let officials check for damage and some reported feeling tremors as far away as tremors in neighbouring countries slovenia and croatia st pauls outside the walls basilica was also temporarily shut after some plaster fell off the church but was later reopened vatican firefighters inspected st peters basilica and other churches in the area on sunday morning live television images showed firefighters in norcias main square helping people running down small alleyways seeking safety including monks and nuns from a nearby monastery some then fell to their knees in prayer in the towns main square towns affected by italian earthquakemajor destruction was also reported in other small towns it all came down now there is no more town said aleandro petrucci the mayor of the marche town of arquata del tronto there had already been red zones in place abandoned after the previous quakes the few people who remained have gone out to the streets and are embracing now were going around to see what happened he said cesare spuri the head of civil protection in marche said there are collapses everywhere we report collapses in muccia tolentino and in the areas surrounding macerata were trying to establish if people are underneath the rubble there was also a strong shock in ancona everythings collapsed i see plumes of smoke its a disaster said marco rinaldi the mayor of ussita a town in the marche that was among the worst hit in a magnitude quake on wednesday night in rome the strong tremors caused concern i was woken up by the earthquake gianpaolo giovannelli who lives in the flaminio area of rome told the guardian the apartment started to shake we feel them here in rome but we never get used to them so
the latest furore over hillary clintons alleged misuse of private emails when she was secretary of state in has thrown a tumultuous and unedifying us presidential election into even greater confusion with little more than a week to go before voting day the fbis unexpected and very public revelation that it is recommencing its investigation into clintons conduct may not be politically motivated but its timing certainly makes it appear that way the row represents yet another hammer blow to a democratic process whose credibility has been repeatedly challenged principally by the unscrupulous republican candidate donald trump despite this new firestorm stoked by republicans and rightwing media it remains likely that american voters will deliver a clear possibly resounding rejection of trump on november although opinion polls show the race tightening nationally and nothing is certain as a febrile campaign climaxes clinton is ahead almost everywhere that matters and she is the sane and reasonable if uninspiring choice a trump defeat will be richly deserved as we have noted previously he is not a fit and proper person to serve in the white house his behaviour during a long raucous and often embarrassingly vulgar campaign made that abundantly plain yet consigning the donald to the rubbish bin of electoral history is easier than getting rid of trumpism this is likely to take a lot longer trumps platform was based not on thought through policies and careful analysis but on prejudice grievance ignorance and fear spiced with opportunism his unexpected success in winning the nomination despite the republican establishments hostility reflected his close identification with mainly white working class and lower middle class voters who like him feel angry undervalued and alienated while public figures such as barack obama trumps failed republican rival jeb bush and clinton appear to this constituency to be remote out of touch and uncaring trumpism peddles the delusion that the candidate is on their side again and again in ohio florida and elsewhere disaffected voters claimed that only trump could be trusted to tell the truth only trump would keep his promises only trump could make america great again oblivious to paradox irony history or facts trumpism projects a distorted vision of american greatness the trump doctrine decrees that a nation built by immigrants that became the most powerful on earth is so scared of migrant and refugee hordes that it must build a mile wall with mexico trumpism holds that a great nation that incorporated religious tolerance into its groundbreaking constitution and bill of rights must now shatter its own principles and deliberately discriminate against muslims to keep itself safe as general concepts trumpism makes an enemy of the other equates nationality with homogeneity calls honest critics liars and seeks to threaten jail or harm opponents it says individualism outweighs state authority as in the unfettered right to bear firearms but not perversely in the case of a womans right to choose abortion trumpism distrusts and fears foreigners it believes free trade international treaties and economic globalisation in general are loaded dice intended to rip off americans paranoid trumpism holds that long term allies such as germany and japan get a free security ride at americas expense trumpism admires the domestic authoritarianism and international bullying of dictatorships in russia and china vladimir putin is a strong leader standing up for his people national beliefs and way of life any inconvenient truth that contradicts this or other trumpist narratives is inherently mendacious part of a web of lies and falsehoods spun by the treacherous mass media conspiring with the establishment to dupe honest citizens and dont forget trumpism cannot be fairly defeated if it loses it was cheated for sure trumpism appeals to the worst in people cynically exploiting and fanning the anger grievances and prejudices of the economically disadvantaged the embittered uneducated and plain ignorant it appeals to base instincts to lowest common denominators its is political dumbing down writ large it is underpinned by a pervasive and comprehensible insecurity engendered across the west by post economic injustice and social division the growing gulf between rich and poor and incompetent unfeeling or corrupt governance fear is the common enemy but fear is trumpisms friend this phenomenon is not confined to america european countries including britain experience variations on the theme in germany and france concern about rising immigration has boosted hardline nationalists whose appeal and disturbing ideology extend far beyond the cathartic issue of syria in greece poland austria and hungary rightwing extremists evil dehumanising ideas about refugees migrants and foreigners in general have become a commonplace of political discussion in britain ukip provides a noisy echo chamber for some of trumpisms most divisive chauvinistic and discriminatory refrains if trumpism is indeed a transnational pestilence it would be wise to look for a common remedy but first the symptoms must be accurately diagnosed and its long term effects should not be exaggerated much of the political turbulence and iconoclasm witnessed of late in america and europe is the direct result of continuing negative economic fallout from the financial crash hard times austerity cuts high unemployment and low wages are the manure in which political aberration takes root but as history shows they sometimes yet rarely lead to disaster when economies improve generally speaking so too does the quality of political discourse ensuring all people benefit equally from such an improvement is the one certain antidote to extreme politics while protest movements share characteristics and aims it is also evident that they are not all the same as each other trumpism is an infection others can catch yet it is also unique to america before panicking about the advance of the far right and far left in europe commentators in britain and elsewhere should remember that when all is said and done mainstream politicians such as angela merkel alain jupp mariano rajoy and yes hillary clinton do on the whole get elected or re elected notwithstanding greeces epic upheavals the centre does mostly hold more than
by declining to put up an official candidate to fight the richmond park byelection the conservative party has shown itself to be cynical cowardly and rational it took the decision knowing that it is not a great look for the governing party to absent itself from the contest it calculated that it would be an even more dreadful look to field someone in the colours of mrs may and see them slaughtered which is what would have happened the chances of an official tory candidate winning in this leafy patch of southwest london would have been somewhat lower than a flying saucer piloted by elvis and lord lucan landing on the head of the loch ness monster there is no constituency in the country with a more intense concentration of rage about heathrow expansion and the government has just declared that it wants to multiply the number of planes flying over its rooftops the constituency voted heavily to remain within the european union and the government is embarked on a trajectory towards one of the harder versions of brexit a candidate in the name of the tory party would have split the conservative vote enhancing the chances of the lib dems taking the seat so cowardice and cynicism combined with logic yet this does not mean that the absence of an official competitor for the tory party is an unalloyed blessing for zac goldsmith the former conservative mp who is recontesting the seat in the guise of an independent once upon a time when he had a reputation as someone who was not enslaved to his partys line he might have been convincing in that role not now only a few months ago he was the conservative candidate for mayor of london moreover he made the disastrous decision not to run on his own terms but to be the frontman for a racially charged campaign designed by the tory machine both nasty and ineffective even his sister jemima khan was moved to publicly deplore that campaign only very occasionally in british politics have we seen genuine independents in parliament one such was martin bell the former bbc correspondent famed for his white suit who ran and won as the anti sleaze candidate against neil hamilton in tatton at the election zac goldsmith is no martin bell to see how truly independent he is we only have to visit the website of the local tory party when i checked there on saturday the banner at the top of the home page still featured his mugshot alongside the tory logo the strapline read supporting zac goldsmith in the richmond park constituency the video content is a stream of images of the man who is supposedly no longer a member of their party a statement by the chairman says that the association and its resources will not play a part in this byelection before declaring that individuals who are members of the association may well wish to support zacs campaign and they are at liberty to do so it then provides an email address for joining his campaign statements from the tory party nationally have conveyed their warmest wishes for his re election should he be returned as an mp it is widely suspected and he has not denied it that he will only sit as an independent for a while before after an interval he judges to be decent rejoining the tory party if words in politics retain any meaning zac goldsmith is no independent if he is re elected it will be a message to mrs may to carry on as you are it is a big challenge to run as a genuine independent because they cant usually compete with the money logistical capacity and activist base at the disposal of organised parties i guess the money is no obstacle in this case the trustafarian mr goldsmith has exceedingly deep pockets there is an issue over how much support overt or clandestine he is going to get from the conservative party will the tory machine feed him with voter data this is a highly valuable commodity especially at a byelection when turnout is often pivotal to the outcome it seems to be a legal grey area whether the tory party can gift him resources without it counting against the byelection spending limit or whether he should be expected to pay a commercial rate and count that as a campaign expense he starts with some significant advantages he has a well known name enjoys the benefits of incumbency and won a chunky majority of more than in the first opinion poll for what its worth has him comfortably ahead in an age that expects politicians to betray their pledges when they become inconvenient he may earn credit with some voters for keeping his promise to resign and recontest the seat if his party went ahead with heathrow expansion here though is a paradox this byelection may have been triggered by the runway decision but it is essentially irrelevant to the contest his lib dem rivals are just as opposed to the expansion of heathrow and unlike mr goldsmiths party they have always been united in their conviction that it is a terrible idea the lib dems who came second in the seat in and held it until ache for the boost in media attention and party morale that they would receive from a victory vince cable suggested that he might be up for attempting a comeback there but in the end he did not apply to be the candidate it concerns some lib dems that their flagbearer sarah olney lacks the name recognition and the experience of her opponent but that has not prevented them from pulling off byelection sensations before tim farrons party seeks to cast the contest as a referendum on the tory government and particularly its trajectory towards a hard brexit this makes sense if they are to see a national revival from their near death experience at the
monday october my dose of high energy radiation which to be honest im finding a bit more punishing than the seven cycles of chemotherapy ive just finished ive lost my appetite im more tired at the end of the day and pain when i eat and drink around the main tumour where my oesophagus joins my stomach is definitely worse in fairness to the radiotherapy staff at the royal marsden whove been brilliant they did say my symptoms would most likely get worse before they got better too true but details aside this is a big week for me and my cancer since the first line of chemotherapy which initially worked so brilliantly reducing the cancer and the liver and lymph node metastases was shown to have failed completely the key question has been what to do next and aside from the high dose radiotherapy aimed at controlling the main tumour hopefully preventing it from further restricting the oesophagus thats really about whether to start second line chemotherapy immediately or wait for some promising clinical trials due to open up in the next couple of months thats a conundrum because the rules of eligibility for many clinical trials stipulate first that any previous treatment must have ended some time before the trial starts for the reason i guess that if theyre not careful the trial will inadvertently reflect the results of the previous treatment rather than the drug or drugs its aimed at testing second in the case of the trials that might be relevant to me it is a requirement that any previous line of systematic chemotherapy treatment has failed and when you think about it from an ethical point of view you can see why taking a patient off a treatment with a scientifically underpinned known set of costs and benefits before it has failed to put them on to a new unproven treatment no matter how promising would be questionable and these questions of eligibility potentially so critical to me because of the huge promise offered by some of the new treatments being trialled all boil down to timing so there you go isnt cancer just like the rest of life so the question for me and my consultant now is whether my cancer especially the metastases in my liver are stable enough to allow us to wait for the trials to open or whether we need to get on with second line chemo immediately which unless it fails really quickly and lets hope that doesnt happen will probably rule out access to this next batch of trials which is why im due for another ct scan this afternoon tuesday october back at the royal marsden for the last of daily sessions of high dose radiotherapy thank goodness but critically also to see my consultant the amazing dr starling about the results of yesterdays ct scan and unfortunately although the cancer hasnt spread anywhere else and it looks as if the radiotherapy is working on the main tumour the news on my liver is not good the cancer is on the march says dr starling so we need to get on and treat it asap and that means a second line chemotherapy drug called paclitaxel delivered as an intravenous infusion every week for three weeks out of four and most likely no clinical trials at this stage of course there are new ones coming up all the time but whether theyll be relevant to me and my cancer and whether ill meet the eligibility criteria are for now all unknown as a fellow cancer combatant nick robinson has been a real source of support and invaluable advicebut heres the next twist in the story there is another drug called ramucirumab which has been shown to produce significantly better results when combined with paclitaxel in some patients as much as a per cent improvement in response rates says dr starling but heres the rub ramucirumab has been fully clinically trialled and licenced for use in the us europe asia and beyond and is now almost part of standard second line treatment for my cancer but on account of the way they measure its cost effectiveness nice do not recommend it in england and so the nhs does not fund it so what to do if money were no object or i was sitting here with full service private health insurance what would you say i ask dr starling she says id say take it without hesitation which raised the question of what it would cost if i chose to pay for it from my savings as that would be the only way i could get it first estimate from the marsdens private patient unit when you include day case fees for the treatment to be given along with the cost of the drug was stand by per monthly cycle cue very sharp intake of breath from yours truly friday october filming this morning for a bbc special on cancer with my very good friend nick robinson we first worked together on in the mid and then again years later at when i was editor as a fellow cancer combatant hes been a real source of support and invaluable advice and is one of the reasons i decided to go public with my diagnosis as he has done realising how much i didnt know and sensing how perplexing that can be might explain the huge public reaction theres been to my interviews with eddie mair on radio programme anyhow back to the cost of improving my chances with my second line chemo due to start this coming thursday on further investigation where would i be without google it transpires that i dont need as much of the drug as the private patient unit calculated and that the stark difference between what the drug company sells it for and the price proposed to me by the marsden included a mark up i understand and accept that if i choose to
were going close our rolling coverage of the presidential campaign with a few hours and days before election day you can read a summary of the days events here about hillary clintons subsequent remarks on the new fbi review here and about a falsehood strewn speech by donald trump in iowa here hillary clinton reacts to new fbi investigation into her emailshillary clinton demands fbi explain review of new batch of emails read more were a divided nation but we are fighting to bring us all together like here tonight theres love here theres love trump says we will make america wealthy again we will make america strong again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again god bless you with that trump closes out his rally we have the highest murder in this country in years trump says very falsely trump is distorting an fbi statistic into a false claim in september the agency reported that murders and non negligent manslaughter rose in the us by in the largest single year increase since that is not the same as saying there are more murders in the us than at any point since murders were reported in down from and highs of and there were more murders in than in the murder rate declined from to even though the population increased by a quarter during this weeks debate trump almost cited the statistic accurately saying we have an increase in murder within our cities the biggest in years the fbi figure is a national one not restricted to cities you dont hear that from these people he adds gesturing toward the press they dont want to talk about it you can read our report on it from the day of the release and before trump remarked on it through the link below murders up in biggest percentage increase since fbi data shows read more when i am elected president i am going to keep radical islamic terrorists out of this country trump says without details and yes we will build the wall and yes mexico will pay for the wall the cost of the wall is peanuts compared to what were talking about trump says nonpartisan analysts estimate the wall would cost at least the us goods trade deficit with mexico is about which is offset by the us surplus in services of if not for the open border policies of this administration trump says countless americans would be alive today the us does not have open borders and barack obama has deported more than million people a record as trump himself noted at hte final presidential debate hillary has pledged open borders trump says and supports sanctuary cities clinton does not support open borders but does support sanctuary cities and reform to let people pass background checks and pay back taxes in order to stay in the us and she supports obamas executive actions to shield some migrants such as people who were brought to the us as children like obama she supports deportation for people with criminal records we are going to have the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan this is only true if youre in the wealthiest bracket of american earners half of trumps tax cuts would go to the top of earners according to the tax policy center and most families below the top of earners would have income gains of less than trump doesnt linger long on the affordable care act though he leads the crowd in a chant of drain the swamp his new catchphrase for taking on corruption in washington forty five percent of african american children under the age of six are in poverty trump says inaccurately citing outdated data per politifact the poverty rates in question were as high as trump says they were at the depths of the great recession but they have since eased to somewhere between percent and percent depending on which income threshold you use still the rates for african american children are disproportionately high so trump has a point even if his statistics are too old and exaggerate the scale of poverty in that age group on balance we rate the statement half true another two million hispanic americans have fallen into poverty under the obama administration he says also falsely per the guardians own fact check trumps use of two million is misleading on two points he starts counting from when george w bush was still in office and from right before the financial crisis peak and he ignores that the hispanic population has grown dramatically in the eight years since then almost million hispanic people fell below the poverty line between and census poverty numbers show but the number of hispanic people in poverty has decreased during the recovery in it fell to down from in it will be very hard to leave your farm to your children and your heirs he says alluding to the so called death tax on inheritance though the estate tax actually only affects wealthy families and not the majority of americans trump then moves on to saying that hes really moving in the polls and that hes leading in many of them this is not true as election models and poll averages show i dont know whats going to happen now trump continues so much is at stake in this election when we win in november we are going to have honest government once again hillary clinton destroyed emails destroyed iphones he then says without evidence that clinton put her office up for sale to corporations and foreign donors hacked emails show concerns within the campaign that clintons husband bill was too close with various donors but no one has found evidence of a favor returned in exchange for donations to the clintons charitable foundation trump moves on to reminiscing about how last june he came down an elevator with his wife to announce his presidential campaign he abruptly segues into saying

was that was just his regular saturday night attire my failure to dress up appropriately meant that the now infamous viral hennoween pic is whiter than the set of sunrise but the thing im most bitter about the pic i took was way better than the one that rocketed around the world and it only got six likes spooky olly dixon i went to a vogue party dressed as a piratemy partner was working at brazilian vogue as art director and i was a freelance graphic designer we had been living in sao paulo for a few months and life was pretty good but we were young and didnt have much money so i always felt a little like a fraud among the fashion art scene people of brazil this was highlighted most spectacularly at a party vogue hosted the invitations were of course in portuguese but we understood them to a point the dress code said black tie or fancy dress i didnt have a tuxedo so was reluctant to go but my wife was keen to make a good impression and encouraged me to go for the fancy dress option i figured it would be fun and to be honest we didnt give it that much thought we were from london we went to loads of parties we were used to this sort of thing i opted for a pirate outfit cut off jeans flip flops and a hook hand and sword i had purchased from a local toy store a few hours before the party eye liner eye patch bandana my wife wore a beautiful vintage ball gown ready to go the party was held at hotel unique a huge modernist luxury hotel and it was hosted by naomi campbell gilberto gil was performing we turned up on the red carpet and not being celebrities we were of little interest to the paparazzi but i did feel we had a certain presence and caught the eye we entered im not saying all people turned and looked at me but it did feel like that the editor of vogue rushed towards us what are you doing why are you dressed as a pirate and why are you wearing flip flops to this party im in fancy dress on the invitation it said black tie or fancy dress what no no no

mapping out the likely features of the brexit age it is hard to know where to start headlines about government support for the nissan factory in sunderland and gdp rising immediately after the referendum do not detract from the big picture the uks post eu future remains gloomy and then some we are it seems at the start of a new era of border queues inflation renewed austerity with the prospect of rising unemployment and the exit from britain of banksand other financial services they may be modern villains but they are also one of the only dependable sources of tax revenue weve got left the richmond park byelection is a golden opportunity to fight brexit hugo dixon read morepolitical debate about what happens next is currently carved up between supporters of hard and soft brexit with just to add to all the absurdity the labour party saddled with a new position all of its own as reconfirmed by john mcdonnells media appearances this week hard in the sense that its leadership is relaxed about britain having only access to the single market but soft in its attitude to immigration even among the people who spent the late summer wondering whether the referendum might somehow be annulled the enemy is now a destructive brexit not the thing itself the pro eu noise that followed the vote it seems has dwindled to almost nothing you would think that no one is now calling into question what of us voted against but listen closely and you can hear it people wondering why the uk is doing this at all this week a yougov poll suggested that if a hypothetical stop brexit party put up candidates at an election it would get the support of of voters leaving labour trailing on indeed trawl recent surveys and you quickly get a sense of the people who are spooked with good reason the of people who say brexit will be bad for jobs the who think there will be negative effects on pensions the who agree with the no brainer proposition that leaving the eu will reduce britains influence in the world a lot of these people would presumably agree with ac grayling who may yet find himself in the unfamiliar position of speaking for a substantial body of public opinion leaving the eu he recently tweeted is obviously such an incredibly bad idea just stop it for many people including me that kind of talk always triggers a deep ambivalence if what took the leave side to victory was the support of so called left behind voters who had not been listened to for decades it still seems to me that arguing they should be ignored may not just be democratically questionable but a gift to the forces that even with ukip apparently imploding would know a once in a lifetime chance when they saw it and strike witness the pro brexit tycoon arron banks who now wants to bankroll nothing less than a peoples movement and give voice to england rising in that sense there remains a good argument for those of us who voted remain to stand back and let this frazzled example of government by plebiscite run its course while bearing in mind the immortal words of the us writer and satirist hl mencken democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard the snowballing brexit disaster will create a groundswell of public anxiety and outrageand yet and yet whatever your view it is unquestionably the case that at this rate the snowballing brexit disaster will create a groundswell of public anxiety and outrage and a big opportunity for a party willing to channel them at the national level at least this seems unlikely to be labour for three reasons the number of core labour voters who supported leave the anti eu inclinations of its leadership and the general cluelessness that suggests it tends to view glaring political opportunities as some kind of bourgeois trick in which case there is one obvious candidate the liberal democrats for sure they have a hell of a lot to surmount the deep damage to their reputation done by the coalition years a leader who has yet to break into the public consciousness and an almost total lack of powerbases even in their traditional redoubts but with memories of their grim partnership with the tories fading an intersecting alliance of voters could yet be theirs those variously worried about hard brexit drawn to the lib dems insistence on a second referendum and in many cases opposed to leaving the eu per se people who if the government sticks to its current hard line and or the eu refuses to play ball may well become one big anti brexit bloc there was a flavour of this at this at last weeks witney byelection whose pretty miraculous result a swing from the tories to a party we all thought was dead has been rather overlooked along with tim farrons trumpeting of the result a clear rejection he said of the conservative brexit governments plan to take britain out of the single market what happened there highlighted a tension hardly unique to that corner of the country that was arguably always going to explode the conservative party faced thousands of tory inclined voters who supported remain after weeks of telling them that whatever their anxieties it was now likely to be hard brexit all the way surprise surprise a lot of them didnt like it something similar is likely to happen in the looming richmond park byelection which zac goldsmith wants to be about a third heathrow runway but thanks to the absence of an official tory candidate and an already energised lib dem campaign may well turn out to be a contest much more focused on europe and goldsmiths leap away from thousands of his constituents they live in a borough that voted for remain in
european union leaders have expressed hope of signing a trade deal with canada after belgian politicians overcame differences that had been blocking the treaty the belgian prime minister charles michel confirmed that leaders of five regional parliaments had reached an agreement with the federal government shortly after midday on thursday he tweeted charles michel belgian agreement on ceta all parliaments are now able to approve by tomorrow at midnight important step for eu and canadaoctober belgian compromise a four page text that sits alongside the page treaty was approved by ambassadors from eu member states on thursday afternoon belgiums regional parliaments are expected to endorse the text on friday paving the way for the deal to come into force on a temporary basis canadas foreign minister stphane dion said he was prudently optimistic that the treaty could be signed if it happens it is excellent news but he added that a scalded cat fears cold water what does ceta mean for brexit the european union and canada have spent seven years negotiating a trade treaty the comprehensive economic and trade agreement would abolish most tariffs between the eu and canada and pull down many barriers to transatlantic business conservative politicians including boris johnson and david davis have hailed the treaty as a model for post brexit britain but ceta has to be approved by all eu member states it has faced opposition from regional parliaments in belgium and scrutiny from germanys highest court some fear the uk could encounter similar problems in striking a free trade agreement with the eu the british government has dismissed the parallel officials argue that putting up trade barriers is very different from taking them down the belgian compromise came too late for an eu canada summit that had been scheduled for thursday the canadian prime minister justin trudeau had been due to meet the eu leaders donald tusk and jean claude juncker in brussels but decided at the last minute not to get on the plane as belgian politicians wrangled over the agreement late on wednesday night cecilia malmstrm the eu trade commissioner leading the trade talks with canada said she hoped a date could be set soon to sign the accord tusk the european council president sounded a note of caution tweeting donald tusk i am glad for good news from pm charlesmichel only once all procedures are finalised for eu signing ceta will i contact pm justintrudeauoctober comprehensive economic and trade agreement known as ceta which has been seven years in the making stumbled near the finish line amid strong opposition from the belgian regional parliament of wallonia the eu requires all member states to support ceta for the treaty to come into force but the belgian federal government which has always backed the trade treaty was barred from giving its consent because of opposition from regional parliaments in wallonia and brussels paul magnette wallonias minister president who had been leading opposition to the agreement had wanted to reopen talks with canada but the eu institutions insisted that was impossible wallonia has been nervous about exposing its agricultural sector to competition from canadian farmers magnette had also raised objections to a proposed court system for settling disputes between foreign investors and governments one concession he won means that belgium would be able to go to the european court of justice to determine whether a system of investor state tribunals were compatible with eu law the four page document contains a guarantee that the belgian government will assess the socio economic and environmental impact of ceta the walloon minister president who has been dubbed super magnette in the belgian media said wallonia is extremely happy that our demands have been heard speaking of the delay magnette said he was sorry for our european partners and for the canadians but what we managed to get here is important not just for wallonians but for all europeans the special court that ceta would create has proved so controversial that the commission has decided it will not come into force immediately eu member states insisted that national parliaments should have a say on aspects of the eu canada deal that touch on national competences even if the eu and canada sign the treaty in the coming weeks ceta will only become a complete and permanent legal document following ratification by at least national and regional parliaments in europe only the backing of national parliaments would trigger the creation of an exclusive trade court to replace the investor state dispute settlement the existing system for resolving trade disputes that has existed since the this system is written into thousands of investment contracts including involving eu countries critics have rung alarm bells about the scope isds gives private companies to sue governments the commission argues that its proposed changes to existing investor courts deepen transparency and end conflicts of interest as judges would be appointed by governments and not companies but critics have dismissed the reforms as rebranding campaign groups welcomed the belgian challenge to the investor state tribunals the use of investment tribunals allows companies to sue governments for lost profits if they introduce laws to protect people or the environment said paul de clerck of friends of the earth europe these corporate courts have no place in our democracies and we welcome the stance of the dissenting belgian regions in contending them the european commission had no immediate comment on the challenge to the investor court idea it has championed but a spokesperson said events were unfolding in a good direction what matters is not when the ceta signing happens but the fact that it happens and it will happen shortly after the compromise was announced several dozen activists launched a rowdy but peaceful protest outside the commission headquarters in brussels holding aloft banners reading stop ceta protesters banged drums occasionally jeered at passing eu officials and sang songs including the les misrables musical number can you hear the people sing the cliffhanger story of the
kent university student union has been criticised after using images of former one direction singer zayn malik and london mayor sadiq khan to promote black history month the universitys students branded this an embarrassment black history month traditionally celebrates the culture of britons of african and caribbean descent the union apologised and said that in the planning stages kent union worked with students to develop a campaign that celebrated a range of ethnic cultures following the national union of students position on black history month which is to recognise and celebrate the immense contributions that people of african arab asian and caribbean heritage make to humanity this definition has roots in the idea of political blackness a term which was used by many in the british anti racist movement during the the idea that anyone from a group affected by racism could identify as politically black to form a united group but is this idea still relevant today amrit wilson political blackness lingers on but the unity of africans and asians has fadedwhy were zayn malik and sadiq khan selected as poster boys for black history month they are not black they are not politically black either although the two men are very different neither even self identifies with the powerful politics of political blackness which originated in the united struggle of working class african caribbean and asian communities against racism and imperialism in the that unity was deliberately destroyed after the youth uprisings against racist policing when the thatcher government imposed not only more police powers but the term black and minority ethnic to define us all bme people and organisations were then made to compete for handouts from the state leading to division not unity the term politically black lingered on useful at times counterproductive at others while the vitally important underlying concept of african asian unity faded away black history month was first celebrated in the uk in long after bmeness had tightened its hold it was always about black not asian or minority ethnic history while it makes sense to commemorate the grunwick strike as part of black history month because although primarily asian it was part of a united struggle foisting malik and khan on the celebrations as black icons is both ridiculous and just plain wrong it is also utterly divisive there is no dearth of inspiring people of african origin in britain both historically and in the present from claudia jones to ben okri to bill morris kehinde andrews solidarity shouldnt mean creating a shared identitytheres a new type of negro who calls himself black this new type of black man who wants to think for himself speak for himself stand on his own feet and walk for himself explained malcolm x in the embrace of blackness rooted in african ancestry was a powerful political tool that fuelled an unapologetic and radical resistance to racism blackness has always been a political idea that has its roots in much earlier struggles against enslavement colonialism and racism in britain the use of the term political blackness is problematic for a number of reasons i am not a non white to define ourselves in relation to whiteness is to entirely disempower our politics i am black embracing my features as not a symbol of shame but a glorious symbol of greatness as marcus garvey put it connecting me to the african diaspora student union promotes black history month with zayn malik picture read morea dangerous myth has developed that ethnic minorities rallied around the banner of political blackness before the state money from multiculturalism caused bitter divisions this erases the history of political organising based around shared african ancestry which has strong roots in britain the first pan african congress was held in london in the hugely influential fifth pan african congress in manchester in and there has been an unbroken history of grassroots organising including the black supplementary school movement anti racist unity has historically involved organisations based in different ethnic minority communities coming together to fight specific issues when caribbean indian and pakistani groups worked together to fight the commonwealth immigrants act in for instance a shared non white identity has never been necessary to build coalitions real solidarity is based on organising around shared issues and not trying to create a shared identity that erases the substantial differences between a wide variety of peoples vera chok political blackness flattens out many different experienceswhen we talk about race we tend to use the language of black and white its clear yes but i dont find this simplistic binary constructive it positions blackness at one end historically negatively associated with darkness and evil or today with drugs poverty or crime and whiteness as the pinnacle i fully understand why a person of colour might choose to self define as being politically black sharing as we do experiences of institutional racism but i do not assume this position because i believe it reinforces counterproductive shadeism where my worth is tied to the shade of my skin and because it positions me in relation to white oppressors or the black oppressed the experiences and narratives of non black people of colour shouldnt be flattened out in this way blackness shouldnt be reduced to a victimhood that needs to be rebalanced white privilege absolutely exists yes but it should be diluted with the plurality of the rest of humanity rather than sitting in opposition to a socially constructed position of blackness labels and messaging shape our worldview whats media friendly and prominent in our consciousness in the uk media we dont see south asians portrayed in a way that reflects their position as the largest racial minority group in the uk east asians the third largest and fastest growing racial group at million people bear the damning model minority label which isolates them from other people of colour and condemns them to an invisibility where violence against them is ignored because we dont care to ask why

the ticketing website viagogo has been branded disgusting for seeking to profit from a charity event hosted by the actor and comedian peter kay to raise funds for cancer research uk criticism of viagogo came as it emerged that the company and its competitors faced being questioned by a parliamentary select committee amid a political crackdown on ticket touting tickets for kays dance for life events went on sale last weekend at a face value of with all profits donated to the cancer charity hundreds of fans tried to buy tickets as soon as they went on sale but missed out and thensaw tickets for the events appear on viagogo minutes later and for hundreds of pounds there has been growing scrutiny of touts who use a variety of specialist methods to harvest hundreds of tickets within seconds to sell at a profit via secondary ticketing platforms such as viagogo tickets for the dance for life event appeared on viagogos website over the weekend one ticket at the ricoh arena in coventry was listed for including vat and a booking fee of that would go directly to viagogo if a buyer were found industry insiders said the highest priced tickets tended to be listed as a publicity stunt rather than with an expectation of a sale but that many other tickets listed for hundreds of pounds were likely to sell viagogo which has a large call centre in london but has headquarters in geneva typically takes up to on the value of tickets sold claire rowney director of stand up to cancer at cancer research uk said all the money we raise will help fund vital research that will accelerate new treatments and tests to uk patients and save more lives more quickly weve been made aware that tickets are being sold for much more than the set ticket price with the profit going to the seller and not to the charity cancer research uk relies entirely on the generosity of the public to fund our life saving research and so we encourage anyone who is buying a ticket to support the event to be aware of any sellers who are not donating all the profits to stand up to cancer the conservative mp nigel adams who recently tabled an amendment recommending criminalisation of the use by touts of software called bots to harvest tickets called on viagogo to donate its profits to cancer research uk i would like to think that viagogo would do the right thing and donate an appropriate margin from their commission towards the charity im sure peter kay would be interested if they dont it would be a sad reflection on them kay did not respond to requests for comment adams added that he hoped to talk in person to executives from ticket resale firms such as viagogo stubhub getmein and seatwave ill be pushing for a further select committee enquiry into ticketing because technology has developed industrial touting and the fleecing of fans continues apace id like to see all the ticketing sites appear before the inquiry the labour mp sharon hodgson who has campaigned for reform of ticketing said it seems that nothing is beyond their grasp and greed and their willingness to exploit some of the most vulnerable in society whilst they are in a life or death battle such as cancer patients by profiteering in such a callous fashion shows the very worst aspect of their business model fans expressed their disappointment on twitter after missing out on tickets and seeing them resold at a profit ash hayward sad to see people buying tickets for peterkay co uk dance for life for life selling them on for a lot more no wonder we couldnt get oneoctober smith from leeds said she her mother and a friend tried to get tickets for the lancashire comedians dance a thon the morning they went on sale but were unsuccessful i am absolutely disgusted tickets that were originally bought for the original face value of are now being sold for and above she said there are genuine fans and people who want to go to the show to see peter kay and raise money for charity and ticket touts are making a large margin of profit from them its horrible i was hoping to buy these tickets for my family as a christmas present and now no one gets to go and these people are making a fortune out of it it is even more disgusting because this is an event for charity and those able to pay upwards of a per ticket could spend that extra money at the event and donating it to charity kiahleigh absolutely gutted i did get tickets for peterkay co uk dance for life next year sold out well fastoctober which has also been warned that it could face legal action for advertising tickets before they go on sale did not respond to a request for comment last month the ticket resale websites seatwave and getmein both owned by ticketmaster agreed to remove tickets for the bbc children in need rocks for terry event from their website seatwave lists tickets for the peter kay dance for life event but has pledged to donate all of its commission from their sale to cancer research uk however those using seatwave to sell the tickets could simply bank their profits secondary ticketing has come under scrutiny in recent weeks following the tabling of an amendment to the digital economy bill that would usher in jail terms for touts who use bots to grab tickets within seconds of their going on sale a government backed review by mike waterson an economics professor at warwick university warned this year that websites could be flouting consumer rights law viagogo is the brainchild of eric baker an american tech expert who co founded the ticketing website stubhub which he sold to ebay for a deal believed to have made him more than viagogo has grown rapidly
how is everyone doing ready for november yet tonight i was asked to speak about a vision for the next hundred years of reproductive choice and justice its such a wonderful frame to think about what a feminist future might look like but i bet like a lot of you its hard to imagine what the next hundred years will look like when so much of that for women especially will depend on what happens in just days there is no overstating how important this election is its not just about the next four or eight years this decision is about sending a message about who we are as a country and setting a very particular course for the women who live here well look back on this time as a watershed moment a moment that could in fact shape the next hundred years of womens rights but first i want to share a personal story a little over six years ago i was pregnant with my daughter layla and when i was weeks pregnant i got incredibly ill i developed pre eclampsia which some of you might know is dangerously high blood pressure during pregnancy i was admitted to the hospital and within just a few days i developed another complication called hellp syndrome the short version being my liver was in danger of failing and i was in danger of dying if my daughter was not born i had an emergency c section and layla was born weighing she stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first two months of her life undergoing medical interventions to save and protect her that to this day i try to avoid thinking about but i was lucky and she was lucky and today shes a wonderful healthy six year old and i feel grateful for that every day i share this story often because this was something in my life that changed me forever that shaped who i am today and when i think about this moment what i think about most often is how fortunate i was that i got sick far enough along in my pregnancy that i wasnt faced with the reality of needing an abortion to save my life and when i think about those days in the hospital the fear the urgency the confusion the stress the idea that the government could ever become involved in my lifes most pivotal moment it horrifies me so one thing i want for the next hundred years i want for no person ever to fear that their most personal life choices will be made by someone else i want for no woman ever to be afraid that her scariest life moment will be made even more difficult and traumatic by government interference in the next hundred years i want to see every woman be free from the fear that her body is not really her own and thats why i want to talk about this election tonight because thats whats at stake never before in american politics have womens bodies been so front and center in the national conversation and so at risk we are choosing between a candidate who has spent her political career fighting for reproductive rights and a candidate who says that women who have abortions need to be punished a candidate who said this week in the final debate unequivocally that she will defend planned parenthood and a candidate who promised to defund it a choice between a person who has spent her life in public service and a braggadocious businessman who rips off his workers and perhaps most tellingly were making a decision between a woman who has said that womens rights are human rights and a man who says if you want to you can just grab women by the pussy theres a feminist rallying cry online right now that i like a lot and it says november pussy grabs back now i know that so much has been made of that comment and the ensuing allegations against trump by multiple women that he did just what he bragged about doing on that tape and while some people may not see the link between sexual assault and reproductive rights those of us here in this room know better we know that there is a direct connection between those who think they can touch womens bodies without permission and those who think they can legislate our bodies reproductive rights and justice has always been about a fundamental respect or in this case disrespect of womens bodily integrity and autonomy either our bodies are our own or theyre not and make no mistake the conversation that were having right now about groping is not just salacious media fodder the way we come out of this moment the direction our culture shifts because of it will absolutely determine womens rights in the future we are witnessing a moment where our country could move backwards back to a place where boys will be boys and men will make decisions for women or towards a future where our culture and politics understand and respect women as autonomous full human beings those are the two paths right now im optimistic that were on the right one the one that brings us to the feminist future all of us in this room have been waiting for when trump said he wanted to punish women for having abortions there was outrage and he had to walk back those comments but more importantly pro choice activists and organizations like planned parenthood were there to point out that while other politicians may not say they want women to be punished thats exactly what would happen if abortion were made illegal and in fact what has already happened to women like purvi patel who was put in prison for inducing her own abortion in indiana our feminist future has no place for criminalizing women who decide if and when to parent when
a melbourne cinema has cancelled a screening of a documentary on mens rights activism for fear it could be potentially damaging to our credibility following online uproar the red pill a documentary by film maker cassie jaye was due to screen at palace cinemas kino cinema on sunday november at an event organised by mens rights melbourne the film professes to take a balanced approach to the mens rights movement documenting jayes life altering journey where she would never see the world the same way again but it has faced backlash from members of the feminist community and has been criticised as unbalanced and in favour of mens rights groups the australian premiere was cancelled on wednesday after an online petition calling on the cinema to abandon the misogynistic propaganda film eclipsed signatures susie smith who founded the petition on change org said the film gave a platform to views similar to those of daryush roosh v valizadeh a self described neo masculinist whose planned visit to australia caused a stir with immigration in february this is the kind of disgusting violent message that is totally out of line with australian values and law smith wrote daryush valizadeh cancels neo masculinist meetings over safety read moreplease do not associate your cinema with the kind of people who teach men how to violate women physically and emotionally please stand with the women everywhere and do not promote misogynistic hate the petition was directly referenced by kino cinema in its email to notify david williams the event organiser and a spokesman for mens rights melbourne that the screening had been cancelled guardian australia has contacted williams for comment williams pasted the email above a rival petition on change org set up to stop extremists censoring what australians are allowed to see at time of writing it had more than signatures in the email the representative of kino cinema told williams that much of the feedback to the screening of the red pill assumed that it was a curatorial decision which is potentially damaging to our credibility as we are yet to see the film so cannot stand by its contents in the face of the criticism we are receiving a spokeswoman for palace cinemas confirmed that the email pasted by williams was sent by staff at kino cinema benjamin zeccola chief executive of palace cinemas told guardian australia on thursday that the decision to cancel the screening was made in the absence of any judgement of the film filmmakers or attendees however what was initially booked as a closed private screening was being publicised widely and this in turn upset a significant proportion of our customers who communicated their feelings to us directly upon receiving such direct feedback we realised that irrespective of the content its presence in one of our cinemas was offensive to a large section of our core audience and movie club members therefore we took the decision to cancel the screening aware that regardless of the decision we took a significant number of people would be disgruntled so we took the decision that we think was best for our customer base at that time jaye rallied against the decision on social media and called for one melbourne movie theatre to defend free speech and host the screening the numbers are on our side people want to see the red pill so why arent any australian movie theatres wiling to stand up to censorship she wrote williams told the herald sun he was determined to find a new venue to screen her film cassie jaye it confirmed palace cinemas has pulled the red pill a film they have not even seen read their letter here https t co jaye uninformed protestors bullied a melbourne theater into censoring redpillmovie but have signed wanting to save the red pill october jaye just need one melbourne theater to defend free speech and screen redpillmovie but they all saying they do want to invite controversyoctober told guardian australia she was very disappointed that a petition filled with lies raised the response it did and that kino cinema had decided to cave to these bullies demands rather than stand up for whats right im still hopeful that the red pill will find a courageous australian cinema to support a screening of the documentary and if that happens i believe that theatre will receive a lot of praise and support from the general public for standing up for free speech pointing to her portfolio of work she said she was a supporter of womens rights and gay rights i am not a mens rights activist even after making the red pill but i do believe in having an open dialogue about gender equality and thats what my film is about she said she told the website breitbart last year that she had struggled to find executive producers who were prepared to work on a balanced film about the mens rights movement we found people who wanted to make a feminist film though the film eventually raised more than us on kickstarter its release has been plagued with controversy much centring around one of its central subjects paul elam the founder of the mens rights website a voice for men which has published some deliberately inflammatory articles on domestic violence feminism and rape you see i find you as a feminist to be a loathsome vile piece of human garbage reads one of his posts on the site i find you so pernicious and repugnant that the idea of fucking your shit up gives me an erection alan scherstuhl referenced elams writings in his review of the documentary for the village voice the red pill he noted was screened in theatres mostly so that outlets like this one get tricked into running reviews that even if negative confer some kind of legitimacy i apologise for taking the bait he added david futrelle a chicago blogger who tracks and mocks the mens rights movement on his website
donald trump photograph mark wallheiser getty imagesdonald trump said today that hillary clintons plan for syria would lead to world war three because of the potential for conflict with military forces from nuclear armed russia in an interview focused largely on foreign policy the republican presidential nominee said defeating islamic state was a higher priority than persuading than syrian president bashar al assad to step down playing down a long held goal of us policy trump questioned how his democratic opponent would negotiate with russias president vladimir putin after having demonized him blamed barack obama for a downturn in us relations with the philippines under its new president rodrigo duterte bemoaned a lack of republican unity behind his candidacy and said he would easily win the election if the party leaders supported him if we had party unity we couldnt lose this election to hillary clinton trump said as they go to the polls in a historic presidential election more than six in americans say neither major political party represents their views any longer a survey has found dissatisfaction with both democrats and republicans has risen sharply since when less than half held that neither reflected their opinions according to research by the public religion research institute a former aide to republican governor chris christie reiterated today that a now infamous email she sent saying time for some traffic problems near the george washington bridge in referred to a traffic study not a political retaliation plot trump implied today that he would be willing to fight the sitting vice president joe biden behind a barn speaking at a rally in tallahassee florida almost precisely two weeks to the minute to when polls close there on election day trump

life you could really love doing fox news host megyn kelly and former house speaker newt gingrich engaged in an aggressive argument tonight over lingering questions regarding donald trumps treatment of women and how it might affect him in the coming presidential election with gingrich accusing kelly of bias against trump and kelly urging gingrich to take your anger issues and spend some time working on them im sick and tired of people like you using language thats inflammatory thats not true gingrich shouted i think that is exactly the bias that people are upset by i think that your defensiveness on this may speak volumes sir kelly deadpanned what i said is if donald trump is a sexual predator then its a big story what we saw on that tape was trump himself saying that he likes to grab women by the genitals and kiss them against their will kelly continued referring to a tape that showed trump bragging about being able to sexually assault women with impunity because of his fame then we saw ten women come forward after he actually denied doing it at a debate to say that was untrue he did it to me he did it to me he did it to me we saw it with reporters people who had worked with him people from apprentice and so on and so forth he denies it it all which is his right we dont know what the truth is my point to you is as a media story we dont get to say the ten women are lying kelly continued we have to cover that story sir gingrich dismissed kellys assertion and decried the amount of focus paid on trumps sexual assault accusations you are fascinated with sex and you dont care about public policy gingrich responded and thats what i get out of watching you tonight im not fascinated by sex but i am fascinated by protection of women and understanding what were getting in the oval office kelly retorted its not about me its about the women and men of america and the poll numbers show us that the women of america in particular are very concerned about these allegations the former speaker of the house of representatives responded by daring kelly to call former president bill clinton a sexual predator which kelly ignored were gonna have to leave it at that and you can take your anger issues and spend some time working on them mister speaker kelly concluded and you too gingrich responded meekly the trump campaign swiftly responded deeming gingrichs appearance a success dan scavino jr newtgingrich just destroyed megynkelly shows she is totally biased against mr trump not very smart mr trump has long known october hillary clintons campaign has released yet another spanish language advertisement in ruby red arizona although theres no word yet whether clinton plans on visiting the grand canyon state herself families are complicated malik obama all i know is that my brother has done nothing for the kenyan side of his family i wonder if we are related sometimes october scott adams the author behind the once popular dilbert cartoons has published a blog post in which he offers his qualified support of donald trump but vows to assist in his assassination if trump does anything that looks even slightly hitler ish in office in a post titled the crook versus the monster adams argues that the public conception of trump as a monster are misguided but that if they prove accurate adams vows to join the resistance movement and help kill him calling it an easy promise to make adams continues i hope my fellow citizens would use their second amendment rights to rise up and help me kill any hitler type person who rose to the top job in this country no matter who it is what could be a more suitable ending to this awful campaign than a fistfight between donald trump and joe biden donald trump photograph jonathan ernst
