savage kingdom , a three part nature documentary that begins friday on nat geo wild , is hard to watch and even harder to listen to its an effort to capitalize on game of thrones by imposing a human narrative onto wild animals in botswana , in southern africa a game of thrones star , charles dance \( who plays tywin lannister in that hbo series \) , reads a ponderous narration in a sonorous voice that is supposed to be ominously intriguing but is too often just nap inducing it doesnt help that the default speed of the six hour mini series seems to be slow motion the combination of voice and slow motion is only slightly more stimulating than a television yule log thats too bad , because the imagery can be impressive we see big cats lions , leopards snatching prey out of trees and on the plains turning on one another trying in vain to protect cubs we see hyenas battle wild dogs the special was filmed over two years , and you can only marvel at some of the shots and wonder how they were obtained that said , the program is preoccupied with blood and death , so much so that the episodes are preceded by a viewer advisory rarely do more than a few minutes go by without a shot of one animal carrying a chunk of some other animal in its jaws random close ups of grinning skulls and fly covered leg bones are used as transitional adornments theres nothing wrong with emphasizing the kill or be killed reality of life in the wild , but thats been done before , repeatedly to set itself apart , savage kingdom accompanies the grisly footage with a sort of story line in which the leaders of the various species have names \( the top billed lioness is matsumi , the featured leopard is saba , and so on \) , and all of them are plotting and scheming for control of a game rich marsh the clich heavy narration mr dance is saddled with is full of references to defending the border and military style strategy worthy of macarthur in this overwrought world , female hyenas arent merely tending their young the sisterhood is raising an army , mr dance intones trying to shake off the sameness that has settled over a lot of wildlife programming is a commendable instinct , but the treatment here is a bit much for a more easygoing animal themed offering , try polar bear town , a six part documentary series that began in mid november on the smithsonian channel the series , with new episodes wednesday nights , chronicles the annual polar bear migration that runs through churchill , a town in manitoba , canada , where the relocating bears are a tourist draw the series explores the push and pull between the natural world and the human one things can become dicey when the gawkers forget that the bears are wild animals our first priority is the safety of people from polar bears , bob windsor , a manitoba natural resource officer , explained in the first episode second priority is basically the safety of polar bears from people churchill has tour guides who make a living off taking tourists to see bears , a job that became more difficult recently after a bear attack now the authorities are more aggressive about keeping bears away from people , and some of the guides best viewing spots are off limits seeing tourists intrude on the natural cycle of the animals is annoying , but its hard to blame them the bears are gorgeous its too bad , at least from the bears perspective , that this series will probably encourage even more tourists to come
washington in the summer of 2015 , armed american drones over eastern syria stalked junaid hussain , an influential hacker and recruiter for the islamic state for weeks , mr hussain was careful to keep his young stepson by his side , and the drones held their fire but late one night , mr hussain left an internet cafe alone , and minutes later a hellfire missile killed him as he walked between two buildings in raqqa , syria , the islamic states de facto capital mr hussain , a 21 year old from birmingham , england , was a leader of a band of english speaking computer specialists who had given a far reaching megaphone to islamic state propaganda and exhorted online followers to carry out attacks in the west one by one , american and allied forces have killed the most important of roughly a dozen members of the cell , which the f b i calls the legion , as part of a secretive campaign that has largely silenced a powerful voice that led to a surge of counterterrorism activity across the united states in 2015 as young men and women came under the influence of its propaganda american military , intelligence and law enforcement officials acknowledge that the islamic state still retains a sophisticated social media arm that could still inspire attacks like those in san bernardino , calif , and in orlando , fla , and remains a potent foe suspected of maintaining clandestine cells in europe but they point to the coordinated effort against the legion as evidence of the success the united states has had in reducing the islamic states ability to direct , enable or inspire attacks against the west initially the threat posed by the legion was primarily seen as a problem for law enforcement officials but as the threat worsened last year , and the f b i stepped up the monitoring of terrorism suspects around the country , the bureau pressed the military to focus on the group , according to current and former american officials while american and british forces conducted a series of drone strikes on members of the group , the f b i sifted through thousands of the legions followers on social media to figure out who had actually been inspired to take action in the last two years , it has arrested nearly 100 people in cases involving the terrorist group several of the arrests were of people who had direct contact with the legion many of the others involved were folks who first came on our radar because we became aware of them through their connections with hussain and reyaad khan , also a british citizen , who was another leader of the group , according to andrew mccabe , deputy director of the f b i mr hussain wore a number of hats , including that of a hacker he was linked to the release of personal information on more than 1 , 300 american military and government employees in march 2015 , his group posted the names and addresses of service members with instructions kill them in their own lands , behead them in their own homes , stab them to death as they walk their streets thinking they are safe more important were mr hussains efforts as an online recruiter according to court records , mr hussain communicated with at least four men in four states , imploring them to initiate attacks or help spread the islamic states message mr hussain was behind a plot to behead pamela geller , the author of a conservative blog in early 2015 , mr hussain began communicating with usaamah abdullah rahim , 26 , and gave him instructions to kill ms geller mr rahim abruptly abandoned the plan and decided instead to kill a police officer in the boston area the bureau was monitoring him , and mr rahim was shot and killed in june 2015 after he confronted an f b i surveillance team with a knife the f b i also arrested two of mr rahims associates , whom prosecutors say were involved in the plot mr hussains associates were also busy another briton , named raphael hostey , was in touch with mohammed hamzah khan , 19 , of bolingbrook , ill mr khan tried to travel to syria with his two younger siblings before he was arrested by the f b i in another plot that the f b i disrupted , mr hussain instructed an ohio college student named munir abdulkader to kidnap a member of the military and record his killing on video mr hussain then asked mr abdulkader to attack a police station in the cincinnati area as mr abdulkader prepared for the suicide operation , he told mr hussain about his prowess on the shooting range mr hussain responded next time ul be shooting kuffar in their face and stomach kuffar is a derogatory term for non muslims mr abdulkader , 22 , who was born in eritrea , was arrested and pleaded guilty in july to material support for terrorism and plotting to kill a member of the military and police officers he was sentenced to 20 years in prison and last year , the f b i arrested a north carolina man , justin nolan sullivan , then 19 , and charged him with trying to provide material support to the islamic state federal prosecutors say he planned to target a public venue in a mass shooting the authorities said that mr sullivan and mr hussain had discussed making a video of the attack for use as propaganda when mr sullivans parents voiced concerns about their son buying a silencer , he approached an undercover f b i employee about killing them mr sullivan , who described mr hussain as part of the islamic state cyberteam , was also charged with fatally shooting his 74 year old neighbor in the head a senior american law enforcement official described the spring and summer of 2015 as a nightmare for the f b i a spike in terrorism activity left the f b i reeling the strain was so great , said the f b i director , james b comey , that the bureau was struggling to keep pace with the threat , forcing it to move criminal officers to surveillance squads but then , carrying out one strike after the next , american and british forces set out to destroy the legion mr hostey was reported killed in may several months later , reyaad khan was killed in a drone strike an australian , neil prakash , was targeted in a strike around the same time a senior american official said that mr prakash was wounded but survived in the last few weeks , however , a middle eastern government arrested mr prakash , another senior american military official said mr hussain died in august 2015 his wife , sally jones , a former punk rock musician from southeastern england , who went with him to raqqa , is believed to be alive shawn parson , who was trinidadian and in mr hussains circle , was also killed american officials say they have been surprised that the islamic state has failed to replace mr hussain and the other members of the legion with hackers of comparable ability but the f b i is still grappling with mr hussains legacy we are still dealing with the repercussions of that development and that recruitment of that network to this day , said mr mccabe , the f b i official
if alton brown , the food network celebrity , offers you a cocktail , refuse it maybe you are parched maybe you are in alcohol withdrawal maybe you have thought that clinking glasses with the host of good eats and cutthroat kitchen would be a fine thing even so , dont do it never forget that this is the man who coined the term evilicious in mr browns mostly charming and occasionally stomach churning show , alton brown live eat your science , now making a brief stop on broadway , he invites a woman from the audience to join him for an onstage tipple as theres little entertainment value in simply stirring up a negroni , he devises a game to select cocktail components at a recent performance , his volunteer was assigned tequila and pumpkin spice liqueur then mr brown added a secret ingredient mouthwash cheers \? it would be unsporting to say just what mr brown does to make this cocktail more palatable or exactly how , in the second half , he levels up a simple snack food into something a lot more explosive \( each experiment is a riff on shtick in his earlier edible inevitable tour \) this one man variety show combines cooking lore with physics , chemistry , comedy and a live band the cumulative effect is a little like having harold mcgees cherished kitchen science tome on food and cooking read aloud by gallagher those seated in the first couple of rows should probably be fitted with aprons or shields mr brown , a southern polymath with a pilots license , a gun license and a host of vocations , has always been a welcome presence in food television his persona is part nerd and part gentleman , part mastermind and part bro he is a know it all who just might know it all , and if some of his material isnt precisely gourmet , he has the smarts and the delivery to put it over his current show doesnt have much in the way of a governing structure or theme its a chance for him to spend two and a half hours doing stuff no one will let me do on tv , he says this translates to an evening of culinary science , dad rock jams , flatulent puppets and a twitter q a \( q what is something you enjoy eating that might surprise people \? a capn crunch \) while mr brown , who cuts a somewhat dapper figure in a collared shirt , v neck sweater and oddly shiny pants , prowls the stage , a large screen hovers above him , magnifying every move for those in the cheap seats yes , the show is wildly indulgent it is also a hoot on the night before thanksgiving , when most people should have been home making pies \( or was that just me \? \) , the superfan filled broadway audience devoured it , even a novelty song about turkey brining if mr brown could move through the material faster , he could offer more of the gonzo experiments and lightly barbed interactions he excels at his work with audience volunteers is dexterous and mischievous , mean without ever being exactly cruel unless you are a 10 year old who announces you dont like the bacon your dad cooks one day your dad is going to die , but bacon will always be there for you , mr brown counseled evilicious
erbil , iraq at least 80 people , many of them shiite pilgrims on their way home to iran , were killed on thursday when an islamic state suicide bomber detonated a truck filled with explosives at a roadside service station in southern iraq , local officials said the devastating attack came two days after prime minister haider al abadi applauded the security forces for protecting the millions of shiites who have flowed through southern iraq in recent days for what many consider the worlds largest religious pilgrimage , larger even than the hajj in saudi arabia in years past , the annual rite known as arbaeen , a commemoration of the martyrdom of imam hussein , a revered seventh century shiite figure , was a frequent target of sunni extremist groups like the islamic state and its predecessor , al qaeda in iraq until the bombing on thursday , for which the islamic state claimed responsibility in a statement , the event had been carried out safely that was seen as a success for mr abadi and the military , and was hailed as a sign that the government could keep pushing a major offensive against the islamic state in mosul , while protecting pilgrims in the south thursdays bombing , in hilla , a city south of baghdad , shattered that illusion the islamic state clearly remains a potent force , both on the battlefields of mosul , where fighters are putting up a last stand against iraqs elite counterterrorism forces in eastern neighborhoods , and in its ability to carry out more traditional guerrilla attacks for nearly six weeks , tens of thousands of iraqi security force members have been fighting in northern iraq to retake mosul , the countrys second largest city and the last stronghold of the islamic state in iraq government forces have found themselves bogged down , fighting house to house in dense urban neighborhoods , and many civilians have been killed a victory in mosul could represent the end of the islamic states control of territory in iraq but the bombing thursday was a stark reminder that the group will most likely revert to its roots as a guerrilla insurgency and continue to carry out terrorist attacks across the country the bombing was the deadliest in iraq since an explosives filled truck blew up near a shopping mall in baghdad in july , killing at least 300 people in the worst terrorist attack in the capital since the american invasion of iraq in 2003 that attack alarmed american officials , who worry that efforts to help the iraqis defeat the islamic state in mosul will be squandered if civilians around the country are terrorized by suicide bombings in recent months , the united states has rushed intelligence advisers and new drones to iraq to counter car bomb attacks in baghdad and the south before thursdays bombing , there had been a noticeable decline in the numbers of attacks falah al khafaji , the head of the provincial security committee in babil province , where the bombing occurred , said that at least 80 people had been killed and that dozens more had been wounded mr khafaji said early reports suggested that the bomber had followed a bus of iranian pilgrims and then detonated his explosives in a crowded parking lot at a gas station restaurant complex , setting fire to a number of vehicles and fuel tanks another local official , dr nowras abdulrazak , the head of babils health directorate , said on thursday that his casualty toll was 75 people dead and 25 wounded that number was likely to rise , he said most of the victims were iranians , officials said , but it was unclear in the immediate aftermath of the attack exactly how many iranian state television , however , reported that a majority of the victims were afghan citizens living in iran iran is the regions pre eminent shiite power , and millions of its citizens annually flock to iraq , which is also majority shiite , to visit important religious sites in the cities of karbala and najaf the islamic state said in a statement released after the attack that one of its fighters , an iraqi man , had carried out the suicide bombing the group vowed to spread the flames of the battles underway in mosul to the shiite dominated south , according to a translation released by the site intelligence group , which tracks jihadist statements the islamic state considers shiites apostates , and it has long carried out a campaign of sectarian killings in iraq in its statement , it called shiites miscreants and said , what awaits them in the immediate future , allah permitting , is more sorrowful and bitter one of the people hurt in the bombing , toma muhan , 31 , said on thursday that just before the explosion , he parked his car at the service station he was walking away when he was knocked to the ground i felt a strong blast at my back and then severe pain in my leg , he said from a hospital bed , where he was being treated for shrapnel wounds and burns to his neck and legs i remember hearing loud screaming , and then i passed out and woke up later at the hospital a local police officer , col thamir jhazala , said that the restaurant and gas station had opened recently , and that security was not good he cited what he said was a lack of surveillance cameras numan al jibouri , who works at the station , said that thursday was a day off for him , but that he had been nearby when the explosion occurred and rushed to the scene i heard the sound of a big explosion and saw the blaze rising up to the sky , followed by smoke , he said when he got to the scene , mr jibouri said , he saw charred and unrecognizable victims , but he did recognize one a man who works with him named mohammed , who was severely burned he rushed his colleague to the hospital , where he was being treated

an email i received from a reader some time ago has begun to haunt me the readers sister was dying of cancer how , she asked me , would i respond to the word grace in the context of a cancer death \? my correspondent did not gloss over the miseries of her sisters terminal state she outlined a series of horrific tests that led doctors to withhold food she described fevers , infections and the weeping legs caused by edema but then she testified to her sisters uncanny ability to brighten any room with her smiles had i received this query while i was undergoing my first treatments , it would have triggered irritation bordering on apoplexy why should a cancer patient be expected to lift her own spirits or anyone elses \? isnt it hard enough dealing with such dire circumstances without having to become a booster for oneself and for caregivers \? one scholar of american cancer culture , samantha king , decries a tyranny of cheerfulness that gets too many patients down , making us feel guilty about expressing understandable anguish during the intervening years , however , i have interacted with friends as they confronted an irreversible condition and i , too , have witnessed a kind of grace that i found inspiring while coping with cancer , these people contested it and sometimes the medical protocols upon which they had to rely yet when bodily functions shut down , few of them dug in and battled a condition pronounced terminal indeed , their sense of tranquillity seemed to be founded on acceptance of their impending mortality what might have contributed to their patent and patient grace \? and given my own impatience with circumstances beyond my control , could i possibly tap such sources \? catholic and protestant authorities agree on the mysterious nature of grace , which they see as a free and undeserved or gratuitous favor , not a reward a disposition that works to perfect the soul , grace cannot be known or acquired through words , beliefs or deeds in the jewish tradition , the hebrew word chen for grace appears in the benediction may the lord be gracious to you , though the word baruch for blessed is used more frequently to denote an unmerited gift for believers who seek this benefit from god , as for nonbelievers who seek it elsewhere , grace remains a highly elusive but highly desirable state , especially in troubled times people with cancer explore all the activities that people without cancer use to make themselves receptive to a sense of beneficence or loving kindness religious liturgies , private prayer , meditation , breathing and body exercises , verse or mantra recitations , making or looking at pictures , listening to or making music , walking in nature , communing with friends , and \( yes \) alcohol or marijuana those engaged daily in one or more of these practices testify to their efficacy a zillion self help books offer instructions \( on some of them \) , but the trick must consist in finding ones own eccentric way my correspondent had glimpsed grace in her sisters smiles shed also found it in an obituary that a massachusetts mother , beth orourke , had composed for herself while she was dying of cancer , and she included a link to it the self obituarys eerie opening i died thursday , april 16 , 2015 prefaces a description of ms orourkes life and then her conclusion that in the end grace and love win , not cancer it reminded me of the first self obituary i had read after a recurrence of endometrial cancer , the seattle based author and editor jane catherine lotter posted an essay in which she recalled the high points of her education and career because she wanted to be joyful about having a full life , rather than sad about having to die she closed with thanks for her family and ended with beautiful day , happy to have been here might the introspection and retrospection of writing serve as one source of grace that transforms it from a gift received to a gift conferred \? after my friend pep died of metastatic colon cancer , his self obit in the local paper brought tears to my eyes it was as if i heard his jokey , self deprecating voice from beyond the grave the act of composition must have composed him , providing an opportunity to reflect on his life , to express appreciation of his family and friends , and to make peace with the posthumous presence he would become in common parlance , the word grace means elegance , ease of comportment , a style that charms those who observe it a scholar of many languages , pep would have known that it derives from the latin gratus , which mean pleasing or thankful , and that it gave rise to the italian grazie and the spanish gracias by virtue of his gracious words , pep bestowed a gift of grace on his family and friends i cannot imagine attaining a durable state of grace throughout the ordeals that will surely arrive in the future instead , i consider practicing a series of hesitant , brief grace notes the musical notation of these short notes is printed in smaller type to indicate an ornament and with a slur mark linking them to the note they precede a fleeting sound before a longer lasting duration that immediately follows to me , they look buoyant , like a tiny bounce or skip forward there must be as many ways to play grace notes as there are people in the world what might they be , i wonder \? in this season , i give thanks for the time that remains to resist animosity and fear , i want to devote it to becoming proficient at all sorts of grace notes before the chords of closure resound into silence
as we enter this season of contemplation and reflection , we all have more than the usual number of everyday financial questions weighing on us how much more might we pay for health care under president elect donald trump \? how will any new trade policies affect our household budgets and job prospects \? how much less will some of us pay in taxes after his promised reforms , and what might we do with what could be many thousands of dollars of extra money \? step back a bit , however , and you will see that every money question eventually boils down to a single line of inquiry how much is enough \? it is a quantitative question for sure how much insurance is enough , how much federal revenue and how much personal income and spending but the questions qualitative nature is what makes it special and singular it is about how money makes us feel and , ultimately , it is an inquiry into the nature of our values about what our spending , saving and giving say about us and what we and our families ultimately stand for it is not a new question we find some version of it in the liturgy of various world religions , on the covers of books by financial services professionals and economists , and in the title of an 82 second song by the punk band bad religion , that decries our rapacity , tenacity , capacity for more but addressing the question is an appropriate task right now , given an unpredictable president elect and a congress nominally behind him poised to make good on at least some promises to change our financial lives absent any certainty about what will happen in washington , we can at least try to get ourselves square in our heads about what feels like enough for us enough awareness how much do any of us really know about what our spending , saving and giving add up to \? could we draw an accurate pie chart that reflects a year of household outflows \? this is not another call to write down everything you spend in a notebook but it is a reminder that if you dont like what you see when you glance at the credit or debit card statement or the pile of receipts , then its time to reconsider a few things my colleague carl richards has offered short courses here recently on spending awareness and aligning spending with values moneys value is , in part , as an observational tool , as something to meditate on , said vicki robin , whose classic book your money or your life is an excellent longer course on defining enough does spending money bring you pleasure in proportion to the hours that you spent earning it \? she , too , is reluctant to order anyone to start new spreadsheets she does note , however , that you probably wont achieve zen mastery with just two breaths or forgiveness and enlightenment by taking communion once in a while rigor is the tiller on your boat , she said enough is enough once you have a baseline on spending and quantity , the qualitative work begins manisha thakor , director of wealth strategies for women at the financial advisory firm buckingham , speaks often on the topic of defining enough and laments all the noise that gets in the way of getting it right first , there is nonreality television , where every policewoman , nurse and paralegal live much larger than their professional station in life would suggest is possible all these humid east coast cities , and theyre clearly getting a 40 blowout before every shift , she said switch from television to a smaller screen , and you are confronted with curated social media profiles , where everyone is editing themselves combine that with the ever present pressure to maintain a prominent personal brand , and its no wonder that so many people think that the right definition of enough is just a little bit more it just creates this feeling of lack , ms thakor said she said that one good place to start is the most elementary of benchmarks she is often surprised , for instance , by how few people have heard of the basic one that elizabeth warren suggested years ago when she was still a professor spend 50 percent on needs , 30 percent on wants and 20 percent on savings not everyone will be able to meet those targets , especially if they live in a high cost area , if their income is irregular or if temporary job loss or illness interrupts their earning but at least those percentages give people something to shoot for or revise from when attempting to define enough savings and discretionary spending in their own lives enough for children embedded in now senator warrens definition is the concept of wants and needs , something that is well worth defining and discussing with any children in your life from their earliest possible age john bogle , vanguards founder , learned this early , and by necessity , when his family fell on hard times , an experience he describes in his book enough in an interview this week , he described the advantage of having to stand up for yourself financially and help your family get along i worked from the age of 10 , 11 , 12 when my friends were out playing tennis , and it never bothered me one damn bit , he said his own children worked , too , even though it was no longer financially necessary they were all trying to get high sales of the day at the county seat , he recalled in his book , he laments that so many children growing up in an affluent world dont get enough opportunities to build character to fail and contemplate and pick themselves up again giving children an allowance to budget and practice with can help get them started how much is enough pocket money \? just enough so that they have the things they need and some of what they want , but not so much that they do not have to make hard choices tradeoffs are what we adults do each day , after all , and all parents are ultimately in the adult making business enough money ms robin , when i pressed her for a universal definition , seized on the discernment necessary to arrive at an answer enough is the quality of having everything you need and want but nothing in excess , nothing that burdens you , she said hers is an ecological sensibility she indulges , she said , in thrift store clothing and investments in local businesses on the island she lives on outside seattle her notion of excess happens to be an essential concept at a time when many people of above average means may end 2017 or 2018 with extra money , if the tax laws change giving that money away to people who need it more than you do is a worthy reflex , but ms thakor isnt sure that is the right answer for everyone what would bring you one step closer to feeling more joy \? she asked for many people , it may be paying off debt others may want to do something nice for themselves after years of frugality perhaps there is a family member who needs help , or you want to spend money in a way that will contribute to economic growth while also helping you save in the long run , by , say , putting money toward energy efficient home improvements or other similar investments whatever it is , talk about it with your spouse , friends or family how much is enough is as good a thanksgiving conversation starter as any and probably better than most at a time when politics may be a touchy subject you will be richer for having had the conversation , but just dont expect an easy answer or one that wont change over time as your goals do ms thakor has an m b a and is a certified financial planner , so she is surprised by the lack of a clear solution to the challenge that the question poses but as i travel around the country , its clear to me that there is not a numerical answer
when isaac avila stopped sending his mother birthday and christmas cards , his family knew something was wrong his sister , guadalupe avila , and her large family tried unsuccessfully to find their brother , especially in 2010 when their father died and in 2014 , when a brother passed away so the family was stunned when after 40 years , mr avila found them via a 58 second video posted by miracle messages , an organization that aims to reconnect homeless people with their loved ones i hope to see you all pretty soon i wish i could get a hold of you in a better way but this is going to be the fastest way and i hope you all have a computer , mr avila said in his video i miss you all very much my heart is missing you big time within days of posting the video on youtube earlier this year , miracle messages had shown mr avilas message to his family and begun setting in place a reunion today , mr avila is living with his 92 year old mother , helping to take care of her in his childhood home in texas mr avilas reunion is one of more than two dozen miracle messages has successfully engineered as families around the country gather for thanksgiving , many are missing a relative according to the department of housing and urban development , more than 500 , 000 americans are homeless and in many cases they have lost touch with their families the goal of miracle messages is to help 1 percent of the worlds estimated 100 million homeless people reunite with loved ones by 2021 , said its founder and chief executive , kevin f adler he said he started the organization almost two years ago in honor of his uncle mark , who lived on and off the streets for 30 years this is an effort to humanize a homeless person and reconnect them with their families , mr adler said even if you are homeless , you are a complete being as you are mr adler said he found that through social media , it was relatively easy to find a homeless persons family one of the first videos he recorded , on christmas eve 2014 , was of a homeless man named jeffrey gottshall , who was living on the streets of san francisco he posted it to a facebook group in the small town in pennsylvania where mr gottshall was from , and within 20 minutes someone had tagged his sister ninety percent of the messages weve been able to deliver have been received positively , and in about 40 percent of the reunions , the homeless person has stable housing or is living with family , mr adler said in some cases , the family does not want to be in contact for whatever reason and we have to respect their wishes but in those cases , we often find friends or other relatives who do want to reach out so far , miracle messages has recorded more than 130 videos , delivered 43 and reunited 26 families the organization relies on sponsors , donations and a crowdfunding campaign to do its work mr adler was also named as one of 20 ted residency program residents this fall to help miracle messages grow some reunions are happy ones , like the avila familys in a telephone interview , mr avila recounted the day he made the video as he got food from a local homeless outreach group in miami , he heard an announcement that miracle messages would be recording videos of anyone who wanted to send loved ones a message mr avila stepped forward it was time for me to contact my family , he said he spoke of bouncing from printing press jobs at several newspapers in texas before going to miami to find work he said that for a few years in the 1980s , he worked in the printing press shop for the miami herald but he said he had a mental breakdown and walked away one day during the time he was lost to his family , mr avila lived on and off the streets , found some work at local outreach centers and suffered a heart attack now 66 , he is thrilled to be home with his large family but not every reunion has a happy ending jeffrey gottshall , 47 , is still waiting for his mr gottshalls 32 second video , taken on the streets of san francisco where he still lives , plunged his family in pennsylvania into a spotlight many members did not welcome his younger sister , jennifer gottshall gavitt , stepped forward to embrace her brother the best way to describe my family is old school , mrs gottshall gavitt said in a telephone interview you dont even cry at funerals , because thats making a public spectacle so when the video was made public , it was like the sky had fallen for some members of my family when her family saw mr gottshalls message , it was the first time in 20 years they had been in contact with him , although mrs gottshall gavitt and her husband had tried to find him she went to san francisco to see her brother and with mr adlers help , was able to reunite and talk to him she says her brother suffers from mental health issues she is trying to help him get the help he needs but says he needs to want to help himself for now , the best she can do from her pennsylvania home is to have people like mr adler and a police sergeant she met with san franciscos homeless outreach unit keep her updated on how her brother is doing they help mr gottshall call her on occasion so she knows hes o k even if jeffrey doesnt end up with a happy ending , other people are getting their happy ending and thats just as important , she said no one should be lost in his own way , jeffrey has helped find people
jerusalem parts of the port city of haifa in northern israel were ablaze on thursday as wildfires raged through the country for a third day , devouring forests , damaging homes and prompting the evacuation of tens of thousands of people asked how long haifa was likely to be battling the blazes , mayor yona yahav told reporters , this is a question that has to be referred to god israeli officials said the fires had been fanned by unusually strong winds and made worse by a dry atmosphere , but they also said they suspected that many of them had been caused by arson and negligence dozens of people have been slightly affected by smoke inhalation , but no serious injuries or fatalities have been reported gilad erdan , israels public security minister , told army radio that the professional assessment was that almost half the fires were the result of arson prime minister benjamin netanyahu attributed the fires to natural and unnatural causes and said that any fire caused by arson or incitement to arson is terrorism in every sense of the word , and we will treat it as such arab leaders in israel protested the widespread allegations that palestinian nationalists were behind many of the fires , saying their land was burning , too , and they condemned what they viewed as unfair accusations against israels arab citizens , who make up about a fifth of the population ahmad tibi , a veteran arab lawmaker in the israeli parliament , wrote on twitter i called yona yahav our homes are open to the evacuees sad and painful lets join hands to overcome the fire and lets also douse the flames of incitement mr netanyahu spoke on thursday with president vladimir v putin of russia , who promised to send two huge firefighting aircraft firefighting planes and teams from cyprus and greece had already arrived , and the israeli police and foreign ministry said that more help was on the way from croatia , italy and turkey the palestinian authority also sent some fire engines to tackle the fires the israeli emergency services are more prepared and better equipped than they were in 2010 , when a fierce fire raged through the carmel forest area near haifa more than 40 people , most of them officer cadets from the prison service , were killed in that blaze when their bus was engulfed in flames as they were on their way to evacuate a prison that episode counted as israels worst natural disaster the government of mr netanyahu , who assumed office in 2009 , was accused of being woefully unprepared it was the first time that israel , which often provides doctors and aid workers for disasters abroad , had to rely on international help israel has since added firefighting planes , but they do not have the capacity of larger aircraft like those that russia was expected to send , nor can they operate at night the police and emergency services have been going door to door evacuating homes , schools , two prisons , neighborhoods and , in some cases , whole communities noy parati , a student at the israel institute of technology in haifa , described scenes of panic , with people pushing one another out of the way to evacuate as soon as they tell me where to go , i will leave , ms parati told israeli television , adding , everyone is trying to escape yael hamer , a resident of the romema neighborhood of haifa , said people were leaving on foot and by car my house was filled with smoke , she told reporters by phone from her car , with the sirens of fire engines and ambulances audible in the background and the smell , she added , it was impossible to stay there local authorities in haifa said they had set up gathering points and temporary shelters in community centers , in an auditorium and in a stadium the police reported heavy traffic on highways around the city , and the train service to and from the city was suspended by nightfall , about a quarter of haifas population of 280 , 000 had been instructed to evacuate the israeli military said that it had deployed two search and rescue battalions from its home front command to assist evacuation efforts , and that it had called up reservists to help fight the fires several homes have been destroyed in recent days in the town of zikhron yaaqov , south of haifa , and in nataf , a village in the hills outside jerusalem flames have also threatened talmon , a jewish settlement in the occupied west bank and on thursday night the police reported a fire near shuafat , a palestinian neighborhood of east jerusalem the first major fire began in the forest surrounding neve shalom , known in arabic as wahat al salam , or oasis of peace , a small cooperative community about halfway between tel aviv and jerusalem where israeli jews and arabs live together despite the suspicion of arson in many cases , the israeli authorities were cautious in assigning blame but some israeli news organizations were labeling the wave of fires an arson intifada , alluding to a palestinian uprising mr erdan , the public security minister , noted that jewish extremists had been charged with arson attacks in the past , including one last year in the west bank village of duma that killed a palestinian toddler and his parents mr erdan has instructed the police to focus efforts on locating incitement to arson on social networks by thursday night , mr erdan said , the fires had been brought under control , though there were fears that the weather conditions could whip up the flames again some palestinians were celebrating the fires on social media , posting congratulatory messages on facebook enjoy the burning of your homes , you zionists , one wrote others described the fires as divine retribution for legislation being advanced in israel , with mr netanyahus backing , to ban or restrict the use of loudspeakers by mosques and other houses of worship across israel ayman odeh , another arab member of the israeli parliament , noted that several arab cities in northern israel , such as umm el fahm , had also been affected by the fires
the first part of lion , garth daviss unabashedly tear jerking movie about a remarkable real world incident , has some of the scary , wondrous feeling of a fairy tale the audience is invited to imagine a long ago time 1986 , to be precise before social media or smartphones or google in those days , a person could get lost , which is just what happens to a little boy named saroo \( sunny pawar \) , who accidentally travels more than 1 , 000 miles from his home in central india to the streets of calcutta saroos mother \( priyanka bose \) is a laborer in a poor village he and his beloved older brother , guddu \( abhishek bharate \) , supplement her meager wages with whatever casual work they can find in the first scene , they are scavenging lumps of coal to exchange for milk at the market later , saroo follows guddu to a railroad station , where the younger boy accidentally boards an out of service train that takes him to a city full of strangers who speak a different language with minimal dialogue and graceful editing , mr davis and the screenwriter luke davies convey the dickensian dimensions of saroos situation he is small and vulnerable , but also smart and resourceful , and even as he is exposed to horrifying cruelty , he is also a hero on an adventure the enormous pain of his loss is sometimes mitigated by the excitement of discovery you fear for him , and also root for him , and mostly you are captivated by his story and the sophisticated simplicity of its telling what happens in the second part of the movie is a little more complicated saroo \( now played by dev patel \) has grown to manhood as the adopted son of an australian couple , john and sue brierley \( david wenham and nicole kidman \) he has a brother , mantosh \( divian ladwa \) , who was also adopted from india and has mental health and substance abuse problems despite that , saroo seems to be living in the happily ever after stage of the fairy tale he moves to melbourne to study hotel management and falls in love with a fellow student , lucy \( rooney mara \) , from america but memories of his long ago life haunt him , and the arrival of new technology raises the tantalizing possibility of a return to his first home using google earth , saroo sets out to retrace , on the computer screen and on sheets of paper tacked to his bedroom wall , his accidental journey its not a fast or easy process , and the effort takes an emotional toll on him , on his parents and on lucy but you know , even if youre not familiar with the true story behind lion , that the fairy tale will come true mr davis , with strong assistance from a cast of dignified , charismatic criers and the music of hauschka and dustin ohalloran , floods the viewer with big feelings if you have ever been a child , raised a child , lost a child or met a child or a mother this movie will wreck you as a purely emotional experience it succeeds without feeling too manipulative or maudlin i mean , it is manipulative and maudlin , but in a way that seems fair and transparent still , it isnt quite satisfying the transition from the young to the grown up saroo demands a shift in tone and genre that lion doesnt quite achieve what felt in the first part like wonderful , spielbergian simplicity feels , in the latter sections , like simplification there isnt enough of the rough texture of family life or the complications of young love to give the older saroo a full identity the movie hovers on the edge of going deeper into his psychological predicament but holds itself back at the end , the focus shifts from the agonies of saroo to the glories of google i cant complain too much about that for all i know , google brought you to this review but i also cant help feeling a dystopian chill amid all the warm dont be evil fuzzies , a hint of corporate propaganda behind the fable it is indeed remarkable how small the world has become , how many problems data can solve , how connected we all are to one another but weve lost something , too , and we cant even see what it is
in 2012 , forbes dropped j k rowling after eight years on its authoritative billionaires list , saying high british taxes and large charitable contributions had eroded her fortune forbes may want to rethink that last weekend , fantastic beasts and where to find them the first of a new , multifilm franchise , with a script by ms rowling opened in the united states to a strong 75 million weekend \( the international box office was close to another 150 million \) hugely popular wizarding world of harry potter attractions have opened at universal studio theme parks in orlando , fla , hollywood and osaka , japan , as well as a potter attraction at warner bros studio tour london the two part drama harry potter and the cursed child is a smash hit in london and is scheduled to open on broadway in 2018 a book based on the play was an instant no 1 best seller warner bros recently licensed the television rights to the harry potter films to nbcuniversal for as much as 250 million any estimate of ms rowlings fortune is at best informed speculation , and most previous attempts ive seen dont seem very informed ms rowling is famously private , especially about her financial and business affairs she denied being a billionaire after forbes first anointed her , telling the television interviewer katie couric in 2005 that ive got plenty of money , more money than i ever dreamed i would have but i am not a billionaire she has remained publicly silent on the subject since so i set out this week to assess the size and scope of her fortune , not to invade her privacy but because shes that all too rare commodity in the ranks of the ultrawealthy a role model not only has she made her fortune largely through her own wits and imagination , but she also pays taxes and gives generously to charity at a time of bitter disputes over rising income inequality , no one seems to resent ms rowlings runaway success its an impressive story , said steven n kaplan , a professor at the university of chicago booth school of business and an author of its the market the broad based rise in the return to top talent , a study of wealth generation in the digital age she struggled as a single mother , he said then , she created this amazing franchise she had tremendous talent , and shes reaping the rewards people dont mind that what they resent is when chief executives get paid for failure ms rowling has also been backed by some high powered negotiating and marketing muscle scholastic , which published the potter books warner bros , the studio behind the potter films and now the fantastic beasts franchise and nbcuniversal , which opened the wizarding world attractions at its theme parks neil blair , a former warner bros executive , has represented her and fiercely protected her interests since he founded the blair partnership , a literary agency , in 2011 , with ms rowling as his most prominent client mr blair did not respond to requests for comment along with other famous authors , entertainers and sports stars , ms rowling has also benefited from globalization and technology advances , the same forces that have squeezed the working class thirty and 40 years ago , entertainers and sports figures didnt have that kind of money , professor kaplan said \( he noted that bob hope was the only entertainer on the original forbes 400 , and he made most of his money in real estate \) thanks to globalization , the internet and social media , they can reach a much bigger market today , he said a close look at ms rowlings sources of income suggests that shes worth more than 1 billion , even allowing for a large margin of error i came up with the estimates by interviewing a range of publishing and entertainment executives and agents some of them have negotiated with ms rowlings representatives and knew what terms they were seeking no one was willing to be identified because pretty much everyone hopes to do business with ms rowling shes a sacred cow , one executive said to start with the obvious , theres the source of her wealth the seven harry potter books have sold an estimated 450 million copies , with estimated total revenue of 7 7 billion at a standard 15 percent authors royalty , she would have earned 1 15 billion these books continue to sell strongly years after they were first published ms rowling has presumably been able to negotiate better deals for her subsequent books , which include adult mysteries under the pseudonym robert galbraith , published by a little brown imprint , as well as numerous potter spinoffs these works probably contributed at least another 50 million ms rowlings deal with warner bros is a closely guarded secret , but it has been reported that she sold the film rights to the first four potter films for just 2 million nearly all such deals , though , also include a percentage of the net profits , which were substantial the first four films grossed close to 3 5 billion and generated an estimated 2 5 billion in profit if she managed to achieve a 10 percent net profit participation , thats 250 million the next four potter films were far more lucrative , generating well over 4 billion in revenue by then , she was one of the rare talents who probably had negotiated a deal providing her a percentage of a films gross revenue at 10 percent , thats another 400 million she almost certainly , according to the people i spoke with , managed a similar deal for the fantastic beasts series even if the first film generates just 500 million in revenue , less than half the highest grossing potter films , that adds another 50 million to her fortune , bringing the film total to 700 million warner negotiated ms rowlings theme park deals on her behalf that deal with nbcuniversal is also secret , but she is one of the unusual examples of someone who is also a consultant and gets a percentage of the gate \( steven spielberg , the only other known example , gets 2 percent of ticket sales at universal studios \) she also received a one time licensing fee estimated at 60 million to 80 million and annual development fees like mr spielberg , ms rowling also gets a percentage of gross sales of merchandise , food and beverages nbcuniversal does not break out revenue from the wizarding world attractions , but attendance has more than doubled since the first harry potter attraction opened in 2010 last year , nbcuniversals parent , comcast , said overall theme park revenue jumped more than 60 percent to 1 4 billion if half of that comes from wizarding world , and ms rowling gets 2 percent , then her take last year would have been 14 million since 2010 , when the first attraction opened , id estimate she has earned at least 30 million on ticket sales , which would bring her total theme park earnings to roughly 100 million nbcuniversal also bought exclusive television rights to the eight harry potter films this summer in a deal valued at as much as 250 million ms rowling presumably received a large piece of that , at least 125 million that replaced a deal with disney estimated to have been worth 50 million or more to her that brings her total estimated earnings from books , movies , theme parks and television to more than 2 2 billion assuming that she paid britains top individual tax rate of 45 percent , she would have been left with 1 2 billion ms rowling also has other income she did not write the play harry potter and the cursed child but no doubt earned a licensing fee and is a profit participant long running hit shows can generate enormous income the composer andrew lloyd webber has an estimated net worth of 1 2 billion she earns licensing fees on all potter related merchandise she owns the e book rights to her books , sold on her proprietary website , pottermore pottermore loses money , but it said this week that it expected to earn a profit in 2017 and , of course , ms rowling has substantial investment income and unrealized capital gains given the long stock market rally an average 8 percent return on invested assets of 1 billion would generate 80 million a year , and it compounds ms rowling has given generously to charity forbes estimated a total of 160 million by the time it dropped her from its list in 2012 but theres no indication that the contributions have even offset her investment income , let alone seriously dented her net worth whatever the precise size of her fortune , ms rowling is enormously wealthy in this postelection holiday season , maybe her self made success is something everyone can feel warm about its not going to happen to everyone , but its an inspiration that if you work hard and have talent , really good things can happen , professor kaplan said its kind of like her books good triumphs over evil

hillary clintons lead in the popular vote is growing she is roughly 30 , 000 votes behind donald j trump in the key swing states of michigan and wisconsin a combined gap that is narrowing her impassioned supporters are now urging her to challenge the results in those two states and pennsylvania , grasping at the last straws to reverse mr trumps decisive majority in the electoral college in recent days , they have seized on a report by a respected computer scientist and other experts suggesting that michigan , pennsylvania and wisconsin , the keys to mr trumps electoral college victory , need to manually review paper ballots to assure the election was not hacked were this years deviations from pre election polls the results of a cyberattack \? j alex halderman , a computer science professor at the university of michigan who has studied the vulnerabilities of election systems at length , wrote on medium on wednesday as the calls based on his conclusions mounted probably not more likely , he wrote , pre election polls were systematically wrong but the only way to resolve the lingering questions would be to examine paper ballots and voting equipment in critical states , he wrote tellingly , the pleas for recounts have gained no support from the clinton campaign , which has concluded , along with outside experts , that it is highly unlikely the outcome would change even after an expensive and time consuming review of ballots but that has not quieted mrs clintons supporters , who see the inequity of her growing lead in the national popular vote , which is now more than two million votes , or 1 5 percent of all ballots cast , according to the nonpartisan cook political report , which regularly updates its count as states continue to tally and to certify votes since there is currently no effort to review the paper ballots which exist in michigan and wisconsin , but only in parts of pennsylvania conspiracy theories about the 2016 election may live on for years after united states intelligence agencies accused russia of trying to influence the election by stealing and publishing emails from the democratic national committee and a range of other institutions and prominent individuals , the united states went on high alert to determine if there was any attempt to sabotage the vote count so far , no one in the obama administration has indicated that there is any such evidence in the three battleground states , mrs clinton is behind by 1 2 percent or less , and the final results have not yet been certified uniting around the social media hashtag auditthevote , the campaign after the campaign has picked up momentum among grass roots activists still mourning mr trumps victory and who echo , paradoxically , his pre election complaint that the vote was rigged based on the information of the intelligence community that russia was actively trying to screw around with our election , i thought why not take the time and question this , said michelle zuckerman parker , an engineer in pittsburgh , who on wednesday planned to petition her county election board for a recount of the nov 8 vote that view spread quickly on social media on tuesday evening when new york magazine published an article about professor halderman and others who had contacted the remnants of the clinton campaign it also generated pushback by experts who said that even though it was theoretically possible to hack voting machines , it would be enormously difficult because it would have to be highly targeted in key precincts and conducted on a scale required to assure mr trumps victory left wing conspiracy theories of vote rigging are pathetic , dave wasserman of the cook political report said on twitter time may have already run out pennsylvania allows individual voters to petition for a recount , but the deadline was sunday , said wanda murren , a spokeswoman for the pennsylvania department of state a candidate can also contest an election in court , and the deadline is monday michigan and wisconsin have not reached their deadlines for seeking a recount , but they will in days so far , mrs clinton has not requested any action , said reid magney , a spokesman for the wisconsin elections commission until the publication of professor haldermans work , clinton supporters had few reasons to hope he did not offer them much he noted that while the voting machines used in those states are not connected to the internet during the election , they are programmed before the election the data is usually transferred on a usb stick or other data card if attackers can modify that software by infecting the machines with malware , they can cause the machines to give any answer whatsoever , professor halderman wrote the problem , as bruce schneier , a security expert who has written often on the issue , noted in an interview , is that the usual triggers for a recount a very close margin between two candidates make little sense in a world of state sponsored computer hackings a truly sophisticated hacking would result in a wider margin of victory that would not set off an automatic recount mrs clinton would have to triumph in all three states to win the electoral college the electors will meet in december to formally choose the president and there , mr trump is ahead by 290 votes to mrs clintons 232 , with michigan still officially uncalled as of wednesday , mr trumps lead in michigan had shrunk to 10 , 704 votes , or 0 2 percent , according to the national popular vote tracker maintained by the cook political report mr trumps lead in wisconsin has narrowed to 22 , 525 votes , or 0 8 percent in pennsylvania , his lead slightly grew on wednesday , to 70 , 010 , or 1 2 percent the clinton campaign did not respond to requests for comment other democrats said it was time to move on im not sure its possible to undo the results , and all the people are focusing their energy on opposing the worst ideas of this administration at this point , not the legitimacy of the results , said daniel doubet , an organizer for keystone progress , a liberal group in pennsylvania those pushing for a recount say they are trying to pick up the fight for a tired and demoralized candidate and her staff the democratic party and the hillary campaign are exhausted , and theyre really hurting , and they may not have the clarity , said ms zuckerman parker , who briefly volunteered for the clinton campaign on social media , supporters pleaded with the campaign to act please hillaryclinton timkaine call for auditthevote , wrote writerchick on twitter , appealing to mrs clinton and her running mate , senator tim kaine of virginia we are all working so hard for you , make the call , the nation is depending on you by poring over local election results online , the audit the vote crowd uncovered what appeared to be anomalies in the counting helen manich of national harbor , md , for one , noticed that sauk county , wis , reported that 31 , 838 ballots were cast overall , but the total votes for presidential candidates numbered 34 , 323 such glitches are not uncommon , election experts said they are usually ironed out in the process of certifying results although those certifications might change the results by several hundred or several thousand votes , they are highly unlikely to move tens of thousands to shift the electoral college , mrs clinton would not only have to reverse her current deficits in wisconsin and michigan but also in pennsylvania , which experts say is highly unlikely there is widespread confusion on social media about how recounts are generated a flood of twitter users have urged clinton supporters to call the united states department of justice , even though it is states that certify election results ms zuckerman parker was furiously trying to organize voters around the states to file petitions demanding a recount this week its like this fever approach happening in the last few hours , melissa lang of allegheny county , pa , said on tuesday , describing her efforts to reach out to voters across the state using social media but ms murren , the pennsylvania state department spokeswoman , said the deadline for such petitions had come and gone our staff is not aware of any petitions for precinct level recounts in the presidential race , she said

manila thomas dooley has bad memories of the 1998 world cup he was a player with the united states back then , when the team lost all three of its games in france after the tournament , fifa ranked the 32 participants it put the americans last we had no team spirit , no positive team energy nothing , dooley said after the coach announced the roster , we got the bonus and then there was just selfishness the players didnt listen anymore they were against each other the coach lived in a different hotel everything was negative i didnt want to be a part of it , and i wanted to go home dooley has little time to follow u s soccers activities these days , not even the departure of jurgen klinsmann , who briefly brought dooley back into the national team fold in 2011 to help him coach his first match , a friendly against mexico dooley has his own leadership concerns now as head coach of the philippines national team , he is busy trying to prevent another first round exit the event in question is the suzuki cup , southeast asias biennial championship and a big deal especially as no team from the region has been to the world cup since 1938 , when indonesia participated as the dutch east indies with 2 points from its first two games , against singapore and indonesia , the philippines has to defeat thailand , the defending champion , on friday to be assured of a place in the semifinals dooley , who won the bundesliga title with kaiserslautern in 1991 , wants the win , the semifinal berth and the trophy that could help bring an even bigger prize an opportunity to help soccer compete with basketball in the philippines , a sprawling archipelago that is home to more than 100 million people and was a united states colony from 1898 to 1946 next door to the quezon city hotel where the philippine team is staying this week is the araneta coliseum , which in 1975 hosted the thrilla in manila , in which muhammad ali defeated joe frazier these days it plays host to basketball , and on the biggest nights , more than 20 , 000 pack inside to watch the games the equivalent showdowns in the countrys national soccer league regularly struggle to attract four figure crowds basketball is still king here the n b a opened an office in april , and there are three official n b a stores in the country the big european soccer clubs that visit singapore , kuala lumpur , shanghai and bangkok on their summer tours do not make it to manila in the lobby of the official hotel here , even the branded suzuki cup television in the corner is showing womens basketball from the united states we are not a soccer country , simple as that , said cedelf tupas , a sports reporter for the philippine daily inquirer it is easy to play basketball in manila while he praised the rising standards in the soccer league , he said people dont watch it is not promoted events like the suzuki cup may help , but that depends on how dooleys team performs after a disastrous record from 1996 to 2008 , a period in which they lost 19 of 21 games , the azkals , as the philippine team is known , have reached the semifinals on the last three occasions this time , it wants to play in the final every win is another log on the fire , said dooley , who was hired in february 2014 after the father of a boy he was coaching in california alerted the philippines football federation to his availability although it doesnt help that much there are so many things we need , the organizational things in the nearly three years since dooley took the job , there have been improvements now we have nice bags , the backpacks , he said at the airport , everyone looks the same with the uniforms we used to look like a bunch of tourists but there is still something missing we should be on the billboards here , dooley said the people need heroes they had them at the 2010 suzuki cup , in which the team thrilled the nation by defeating the defending champion , vietnam , in front of 40 , 000 stunned fans in hanoi it was the first time soccer made the front page of a major philippines newspaper , tupas said it was unexpected at home , too , with no stadium in the country ready or equipped to host the home leg of the philippines semifinal against indonesia as a result , both matches were played in jakarta , with a combined attendance of 180 , 000 even in defeat , the reception and the news media attention back home were unlike anything the team had ever known but the passion has disappeared on saturday , fewer than 5 , 000 fans braved manilas chaotic traffic to head north to bacoue for the opening game , a scoreless tie against singapore considerably fewer turned up for tuesdays 2 2 tie with indonesia i dont know what happened , the teams star midfielder , stephan schrock , said as he stretched by the pool i have no idea where the passion has gone it was here in 2010 , but now it is not not in manila anyway i think there is more in the provinces schrock , who was born in germany and is a former player with the bundesliga club eintracht frankfurt , is one of the so called fil foreigns players born and raised overseas , usually in europe , but eligible to represent the philippines because they have one filipino parent the foreign born players have helped raise standards for the national team , and results have been improving the team is ranked 124th in the world by fifa , the highest in the region but until last year , the philippines had won only one world cup qualifier , against sri lanka , before the 2014 cup in brazil on the road to russia for 2018 , however , the azkals have already defeated two established asian powers north korea and bahrain there is still much to do , however , on and off the field dooley , the son of an american serviceman , moved to the united states in 1992 , before major league soccer was born , but says the situation in the philippines now and the united states then are very different in the u s , we had a generational problem , he said there were 20 million kids playing the game , but their parents were basketball or baseball fans when that generation goes , then soccer grows big time in the philippines , he said , the issues are cultural its basketball , he said in america , we had kids but no league here , we have a league but no kids football here is not a game to make money tupas said more than anything , we need a major trophy people need to see something tangible this could turn it around
seattle a federal judge on wednesday ordered striking airline cargo pilots who transport packages for amazon and other customers to immediately resume work about 250 pilots for the carrier , abx air , went on strike on tuesday , accusing their employer of forcing them to work an excessive number of flight assignments in violation of their contract the strike threatened to hold up shipments of amazon orders , though the internet retailer said it had avoided delays so far in a hearing wednesday evening in cincinnati , federal district court judge timothy s black granted abx air a temporary restraining order blocking the strike , according to representatives of the company and pilots union the airline professionals association , teamsters local 1224 , the union representing the pilots , started the strike because of what it called significant understaffing problems at abx air , which has demanded that pilots fly emergency flights to meet the demands of its cargo customers , disrupting the pilots schedules the pilots were picketing outside abx headquarters in wilmington , ohio , and cincinnati northern kentucky international airport , where dhl , one of abxs big customers , has its north american hub in a statement , the union said its pilots would return to work , but called on abx to address the staffing shortages that prompted the strike abx airs failure to address the staffing crisis hurts our families and compromises our ability to do our jobs and meet the needs of amazon , dhl and other customers , said rick ziebarth , an abx pilot and a representative of the pilots union amazon has significantly expanded the number of jets it leases from carriers like abx over the last year to meet soaring demand from customers for speedy shipment of their orders this year , amazon and the air transport services group , the parent company of abx , announced that amazon was leasing 20 boeing 767 freighter aircraft to ensure that the retailer had enough capacity to ship one and two day deliveries for customers as part of their agreement , the carrier granted amazon warrants to buy just under 20 percent of its stock over a five year period amazon suggested that so far , the strike had not affected its customers we rebalanced capacity across our diverse network of carrier partners , and these adjustments ensure there are no disruptions through the busy holiday weekend , kelly cheeseman , an amazon spokeswoman , said abx said it expected flights to resume immediately i am pleased that the court continues to recognize the value to all parties from continuing to work out remaining differences in negotiations and through arbitration , john starkovich , president of abx air , said in a statement amazon has gone to great lengths to discourage employees in its warehouses across the country from forming unions , arguing that they would interfere with the companys ability to innovate inside the facilities but the strike by the pilots shows how some segments of its logistics network could still be affected by organized labor in a phone interview before the judges ruling , mr ziebarth , the abx pilot and union representative , said that the scheduling demands of his employer had caused considerable strain among pilots , which could become worse as the carrier and its customers head into the peak holiday shopping season i cant tell you how many birthdays , family events , anniversaries and even funerals our pilots have had to miss because of all these emergency flights , he said
if the supposed war on christmas is still being waged , youd never know it from the television listings for the next few weeks christmas which conservative critics have complained has been marginalized in our cross cultural age is everywhere this season , often right in the titles of specials and made for tv movies and one of the first examples comes friday night on that most libertine of cable outlets , hbo its once upon a sesame street christmas , a music dotted fable in the tradition of christmas eve on sesame street , elmo saves christmas and assorted other holiday offerings featuring the furry gang the sesame street franchise moved to hbo early this year , and it shows in the casting of the new special the guest stars include zosia mamet of the hbo series girls \( also turning up jim gaffigan , unrecognizable in a santa suit , and audra mcdonald \) the show , pleasant and witty , contains obligatory references to hanukkah and kwanzaa , but the story is decidedly about christmas or , more correctly , about the dark time in sesame streets past , when christmas was not celebrated , decorations were not hung , and santa did not bother stopping that might sound as if it were some kind of metaphor for the very war on christmas world those aforementioned critics have trumpeted , but really its just a bedtime story being told to elmo by his father the tale results in a flashback to a dickensian looking period when sesame street was known as the unfriendliest street in town and ancestors of all the current gang spent their days crabbing at one another \( oscar the grouchs great great grand grouch was , we learn , named oscar the malcontent \) a forebear of elmos is a new arrival on the street , and he sets about changing the prevailing mind set , introducing concepts like generosity and good will elmo and hbo are actually a bit slow to board the christmas bandwagon the hallmark channel began its annual countdown to christmas weeks ago it has already debuted original movies that include every christmas has a story , christmas cookies and my christmas dream , while its companion channel , hallmark movies mysteries , has introduced finding father christmas and operation christmas still to come , to name just the most imminent hallmark channel films christmas in homestead \( thursday night \) , christmas list \( friday \) , a heavenly christmas \( saturday \) and journey back to christmas \( sunday \) lifetime is almost as fond of christmas titles , as in all i want for christmas \( saturday night \) and a christmas wedding date \( dec 10 \) the up tv programming stunt we get christmas which , like hallmarks countdown to christmas , began a few weeks ago includes the world premiere movies a puppy for christmas \( friday night \) , falling for christmas \( saturday \) , the rooftop christmas tree \( sunday \) and girlfriends of christmas past \( dec 4 \) as that last title suggests , somehow the christmas story has been invaded by singles seeking to fill a romantic or other void in their lives on saturday , tv ones monthlong tv winter onederland has the christmas swap , which the channel describes as the story of a down on his luck single father who questions his decision to give up his dreams to take care of his ailing mother on the same channel on dec 10 merry ex mas , about a mild mannered single mother who sets out to foil her ex husbands remarriage most of this fare strays quite far from the actual christmas story , the one in the christian bible dolly parton , at least , is not afraid to put a little faith back into the equation with dolly partons christmas of many colors circle of love , nov 30 on nbc like dolly partons coat of many colors last year , it is inspired by her own childhood , and its short on subtlety but at least it doesnt shy away from the sacred side of christmas the best of the religious themed christmas shows is a little harder to find and doesnt blare its seasonal intentions in the title its winter thaw , thanksgiving night on byutv its a quiet , beautifully acted adaptation of a leo tolstoy story , where love is , god is , with john rhys davies as a gnarled , embittered cobbler who learns that he holds within himself the key to breaking out of his misery so is there still a war on christmas \? there certainly is in supermansion war on christmas , a hilarious special episode of crackles animated supermansion show that is the polar opposite of the dignified story of the cobbler the series is about an assortment of inept superheroes , and in the christmas special , which begins streaming dec 8 , they have to band together to save christmas from a psychotic doll the plot is too bizarre for further description suffice it to say that if you like your holiday fare demented and fearless rather than subdued , this ones for you
donald j trump sat down on tuesday with reporters , editors and columnists of the new york times for an exclusive interview times reporters have annotated portions of the interview the full transcript is available here the personal interactions between president obama and mr trump have so far been pleasant , but its not clear that the kumbaya moment will last mr obama has already indicated that he may weigh in against mr trump once the new administration takes over , especially if the new president attacks mr obamas legacy achievements here is our story on the cordial 90 minute meeting between mr trump and mr obama in the oval office mr trump is working to reset his mercurial relationship with the media as he looks toward assuming office , starting with this meeting at what he branded the failing new york times during his presidential campaign but he still nurses intense grievances toward news outlets in general and the times in particular here is more about mr trumps relationships with the news media and the times mr trump is hinting that even though federal law does not require him to do anything specific to separate himself from his vast business empire , he is inclined to submit to some sort of voluntary standard of ethics that would avoid conflicts of interest or their appearance but he leaves open the possibility that there may not be a way to accomplish it this story has more about mr trumps business ties mr trump is correct that federal law , for the most part , exempts the president from conflict of interest rules , meaning he is allowed to take actions that could benefit his financial holdings but in modern times , most presidents have voluntarily put their financial assets into blind trusts mr trump has said he does not intend to take such a step , instead will turn his companies over to his children read this story for more on mr trumps potential conflicts of interest the wall street journal editorial board , among others , has suggested that the only solution to mr trumps potential conflicts of interest is to sell off all of his assets , and then have a blind trust reinvest the proceeds mr trump suggests that this is not practical mr trumps crowds at rallies frequently targeted hillary clinton , chanting lock her up ! and referring to her as a criminal in july , mr trump himself encouraged a crowd in colorado , telling them im starting to agree with you as they chanted lock her up ! in addition , despite mr trumps remarks here , the f b i and the justice department , which have investigated mrs clintons email server and the clinton foundation , conduct criminal inquiries largely independently of the white house a president attempting to intervene in those kinds of inquiries , in any direction , would be a major scandal here is our full story about mr trumps reversal on prosecuting mrs clinton mr trump has been criticized for not specifically denouncing bigotry and groups that spread bigoted views his statements about such conduct tend to be vague , including here , when he says i disavow the group that nonspecific language has been comforting to leaders of the alt right , a rebranded white nationalist movement , including richard b spencer , who led a gathering at a federal building near the white house last weekend that included some audience members offering a nazi salute mr trump here acknowledges , perhaps for the first time , that being president will perhaps help enrich his family he also concedes that the arrangement might fairly be called a conflict of interest back in february , when he was still a candidate , mr trump said definitively that torture was effective dont tell me it doesnt work torture works , he told an audience in south carolina o k , folks \? torture , you know , half these guys torture doesnt work believe me , it works o k \? so mr trumps answer on tuesday offered a revealing insight into his willingness to shift or rethink a position , especially after talking with someone he respects gen james n mattis may well be mr trumps secretary of defense , and his rejection of torture clearly had an effect on the president elect the reality is more complicated the number of factories and the number of americans who work in factories both have declined sharply in recent decades but the nations manufacturing output is at the highest level in history the labor intensive production of low value goods , like socks , has been replaced by the largely automated production of high value goods , like circuits in 1986 , president ronald reagan signed a landmark law that prohibited the hiring of illegal immigrants , provided new resources for enforcement along the mexican border and offered legal status to several million illegal immigrants experts say the law did little to slow migration to the united states , but made crossing the border more difficult and dangerous premiums for many health plans under the affordable care act are increasing 20 percent to 40 percent or more , but increases of 100 percent are extremely rare deductibles for many plans are high , but not 16 , 000 for a family plan in 2017 , the maximum out of pocket cost , including the deductible , is 14 , 300 mr trumps comments about his fellow republicans had a sharp edge and an implicit message they owe their congressional majority to him , and he expects to be treated accordingly whether this is true , and to what extent , will be one of the pivotal stories of the new trump administration , and crucial to figuring out how much or how little he can get done he needs congress to achieve many of the campaign promises he made , including the deep tax cut and large infrastructure spending package , not to mention and it is an open question how in love with his policies republicans will prove to be read these stories for background on mr trumps relationships with republican leaders in congress , and the never trump stalwarts who are pondering the future of the conservative movement mr trump suggests here that he may name jared kushner , his son in law , as a special envoy to the middle east , charged with making peace between the israelis and the palestinians buried in this answer is an assertion by mr trump that the federal governments anti nepotism law does not apply to him as president , but he also says he would want to avoid the appearance of conflict installing mr kushner as a special envoy could have that effect , essentially giving him an important task that would allow him to be involved in high level national security deliberations without hiring him outright this is a role that was often discussed as a potential landing spot for bill clinton if mrs clinton had won the white house
in 1970 , a dutch woman named christiane van maarsen took out a notebook from her childhood she tore out a page with an eight line poem that her little sisters best friend had written decades earlier the friends condescending tone had long rubbed her the wrong way the friend was anne frank the opening lines of the poem , written in a poezie album , or friendship book , sought to motivate christiane , whom anne regarded as somewhat idle they are traditional lines of encouragement that might have come from a 1930s dutch periodical the closing verses which may be annes own say if others have reproached you for what you have done wrong then be sure to amend your mistake that is the best answer one can make ms van maarsen , who died in 2006 , gave the poem to her sister , jacqueline , annes best friend , for safekeeping , and she kept it for decades on wednesday , the autographed poem fetched about 148 , 000 at an auction in the dutch city of haarlem , a price that reflected the profound resonance anne frank continues to have in global popular culture , seven decades after she perished in the holocaust addressed to dear cri cri , the poem is signed by anne and dated march 28 , 1942 , nearly four months before her family went into hiding in an annex of rooms above the amsterdam office of her father , otto frank it was there that she wrote her famous diary , which was published in 1947 and transformed her into an emblem of lost innocence in a phone interview from amsterdam on wednesday , jacqueline van maarsen , 87 , said that she had decided to part with the poem in part because her sister had spurned it she stressed , however , that she treasured the notes and verse that anne had written to her my sister didnt really like the poem very much because anne was very critical of her , because she left school early , whereas anne was busy all the time , she said she gave it to me because she knew i was collecting annes things i would never sell the verse that anne addressed to me but as my sister was not attached to hers , i decided to sell it thys blankevoort , co director of bubb kuyper , the auction house that sold the poem , said the price was nearly five times the minimum price of 32 , 000 he said the successful bidder wished to remain anonymous mr blankevoort said that autographed works by anne frank were extremely rare and that only four or five had been discovered in the past four decades he said the auction had generated strong interest , including inquiries from as far away as fiji and japan the bid was much higher than i expected and shows anne franks cultural importance and also the emotional attachment to who she was and what she represents , he said any item by anne frank is very important , as there is not much left when the nazis broke down doors , they put everything on the street , where it could be destroyed by the rain or stolen after two years of hiding from the nazis in the annex , the frank family was discovered in august 1944 and deported everyone died , except for mr frank anne died of typhus at the bergen belsen concentration camp in germany in the first few months of 1945 she was 15 her diary of a young girl has been translated into 67 languages and has sold 30 million copies mr blankevoort noted that the friendship books that circulated in the netherlands in the 1940s were the social media of their time , and that the sentiments expressed by anne to christiane were particularly notable because they were written before anne was confined , emotionally and physically , by the attic walls that would soon curtail her activities in our mind , she is the girl who never left the attic , he said but here she is free , with her spirit free in the spring , a massachusetts museum paid 50 , 000 for a copy of grimms fairy tales in which anne had inscribed her name and the name of her sister , margot in 1989 , another short piece of verse written in a friends notebook went on sale at christies the anne frank house , the popular four story museum in amsterdam on the prinsengracht canal where the frank family hid during the war , decided not to bid on the latest document for sale maatje mostart , a spokeswoman for the museum , noted that the poem was addressed to the sister of a friend and , as such , did not shed deep light on annes own story its , of course , very special that part of an anne frank collection comes out after so many years , ms mostart said as we have other original manuscripts directly connected to her life , for us this is less important jacqueline van maarsen , whose father was jewish , survived the nazi occupation because her mother , who was born catholic , had registered her as a christian the father survived the holocaust , but his relatives died she has written a memoir , your best friend , anne frank , which she said was how anne signed a farewell letter to her before she went into hiding ms van maarsen said the two had enjoyed playing monopoly and chatting about hollywood stars she said her friend would have loved the interest around the world that her writing had inspired people say her diary was very well written , and i think her work remains powerful so many decades later because of her intelligence and her character , she said , adding , to me , she was just my little friend , and i miss her very much
donald j trump has said climate change is a hoax created by the chinese to get the united states to suppress its manufacturing sector that prompted a public rebuttal last week from a chinese official attending a climate summit meeting in marrakesh , morocco on tuesday , mr trump appeared to back away from the strict climate denier viewpoint embraced by many republicans in an interview with the new york times , saying that there was some connectivity between human activity and climate change he also said he wanted to keep an open mind about whether to pull the united states out of the paris agreement , the main global climate change accord mr trumps opacity means it is unclear whether he will actually support policies to limit the effects of climate change after being sworn in as president in january but officials from china , which has surpassed the united states as the worlds largest emitter of greenhouse gas , have said they will move forward on climate policies without the americans , if it comes to that on tuesday , michael r bloomberg , the media tycoon and former mayor of new york city , said that american cities would continue to enact climate policies no matter what mr trump and the federal government decided to do mr bloomberg made his remarks in washington at a talk hosted by the china general chamber of commerce they were adapted for an op ed article published tuesday by bloomberg view under the headline , washington wont have last word on climate change mr bloomberg , a longtime advocate for action on climate change , praised xie zhenhua , chinas climate envoy , for saying china remained committed to tackling the issue thats a responsible thing to do for the chinese people and the world , he said mr bloomberg added that if mr trump decided to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement , then he would urge the mayors of 128 cities in the united states who see the need to fight climate change to join the agreement following is a central passage from mr bloombergs op ed article i cant tell you what donald trumps administration will do and in all fairness , they will need time to figure it out themselves whats said on the campaign trail is one thing actually carrying out a specific policy is another i hope theyll recognize the importance of the issue but i am confident that no matter what happens in washington , no matter what regulations the next administration adopts or rescinds , no matter what laws the next congress may pass , we will meet the pledges that the u s made in paris the reason is simple cities , businesses and citizens will continue reducing emissions , because they have concluded just as china has that doing so is in their own self interest the u s s success in fighting climate change has never been primarily dependent on washington bear in mind over the past decade , congress has not passed a single bill that takes direct aim at climate change yet at the same time , the u s has led the world in reducing emissions that progress has been driven by cities , businesses and citizens and none of them are letting up now just the opposite all are looking for ways to expand their efforts mayors and local leaders around the country are determined to keep pushing ahead on climate change mr bloombergs remarks dovetail with recent ones made by american mayors who say their cities will defy potential policies from mr trump on critical issues among others , the mayors of new york , chicago , seattle , philadelphia and washington have said their cities will be immigrant sanctuaries that do not cooperate with united states immigration and customs enforcement in his visit with reporters and editors at the new york times on tuesday , mr trump said of the paris agreement im looking at it very closely i have an open mind to it in addressing the climate issue , he also said , clean air is vitally important mr trump appeared to be confusing the issues of climate change and air pollution carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change do not cause smog it is buildup of particulate matter that leads to toxic air , a severe problem in chinese cities greenhouses gases and particulate matter can both come from the same source in many cases , industrial coal burning so any policies to limit the use of coal helps with both issues the united states and china have made pledges to curb the use of coal mr bloomberg concluded the op ed article published tuesday with this thought washington will not have the last word on the fate of the paris agreement in the u s mayors will , together with business leaders and citizens
is childhood the golden era of friendship \? and can you get those relationships back \? the other day , i took down from the shelf a beautiful novel by william maxwell so long , see you tomorrow and i realized the title alone summons the unspoken bond , the constant availability , the relentless promise that friendship is when you are 12 my great friend at that age was mark macdonald in those early , rain soaked days on scotlands west coast , mark was my constant companion and my secret weapon whatever happened at home , there would always be mark to brighten the day and spit with style like river phoenix did in stand by me , via a rolled up tongue we would be up at the crack of dawn to wander over the fields , scan the beaches for coins , climb the hills together and sit in the graveyard comparing our plans for world domination mark had crohns disease he was often in hospital , and wed write to each other planning our adventures for the summer he told me i was a good writer and i told him he was a great painter , before we disappeared from each others lives i havent seen him in 30 years when i recently tried to find mark again , he didnt appear to exist like the boys in maxwells novel , he seemed like a figment , or a fragile piece of memory that crumbles when you turn it in your hands he wasnt to be found at the old address i had for him in the seaside town of saltcoats his name is a popular one on facebook , but none of the marks i found was the one i knew , and he wasnt on twitter or instagram either none of the search engines reveal anything about mark i tried death certificates , fearing , as i have for a long time , that my old friend might have died i asked my mother if any of her friends had kept in touch with the family but none had i could remember two of his sisters names but they didnt show up on the internet either when i went back to scotland recently , i drove to the square where we once lived , and i looked up at the window of my old house , remembering how i used to shine a torch from there to marks bedroom two flashes meant good night three flashes meant see you tomorrow i wonder if technology has changed the meaning of friendship my daughter is 12 and most things that happen to her are photographed she and her friends get together and spend hours trying out poses , making videos , retouching them , setting them to music and posting them on this or that social media network im sure the girls are bonded in many of the traditional ways , but i also wonder if theyll ever lose sight of each other , which was always one of the possibilities of friendship , an aspect of its mystery i think we always knew we would move on in life and that our great friendships would be a matter of memory i dont have a single photograph of mark macdonald i dont think we were ever photographed together , and that adds to the notion that our friendship was a fiction social media is a vehicle of self promotion , a means of fixing an idea of yourself in the social sphere , without people actually knowing you at all and thats a change the thing about friendship used to be that the ideal was shared entirely by the pair of you , or sometimes by a group , yet it remained local , and that was part of its power its the mindfulness i miss a pair of excellent youngsters in my wider family have over 1 , 000 facebook friends between them they say they dont know half of them , and that some of them are frenemies the social network gives them the option of corralling people into close friends or acquaintances , and , naturally , they always have the option of clicking unfriend but are the majority of these people friends or are they just names \? you can know everything thats going on in peoples lives without knowing a single thing going on in their hearts but is that friendship \? im told that empathy still flowers in the usual way , but i have my doubts people now in their 20s have a lot of self advertising talent , but are they , i wonder , close to the point where a bad breakup , say , or a death in the family , isnt a moment of opportunity for the protective and dignifying balms of old friendship , but simply a quiet day on social media \? the times we live in are big on loyalty technology has driven us wild with questions of loyalty to flags , to nations , to a way of life or to brands who give out loyalty points to those who stay tight but the only kind of loyalty that matters is to know your friends and stick with them the relationship has nothing really to do with outside people , or with your self image or with status updates , and perhaps our vision of friendship has been degraded by the instantaneous , relentless nature of our communications technology replace watch and click with listen and feel , close the curtains and mix two drinks , download nothing , share nothing , but lose yourself in the sort of communication that has nothing to sell love gets all the big headlines , but friendship is where the action is , especially if you consider that it is really a lack of friendship that makes an unhappy marriage fundamentally , its the art of friendship that warms you in the various winters of your discontent , and when youre in trouble you dont want 1 , 000 people , but just one friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain , the late muhammad ali is thought to have said its not something you learn in school but if you havent learned the meaning of friendship , you really havent learned anything and that is why i miss my old friend mark there was something there that stood outside of achievement or romance , money or technology , religion or reputation as i say , i was never photographed with mark macdonald and i never hugged him or bought him lunch either but sometimes in a dark hour ill look up and imagine i see him , not far distant , a living guarantee that there will always be someone in life who really knows who you are when all the machines are off and when all the chips are down , i see his light three flashes

istanbul the european parliament is likely to vote on thursday to suspend negotiations to bring turkey into the european union , infuriating ankara and possibly hastening the end of a long and troubled process while the vote is advisory rather than binding , the government of president recep tayyip erdogan is smarting from european criticism of its crackdown on opponents and on the news media after a failed coup attempt in july so it has suggested that , in any event , it may pull out of the process altogether if there is no progress by the end of the year such progress now seems improbable mr erdogan has also said that he would approve a restoration of the death penalty , which would almost certainly force an end to any talk of turkey joining the bloc , since a ban on capital punishment is a condition of membership many policy makers and analysts criticized the european parliaments expected move , saying it would only push turkey to harden its position on issues like human rights and the death penalty , while endangering cooperation on limiting refugee flows to europe it would be a strategic stupidity of the first order for the e u to unilaterally abandon its relationship with turkey , carl bildt , a former swedish prime minister , said in a twitter post this week nonetheless , at a debate in the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday night , it was clear that lawmakers from most of the main parties seemed likely to vote on thursday to suspend accession talks mr erdogan did not wait for the formality of the vote to react with bitterness the e u parliament resorting to such a vote means it takes terror organizations under its wings , it takes sides with them , he said on wednesday , addressing an organization of islamic cooperation meeting in istanbul only a few days ago , the turkish president , according to the hurriyet newspaper , threatened to join the shanghai cooperation organization , a body that includes china and russia , in place of seeking membership of the european union the e u has been delaying us for 53 years how can such a thing happen \? the paper quoted mr erdogan as saying turkey first expressed interest in joining the union in the 1960s , although formal accession talks began in 2005 the european parliaments vote comes at an awkward time for both the european union and turkey accession talks formally resumed this year in a limited number of areas as part of the deal to limit migration , though they could also help unlock an agreement for cyprus , one of the longest running disputes in the world but talks in switzerland between greek and turkish cypriot leaders collapsed on tuesday , with no date set for resumption the e u finds itself devoid of a flexible response toward turkey and is now contemplating the nuclear option , suspension of negotiations , said sinan ulgen , a turkish scholar at carnegie europe , a foreign policy think tank in brussels that , he said , could threaten the refugee deal that europe has with turkey that deal , which was reached last march , provides for the union and member states to pay turkey 3 billion euros , or about 3 2 billion , for refugee assistance in 2016 and 2017 , and it foresees a further 3 billion in 2018 in exchange , turkey agreed to help stop the flow of refugees across its border and to take back migrants rejected for asylum in europe turkey hosts an estimated 2 7 million refugees or other migrants from afghanistan , syria and other countries the agreement has been broadly successful in reducing the flow into europe the number of migrants crossing into greece was at about 100 or fewer a day in the last few weeks , compared with 2 , 000 a day last year so far , europe has disbursed 677 million of the promised funds , badly needed at a time of economic hardship in turkey the deal was a complex one , however it tied returns of migrants to progress on visa free travel to europe for turks , as well as resettlement of registered refugees visa free travel was further conditioned on turkey modifying its antiterror legislation , but the attempted coup on july 15 led instead to even harsher tactics under extraordinary emergency powers that have seen some 40 , 000 people jailed and more than 100 , 000 fired from public sector jobs , including 15 , 000 on tuesday that means the refugee deal could well unravel , as there seems little inclination in ankara to liberalize its terrorism legislation or in brussels to grant visa free travel to turks the majority of the society has started not believing in the sincerity of the e u , said mustafa yeneroglu , head of the turkish parliaments human rights committee and a member of the governing party , the justice and development party we have come to a point that the enmity in europe against turks and islam is at a level that it does not seem possible for turkey to become an e u member , despite fulfilling all conditions mr ulgen , the carnegie europe scholar , said that while the probable outcome of the european parliaments vote makes the refugee deal even more tenuous , both sides nonetheless have an interest in maintaining it it could lead to unraveling of the deal but does not mean the full deal will collapse , because it generates benefits for both sides the possibility that the european parliament would vote for suspension has been opposed by some of the blocs most senior officials i believe the best way to strengthening turkeys democracy the most effective way is by engaging with turkey , by keeping channels open , said the european unions foreign policy chief , federica mogherini if the accession process came to an end , i believe , we would both find ourselves in a lose lose scenario to formally suspend or cancel accession talks would require a vote by member states the parliament is voting on whether to recommend that they do that , but so far , only austria has publicly advocated such a measure it seems unlikely that the recommendation will gain much traction ahead of the next european union summit meeting in december nevertheless , the parliament seems determined to make a statement in light of the antidemocratic measures mr erdogan has taken in recent months we cant simply stand aside and observe we cannot simply have business as usual , said manfred weber , a german lawmaker and a leading figure in the largest political group at the parliament , the european peoples party we need to appeal to turkey to change its course in the interest of its own citizens reinstituting the death penalty could bring turkeys european ambitions to a definitive end mr erdogan has been open about forging a majority in the turkish parliament with the far right nationalist movement party to bring back capital punishment in several speeches , mr erdogan has noted that many other countries have capital punishment , though none of them are in the european union at a speech in ankara last month , the crowd began cheering for reinstating the death penalty soon , soon , dont worry , mr erdogan said our government will bring this to the parliament and i believe it will pass , and when it comes to me i will approve it
if you think back to this years presidential campaign and recall a lot of articles mentioning hillary clintons email troubles and donald j trumps various controversies , you wouldnt be wrong if it seems there were fewer articles about jobs , the economy and taxes , thats because there were the temptation to blame news organizations for this imbalance is strong , but there is at least some reason to resist it critics have long assailed campaign coverage as focused too much on candidate personality , campaign strategy and assessments of whos winning , instead of on policies and ideas but this year , the candidates share the blame i compared the content of campaign ads with the content of news articles about two specific topics candidate traits or characteristics , and the economy or jobs both the candidates and news organizations spent more time discussing the candidates fitness for office \( or lack of it \) than they did the nations economy and the imbalance grew more lopsided as the election approached using analytic tools provided by crimson hexagon , i categorized the campaign news coverage of 23 media outlets this consisted of four broadcast networks three cable news networks national public radio and hugh hewitt on the radio two online news sites and 12 newspapers i specifically searched for news about mrs clintons campaign and her email server or her campaign and wikileaks , and several controversies connected to mr trumps campaign \( including things like trump university , the khan family and the access hollywood video \) i also looked for news about the candidates campaign appeals on the economy and jobs this list isnt exhaustive , but it gives a sense of the trade off between coverage of these controversies and the economy the candidates controversies received more coverage , on average , than their views on the economy from june until election day , 38 percent of the stories mentioned mr trumps various missteps , and 35 percent mentioned mrs clintons email only 17 percent mentioned mr trump and jobs or the economy , and only 10 percent cited mrs clintons campaign and the economy closer to the election , from oct 8 on , the numbers got even more lopsided this was an important date just after the release of the access hollywood video and a few weeks before f b i director james b comeys letter to congress from this point , 53 percent of the campaign articles mentioning either controversies or the economy discuss mrs clintons email , while only 6 percent mention her alongside jobs or the economy as for mr trump , 31 percent mention his entanglements , while 10 percent mention him related to jobs and the economy the imbalance in coverage of the candidates character is striking , as is the lack of coverage about the economy compared with the controversies moving one week past the video release , between oct 15 and election day , roughly half \( 56 percent \) of the stories about scandals and the economy mentioned mrs clintons emails , and only a quarter \( 26 percent \) discussed mr trump and his imbroglios a mere 7 percent of the stories in these last three weeks mentioned mrs clinton and the economy \( 11 percent mentioned mr trump and the economy \) these choices have consequences according to the gallup organization , americans reports of what they heard or read about mrs clinton between june and september were mainly references to her handling of emails during her time as secretary of state in contrast , mentions of mr trump changed week by week , tracking what was happening on the campaign trail but before anyone blames the news media , its important to examine what the candidates themselves were talking about over the course of the campaign if media reports reflect candidate discourse accurately , then it is not merely the media choosing to report on scandals it might be at least as much the candidates choosing to campaign on them that results in unending coverage of traits and characteristics to figure out if this was the case , i used data from kantar media cmag on all the candidates campaign ads aired between june and election day i coded all of the appeals in each ad and weighted the appeals by how many times the ads ran on television mrs clinton made more ads than mr trump , and she vastly out advertised him , running nearly three times as many ads as he did all told , over half a million ads were run in 2016 during this period the content of the ads is revealing both candidates spent most of their television advertising time attacking the other persons character in fact , the losing candidates ads did little else more than three quarters of the appeals in mrs clintons advertisements \( and nearly half of mr trumps \) were about traits , characteristics or dispositions only 9 percent of mrs clintons appeals in her ads were about jobs or the economy by contrast , 34 percent of mr trumps appeals focused on the economy , jobs , taxes and trade since the start of presidential campaign television advertising in 1952 , no campaign has made 76 percent of its television ad appeals about any single topic on average , traits typically garner about 22 percent of the appeals the economy typically generates about 28 percent of the appeals theres usually much more balance of course , this was an unusual election year , with two very unpopular candidates , so the candidates flaws may have simply been too big a story for either them or the media to pass up whatever the reason , the criterion of fitness for office dominated the clinton campaigns messaging and made up a good share of the trump messaging as well , and the news media covered it
new delhi in the dense smog that engulfed indias capital early this month , a baby named vaishnavi gasped through the night in the concrete room that her father and mother rent for 20 a month , they took turns staying up , laying a hand on her rib cage , feeling it move up and down her coughing fits became so violent that she vomited , milk mixed with ropes of sputum three times they thought she would not survive until morning twenty miles away , in an elegant , high ceilinged house in an elite neighborhood , a 4 year old boy named mehtab was also struggling to fill his lungs with air his mother , heavily pregnant , sat beside him , administering corticosteroids through a nebulizer mask once an hour but once an hour wasnt enough mehtabs father fought waves of panic as they waited for the sun to rise the boy looked , to him , like a fish suffocating in the air for seven days at the beginning of this month , a thick cloud settled over this metropolis of 20 million people held in place by a weather system known as an anticyclone , the pollution was pulled inward and down , trapping the people of this city in concentrations of hazardous micro particles never before recorded here the rich , who are buffered from so many of delhis dangers , bunkered themselves inside , filtering out particles in their own air through expensive , high tech purifiers but the nature of air pollution is that it is pervasive researchers in china have found that exposure rates for the rich and the poor are virtually indistinguishable as average daytime levels of pm 2 5 , the most dangerous particles , passed 700 micrograms per cubic meter , 28 times the concentration the world health organization considers safe , the authorities in delhi took the unprecedented step of shutting schools for three days protesters marched in surgical masks , carrying posters likening the city to a gas chamber eventually , the wind picked up , reducing the citys pollution down to its usual , atrocious winter level but the air quality in north india will remain dangerous for months , as poor people fight the dropping temperature by burning things leaves , plastic , anything to stay warm there is a clear body of evidence that death rates , emergency room visits , heart attacks and strokes all rise when particulate concentrations are high recent data from the w h o s global burden of disease project indicates that the number of premature deaths related to air pollution in india has caught up with the number in china , and is now surpassing it the worst hit will be the very old , who are susceptible to heart disease and stroke , and the very young , whose lungs are taxed so badly by polluted air that they cannot develop normally children are more vulnerable because they are smaller , with shallower breaths and higher heart rates they breathe more air in the very different homes of vaishnavi and mehtab , four parents are waiting to see what the rest of this winter will do to their children vaishnavis father , ravi who , like many in india , does not use a last name remembers the day when he woke up and smelled something burning the rubber casing of an electrical wire is burning , that was his first thought he splashed his eyes with water to stop the stinging on the ride into central delhi , where he sells trinkets on a street corner , he passed columns of smoke gray blue wisps from piles of trash , and black pillars from fields where farmers were burning the straw left over from their rice harvests scientists had been tracking the progress of a mass of smoke via nasa satellite images , as it rose off farmers fields in the nearby states of punjab and haryana and floated across the plains toward the city , a two day drift in delhi , it merged with emissions from cars , coal fired power plants , open air burning of trash and dust from construction this year , the crop burning emissions happened to arrive on the eve of diwali , the hindu festival of lights , when smoke from millions of celebratory fireworks typically send concentrations of the harmful pm 2 5 particles skyrocketing ravi has worked on the same corner since he was a child , and his mother worked there before him he had never seen a smog so thick that it obscured the shangri la hotel he knew something was not right he felt dizzy , as if he had been sniffing glue what worried him more was his only child , vaishnavi , just 18 months old , whose spasmodic nighttime cough no longer quieted with the arrival of morning he bought her a surgical mask for 40 rupees about 60 cents from a merchant at an intersection , but she kept pulling it off on the way home , he furiously jumped out of the auto rickshaw and confronted a man burning a pile of trash on the road please dont burn this , my daughter is crying , he said the man responded with a string of especially dirty abuses the air that week was utterly still meteorologists measured both horizontal and vertical movement at nil madhurbain singh anand , the father of 4 year old mehtab , peered into the garden behind their house as the cloud of pollution settled on the city the garden wall , maybe 20 feet away , was no longer visible when someone opened a door , a haze filled the room its like those horror movies , he said you open the door and the thing comes in mr anand , an executive at a clothing company , grew up in the house , and moved his family back to it from mumbai shortly after his son , their only child , turned 2 he hoped mehtab could enjoy the same protected delhi boyhood that he did , tumbling out the door after school and running around with a gang of neighborhood children until dinner but mehtabs life is nothing like that in the winter , when the air quality plummets , he barely goes outside for fear of setting off his breathing problems his mother , guntas kaur , enrolled him in tennis lessons , and then swimming , but both had to be cut short because of wheezing attacks she says she had to allow him more television time instead after a severe attack last year that led to a four day hospitalization , ms kaur moved mehtab into his parents bedroom and set her iphone alarm for every two hours , so she could strap on his nebulizer mask at intervals throughout the night on the night of diwali , the couple sat inside , listening to the neighbors celebrate they could hear firecrackers going off outside , the expensive kind that sizzle and pop and burn for half an hour we were feeling so disturbed , ms kaur said we knew what was going to happen the two children , 20 miles apart and at different ends at the economic spectrum , got sick on the same night thirty six hours after diwali , the pollution had pooled close to the ground delhis airport , indira gandhi international , reported visibility of around 1 , 000 feet , the worst conditions in 17 years after episodic smog events , it typically takes between one and three days for severe effects to emerge in children , according to bhargav krishna , who manages the public health foundation of indias environmental health system and is a co founder of care for air the crisis typically comes in the form of a lower respiratory infection , like bronchitis or pneumonia , that can become dangerous , with fluid filling the lungs and plummeting levels of oxygen in the blood in the mosquito ridden migrants settlement where her family lives , vaishnavi coughed incessantly her face was red , and the tendons on her neck were popping out ravi stirred from a nap to hear his wife howling he did not sleep again until morning , but instead rubbed the babys feet and hands , and listened for a heartbeat there was not a sound coming from her , said bhanwari , her mother you hear a wheezing sound inside her a rattling mehtab , too , was in trouble his mother , weary of confining him , had finally allowed him to go to school , but he was sent home right away , sniffling that much exposure to the air was enough when night fell ms kaur began administering the steroids every hour , something she had never done he began to gasp , his rib cage heaving , 15 minutes after she removed the mask from his face it was really bad , mr anand said i cant explain it in words , actually the decisions came quickly after that mr anand brought home an air purifier that cost 29 , 000 rupees about 425 and switched it on , peering at the display to see the concentration of pm 2 5 it was above 700 inside the house three days later , ms kaur took mehtab out of delhi , boarding a train for her parents home , a few hours north what shocked her was how quickly his breathing eased they arrived at night , and he slept so peacefully that she reduced the steroid treatments to every four hours the next morning , she watched through the window as he played outside she called her husband , crying , and said it was time to leave delhi not so for vaishnavi this week , she sat on her mothers lap , sucking on a lollipop , while her aunt cooked on a clay stove in the room , filling it with fumes the worst season here in delhi has just begun it will continue for three months , growing worse when the citys vast homeless population begins setting nighttime fires for warmth , and when dropping temperatures push the emissions toward the ground some emergency protective measures introduced during the week after diwali , including a moratorium on construction , have been reversed the 43 year old badarpur coal fired power plant will remain shuttered until jan 31 but it will then reopen , and new standards being imposed on coal plants next year will apply only to newly built plants , mr krishna said you stop being angry and start being cynical at some point , he said year after year , there are action plans issued with no follow up and every year , this kind of thing happens with the tourists back on the street , vaishnavis father , ravi , was back at his corner , selling trinkets he had consulted a roadside doctor about protecting his family from air pollution , and gathered that they were supposed to eat cane sugar he had also bought a pair of glasses to protect his eyes from the pollution , and removed several bricks from the wall of the small , airless room his family occupies , which he thought would improve air circulation vaishnavi had improved with a course of antibiotics , but he felt no certainty that she would survive another week like the one that followed diwali or , for that matter , that anyone would notice if she did not delhi people have no memory , he said it would be one in a hundred who would ask me how she died
it happened so fast one moment i was running trails , the next i was staring a black bear sow in the face , so close i could smell it , wild and pungent and alarming , and i knew it could smell me , too , my fear i was in the middle of a rainy 22 mile run in far north bicentennial park on the outskirts of anchorage , where i live it was late july , a time when grizzlies sweep down from the mountains to feast on the red flecked salmon swimming up campbell creek but i was miles from the water i had planned my route away from the creek , and i hadnt seen bear scat in more than an hour as i crested a hill , a crash sounded from my right , and i instinctively moved to the left , expecting a moose but it was the sow with three cubs the cubs fled up a tree the sow paused in front of me , as if waiting i backed into the brush , fortifying myself behind a skinny grove of alder trees , moving slowly , carefully , never taking my eyes off the bear when it veered as if to leave i felt such relief that my throat loosened and small gasps escaped my lips then it abruptly turned and charged directly at me its impossible to run the trails around alaska without thinking about bears there are piles of scat everywhere , dotted with blueberry and cranberry seeds that glint in the sun , reminders that you have to be careful you have to be versed in bear awareness , bear etiquette and bear protocol headphones are a no no and going alone is discouraged making noise and carrying bear spray is recommended still , i often ran alone i preferred it that way i liked the serenity and the loneliness , liked the hours of nothing but me and the mountains and the trees that day , i wore a bear bell attached to my hydration pack , and i sang , too , whenever i came to dense areas i sang old rock n roll songs , loudly and badly i was cautious but not afraid i ran these trails all summer and the summer before , and while i saw bears on many other trails , i only twice saw them on these sections maybe i let down my guard maybe i felt invincible , the way you feel when you repeat risky behavior without negative results maybe the bear was having a bad day when the bear charged , time stood still i felt every millisecond i stood in the drizzle , rain coating my face like tears , and i did what they tell you to do if a black bear charges i waved my arms and yelled im human ! i cried , my voice rising through the birch trees , through that silent and never ending moment im a person ! the bear paused and ran back toward the brush a minute later , it charged a second time and again i waved my arms and yelled and again it stopped , this time so close i could almost reach out and touch its snout i couldnt breathe , couldnt swallow i wondered , briefly and almost idly , if this was how i would die suddenly , i wanted to talk to my son , who was grown and off living his own life i wanted to hear his voice a lifetime later , the bear turned and ran off , its backside swaying into the trees i had to get back to the trail , to the possibility of safety , yet i couldnt step away from the alders it was my only protection thats when the bear began circling around me in a wide arc thats when i knew i was in trouble , became really afraid when my son was young and nothing would comfort him , i would talk it didnt matter what i said , he needed my voice , the steady flow of words as i stepped from the shelter of the alders , i talked out loud , my voice surprisingly calm i talked to the bear to show that i meant no harm , but mostly i talked to reassure myself as the bear circled for a second time , i stumbled through devils club , snagging my shorts and scratching my legs , and i talked about the day my son was born , how i recognized his face immediately when i reached the trail , i kept talking the bear followed , but i didnt look back a half a mile later , i glanced over my shoulder , and the bear was gone i started running and didnt stop until i encountered two hikers , and i collapsed at their feet for weeks i saw that bears face in my dreams , and i woke up , heart pounding i swore i would never run trails again , but i missed it too much , and soon i was out with the trees and that big , big sky some things are worth the risk , though i made sure to carry a canister of bear spray , just in case and sometimes even now when im running , i think of that bear charging and how i stood there , so still and yet so alive it opened something inside of me that can never be closed it offered a taste of the unknown at any time i might find myself crouched in the brush , face to face with my own fragile existence so much of life is chance there are no guarantees but there are vast landscapes and dangers and wild moments of good luck

hong kong whenever the windows of her employers 35th floor apartment looked dirty , win win warsiating would lean halfway out of the high rise building to clean them sometimes she would glance down at the ground far below and be seized with anxiety , she said but she never complained that was years ago , when ms warsiating , a domestic worker from indonesia , was new to hong kong and the job these days , she said , she would be far less willing to compromise her safety to please an employer i agree to clean windows , but if you are not safe , of course not , she said at a recent rally for migrant workers rights in hong kong in a rich city known for its soaring high rises , reports that several domestic workers fell to their deaths this year while cleaning windows have added urgency to a long running debate about the citys deep social inequality and dependence on low cost migrant labor last month , the deaths prompted indonesia and the philippines the countries that supply the vast majority of hong kongs roughly 300 , 000 migrant domestic workers to call for window washing safety regulations last week , the labor department said that , starting in january , new employment contracts would contain a clause prohibiting domestic workers from cleaning any windows without secure grilles , or from extending anything but their arms beyond window ledges but the underlying question of what rights hong kongs domestic migrant workers deserve is far from resolved labor activists said the new clause would do little to improve a system they say is rife with exploitation by employment agencies , and which hong kong officials rely on to plug gaps in social services for children and older residents they want to keep the labor cheap , said leo tang , the organizing secretary at the hong kong confederation of trade unions mr tang said the government could raise the minimum wage for domestic migrant workers or better police the employment agencies but of course , for all these types of needs , they have to increase the public expenditure , he said that is the thing they wouldnt do as a neoliberal government hong kongs migrant domestic workers , who are mainly women , typically work six days a week and earn a monthly minimum wage of about 556 far less than what other workers are guaranteed under hong kong law they also pay placement fees to employment agencies and security deposits that are worth several months of wages hong kong , a former british colony , does provide better legal protections than these workers would find in many other popular destinations for economic migrants across asia and the middle east but jade anderson , an anti human trafficking coordinator at justice center hong kong , an advocacy group , said that was no excuse for employment policies that she said encouraged abuse being the best amongst a series of poor choices doesnt say much for hong kong , ms anderson said a recent survey by the center of migrant domestic workers found that 17 percent displayed signs of being subjected to forced labor , while a third said they did not feel free to quit their jobs eman c villanueva , the spokesman for the asian migrants coordinating body , another advocacy group , said that migrant domestic workers feel discriminated against by rules that require them to live in their employers homes , by vague job descriptions that can facilitate exploitation and by immigration policies that oblige them to leave the city within two weeks if their contracts are terminated we are segregated we are excluded from hong kong society , he said and i think that is the underlying thing that reinforces the mind set of the people that we can be treated differently and treated unfairly mr villanueva , citing philippine officials and indonesian activists , said that three filipinos and two indonesians had died in hong kong this year after falling from heights , although he said the figures included both suicides and work related accidents the debate over window washing began last month , after the philippine consulate sent a letter to employment agencies saying that it would require new employment contracts for its citizens to stipulate that domestic workers were banned from cleaning windows the indonesian consulate later said it would do the same for us , the most important thing is that our workers are protected by law , tri tharyat , the indonesian consul general , said in an interview before the new clause was announced indonesia has said it plans to stop sending domestic workers to several countries , he added , but hong kong was not on that list because its legal code provided better protections for migrants its not perfect yet , but its better than nothing , he said carlson k s chan , hong kongs labor commissioner , told reporters last week that the new clause on window washing represented a pragmatic compromise among labor unions , foreign consulates , migrant workers and their employers im very happy that all the parties have been adopting a very sensible attitude , mr chan said he added that he did not have official data on how many migrant workers had died while cleaning windows this year benny lee , the chief operating officer of the support group for hong kong employers with foreign domestic helpers , said he was willing to accept some safety measures but worried that the clause could inspire the workers to negotiate other aspects of their contracts , resulting in reams of paperwork that might confuse employers hong kong provides some of the best legal protections for migrant workers in asia , mr lee added , and accusations of exploitation were frequently exaggerated by the international news media its totally unfair , he said ms warsiating , who was once frightened cleaning windows on high floors , now spends her off days advising newly arrived indonesian domestic workers about their rights some tell her they would be willing to complain about unsafe conditions , ms warsiating said but others say doing so could give their employers a pretext to fire them and therefore put them at risk of being deported , or having to pay extra job placement fees to employment brokers im scared of being terminated , she said the women tell her when she asks what they would do if asked to dangle outside a high window we dont have a choice

in early october , yurie adachi , a member of the japanese womens national hockey team , was preparing for a late night practice in tokyo when she met a visitor from new york adachi , who does not speak much english , smiled and offered a one word greeting riveters since junior high school , adachi has played with nana fujimoto , the japanese goaltender who competed in the inaugural season of the national womens hockey league in 2015 adachi kept track of fujimoto with the riveters , the leagues new york area franchise that now plays its home games in newark canada , united states are wonderful environments for hockey , adachi said through an interpreter , sitting in an aging rink where water from the roof leaked onto the ice the formation of the n w h l was a significant moment female hockey players in the united states would finally receive salaries as professionals the first season of operation was largely deemed a success , with paid attendance , the league said , of 1 , 000 per game so the n w h l s players were staggered when they were notified on thursday that their salaries would be cut to keep the league afloat this season according to the league , average attendance has dropped to 600 now , with the future of the n w h l uncertain , players are calling for more transparency from the league office theyve made that clear , that we need to rebuild some trust , dani rylan , the n w h l s commissioner , said on sunday during the riveters 4 0 win over the connecticut whale in newark i think trust is a two way street even though it was an unfortunate set of circumstances , it might end up realigning us and putting us back on that path together this season , player salaries ranged from 10 , 000 to 26 , 000 originally , some players said , they were told that salaries would be cut in half but multiple sources with direct knowledge of the leagues finances confirmed the actual pay cut would be 38 percent , the reduction softened by a recent 50 , 000 contribution by dunkin donuts meanwhile , many players are troubled because they have received little information about the leagues condition there are many things since their inception that have been a state secret , said brant feldman , managing partner of american group management , who has represented womens hockey players since 2006 if you operate something without a public image to it , i get it , but if youre operating a sports league of any sort , you need things done in a public facing manner n w h l players , in a statement released saturday through social media , called for an independent audit of the leagues finances , disclosure of the identity of investors and an explanation of why revenue has diminished so quickly the biggest thing is we need transparency right now , riveters forward bray ketchum said of the players demands , rylan said there are some things we will work with the players on there are some demands that we might not be able to , but i think that we are committed to working together on sunday , the leagues four teams the riveters , the whale , the boston pride and the buffalo beauts played for the first time since the salary cuts getting back on the ice had the effect of cooling emotions some players had contemplated walking away from the league rather than accept its new circumstances i can understand how much it hurts them and if they feel a bit betrayed and they cant trust this league right now , pride forward rachel llanes said the league has a players association , but there is no collective bargaining agreement christopher fusco , managing partner of the law firm callahan and fusco , has a background in sports and employment law he said he thought cutting salary without any negotiations was an unfair labor practice but without a collective bargaining agreement , he added , players do not have much recourse unless they are willing to walk out opt out clauses were added to player contracts this season , but few are likely to use them for the players , a 38 percent pay cut meant that game preparation was replaced by questions about paying rent , getting out of leases or becoming eligible for unemployment benefits the riveters have been discussing ways to raise money and pitch in to help teammates under serious financial strain riveters defender kiira dosdall and other players also thought the role of the players association should be reassessed on the management side , rylan said she had no doubt this season would be completed but added that attracting sponsors had been harder than expected before dunkin donuts agreed to give 50 , 000 toward salaries , players had received 400 dunkin donuts gift cards each season tom manchester , the companys vice president for field marketing in the united states , said it was possible the company would provide further salary contributions although the n h l has collaborated with the n w h l , there is no formal partnership between the two , or with the canadian womens hockey league , another womens professional league , which is in its 10th season in an email , an n h l spokesman said that the league was supportive of womens hockey but that it had always questioned the viability of two professional womens leagues and the sustainability of the current business model riveters forward janine weber said everyone understood the risks involved in joining a start up venture that was bound to encounter setbacks amid these flaws , the n w h l has had its groundbreaking moments , as well kelsey koelzer is believed to be the first african american taken first over all in a top tier american hockey league draft when the riveters selected her in june last month , harrison browne became the first openly transgender athlete in professional team sports in north america the league has also continually raised money for denna laing , the pride player who was badly injured last december during an outdoor game at gillette stadium in foxborough , mass the league , which this season has a 21 game schedule that runs from october to april , and rosters with up to 23 players , has provided a showcase for stars of the united states national team , effectively expanding the quadrennial spotlight of the olympics this has been enticing for international players like fujimoto who are looking to test their skills against the worlds best for american women who do not make the national team , hockey no longer has to end after college ashley johnston , the riveters captain , works as a mechanical engineer in albany and commutes to newark for practices and games johnston , who believed her career was over after graduating from union college in 2014 , has become a fan favorite as a players association representative , johnston was among the first to learn of the cuts , in her case through a conference call with the league on thursday she cried as she told her teammates the news some within the league believed the n w h l would have folded if the players sat out sundays games members of the pride and the riveters confirmed that their teams discussed not playing , but they chose instead to take the ice i definitely get it , johnston said of dissenting feelings toward the league that is an immediate reaction again , theres nothing easy about this situation llanes , who runs a side business as a coach and trainer , was upset with the salary cuts but saw a chance to change the league for the better im going to continue to look at this from a business standpoint , she said it happens everywhere in the real world its huge for us it gives us an opportunity to take a step in a different direction maybe we can ask a little bit more of ourselves to grow the game you see the u s national team for soccer , the amount they had to put in that was huge i dont think were anywhere near that yet the league is on break until dec 3 rylan said she was working through the thanksgiving holiday to find solutions its a crucial two weeks , johnston said things take time we might not necessarily have all the solutions , but we can have plans
apple iphones and other hand held devices have long had an airplane mode that shuts off wireless communications to prevent interference with the vast electronics systems that control modern aircraft now federal auto safety regulators want makers of these devices to add a driver mode to modify or block certain apps and features to keep a drivers attention on the road the initiative comes in the form of voluntary guidelines that will be issued wednesday by the national highway traffic safety administration they arrive amid a spike in traffic fatalities in the last two years and increasing concerns about the distractions posed by smartphones and the many apps that americans are using while behind the wheel your smartphone becomes so many different things that its not just a communication device , anthony foxx , secretary of the transportation department , said in an interview distraction is still a problem too many people are dying and being injured on our roadways the guidelines call on electronics manufacturers like apple and samsung to design future operating systems that limit the functionality and simplify interfaces while a vehicle is in motion and to develop technology to identify when the devices are being used by a driver while driving that would ensure the limits are placed on drivers and not other vehicle occupants the new guidelines from n h t s a are the agencys first recommendations specifically for portable devices that are used while driving the agency cannot force electronics companies to comply , but in the past it issued a set of guidelines for the navigation and entertainment systems built into cars by the manufacturer and carmakers adopted them , for the most part the airplane mode has been around about as long as smartphones the federal aviation administration had required turning off electronics before takeoff , but that rule was relaxed to allow the use of smartphones in flight as long as they had their communications shut off that led to airplane mode , which the iphone had in 2007 unfortunately , there are varying degrees of recognition in the tech community that when youre building an app or a smartphone , or contemplating usage , theres a strong possibility that someone could be trying to use that in the drivers seat , mr foxx said in the first six months of 2016 , highway deaths increased 10 4 percent , to 17 , 775 , according to preliminary data compiled by n h t s a at that rate , more than 100 people die every day in traffic accidents in 2015 , traffic fatalities rose 7 1 percent it was the largest annual percentage increase in traffic deaths in 50 years part of the increase in road deaths can be explained by the improving economy , higher employment numbers and low gasoline prices , all of which are causing americans to drive more than they did just a few years ago , during the depths of the recession in an interview in october , mark rosekind , the n h t s a administrator , said the increase in miles traveled was not enough by itself to explain this spike in crashes , injuries and deaths indeed , fatalities are occurring more frequently even when the increased travel is factored in mr rosekind and other safety experts think one factor is distracted driving in their view , distractions and the allure of smartphones , other devices and in car electronics have multiplied greatly since the dangers of distracted driving entered the national consciousness years ago at that time , the main phone related distracting activities were texting and talking on the phone now a wide range of apps and games also tempt drivers to reach for their phones niantic , the maker of pokmon go , recently modified the game to prevent it from operating while moving at speeds of more than about 10 miles per hour , a spokeswoman for the company said she declined to give further details on the modifications because niantic did not want users to find ways to get around them , she said the change was made after a spate of accidents was blamed on drivers who were playing the game while at the wheel i dont think pokmon go is something any driver should be using at any speed , mr foxx said makers of smartphones have added some technology that can be used to reduce the distraction of electronics apples iphones have a do not disturb feature that can block incoming calls and texts , and a silent mode that eliminates the chimes and other audio cues that signal the arrival of a new message or posting on facebook many carmakers now include apples carplay software in their newest models when an iphone is connected to the vehicle via carplay , the software limits the apps drivers can use to apple maps , the music service pandora and others that are used while traveling drivers can have the system read new texts aloud and dictate responses there are apps and other products that can be used to block incoming communications in cars one called drivesafe mode lets parents monitor if a childs phone is used for texting or email while in a vehicle the guidelines encourage smartphone makers to ensure their devices pair up with in car electronics so drivers can use their steering wheel buttons and in dash screen to control apps a driver mode would present a simplified interface and detect when the device is being used by a driver in this mode , a smartphone would block any video or distracting graphics eliminate scrolling text and prohibit keypad use for texting or email any social media content or content from web pages like news reports should be blocked as well , the guidelines say
san francisco mark zuckerberg , facebooks chief executive , has cultivated relationships with chinas leaders , including president xi jinping he has paid multiple visits to the country to meet its top internet executives he has made an effort to learn mandarin inside facebook , the work to enter china runs far deeper the social network has quietly developed software to suppress posts from appearing in peoples news feeds in specific geographic areas , according to three current and former facebook employees , who asked for anonymity because the tool is confidential the feature was created to help facebook get into china , a market where the social network has been blocked , these people said mr zuckerberg has supported and defended the effort , the people added facebook has restricted content in other countries before , such as pakistan , russia and turkey , in keeping with the typical practice of american internet companies that generally comply with government requests to block certain content after it is posted facebook blocked roughly 55 , 000 pieces of content in about 20 countries between july 2015 and december 2015 , for example but the new feature takes that a step further by preventing content from appearing in feeds in china in the first place facebook does not intend to suppress the posts itself instead , it would offer the software to enable a third party in this case , most likely a partner chinese company to monitor popular stories and topics that bubble up as users share them across the social network , the people said facebooks partner would then have full control to decide whether those posts should show up in users feeds the current and former facebook employees caution that the software is one of many ideas the company has discussed with respect to entering china and , like many experiments inside facebook , it may never see the light of day the feature , whose code is visible to engineers inside the company , has so far gone unused , and there is no indication that facebook has offered it to the authorities in china but the project illustrates the extent to which facebook may be willing to compromise one of its core mission statements , to make the world more open and connected , to gain access to a market of 1 4 billion chinese people even as facebook faces pressure to continue growing mr zuckerberg has often asked where the companys next billion users will come from china has been cordoned off to the social network since 2009 because of the governments strict rules around censorship of user content the suppression software has been contentious within facebook , which is separately grappling with what should or should not be shown to its users after the american presidential elections unexpected outcome spurred questions over fake news on the social network several employees who were working on the project have left facebook after expressing misgivings about it , according to the current and former employees a facebook spokeswoman said in a statement , we have long said that we are interested in china , and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country she added that the company had made no decisions on its approach into china facebooks tricky position underscores the difficulties that many american internet companies have had gaining access to china for years , companies like google and twitter have been blocked there for refusing to yield to the governments demands around censorship in 2010 , google said it was directing users of its search engine in china to its service in hong kong , because of censorship and intrusion from hackers other companies , like the professional social networking service linkedin , agreed to censor some content on their platforms in china the current climate for internet companies in china may not help facebook in august , the ride hailing giant uber gave up an expensive battle to crack the chinese market , selling its chinese business to an incumbent rival , didi chuxing more broadly , china has streamlined and tightened its controls over the internet under president xi , targeting influential social media celebrities and adding new reviews to popular online video sites still , some officials responsible for chinas tech policy have been willing to entertain the idea of facebooks operating in the country it would legitimize chinas strict style of internet governance , and if done according to official standards , would enable easy tracking of political opinions deemed problematic even so , resistance remains at the top levels of chinese leadership some analysts have said facebooks best option is to follow a model laid out by other internet companies and cooperate with a local company or investor finding a partner and potentially allowing it to own a majority stake in facebooks china operation would take the burden of censorship and surveillance off the silicon valley company it would also let facebook rely on a local companys government connections and experience to deal with the difficult task of communicating with beijing facebook and chinese officials have had intermittent talks in the last few years about the social networks entering the market , according to employees who were involved in the discussions , though the two sides have been unable to reach a compromise facebook currently sells advertising for some chinese businesses from its hong kong office among its customers are state media sites that act as the propaganda arm of the chinese government , and that operate official accounts where they post articles chinese citizens who wish to gain access to facebook must tunnel in using a technology known as a virtual private network , or vpn its unclear when the suppression tool originated , but the project picked up momentum in the last year , as engineers were plucked from other parts of facebook to work on the effort , the current and former employees said the project was led by vaughan smith , a vice president for mobile , corporate and business development at facebook , they said like mr zuckerberg , mr smith speaks a smattering of mandarin unveiling a new censorship tool in china could lead to more demands to suppress content from other countries the fake news problem , which has hit countries across the globe , has already led some governments to use the issue as an excuse to target sites of political rivals , or shut down social media sites altogether over the summer , several facebook employees who were working on the suppression tool left the company , the current and former employees said internally , so many employees asked about the project and its ambitions on an internal forum that , in july , it became a topic at one of facebooks weekly friday afternoon question and answer sessions mr zuckerberg was at the event and answered a question from the audience about the tool he told the gathering that facebooks china plans were nascent but he also struck a pragmatic tone about the future , according to employees who attended the session its better for facebook to be a part of enabling conversation , even if its not yet the

the proliferation of fake news online has roiled the american presidential election , politicians around the world and internet companies including facebook and google so what happens when the fake news juggernaut also sweeps up ordinary citizens \? cecilia kang saw the fallout up close when she interviewed james alefantis , owner of the comet ping pong pizzeria in washington mr alefantis and his employees have gotten caught up in a storm of fake news recently a barrage of false articles on social media and fake news sites said their pizzeria was a front for a child trafficking ring led by hillary clinton and her campaign chief , john d podesta the stories collected under the hashtag pizzagate have surprised mr alefantis he was a supporter of mrs clintons and has prominent democratic friends in washington , but has never met the former democratic presidential candidate , nor peddled children nor abused them the repercussions have been far reaching mr alefantis , his friends and employees are now dealing with a flood of nasty comments on social media , threatening phone calls and even visits to their restaurant from people who say they believe the fake news articles mr alefantis has gotten in touch with the federal bureau of investigation , the local police and many social media companies to try to take down the fake items he has had little success its endless , mr alefantis said of the strange digital turn his life has taken
kara waite , an english teacher at bunker hill community college in charlestown , mass , made a rule for herself for every political rant she posts on facebook , she must pick up the phone and call a legislator its kind of a swear jar for political action , ms waite said recently ms waite , who volunteers for liberal causes and who created a widely shared document last week to teach others her methods , figures that a phone ringing off the hook is more difficult for a lawmaker to ignore than a flooded inbox activists of all political stripes recommend calling legislators , not just emailing and certainly not just venting on social media several lawmakers , along with those who work for them , said in interviews that ms waite is right a phone call from a constituent can , indeed , hold more weight than an email , and far outweighs a facebook post or a tweet to understand why , it helps to know what happens when someone answers the phone at a legislators office emily ellsworth , whose jobs have included answering phones in the district offices of two republican representatives from utah jason chaffetz , from 2009 to 2012 and chris stewart from 2013 to 2014 said the way your points reach a lawmaker depends on how many calls the office is getting at the time and how you present your story in some cases , its a simple process when a caller offered an opinion , staff members would write the comments down in a spreadsheet , compile them each month and present reports to top officials , she said if the lawmaker had already put out a statement on the issue , the staff member would read it to the caller , she said but a large volume of calls on an issue could bring an office to a halt , sometimes spurring the legislator to put out a statement on his or her position , ms ellsworth said she recommended the tactic in a series of tweets shared thousands of times it brings a legislative issue right to the top of the mind of a member , she said it makes it impossible to ignore for the whole staff you dont get a whole lot else done when her branch in utah received a lot of calls , she contacted the washington office and coordinated the messaging , involving the communications director , the legislative director or the chief of staff , ms ellsworth said while scripts found on the internet can be useful for people uncomfortable talking on the phone , she suggested making the phone calls as personal as possible in some cases , if she was moved by a call , she would pass on the comments to her district director , she said what representatives and staffers want to hear is the individual impact of your individual story , she said i couldnt listen to peoples stories for six to eight hours a day and not be profoundly impacted by them a new york state senator , phil boyle , a republican , said that one of his staff members would contact him after a constituent called his office , and that he would try to call everyone back thats a perk exclusive to those who call in , since he sometimes gets more than 300 emails per day , he said i couldnt possibly do that for emails , mr boyle said when its a subject in which he lacks expertise , he said , the calls have made a difference in one case , several retired law enforcement officers called him about a gun control law that was enacted in 2013 , worried that they would have to give up their service revolvers senator boyle , who said he doesnt use firearms much , was unaware of that possibility and proposed an amendment to grant them an exception gov andrew m cuomo granted the exception seven months after the law was passed most calls can be handled by staff members , said brian kolb , the republican minority leader in the new york state assembly many callers just want to express an opinion and dont even offer a name , he said in other cases , callers who want to talk out an issue more fully could be directed to a staff member who has expertise in the area , said state senator liz krueger , a democrat in new york ms waite , who has had a calendar reminder for each monday morning alerting her to call party leadership , said that first time callers often fear they will be quizzed or interrogated , but that they generally just need to offer their opinion and basic personal information , like name and city she implored people to be courteous , since the staff members might be getting many calls communicate in a way that someone cant ignore , ms waite said

seoul , south korea president park geun hye on tuesday approved a military intelligence sharing pact with japan aimed at countering the north korean threat , a move that angered south korean opposition parties , which want to impeach ms park over a corruption scandal the united states , an ally of both south korea and japan , has pressed them to increase military cooperation so the three countries can more effectively monitor and confront threats from the north , whose development of nuclear arms and missiles has been accelerating currently , japan and south korea use washington as an intermediary when sharing intelligence on north korea but south koreans are wary of cooperating too closely with japan , which ruled korea as a colony for 35 years until the end of world war ii many of the protesters who have been demanding that ms park resign over the corruption scandal have also insisted that she cancel the negotiations with japan ms park has been accused of conspiring with a friend , choi soon sil , to extort millions from big businesses her polling numbers have reached record lows , and huge crowds have gathered in seoul , the capital , and other major cities to demand that ms park step down or face impeachment prosecutors further undermined ms park on sunday by identifying her as a criminal accomplice while indicting ms choi on extortion charges as a sitting president , ms park cannot be indicted since the scandal engulfed her administration , ms park has made moves to assert her leadership , such as making high profile government appointments critics have charged that the talks with japan were another attempt to establish her authority and rally her conservative supporters , who favor the deal her government has denied this , saying that the pact was needed to counter the threat from pyongyang the main opposition democratic party said tuesday that ms park would be remembered as a traitorous president because of the deal with japan we cannot restrain our anger at president parks arrogance , the party said in a statement she is not satisfied with parlaying the government through her unprecedented scandal now she is trying to ruin diplomacy and national security too yoshihide suga , the japanese chief cabinet secretary , said tuesday at a news conference in tokyo that the government wanted to work for an early signing of the agreement but did not comment further , the kyodo news agency reported many south koreans harbor strong resentment over japans harsh colonial rule , and any moves by japan to expand its military role in the region stir painful associations here in 2012 , a similar intelligence sharing deal with japan was put on hold at the last minute after a domestic backlash in south korea the governments sudden announcement that the talks would resume came a month ago , after the scandal involving ms choi had erupted the pact , which was approved earlier tuesday by ms parks cabinet , will take effect at a signing ceremony wednesday morning , officials said
throughout this bitter election campaign , liberal celebrities like lady gaga , jennifer lawrence , lena dunham and lin manuel miranda used their powerful media platforms to sing hillary clintons praises now theyve invited their online followers to join them in processing her loss and protesting the impending administration of donald j trump i want to live in a countryofkindness where lovetrumpshate , lady gaga wrote on twitter the day after the election she added a photo of herself at a protest outside trump tower in manhattan , where she had climbed onto a truck in a strapless black jumpsuit and raised a pro clinton sign while the angry tweets , therapeutic instagram testimonials and fiery speeches may comfort their fans , these left leaning celebrities are also inadvertently energizing the opposition conservative news outlets most notably breitbart news network , the right wing populist enclave are perfecting the art of sapping democratic stars name recognition and repurposing their words and actions into pro trump material the enormous reach that celebrities enjoy , and the privileged bubble they live in , is wielded against them here , refashioned as evidence of the outsize control that the rich and famous have over regular americans this new battle in the culture wars is being waged not by bombastic , big name right wing commentators like rush limbaugh , but by nimble , often nameless online aggregators who quickly churn through popular culture and throw the most evocative stories to their readers , often without much commentary all it takes is a pointed headline , an unflattering photo and a few well chosen \( and real \) quotes like this lady gaga protests on sanitation truck outside trump tower , read breitbarts headline for its article on her tweet america is divided by its politics , its media , and as this election made even clearer , by its celebrity influencers in the weeks before the election , the avengers director joss whedon booted up his own online public service announcement factory , save the day , and recruited stars like robert downey jr , don cheadle and scarlett johansson to churn out web videos for mrs clinton katy perry , america ferrera , lebron james and beyonc joined democratic candidate at rallies and when vice president elect mike pence caught a performance of the broadway hit hamilton on friday , one of the shows stars addressed him on behalf of the diverse america who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us no offense to paris hilton and pat boone , but the president elect doesnt have the biggest stars on his side instead , breitbart mostly uses its culture pages to aim spitballs at hollywood lefties as part of its coverage of what it calls big hollywood , the glamour of celebrities becomes grist for the sites overarching narrative about the corrosive influence of the cultural elite the image ms dunham posted to instagram of a restorative trip to sedona , ariz , may have played as soothingly aspirational for an audience concentrated with young , coastal women , but to breitbarts demo , under the headline grieving lena dunham seeks answers in arizona wilderness after trump win , it looks like a damning shot of a celebrity who decided to jet into a red state for a quirky vacation retreat as the hamilton controversy raged , prodded by mr trumps demand that the cast apologize to mr pence , breitbart pointedly reminded readers of the private fund raiser mr miranda hosted for mrs clinton during the campaign , where ticket prices ranged from 2 , 700 to 100 , 000 and just like that , a celebrity speaking out against mr trump becomes a point in his defense breitbarts postelection hollywood coverage appears largely to be a cool cataloging of aggrieved celebrities , including rick ross \( who just dropped a video for the song free enterprise , which includes a lyric that makes reference to assassinating mr trump \) beneath the surface of these articles , though , is subtle signaling at work a piece about a postelection vice essay by jennifer lawrence , in which she railed against the barriers still facing women in the workplace , includes an underhanded accolade about her she was recently named the highest paid actress in hollywood for the second straight year this recent headline depressed robert de niro trump election makes me feel like i did after 9 11 packs a one two punch , pairing the image of a pathetic , weepy liberal with a flip attitude toward terrorism breitbarts article on the hamilton dust up , titled tolerance hamilton cast lectures mike pence from broadway stage , is threaded with buzzwords that cast liberals as elite , pedantic hypocrites while breitbart produces its share of original content it ran an essay by ann coulter ridiculing whining celebrities last week most of the conservative media outlets doing this work are scrappy , spammy and surprisingly banal on regated , a bare bones conservative aggregator , the hamilton incident was inflated into a full blown class war just like clockwork , the rich elitist liberals come out to mock the poor hamilton cast members along with other liberals took to twitter to mock and bully the less fortunate people in america but much of the text generated by these sites is barely politicized the conservative online outlet patriotic folks recently aggregated quotes from a lady gaga essay , published in harpers bazaar , about how she was depressed and hurt about mr trumps remarks about women , and worked in just a whiff of commentary women are fighting for their lives because of the leaked access hollywood tape where donald trump makes lewd comments , or at least thats what lady gaga thinks highlighting words like hurt and depressed works like a low frequency conservative dog whistle , signaling to readers who want to revel in liberals pain or ridicule them as emotional children postelection , breitbart may appear little different from any celebrity news aggregator but the sites greater political context , as a breeding ground for extremists , adds another layer breitbart is the site that boosted stephen k bannon to a thought leader \( once the sites executive chairman , he took a leave of absence to steer mr trumps campaign and now has a top white house position \) with that in mind , an article calling attention to ms dunhams jewish faith feels like a bone thrown to the sites white nationalist readers and the catalog of slighted celebrities starts to read like something of a star studded enemies list the real ideological action is undertaken by the audience , whose members read between the lines of these culture pieces and then scribble in the margins breitbarts two posts on ms dunham have amassed more than 10 , 000 comments , including this insight lena was an awesome trump vote recruiter meanwhile , the muted patriotic folks piece on lady gaga soon migrated to a pro trump facebook page that reaches millions , make america great today , which shared it with a baiting line , more white women voted for donald j trump than hillary clinton lefty celebrities have long been preaching to the choir , but they are increasingly galvanizing the other side when their chatter is rerouted into an online conservative echo chamber a study last year by the bowling green state university professors david jackson and melissa miller found that celebrity political statements were highly polarizing to a sample set of ohio voters , and that no celebrity not trace adkins , not ted nugent , not even oprah was likely to inspire net positive votes for his or her candidate of choice these right wing aggregators make sure that any leftist celebritys political reach will be neutralized by a backlash from people who dont idolize and agree with them none of that is likely to stop celebrities from using their own soapboxes to promote their politics but they would be smart to consider how their words will play on other platforms , too
thanksgiving can be stressful extended family members often disagree on everything from who is hosting the dinner to what will be on the menu , and , for young people , there are the inevitable questions involving grades , relationships and future plans this year , the recent election has added another layer of stress for many families and friends who are celebrating the holiday , but not celebrating a common political viewpoint is it possible to have meaningful conversations and to connect with family and friends who widely disagree \? the times has some suggestions how could you \? 19 questions to ask loved ones who voted the other way asks the article then suggests 19 questions you can use to go deeper , including students read all the questions , then tell us do you ever talk about politics with your family and friends \? do these conversations ever get awkward or uncomfortable \? why \? are politics and the recent election likely to come up during your thanksgiving celebrations \? if yes , do you think it will be stressful \? why \? can you see yourself using the 19 question format this holiday season \? would you like to have this conversation with anyone in particular \? listen to the podcast at the end of the article in which one trump voter and one clinton voter used this guide to facilitate conversation do you think aaron and kyle handled themselves well during the conversation \? what surprised you about their discussion \? kyle admitted that social media postings made it easier to avoid a real conversation with aaron over the years , and said i realize now that was wrong open dialogue is obviously what brings people together do you think aaron and kyle would have had the same conversation without the help of the guiding questions \? in your opinion , what did they do especially well during their conversation \? let us know what you think in the comments section
maybe i shouldnt have been surprised that donald trump could be elected president , but i was i live in brooklyn and work in manhattan , two of the most liberal places in the country but even online , i wasnt seeing many signs of support for him how did that blindness occur \? social media is my portal into the rest of the world my periscope into the communities next to my community , into how the rest of the world thinks and feels and it completely failed me in hindsight , that failure makes sense ive spent nearly 10 years coaching facebook and instagram and twitter on what kinds of news and photos i dont want to see , and they all behaved accordingly each time i liked an article , or clicked on a link , or hid another , the algorithms that curate my streams took notice and showed me only what they thought i wanted to see that meant i didnt realize that most of my family members , who live in rural virginia , were voicing their support for trump online , and i didnt see any of the pro trump memes that were in heavy circulation before the election i never saw a trump hat or a sign or a shirt in my feeds , and the only election day selfies i saw were of people declaring their support for hillary clinton to be clear , im not blaming the algorithms for what i assume to be their role in augmenting my worldview they did exactly what i told them to do , blocking out racist , misogynist and anti immigrant comments , hiding anyone who didnt support black lives matter , all with such deftness that i had no idea that a candidate who ran a campaign on exactly those values had gained enough popularity to win the election but considering that more than 40 percent of our countrys population consumes news on facebook , finding alternative perspectives shouldnt have been that hard i knew about eli parisers theory on filter bubbles , or the idea that online personalization distorts the type of information we see , and even so , i still chose to let algorithms shape how i perceive the world everything i could want to see is available at my fingertips , and yet i didnt look in april , mark zuckerberg , chief executive of facebook , addressed a room of developers about the importance of his social network facebook , he said , has the power to bring people together who might otherwise never have the chance to meet the internet has enabled all of us to access and share more ideas and information than ever before , he said weve gone from a world of isolated communities to one global community , and we are all better off for it but thats not what has happened zuckerbergs idealism is belied by his desire to duck responsibility for mediating the content of his site on facebook , the political divide has only been entrenched further its the buzzfeed dress debate , only for our entire lives we are two countries , one that sees blue and black and the other that sees white and gold the internet once offered outlets we could use to understand one another but they are rapidly disappearing most social media like facebook and instagram is curated by software built to manage the high influx of information flowing into it , but there have still been a few islands of digital wilderness , a galpagos of sorts , where culture thrived untouched they included vine \( whose closure was announced in october \) and snapchat , and even tumblr , which were homes for marginalized ideas , theories and lifestyles the video sharing app vine was the first place i got a glimpse of cultures beyond my own , including those of the middle east i was able to see how some women there wanted us to see them prospering , aware a young woman living in saudi arabia who goes by the name amy roko used vine to show clips of herself living her life her version of normalcy at the mall , goofing off at home in her most viral video , she stares into the camera , her face covered in a niqab , save for her perfectly outlined eyes expletive called me ugly , she snaps i said , expletive where \? the emphasis on the last word becomes the punch line as she whips off one niqab to reveal a second underneath i was thrilled to realize that women living there could have a sense of humor similar to my own vine was born as an app and intended to be a social community but vine links could be shared independent of the network , and people did so with abandon , meaning that vines appeared scattershot around the web , defying the sorting mechanism of streams and feeds they could land on your screen via text message , direct message , email rokos vine was a riff on one originally posted by a young black american named brionna london , who was miffed that someone thought she needed makeup to be pretty you can draw a straight line from brown women in saudi arabia to black women in america , a marvel unto itself , a window into the way the internet flattens space and time a vivid example of its fulfilling its promise to bridge divides at vines peak , it had more than 200 million monthly users who watched videos billions of times , and it excelled at showing these sorts of commonalities that , say , black kids in new orleans lived and looked a lot like white kids in florida \( at the very least , they shared a similar humor and taste in music , which gave me hope that they would share a sense of humanity as well \) and yet twitter , which owns vine and is struggling to turn a profit while keeping its main service appealing to advertisers , could seemingly no longer afford to keep the video feature \( which reportedly costs millions a month to maintain \) afloat following news about twitters decision to close the service , there were rumors that outside companies made inquiries about purchasing vines remains but its most likely too late to salvage the community there in its earlier days , snapchat offered its own version of cultural exchange the app had an incredible series on city life that gave users direct windows into different worlds people submitted short video diaries about life in their cities , which the company compiled into a single video , viewable by anyone using the app i remember feeling delighted watching people in istanbul and so paulo showing off their routines and customs but the company is now prioritizing live stories , which feature more mainstream events like the super bowl and music festivals the effect is still fascinating , but less intimate snapchat seems to be betting that people are more interested in the familiar the future of tumblr , the blogging platform whose endless warren of rabbit holes about gender theory , critical feminist thought and identity politics is unlike any other on the internet , is the most uncertain yahoo , its parent company , succumbed to financial struggles and has announced plans to be acquired by verizon , raising questions about the future of its properties what were seeing with snapchat , tumblr and vine reflects a larger shift in the social media economy user generated content , by and large , is not lucrative at a scale that satisfies investors , and as a result , most social media companies are changing direction toward other revenue streams one of the more significant shifts is the move into social messaging semiprivate messaging applications group text threads and applications like whatsapp \( which is owned by facebook \) and slack have grown in popularity as people move away from public arenas for conversation , a shift caused in part by spikes in unchecked harassment on major social networks new features are introduced daily , it seems , to make messaging with your friends more fun the latest version of the iphones software includes the ability to make messages explode with confetti whatsapp now offers the ability to tag people in messages , as you might tag them in a photograph online these changes have probably been spurred by messaging applications overseas , which used similar features to attract and retain customers \( line , a japanese company that built an addictive messaging app with 220 million monthly users worldwide , had one of the biggest initial public offerings 1 1 billion earlier this year \) these new messaging features work to bind private groups tighter together , by making it more fun to talk to one another than to engage with the world at large what happens when we would rather look inward \? i have found something of an answer in a short story called the great silence , by ted chiang , about humankinds search for signs of alien life the story is narrated by a parrot in arecibo , puerto rico , home to one of the largest radio telescopes in the world their desire to make a connection is so strong that theyve created an ear capable of hearing across the universe , the creature begins but i and my fellow parrots are right here why arent they interested in listening to our voices \? the paradox is not to be missed we are more interested in locating alien species than understanding the humanity among the species we already live with the story ends on a somber note human activity has brought my kind to the brink of extinction , the narrator explains they didnt do it maliciously they just werent paying attention chiangs lesson hits hard in this new political and cultural moment social media seemed to promise a way to better connect with people instead it seems to have made it easier to tune out the people we dont agree with but if we cant pay attention to one another , we might as well not live on the same planet at all
in 2005 , tim obrien , then a financial reporter at the new york times , published the book trumpnation the art of being the donald o'brien talked to sources with an up close view of donald j trumps finances , who concluded that the real estate developers net worth was 150 million to 250 million , rather than the 2 billion to 5 billion trump had variously claimed trump , who had courted obrien by taking him for rides in his ferrari and private jet , sued obrien for libel in new jersey in 2006 trump called obrien a wack job on the today show while , obrien says , continuing to curry favor with him privately obriens publisher , warner books , was also named in the suit and hired top lawyers who put trump through an unsparing two day deposition asked about his finances , trump was caught lying or exaggerating 30 times he thought hed get a friendly judge , and we would roll over , says obrien , who is now the executive editor of bloomberg view we didnt the case went through four judges and was dismissed in 2009 trumps suit against obrien is one of seven forays president elect trump and his companies have made as libel plaintiffs he won only once , when a defendant failed to appear but the standard measure defending his reputation and achieving victory in court isnt how trump says he thinks about his investment i spent a couple of bucks on legal fees , and they spent a whole lot more , he told the washington post in march about the hefty sum he spent on the case against obrien i did it to make his life miserable , which im happy about trump was wrong warner books spent less than he did , and obrien paid nothing but that doesnt make trumps central idea any less jarring that libel law can be a tool of revenge its disconcerting for a superrich \( if maybe not as rich as he says \) plaintiff to treat the legal system as a weapon to be deployed against critics once installed in the white house , trump will have a wider array of tools at his disposal , and his record suggests that , more than his predecessors , he will try to use the press and also control and subdue it as a candidate , trump blustered vaguely that he wanted to open up our libel laws i asked his spokeswoman , hope hicks , by email what he meant by that , but she didnt answer the question \( or others i posed \) its not within the presidents direct powers to change the rules for libel suits but our legal safeguards for writers and publishers arent foolproof in the last few years , trump has been joined by at least two billionaires who are determined to exploit cracks in the wall of defense around the press the members of this club are innovators they have sued or funded suits to defend reputations or protect privacy but an underlying aim appears to be to punish critics like obrien or even destroy entire media outlets this kind of manipulation of the law is unfolding at a keen moment of weakness for the press , which has already been buffeted by falling revenue and mounting public disaffection only 40 percent of the public the lowest rate since at least the 1990s trusts the media to report the news fully , accurately and fairly , according to a gallup survey conducted in september 2015 this mistrust has been growing for a long time , but it was stoked by trump during the campaign he called the reporters who covered him scum and whipped up yelling and booing crowds there is no consensus among his supporters that the press should hold those in power accountable a recent pew survey found that only half of trump backers agreed that it was important in a strong democracy that news organizations are free to criticize political leaders media outlets have won many cases by persuading a judge to dismiss them but since 2010 , they have succeeded in only 39 percent of the libel and privacy suits that have gone to trial , a dip from 52 percent in the previous decade , according to the media law resource center the median damage award has increased fivefold since the 1980s , to 1 1 million the figure includes three big verdicts over the last eight months , against gawker , rolling stone and the news observer in raleigh , n c these include run of the mill libel suits , and its too early to say that the sky is falling on the press but its darkening the high bar for winning a libel case in the united states was set in 1964 , when the supreme court decided new york times v sullivan in that case , widely hailed as one of the courts strongest stands for free speech , l b sullivan , a city commissioner who supervised the police in montgomery , ala , sued the times over an ad in the newspaper signed by 100 civil rights supporters the ad turned out to include minor factual errors sullivan said its depiction of how the montgomery police responded to civil rights protests made him look bad under the rules at the time , a libel plaintiff was entitled to victory if he could show that the content that harmed his reputation was false the alabama jury agreed with sullivan on that point and awarded him 500 , 000 in damages \( the equivalent of about 4 million today \) with similar cases pending , the times pulled its reporters out of alabama but when the newspaper appealed to the supreme court , the justices threw out the sullivan verdict and set a far stiffer standard for proving libel the court wrote that a public figure has to prove that a false and damaging statement about him was published with actual malice , translated as knowing or reckless disregard for the truth by the 1980s , the number of libel suits decreased , and if suits did go to trial , they frequently ended in defeat for the plaintiff in two examples from that era , gen william westmoreland sued cbs , and ariel sharon , the israeli defense minister , sued time magazine neither man won damages those outcomes , as well as losses in other high profile cases , were a major deterrent for plaintiffs and their lawyers , says george freeman , executive director of the media resource law center \( and formerly a lawyer for the new york times \) superrich plaintiffs , however , arent subject to the same market forces they can treat suing the press as an investment , with the payoff being , at a minimum , the expense and time required for the other side to produce documents and sit for depositions in february 2012 , the magazine mother jones published a story about the idaho billionaire frank vandersloot , a major donor to a super pac that supported the republican presidential candidate , mitt romney in 1999 , in response to a documentary , he sponsored billboards that asked , should public television promote the homosexual lifestyle to your children \? the magazine wrote that vandersloot outed a gay reporter , peter zuckerman , and bashed zuckerman and his reporting after he helped break a story in 2005 about a history of pedophilia by a boy scouts camp counselor in idaho falls the portrayal of vandersloot was based partly on several ads that he placed in the idaho falls post register vandersloot was upset at the storys implications for the boy scouts , and the ads called zuckerman a homosexual and attacked him for having a personal ax to grind vandersloot sued mother jones for libel over the article they wanted to give me a public beating because i made a sizable donation to mitt romney , he told me vandersloot , who owns an online health shopping club , also said the mother jones article cost him customers over three years of proceedings , which included turning over internal emails , mother jones racked up about 2 5 million in legal fees insurance didnt cover the whole cost the suit was a huge drain on us , clara jeffery , editor in chief of the magazine , told me were still digging our way out judge darla williamson finally threw out vandersloots suit in october 2015 , finding that mother joness statements about him were either substantially true or opinions protected by the first amendment but williamson took the unusual step of including a section in her opinion partially supporting his underlying complaint , accusing the magazine of mudslinging rather than recognizing its approach as squarely within the tradition of investigative journalism despite his defeat , vandersloot declared himself absolutely vindicated and announced that he was creating a guardian of true liberty fund to aid other people who want to sue the liberal press the fund has grown to between 1 million and 2 million , he told me , with five times that amount pledged , so that as soon as something hits we think is worth it , we can go after it it was another billionaire , peter thiel , who realized the full potential of bankrolling other peoples lawsuits thiel , an influential figure in silicon valley who was a founder of paypal and sits on the board of facebook , is now an adviser to donald trump thiel and other silicon valley executives were regular targets of gawkers aggressive reporting and mockery in 2007 , the site ran an article titled peter thiel is totally gay , people thiel didnt sue on his own behalf but he secretly paid a hollywood lawyer , charles harder , at least 10 million to sue gawker on behalf of a suite of plaintiffs neither thiel or harder will say how many suits thiel funded , but harder has filed at least five against the website and its writers and editors \( he also represents melania trump in a 150 million suit in the united states against the british tabloid the daily mail and a maryland blogger for calling her an escort \) when thiels role was revealed by forbes magazine , thiel said his goal was less about revenge and more about specific deterrence asked in october about his secrecy , thiel said , transparency would have turned it into this very different narrative that its this billionaire trying to squash the first amendment \( he declined to comment for this article \) last march , while thiels role remained hidden , one of the suits he funded went to trial in florida the plaintiff , the aging wrestler entertainer hulk hogan , sued gawker for violating his privacy by publishing a brief video clip in october 2012 that showed him having sex hogan , whose real name is terry g bollea , testified that he was emotionally devastated yet when he learned of the existence of the sex tape seven months earlier , hogan appeared on tmz live , joking about having sex with several brunettes its common for judges to dismiss privacy suits when the plaintiff has encouraged news interest in a preliminary ruling before trial , the florida court of appeals said that gawker posted the sex tape as part of an ongoing public discussion , citing hogans appearance on tmz and later on the howard stern show but judge pamela campbell , who presided over the trial , instructed the jury to decide for itself whether the publication of the sex tape was highly offensive to a reasonable person and not of legitimate concern to the public the jury seemed to channel the publics low regard for the press when they awarded hogan 140 million in damages it just wasnt about punishment of these individuals and gawker , one juror told abc after the trial you had to do it enough where it makes an example in society and other media organizations within two months , gawkers parent company declared bankruptcy gawker was sold and ceased publication in the half century since new york times v sullivan , the united states has often held itself up to the world as a beacon for the free press american libel law , the theory goes , protects writers and publishers better than the laws of countries like britain , where its easier to win a libel judgment yet giant jury awards dont topple publications in the united kingdom the country has an unofficial damages cap of about 250 , 000 \( plus legal fees \) british publishers can , in essence , treat compensating someone whose reputation they have harmed as a cost of doing business and its less risky for them to apologize for a story that turns out to be wrong there are limits on damages for malpractice suits against doctors , says robert post , dean of the yale law school why not for journalists \? its tempting to treat gawkers demise as unique or deserved but thats a false form of reassurance , a former editor of the site , tom scocca , argued in august every publication is prepared to absorb the damage when it makes a mistake , he wrote on gawker what thiels covert campaign against gawker did was to invisibly change the terms of the risk calculation the lesson , scocca told his readers , is that you live in a country where a billionaire can put a publication out of business whats new here are two forces squeezing journalism like pincers the first is a figure like thiel , willing to place bets on lawsuit after lawsuit until he hits on a winning combination of facts , judge and jury the second is the publics animosity toward the press , now fueled by the soon to be president juries tend to reflect public sentiment and have recently penalized not just an irreverent new media site like gawker , but also a newspaper doing investigative work in september , the news observer , which is more than 100 years old , went to trial over a libel claim brought by a former state ballistics agent in north carolina , who sued regarding two articles from 2010 that included suspicions , by independent firearms experts , that she had falsified evidence to help prosecutors win a murder trial the agent said that the suspicions were untrue and that she was effectively being accused of a crime the news observer stands by its reporting but the jury found against the paper and ordered it to pay about 9 million the amount exceeded the states cap on damages and is likely to be lowered to 6 million the news observer plans to appeal in the week before the election , seth stevenson , a writer for slate , followed the trump campaign , which meant sitting in the pen where reporters were confined at rallies he realized that the pens function was to turn the press into a prop behold , he imagined trump saying to his fans ive rounded up a passel of those elites you detest and ive caged them for you ! trump has continued to treat the press as a prop , or a punching bag , since his election the weekend after his victory , he railed against the new york times on twitter for its poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the trump phenomena trump thrives on media attention , but its also clear that as the press sinks in the publics estimation , any tough coverage of him will come to seem less credible the media also serves as an all purpose receptacle for blame asked on 60 minutes why african americans , immigrants and muslims have expressed fear of his presidency , trump didnt reckon with any of his own statements he said , i think its built up by the press whatever trumps feelings about the media , new york times v sullivan will surely survive his presidency the case is revered , and in the last several years , the supreme court has moved to expand , not contract , the reach of the first amendment and states have taken steps , too to prevent people from using the courts , and the discovery process , to silence or retaliate against their critics , 28 states and the district of columbia have enacted anti slapp laws the acronym stands for strategic lawsuit against public participation its possible , however , that trump could appoint judges who would find a way around the usual press protections more immediately , he could ask his justice department to prosecute journalists who report leaks from his administration \( president obamas justice department investigated reporters , but didnt charge them \) its also possible that the press will be a meeker watchdog because of subtler changes that are harder to track as the head of the executive branch , the president exerts a great deal of control over access to information federal agencies have power to shape the state of the union they also describe it for us by producing reams of facts and statistics , which in turn shape our assessment of our elected leaders trump could hire people who cancel funding for government reports or research that doesnt serve his interests , or who suppress findings the administration doesnt like the new president will be a man who constantly accuses the media of getting things wrong but routinely misrepresents and twists facts himself their single goal will be to burnish their reputation , tim obrien predicts of the trump administration there are signs , too , of new efforts to harness the law to the cause of cowing the press trumps choice for chief adviser , stephen bannon , ran the alt right breitbart news network before joining trumps campaign last summer breitbart announced last week that it was preparing a multimillion dollar lawsuit against a major media company for calling breitbart a white nationalist website even if breitbart is bluffing , the threat will discourage other news outlets from using that term to describe it , and that will in turn help breitbart and bannon seem more acceptable to the mainstream trump was right about one thing you dont have to win every case to advance in the larger legal war
istanbul the turkish government on tuesday expanded its crackdown on political opponents , dismissing an additional 15 , 000 civil servants from their jobs and shutting down 375 organizations , including nine more news outlets more than 100 , 000 public workers , including police officers , teachers , soldiers and others , had already been fired for what the authorities said were connections to a failed coup on july 15 or to terrorists the new wave of dismissals came on a morning when the european parliament was scheduled to debate freezing accession talks for turkey to join the european union it was one of several recent indicators that the government of president recep tayyip erdogan was abandoning hope of success in that process , which has dragged on for 11 years mr erdogan has been defiant , saying it was time that the european union made up its mind on turkeys membership , and threatening to hold a nationwide referendum on whether to continue the talks a recent european commission report expressed concern that turkeys worsening record on human rights and press freedom was making accession increasingly difficult the turkish president has advocated bringing back the death penalty , which is banned in european union countries as a condition of membership , and he has ordered a thorough crackdown on the countrys news media , with 129 outlets now closed human rights advocates have also been alarmed by a measure , favored by mr erdogans justice and development party , to declare an amnesty for an estimated 3 , 000 to 4 , 000 men convicted of child abuse and rape , provided they have married their victims the measure , which applies to what it calls consensual cases of child marriage , was scheduled to be debated on tuesday in the turkish parliament , but it was instead returned to committee , forestalling an immediate vote the legislation has infuriated womens groups in turkey and has drawn criticism from united nations agencies on monday , a delegation of socialist members of the european parliament was rebuffed in its attempt to visit selahattin demirtas , the jailed leader of turkeys leading pro kurdish opposition party , the peoples democratic party , at the prison where he has been held in edirne , in the countrys northwest mr demirtas is among 10 members of parliament from that party who have been detained this month over alleged connections with the outlawed kurdistan workers party , known by the initials p k k , which the government considers a terrorist organization the government has also deemed followers of the exiled cleric fethullah gulen to be terrorists , blaming them for the attempted coup a government decree on tuesday said that 375 groups from various cities had been ordered shut down for what it said were links with terrorists , along with nine news outlets all the financial assets and property of those organizations were to be seized by the treasury the decree said that more than 15 , 000 public employees were to be dismissed , including 338 soldiers , 404 military police officers and more than 7 , 500 police officers all of their passports were canceled , it added the decree stated that all of them were related , belonging to or in contact with terror organizations and structures that are considered by the national security council as acting against national security the decree was issued under emergency powers granted to mr erdogans government by parliament after the failed coup parliament extended those powers on oct 11 for an additional three months members of the european parliament have been strongly critical of turkeys crackdown on opponents and on the news media after debating the issue in strasbourg , france , on tuesday , they are expected to vote on thursday to put a temporary halt to accession talks with turkey the vote is designed to ratchet up pressure on turkey to curtail its repressive tactics although the resolution already has the backing of the main political groups in the european parliament , the vote will not be binding because of the european unions complicated decision making procedures any decision to freeze the talks must be made by other branches of the union the european commission , the blocs executive body , or one third of european union member states would first need to make a formal proposal to do so , and a majority of the member states would have to vote in favor of the move for it to pass many of the turkish organizations shut down on tuesday were charities or professional bodies , such as a nationwide group called our agenda is kids , based in the capital , ankara the endoscopy and laparoscopy training association and the pancreatic islet cell research association some of the organizations had connections to leftist groups or to followers of mr gulen , but others seemed to have no political links at all
beijing a single spark can start a prairie fire , mao zedong said and being accused of a bigoted outburst can start a wildfire on the internet in china , as a manager for daimler , the german automaker , has learned to his regret daimler greater china said it had removed a manager after a regrettable matter the emailed statement from the company , a unit of daimler , which makes mercedes benz cars and other prestigious vehicles , did not identify the manager or say exactly what he had done but the chinese news media and internet users have been much blunter they accused rainer grtner , the president and chief executive of daimler trucks and buses \( china \) , of insulting the chinese people on sunday during a squabble with a driver over a parking spot on the outskirts of beijing the controversy took off this week after a user of weibo , a popular chinese microblog service , accused mr grtner of insulting chinese people after a standoff over the parking spot in shunyi , a district in northeast beijing where many middle class foreigners and chinese live in townhouse communities that rub shoulders with poorer residents who used to be farmers i am in china one year already , mr grtner told the chinese motorist in english , according to the account , which the beijing news said came from a friend of the motorist it said mr grtner went on to say , the first thing i learned here is and then used a crude insult to describe all you chinese the account also said mr grtner used pepper spray against members of the gathering crowd , including one man whose eyes were hurt by the spray mr grtner has not commented publicly on the quarrel and did not respond to messages , and neither daimler nor the police in beijing have shared details , so it was impossible to know whether he agreed with that description of events even so , the chinese news media and many internet users seized on mr grtner as an example of arrogant western bigotry and demanded that he and daimler apologize he became the latest example of the power of the chinese internet to humble governments , companies and people accused of wounding national pride some people think this was making a mountain out of a molehill , said an editorial on tuesday in southern daily , an official newspaper for the southern province of guangdong but , it continued , some foreign companies often use racially prejudiced words and actions about chinese consumers , even chinese employees foreign executives easily become arrogant about the chinese market , the newspaper said mr grtner , a german , had worked at the chinese truck and bus unit since july 2015 , after a six year stint in south korea , according to his profile on linkedin the controversy over mr grtner has come hard on the heels of another volatile episode , when gnther h oettinger , a european union commissioner from germany , apologized after making crudely disparaging comments about chinese people initially , daimler greater china said on monday that it was deeply sorry about the dispute and stressed that such comments by employees do not represent daimler , according to chinese news reports but as the public anger in china grew on monday , the company acted and announced mr grtners departure from his job in making the announcement , daimler greater china said the dispute , while a private issue , was detrimental to the standing of our company , unbecoming of a manager of our brand and prejudicial to our good name chinese news reports celebrated the decision as a victory for good sense , and many appeared to assume that mr grtner had been fired from daimler but the corporate communications office for daimler greater china did not answer questions about whether mr grtner had been dismissed by the company or moved on , perhaps pending a new assignment elsewhere in the company global times , a popular chinese newspaper , said it was understandable that frustrated drivers in beijing , a painfully congested city , would exchange sharp words over parking spots but no matter how filthy the words , hearts should not be filthy , the newspaper said theres no explaining away an argument that escalates to using you chinese

a joint new york state and federal investigation into how false reports of gunfire at kennedy international airport in august led to mass panic found security protocols seriously lacking , with poor coordination between agencies and widely divergent levels of training for security personnel exacerbating the chaos within minutes of the first reports of gunfire on the night of aug 14 , a wave of panic swept across the airport as thousands of travelers and employees , receiving no official direction , took it upon themselves to run or hide the investigation by the task force , the details of which were outlined in a six page letter released by gov andrew m cuomo on monday , offered the first official account of how fear led to hysteria and ultimately put lives at risk the task force cited a failure of bureaucracy , where the lack of clear lines of authority and poor communication led to one of the nations busiest transit hubs grinding to a halt the episode also raised serious concerns about what would have happened if it had not been a false alarm but an actual emergency in this case , although thousands of people participated in an uncontrolled immediate evacuation , there were no significant injuries , according to the letter from the john f kennedy international airport multi agency security review team that summarized the findings and was sent to mr cuomo , a democrat , and jeh johnson , the secretary of homeland security however , the danger posed by a panicked mass of people fleeing for their lives cannot be overstated mr cuomo and mr johnson said in statements that they would implement a series of recommendations to deal with the problems that the episode exposed , including the creation of a single unified command center to oversee security operations for the airport the panic started with the most unlikely of triggers the victory of usain bolt , the jamaican track star , during the summer olympics it was around 9 30 p m when patrons at the juan valdez caf in terminal 8 erupted in celebration a review of the videotape from the incident shows passengers in the terminal panicking immediately after the celebration , the letter said at 9 33 p m , someone called 911 to report a disturbance in the terminal more calls followed and were echoed by people taking to social media , many claiming shots had been fired things escalated rapidly police officers for the port authority of new york and new jersey , which operates the airport , drew their weapons and advanced to where they thought there might be a gunman , according to the findings at the same time , federal agents with the transportation security administration began to run with passengers from the public area of terminal 8 , according to the letter soon after the initial reports of a shooter in terminal 8 were made , additional reports of a shooter in terminal 1 and 2 were received by 911 operators , the letter said in terminal 1 , officers from customs and border protection took a hard stand , guns drawn , which caused passengers at the federal inspection service area to panic some fled the area through emergency exits onto the tarmac others returned to the gate and boarded a korean air airplane , where airline employees deployed its emergency evacuation chutes , producing a popping sound that may have been mistaken for gunfire , the letter said in all , 275 police officers responded to the false alarm , including 88 from the port authority and 187 members of the new york police department the letter noted that as the threat of terrorism has increased , so too has security with federal , state , local and private security forces all deployed at the airport while the number of security personnel has increased , the coordination and standard protocols have not adjusted to the increased presence , the letter said in addition to establishing a unified command center , mr cuomo and mr johnson said they would implement coordinated training for the various security forces at the airport after the chaos at the airport subsided , scores of travelers began to question how after more than 15 years of increased vigilance and warnings about the threat of terrorism not to mention the billions of dollars spent to combat the threat there was seemingly no evacuation plan in place the authorities said that would change a security plan should be developed to address mass self evacuation , the letter said however , one difficulty that needs to be addressed surrounds the most visible layer of airport security , the t s a agents since t s a employees are not armed law enforcement , and are trained to run , hide , fight in the event of an active violence situation , t s a checkpoints could be left vulnerable in these situations , the letter said one recommendation was to add armed law enforcement to the checkpoints the events at j f k were a wake up call to rethink and re evaluate our security procedures to reflect the new , changing reality of 21st century threats and to better ensure the safety of all new yorkers , mr cuomo said these recommendations will serve as a national model to better train our airport workers , establish new protocols to respond to emergencies , and enhance coordination and communication among all stakeholders

washington days before the presidential election , james alefantis , owner of a local pizza restaurant called comet ping pong , noticed an unusual spike in the number of his instagram followers within hours , menacing messages like were on to you began appearing in his instagram feed in the ensuing days , hundreds of death threats one read i will kill you personally started arriving via texts , facebook and twitter all of them alleged something that made mr alefantiss jaw drop that comet ping pong was the home base of a child abuse ring led by hillary clinton and her campaign chief , john d podesta when mr alefantis discovered that his employees were getting similar abusive messages , he looked online to unravel the accusations he found dozens of made up articles about mrs clinton kidnapping , molesting and trafficking children in the restaurants back rooms the articles appeared on facebook and on websites such as the new nationalist and the vigilant citizen , with one headline blaring pizzagate how 4chan uncovered the sick world of washingtons occult elite none of it was true while mr alefantis has some prominent democratic friends in washington and was a supporter of mrs clinton , he has never met her , does not sell or abuse children , and is not being investigated by law enforcement for any of these claims he and his 40 employees had unwittingly become real people caught in the middle of a storm of fake news from this insane , fabricated conspiracy theory , weve come under constant assault , said mr alefantis , 42 , who was once in a relationship with david brock , a provocative former right wing journalist who became an outspoken advocate for mrs clinton mr alefantis suspects those relationships may have helped to make him a target ive done nothing for days but try to clean this up and protect my staff and friends from being terrorized , he said fake news online has been at the center of a furious debate for the past few weeks over how it may have influenced voters in the presidential election president obama warned last week that we are in an age where theres so much active misinformation and its packaged very well on social media sites the criticism has buffeted web companies such as google and facebook , whose chief executive , mark zuckerberg , has promised to work on technology tools to slow the gusher of false digital information but mr alefantiss experience shows it is not just politicians and internet companies that are grappling with the fake news fallout he , his staff and friends have become a new kind of private citizen bulls eye for the purveyors of false articles and their believers for more than two weeks , they have struggled to deal with the abusive social media comments and to protect photos of their own children , which were used in the false articles as evidence that the pizza restaurant was running a pedophilia ring one person even visited comet ping pong to investigate the allegations for himself to combat the fake news tide , mr alefantis has contacted the federal bureau of investigation and the local police , and he has asked facebook , twitter , youtube and reddit to remove the articles yet the misinformation has continued to spread , growing into a theory known as pizzagate that has traveled to ireland at one point , comets staff counted five pizzagate twitter posts a minute as recently as sunday night , the twitter message dont let up pizzagate everywhere was reposted and liked hundreds of times its like trying to shoot a swarm of bees with one gun , said bryce reh , comets general manager , whose wife asked him to leave his job because of the threats and vulgar messages they both have received on their social media accounts mr alefantis , an artist born and raised in washington , co founded comet ping pong 10 years ago as a casual spot for clay oven pizza the restaurant has kid friendly features like ping pong tables and a craft room famous natives like members of the band fugazi have held small shows there the eatery , which seats 120 , is a mash up of red and white checkered tablecloths and modernist murals and paintings from friends of mr alefantis mr alefantis mingles with other washington chefs and his establishment helped him to be named no 49 in gq magazines 50 most powerful people in washington in 2012 his customers include some high powered locals , such as tony podesta , the brother of john podesta , whom mr alefantis knows casually mr alefantis and mr brock , who is the founder of media matters for america , a website that tracks press coverage critical of the clintons and works to debunk misinformation in the conservative press , broke up five years ago the misinformation campaign began when john podestas email account was hacked and his emails were published by wikileaks during the presidential campaign days before the election , users on the online message board 4chan noticed that one of mr podestas leaked emails contained communications with mr alefantis discussing a fund raiser for mrs clinton the 4chan users immediately speculated about the links between comet ping pong and the democratic party some posited the restaurant was part of a larger democratic child trafficking ring , which was a theory long held by some conservative blogs that idea jumped to other social media services such as twitter and reddit , where it gained momentum on the page the donald a new reddit discussion thread called pizzagate quickly attracted 20 , 000 subscribers glen caplin , a former campaign official for mrs clinton , did not comment directly about comet ping pong but said , wikileaks has spawned several conspiracy theories that have been independently debunked mr podesta did not respond to requests for comment soon , dozens of fake news articles on sites such as facebook , planet free will and living resistance emerged readers shared the stories in saudi arabia and on turkish and other foreign language sites last week , one supporter of the pizzagate theory shot a live video from within the restaurant during a busy dinner shift local police , who had parked across the street after mr alefantis filed a report about the fake news stories and threats , told the man to leave in a statement , the district of columbia metropolitan police department said it was monitoring the situation and is aware of general threats being made against this establishment the f b i said it does not confirm or deny the existence of investigations most troubling for mr alefantis and staff has been the use of childrens images , pilfered from the restaurants social media pages and the personal accounts of friends who had liked comet ping pong online those photos have been used across dozens of websites parents , who declined to talk publicly for fear of retribution , have hired lawyers to get the photos removed musicians who have performed at comet ping pong have been pulled in , too amanda kleinman , whose band , heavy breathing , has performed there several times , deleted her twitter account after the abusive comments became overwhelming similar comments have flooded her youtube music clips we are at a dangerous place in american culture where a good percentage of people arent distinguishing what is a real news source based on real reporting and fact checking and only reinforcing pre existing ideas they have , ms kleinman said the frustration has been compounded by the lack of recourse for mr alefantis , his friends and employees yelp blocked the comments sections of comet ping pongs review page after reports of abusive comments and fake news in reviews youtube said it prohibits threats , harassment and hate speech and has tools for flagging violations and filing complaints for the site to take further action , but has largely not blocked comments on these videos twitter declined to comment , and facebook did not have any further comment after employees and mr alefantis complained to reddit about how comet ping pong was being targeted on the site , the pizzagate discussion thread posted a warning that revealing personal information about individuals was prohibited we know that we have more work to do and we take our responsibility to address online abuse seriously , reddit said in a statement little relief appears in sight over the weekend , comet ping pong received dozens of

washington president elect donald j trump on monday released a two and a half minute infomercial style video , turning to social media to deliver a direct to camera message in which he vowed to create jobs , renegotiate trade agreements , end restrictions on energy production and impose bans on lobbying mr trump offered what he called an update on his transition , which he said was going very smoothly , efficiently and effectively reading from a script and looking into a camera , he steered clear of his most inflammatory campaign promises to deport immigrants and track muslims and his pledge to repeal the affordable care act whether its producing steel , building cars or curing disease , i want the next generation of production and innovation to happen right here , in our great homeland america creating wealth and jobs for american workers , mr trump said in the video the brief youtube video offered one of the few opportunities for the public to hear from mr trump directly since he was elected two weeks ago the president elect has declined to hold a news conference since his victory , and instead has used early morning twitter bursts to communicate mr trump gave a brief middle of the night speech after hillary clinton called him on nov 9 and he sat for an interview with the wall street journal and an appearance , surrounded by his family , on cbs newss 60 minutes last week since then , he has mostly been behind closed doors as he assembles a cabinet and white house team in the video , mr trump described his plans to make america great again on day 1 , but his message seemed aimed less at the supporters who chanted that slogan at rallies and more at the americans who remain skeptical about it the president elect appeared to try to emphasize his appeal to those voters at the end of the video , and he promised to provide more updates as he worked together with everyone to reach his goals and i mean everyone , he emphasized the video underscored the extent to which mr trump intends to try to navigate around the traditional newspaper and television media outlets as he seeks to communicate his message to the public ari fleischer , who served as white house press secretary under george w bush , said mr trump was using technology to communicate with the public in a format that mr bushs staff would never have dreamed of doing 15 years ago , because the news media would have dismissed it as propaganda president obama has become adept at doing the same thing in recent years , through videos posted on facebook and other media mr fleischer said , hes just doing more of what president obama successfully did , and what im fascinated about is , what does this mean for the future \? on monday , the president elect met privately with television executives in a confidential session that was described later as a sometimes contentious effort to clear the air after a campaign season in which mr trump often clashed with members of the media mr trump is also scheduled to meet with editors and reporters at the new york times on tuesday but his decision to deliver a highly scripted video message suggests that he , like mr obama , is eager to embrace new media opportunities by monday , mr trumps realdonaldtrump twitter account , which he enjoys using , had 15 7 million followers once in the white house , he will inherit potus , with its 12 1 million online followers mr trump also spent monday at his office in trump tower , interviewing a stream of potential republican cabinet candidates they included rick perry , a former governor of texas former senator scott brown of massachusetts and representative tulsi gabbard of hawaii , a democrat perhaps the most interesting thing about mr trumps video was what he did not say in it on immigration , he avoided any mention of his plan to build a wall along the border with mexico or his desire to deport immigrants here illegally , whether or not they have a criminal record he made no mention of ending president obamas program that grants work permits to immigrants who were brought illegally to the united states as children instead , mr trump simply promised to direct the labor department to investigate visa abuses the tough talking president elect , who has often railed against mr obama and the generals for what he often called their stupid conduct of foreign policy , said nothing in the video about fighting terrorism , confronting russian aggression or pressuring nato allies to pay more for their common defense instead , he said he would ask his top military officials for a comprehensive plan to guard americas vital infrastructure from cyberattacks , and all other form of attacks mr trumps other promises in the video recapped points that he made repeatedly during the campaign , offering a series of executive actions that he says he will order on his first full day in the oval office some , like his pledge to issue our notification of intent to withdraw from the trans pacific partnership trade deal , will be well within his power as president to accomplish but his additional promise to negotiate fair , bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto american shores will be in the eyes of the beholder , and may not produce the results he expects others appear to be overblown political hyperbole , like his promise in the video to cancel job killing restrictions on the production of american energy including shale energy and clean coal creating many millions of high paying jobs he did not specify in the short video what restrictions he will lift or how that would result in many millions of jobs even supporters of the keystone xl oil pipeline , which mr trump has said he will greenlight once in office , do not believe it would create millions of jobs if it was built mr fleischer said mr trumps more inclusive tone in the video was the latest example of a pattern he set during the campaign of dialing back his impulse for fiery speech when he felt it was in his interest he has said this about himself , that he knows how to be really boring when he wants to be , mr fleischer said of mr trump hes so self aware about the fact that there are these two trumps , and were seeing more of the other one since he won
moscow russias defense ministry said monday that ukrainian security service operatives had abducted two of its servicemen , who were later described by kiev as deserters from the ukrainian army the two servicemen , identified by russia as maksim odintsov and aleksandr baranov , were detained and whisked by the operatives over the disputed border of crimea into the mykolaiv region of ukraine on sunday , the russian defense ministry said in a statement the ukrainian special services are trying to fabricate a criminal case against mr baranov and mr odintsov , the statement said , as carried by the interfax news agency it is not excluded that psychological and physical evidence will be applied against the russian servicemen in order to get the right testimony the statement described what happened as a rude provocation and demanded the immediate return of the men in kiev , the ukrainian security service confirmed that the two servicemen had been detained on the border with crimea , but it described them as former ukrainian army soldiers , who are now facing charges of treason for defecting to russia these are two former ukrainian servicemen , who broke the oath of enlistment and went to serve in the russian army , a representative of the security service told interfax in contrast to the russian statement , the ukrainian official said the servicemen had been detained on ukrainian territory after crossing the border russia annexed crimea in 2014 after deploying thousands of troops throughout the peninsula and conducting a hastily organized pro russian referendum there many soldiers and officers of the ukrainian army and navy have switched sides and begun to serve in the russian military after the annexation , crimea was the site of a number of episodes , especially along its disputed border with ukraine this month , russias main security service said it had arrested several ukrainian citizens in crimea , accusing them of planning to attack military sites and infrastructure there ukrainian officials dismissed the reports as false in august , russia said it had dismantled a ukrainian spy network and accused the ukrainian leadership of sponsoring terrorism in crimea kiev denied both claims as fantasies
washington the islamic state has used chemical weapons , including chlorine and sulfur mustard agents , at least 52 times on the battlefield in syria and iraq since it swept to power in 2014 , according to a new independent analysis more than one third of those chemical attacks have come in and around mosul , the islamic state stronghold in northern iraq , according to the assessment by the ihs conflict monitor , a london based intelligence collection and analysis service the ihs conclusions , which are based on local news reports , social media and islamic state propaganda , mark the broadest compilation of chemical attacks in the conflict american and iraqi military officials have expressed growing alarm over the prospect of additional chemical attacks as the allies press to regain both mosul and raqqa , the islamic state capital in syria the coalition is concerned about isils use of chemical weapons , col john dorrian , a military spokesman in iraq , said in an email on monday , using another name for the islamic state isil has used them in iraq and syria in the past , and we expect them to continue employing these types of weapons colonel dorrian said that the islamic states ability to use chemical weapons is rudimentary , and that american , iraqi and other allied troops are equipped to deal with the impact of these chemical attacks typically rockets , mortar shells or artillery shells filled with chemical agents the effects of these chemical munitions thus far have been limited to the immediate area where they land the ihs assessment is to be made public on tuesday the new york times obtained an advance copy of the assessment and the location of the 52 reported chemical attacks the analysis did not break down the cases by type of chemical attack in an effort to blunt the islamic states ability to make the weapons , the american led air campaign has bombed militants associated with overseeing their production and the facilities where chemical ordnance is manufactured in september , for instance , allied warplanes attacked a converted pharmaceutical factory in northern iraq thought to have been a chemical weapons production facility as iraqi forces now advance into mosul , analysts warned that the islamic state could unleash more chemical attacks as they cede control iraqi forces have reclaimed about one third of mosul , iraqs second largest city as the islamic state loses ground around mosul , there is a high risk of the group using chemical weapons to slow down and demoralize advancing enemy forces said columb strack , a senior analyst and the head of the ihs conflict monitor and to potentially make an example of and take revenge on civilian dissidents within the city at least 19 of the 52 chemical attacks have taken place in and around mosul , according to the ihs data , but the assessment noted a decline in attacks before the iraqi led offensive against the city mosul was at the center of the islamic states chemical weapons production , mr strack said but most of the equipment and experts were probably evacuated to syria in the weeks and months leading up to the mosul offensive , along with convoys of other senior members and their families the islamic state is not the only actor in syria to carry out chemical weapons strikes the syrian government has conducted many more such attacks syrian military helicopters dropped bombs containing chlorine on civilians in at least two attacks over the past two years , a special joint investigation of the united nations and an international chemical weapons monitor said in august beginning last year , american officials confirmed the first instances of the islamic state using sulfur mustard , a chemical warfare agent , and the presence of the mustard gas on fragments of ordnance used in attacks by the group in syria and iraq laboratory tests , which were also performed on scraps of clothing from victims , showed the presence of a partly degraded form of distilled sulfur mustard , an internationally banned substance that burns a victims skin , breathing passages and eyes chemical warfare agents , broadly condemned and banned by most nations under international convention , are indiscriminate they are also difficult to defend against without specialized equipment , which many of the islamic states foes in iraq and syria lack the chemical agents are worrisome as potential terrorist weapons , even though chlorine and blister agents are typically less lethal than bullets , shrapnel or explosives it was unclear how the islamic state had obtained sulfur mustard , a banned substance with a narrow chemical warfare application both the former hussein government in iraq and the current government in syria at one point possessed chemical warfare programs chlorine is commercially available as an industrial chemical and has been used occasionally by bomb makers from sunni militant groups in iraq for about a decade but it is not known how the islamic state would have obtained sulfur mustard , the officials said abandoned and aging chemical munitions produced by iraq during its war against iran in the 1980s were used in roadside bombs against american forces during the occupation that followed the 2003 american invasion of iraq but american officials have said the types of ordnance that have been publicly disclosed so far have not matched known chemical ordnance in the former iraqi inventory the attacks have been geographically scattered and have varied in their delivery systems , suggesting that the islamic state had access to , and was experimenting with , different types of rockets and shells configured to carry chemical warfare agents or toxic industrial chemicals one theory is that the militants were manufacturing a crude mustard agent themselves , american officials say another theory is that the islamic state acquired sulfur mustard from undeclared stocks in syria , either through capture or by purchasing it from corrupt officials , although this theory is not widely held by american analysts
1 president elect donald j trump has yet to hold a news conference , but he released what aides said should suffice for now an infomercial style youtube video in which he asserted that his transition was going very smoothly , efficiently and effectively he outlined his top priorities for his first day in office , including beginning the process of withdrawing from the the trans pacific partnership trade deal and revoking president obamas environmental regulations on the production of coal and natural gas here is the latest on the transition and what he hopes to accomplish in his first 100 days 2 the right wings extremist fringe , the alt right , is exulting in mr trumps victory at a conference in washington , its leading ideologue railed against jews , quoted nazi propaganda in german and celebrated mr trumps election he saw it as a sign that white people were awakening to their own identity , and said that now its up to the alt right to formulate policies that have a realistic chance of being implemented a spokeswoman for mr trump said the president elect disapproved of all hate groups 3 the depth of one of the factors that played into the election is still emerging the role of fake news some of it is produced from people seeking to make money off advertising but false stories can also build off misinformed social media posts we look at how one mistaken tweet by a man with just 40 followers exploded through the hyperpartisan blogosphere 4 law enforcement officials in north dakota used firehoses in below freezing weather against protesters fighting the dakota access pipeline the local sheriffs office defended its actions , accusing encamped native americans and environmental activists of conducting an ongoing riot and setting fires 5 the fallout from revelations of russias state run doping program is rewriting the record books for the beijing and london summer olympics the retesting of stored urine samples for specific banned substances has incriminated at least 40 medal winners , the majority from russia and other eastern european countries medals from the 2014 sochi winter olympics are also likely to be called into question 6 jurgen klinsmann was fired as coach of the u s national mens soccer team , less than a week after a humiliating defeat that damaged the teams chances of qualifying for the 2018 world cup u s soccer did not immediately announce a replacement 7 pope francis extended local priests authority to grant forgiveness for the grave sin of abortion , making permanent the power he gave them on a temporary basis last year there is no sin that gods mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart , he wrote 8 the largest and most authoritative study of dementia rates confirmed that its prevalence is dropping that is remarkably good news , as an estimated four million to five million americans develop dementia every year , and its very expensive to treat researchers will now try to solve the findings many mysteries , like why people who are overweight or obese have a 30 percent lower risk above , a brain scan showing signs of alzheimers 9 more than five years into syrias chaotic civil war , the capital city , damascus , is relatively undamaged and functioning , bustling with commuters , markets and restaurants but the war has warped the city on a recent visit , our correspondent recorded short video clips , where you can sometimes hear airstrikes on rebel held suburbs , and people fear random shells falling 10 more than 600 people signed up for a yoga class with baby goats on an oregon farm they wander around with their collars and name tags , looking for affection , or a bit of grassy kibble \( like many yogis , they are vegetarians \) , and seem entirely unfazed by the sight of 20 or so people posing in downward facing dog , our correspondent reported after taking a class 11 finally , should you quit social media to benefit your career \? thats the advice of a georgetown professor who says its a distraction and harms our ability to concentrate if youre serious about making an impact in the world , he says , power down your smartphone , close your browser tabs , roll up your sleeves and get to work
weve never camped out on its floors , as some people do , but my family has long had a fascination with the american museum of natural history when i was 8 and 9 years old , i lived 21 blocks north of the fortresslike structure on central park west in manhattan and in those days , when not everyone had a television set , it became a delightful source of entertainment and what passed at that tender age for enlightenment decades later , we took our daughter , annie , there shes now 29 , but it remains her favorite museum , an educational outpost so stuffed with information , so prone to inspire questions , that it can at times seem overwhelming like the towering stature of its alaskan brown bear or the immense girth of its 1 , 300 year old sequoia tree \( ive always been a bit apprehensive that the suspended life size model of the whale that hangs from its ceiling would break off and crush me \) more than 60 years after i first visited , the museums sights are just as breathtaking and the questions it sparks are just as abundant but in the age of the smartphone , they can now be addressed and the impact of its exhibits enhanced with a new museum app for iphone and android users that offers lots of fun facts , videos and teaching tools for some 70 of the most compelling items on display this app , which is called explorer and can be downloaded free , explains how the 16 foot wide sequoia slice was fitted through the 12 foot museum doorway \( a pie wedge was cut out to squeeze it through and then restored , along seams that are still visible \) it tells you that at up to 400 , 000 pounds , the blue whale weighs as much as about five subway cars , making it the planets largest animal it lets you hear the sound the real creature makes underwater and shows you a short video of a woman in a forklift swabbing the museums whale with a long handled brush for its annual three day scrubbing it supposedly reassures me that the whale 21 , 000 pounds of foam and fiberglass is suspended by a single steel pipe anchored in the ceiling nevertheless , i still declined to venture under the whale to check out its mammalian navel , which the app also steers you to the explorer app , which cost about 2 75 million , offset by the gift of an undisclosed amount from bloomberg philanthropies , is also a teaching tool it can explain to people with little knowledge of biology , for example , that the blue whale is more closely related to a clown than a clown fish , to a hippo than a sea otter the information is in far simpler form than the sometimes encyclopedic texts of the exhibition labels that more than a few visitors seem to ignore given the museums labyrinthine structure a collection of some 25 buildings cobbled together over the decades with a maze of corridors and halls the app has a bluetooth operated feature that guides you gps like to exhibitions it recommends you see based on your input of any of a dozen interests you may not know where you are , but 800 signal emitting beacons sprinkled through the museum pinpoint your location within 12 feet or so ! very helpful if you are looking to find the bathroom or the cafe in short , its a great aid to anyone seeing the museum for the first or 40th time , preferably with a child or two in tow its like having a curator on your shoulder , the museum likes to say and in the age of the smartphone , when all of life seems to be connected to a hand held device , the app may be the only way to entice some children to see what more grouchy tykes may regard as a collection of stuffed animals and timeworn artifacts its in keeping with how a new generation approaches content , ellen v futter , president of the almost 150 year old museum , told me , adding that the smartphone is the go to for young people and increasingly for everyone and it may not even be such an anomaly after all , as matt tarr , the digital architect who led the apps in house design team , said as he showed off the app , the museums dioramas of animals set against superbly painted scenic backdrops were the original examples of virtual reality a concern , and one that museum designers of the app have tried to guard against , is that some children may be so entranced by the app that they barely look at the giant mosquito or the radiant 563 carat star of india sapphire or the recreation of lucy , one of the earliest fossils of the hominid ancestors of todays humans and they may entirely avoid the labels , which are indispensable for those seeking more sophisticated information one can appreciate such dangers of technology when you watch tourists at the vatican lining up with their point and shoot cameras for michelangelos piet and see them spending their few seconds in front of the magnificent statue snapping a photo rather than taking in the pathos its creator was able to register in marble we are very intentional about the fact that we dont want you to go around looking only at your phone , said anne canty , a museum spokeswoman the idea is to inspire you to look back at the objects not spending time with the exhibitions themselves would be a shame since they remain as astonishing as when i was 8 and 9 years old
tokyo a powerful earthquake triggered a tsunami off the coast of japan early tuesday , near where three nuclear reactors melted down at a plant in fukushima after a quake and tsunami in 2011 tuesdays quake quickly brought evacuation warnings along the coast that was ravaged just over five years ago for about 90 minutes , fears of the 2011 nuclear disaster were raised as a cooling system in one reactor in another nearby plant shut down it was restored without incident the public broadcaster nhk exhorted residents of fukushima prefecture to leave coastal areas immediately please move as far away from the shoreline as possible , the announcer said please remember the great east japan earthquake a tsunami wave of about 55 inches hit the port of sendai in miyagi prefecture about an hour and a half after the quake hit , and nhk said minor injuries had been reported the first tsunami waves hit the coast at onahama in fukushima prefecture at about 23 inches at the fukushima nuclear plant , the tsunami waves rose to about three feet no deaths were immediately reported the japanese weather service reported a preliminary magnitude of 7 4 and issued a warning of a tsunami of about 10 feet \( the united states geological survey reported a lower magnitude , 6 9 \) the warnings were lifted in the early afternoon , and people were allowed to return to their homes the tokyo electric power company , or tepco , reported that a cooling system in one of the reactors at fukushima daini , a nuclear facility not far from the ruined daiichi plant , had stopped but said there was enough water in the reactor to keep the 2 , 544 spent fuel rods cool in the short term but the utility later said the system had resumed operations after 90 minutes the fukushima daini power station , about seven miles south of daiichi , has not produced electricity since the 2011 calamity , in which it suffered earthquake damage most of japans nuclear power plants have been shut down since soon after the disaster amid public concern about their safety fukushima dainis reactors are turned off , but the plant still has uranium fuel in a storage pool that must be kept cool by pumping water through the reactors after the 8 9 magnitude earthquake and tsunami five years ago , three reactors at the daiichi plant melted down after tsunami waves breached the power stations protective sea walls and inundated the facility the water flooded buildings and destroyed diesel powered electricity generators that were supposed to keep critical systems functioning in a blackout since the 2011 disaster , tepco has been cleaning up and has started the decommissioning process officials reported that they found no damage or radiation release after initial inspections tuesday morning tepco has struggled with the aftermath of the 2011 disaster about 7 , 000 workers , most of them contractors , are still at the site for the cleanup and decommissioning , which is projected to take as long as 40 years one of the biggest problems is the huge amount of hazardous waste that has been generated there are more than 700 tanks , about 1 , 000 tons each , that workers have built to store water that has continuously seeped into the melted reactors from the ground since the disaster after tuesdays earthquake , tepco said it had suspended the transfer of contaminated water to the tanks in an effort to stem the groundwater flow , tepco has built an underground wall of frozen dirt 100 feet deep and nearly a mile in length in an effort to halt the flood of groundwater into the damaged reactor buildings the so called ice wall is not yet fully frozen , and groundwater continues to flow into the reactors every day tepco appeared to have learned some lessons from the 2011 disaster , when it failed to give timely updates on tuesday , tepco released information about the status of its plants almost immediately at the peak of the 2011 nuclear disaster , 160 , 000 people fled or were evacuated from around the plant almost 90 , 000 people have not returned the disaster also fundamentally changed the course of nuclear power in energy poor japan , which had invested heavily in its 50 odd nuclear power stations in its quest to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and energy imports on tuesday , the government was taking no chances on warning residents in tsunami zones to evacuate sirens rang continuously in the communities near the coast nhk , the public broadcaster , kept a huge red banner on the top of the screen all morning reading , flee immediately ! the 2011 disaster killed almost 16 , 000 people as sea waves rose as high as 130 feet at miyako in iwate prefecture an additional 2 , 500 were reported missing and never found

the overlook lodge , a bar in the pleasant ridge neighborhood of cincinnati , looks cozy enough at first , with wooden rafters and a fireplace big enough to sit inside but after a while , unsettling details catch the eye the inner lit bar top casts a spectral glow why all the axes on the wall \? and then there is the illuminated sign outside that bears one repeated mantra all work and no play makes jack a dull boy yes , the overlook lodge takes its style cues from the shining , the 1980 stanley kubrick film of stephen kings horror classic the cocktails have names like writers block and the elevator , and the list of whimsical boilermakers is called twin shots , a reference to the films spooky girl ghosts movies have done their bit to glorify bars and drinking over the years think of nick and nora charles swilling martinis in the thin man , and the champagne cocktails hoisted in ricks caf amricain now bars are returning the favor last month , jacob trevino , an owner of the overlook lodge , opened a quentin tarantino themed bar in cincinnati called the video archive in san antonio , the ringer pub pays homage to the big lebowski with bowling alley dcor and white russians always on offer in dallas , eastbound and down icehouse , which opened in may , is all about smokey and the bandit new york has stay classy new york , where fans of will ferrell films can toast their comic idol , and beetle house , where a man dressed in beetlejuices striped suit greets you at the door if the business concept seems gimmicky , the motivation behind many of these bars is quite heartfelt my best friends father passed away , and he was super bummed out , said zach neil , an owner of stay classy , which opened last year on the lower east side he inherited some money we wanted to do something that was uplifting for him and kind of fun he loved will ferrell movies the friends opened the bar , named for a catchphrase from ron burgundy , the title character in the anchorman movies , and covered the walls with original art inspired by ferrell films they keep the actors work in permanent rotation on the bars many televisions the therapeutic exercise proved an unexpected hit , with lines down the block during the bars first months the venture went so well that in april the partners opened a second bar , beetle house it is equally busy ive always loved movies , mr trevino said i was trying to marry my love of cinema and cocktails while working as bartender for one of cincinnatis leading mixologists , molly wellmann , he had staged a series of pop up events called gorilla cinema , in which film screenings \( pulp fiction , footloose \) were paired with drinks when it came time for mr trevino to open his own bar , he put that concept into more long term practice as one may expect , first time customers at these bars are fans of the movies being shown but if they come for the film , they often stay for the bar autumn heisler and her fianc knew mr trevino from previous bars where he worked both are now regulars at the overlook lodge but with differing levels of enthusiasm for the theme my fianc is a big horror film fan , said ms heisler , a creative director at a social media agency i am not i strictly come because of jacob and cocktails mr neil said the same dynamic applies at stay classy new york initially it was about 100 percent ferrell fans , he said nowadays , 50 percent of the people in the bar just wander in and say , why is there all this anchorman stuff everywhere \?
mexico city archaeologists have discovered what may be the original structure built at the pyramid of kukulkan at the mayan ruins of chichen itza the pyramid was built atop a subterranean river around 900 a d , and archaeologists have long known that a smaller pyramid lies beneath it now scans of the site have detected an even smaller structure inside the intermediate pyramid archaeologists at mexico 's national institute of anthropology and history speculate that the first structure may be in the pure maya style , dating from between 500 a d and 800 a d
when robert eidelbergs journalism class at john bowne high school in flushing , queens , convened in september , 1972 , our first assignment was to write an obituary about ourselves we were all about 15 years old , without much life experience \( i was months from my first paying job at a supermarket \) , so the task was to invent our futures did you keep mine \? i asked mr eidelberg last week soon after i announced my move to the obits staff after 25 years in sports didnt \? he responded , with a laugh , prompting me to wish that i could read how i had lived and what i had died of eidelberg is the one teacher ive stayed in touch with all these years he inspired me to enter journalism and each time ive made a significant change in my career , ive called him forty four years later , he is teaching at hunter college and retains the big hearted enthusiasm he brought to our class he recalled that he asked us to write our obituaries as a way to understand ourselves and test our imaginations it was the biographical version of `how i spent my summer vacation , he said but i wouldnt have gotten so much interesting content if i hadnt framed it as an obituary of yourself id like to think i awarded myself a pulitzer now , i will be writing obituaries of others , which ive done now and then while covering sports media and business ive written nearly three dozen obits , all of sports personalities , including the announcers mel allen , ernie harwell , jim mckay , phil rizzuto and harry caray each was , in that ghoulish way that obit writers feel , a pleasure to write \( especially for someone who enjoyed watching sports more than playing them and spent many hours professionally writing about sportscasters \) some years ago , i wrote an advance obit of vin scully , the great brooklyn and los angeles dodgers annnouncer who retired last month after 67 years at the microphone as i wrote about his unmatched career , i couldnt help but think of what i might be adding to the article as i observed scullys gracious farewell to fans as he approaches his 89th birthday would it be that he recorded wind beneath my wings for his wife as a christmas gift \? or his revelation that he would resume rooting for the giants , the dodgers arch rival and the team he grew up loving when he , and the giants , were new yorkers \? the occasional obit that fit into my sports department schedule was a diversion , not a full time endeavor the news of my departure for the dead zone generated three distinct reactions from friends , colleagues and people i write about the first was congratulations the second involved fond memories of the obits i have written and the third was something a lot like dont call me for a while thats right people who recently lobbied me to write about them , now hoped i would lose their phone numbers until they die a well known local sportscaster summed things up nicely when he said , in an email , i always looked forward to you writing a long feature on me in the paper of record now i can wait a loooong time in fact , lets skip it completely the most unusual reaction came from a famous and sophisticated former sports commissioner will you interview me for my advance obit \? he asked teeming with apparent awareness that his years as a successful commissioner entitled him to an advance obit and that , at age 70 something , he was overdue for one bill mcdonald , the obituaries editor , believes that this is the first offer by a big newsmaker to volunteer to talk to us for an article that he will never read we more frequently hear from second string types , he told me , looking for posthumous glory
do you remember playing pretend when you were little \? maybe you were a superhero , a dinosaur or a princess its normal when youre little , and its usually harmless most children know the difference between pretending to be a superhero and jumping off the roof thinking they can fly but adults often forget for instance , we may stop pretending to be superheroes , but a lot of us seem convinced that we can pretend to be investors thats dangerous 1 pretend investors think that financial pornography is real , so the ticker tape scrolling across the television screen all day represents actionable information real investors know it might be entertaining , like going to the circus , but they would never make a decision because of it 2 pretend investors think it makes perfect sense to change their investments based on what they hear in the news theres a new president , so act ! he doesnt like the federal reserve , so trade ! he criticized bankers , so buy bank stocks ! real investors know that they make changes to their investments based on what happens in their own lives if their goals change or there is a fundamental change in their financial situation , then they consider an alteration but they would never make a change based on someone yelling buy or sell on television 3 pretend investors think they need to monitor their investments all the time the little supercomputer they carry around in their pockets makes it so easy real investors know that it takes a long time for a tree to grow , and it will not help to dig it up to see if the roots are still there the same rule applies to investments and because watching things get big slowly is not very exciting , real investors tend not to talk about that tree all that much 4 pretend investors talk about their investments a lot they say things like , im long this , or short that they use jargon that often does not make sense , though it sounds kind of impressive if you dont listen too closely sometimes they cheer for things like increased consumer spending , higher unemployment , or in some cases , war real investors understand the difference between the global economy and their personal economy and choose to focus on the latter 5 pretend investors will worry endlessly about the news in some far off part of the world or the impact on their portfolio real investors focus on the things they can control , like saving a bit more next year , keeping their investment costs low , not paying fees unless its necessary and managing their behavior by not buying high and selling again when prices are low 6 pretend investors complain endlessly about volatility in the market and external actions that have short term impact on the big bets they have made on individual stocks real investors have enjoyed the benefits of a market that is up more than 180 percent in the last 20 years so ask yourself this isnt it finally time to stop pretending now \?
despite fears that dementia rates were going to explode as the population grows older and fatter , and has more diabetes and high blood pressure , a large nationally representative survey has found the reverse dementia is actually on the wane and when people do get dementia , they get it at older and older ages previous studies found the same trend but involved much smaller and less diverse populations like the mostly white population of framingham , mass , and residents of a few areas in england and wales the new study found that the dementia rate in americans 65 and older fell by 24 percent over 12 years , to 8 8 percent in 2012 from 11 6 percent in 2000 that trend is statistically significant and impressive , said samuel preston , a demographer at the university of pennsylvania who was not associated with the study in 2000 , people received a diagnosis of dementia at an average age of 80 7 in 2012 , the average age was 82 4 the dementia rate is not immutable , said dr richard hodes , director of the national institute on aging it can change and that is very good news , said john haaga , director of the institutes division of behavioral and social research it means , he said , that roughly a million and a half people aged 65 and older who do not have dementia now would have had it if the rate in 2000 had been in place keith fargo , director of scientific programs and outreach at the alzheimers association , said the group had been encouraged by some of the previous research showing a decline but had also been a little bit nervous about drawing conclusions because the populations in the earlier studies were so homogeneous now , he said of the new data , here is a nationally representative study its wonderful news an estimated four million to five million americans currently have dementia it remains the most expensive disease in america a study funded by the national institute on aging estimated that in 2010 it cost up to 215 billion a year to care for dementia patients , surpassing heart disease \( 102 billion \) and cancer \( 77 billion \) the study , published online monday by the journal jama internal medicine , included 21 , 000 americans 65 and older across all races , education and income levels , who participate in the health and retirement study , which regularly surveys people and follows them as they age the national institute on aging funded the work but was not involved with the data collection , analysis or interpretation to assess dementia , participants were asked , among other things , to recall 10 nouns immediately and after a delay , to serially subtract seven from 100 , and to count backward from 20 the test was based on extensive research indicating it was a good measure of memory and thinking skills participants also were asked about their education levels , income and health in a way , the dementia decline might seem unexpected it occurred despite an increase in diabetes the diabetes prevalence among older americans surged to 21 percent in 2012 from 9 percent in 1990 it began to fall only very recently and , the study found , diabetes increased the risk of dementia by 39 percent more older people today also have cardiovascular risk factors high levels of blood pressure , blood sugar and cholesterol which increase the risk of dementia but more are taking medications for those conditions , so perhaps better control of those risk factors played a role in the decline the findings about obesity were especially puzzling compared with people of normal weight , overweight people and obese people had a 30 percent lower risk of dementia , the study found underweight people had a risk 2 5 times as great yet the obesity picture is muddled because other studies have found that obesity in middle age increases dementia risk in old age then there is the education question on average , older americans in 2012 had one more year of schooling than older americans in 2000 and years of education were associated with decreased dementia risk in this study , as in many others it is still not clear exactly why education would reduce the risk of dementia there is the cognitive reserve hypothesis that education changes developing brains in a good way , making them more resistant to dementia , and that people with more education have brains that are better able to compensate for dementia damage but education also is linked to more wealth people with more education often live in environments that differ from those of people who have less schooling , and they tend to have better health over all they also are less likely to smoke as for black americans , the dementia risk was higher , but some possible reasons less education , less wealth , more cardiovascular risk factors did not fully explain the difference one possibility is that they received a poorer quality of education , so each year of it offered less protection from dementia , said the studys lead author , dr kenneth langa in the end , much of what is happening with dementia rates defies explanation , said dr langa , a professor of medicine at the university of michigan in ann arbor , who also works in the veterans affairs health care system there dr denis evans , a professor of medicine at rush university medical center in chicago , urged caution in accepting the conclusion that dementia rates were declining and , if they are , in accepting the possible explanations although he had nothing but praise for the abilities of the researchers , he noted that such studies were extremely difficult to do deciding if a respondent is demented can easily be inadvertently skewed , he said its very complex , dr evans said but the decline is consistent with what seems to be a long term trend , despite researchers failure to find any effective way for individuals to protect themselves from alzheimers , the most common form of dementia dr langa estimates that compared with the rate in the early 1990s , there has been a 25 to 30 percent decrease in dementia rates among older americans as for the future , that is hard to predict , dr langa said even with the lower prevalence of dementia , there will be many more older people in the united states over the next few decades , especially people age 85 and older , who are at highest risk for that reason , the total number of people with dementia should rise , although not as much as had been estimated and there are forces acting against the continuation of the decline in dementia rates more people reaching age 65 and above in the next few decades will have been obese in middle age , possibly increasing their risk of dementia in addition , the trend toward more years of schooling seems to have leveled off , so the education effect might not be as much of a factor but researchers remain optimistic the study found associations , dr hodes noted now the real challenge , he said , is to see if we can generate evidence of what causes what
san francisco for the last six years , instagram has been a repository for users most picturesque moments but 2016 has been a year of reinvention for the photo sharing social network , which has broadened what it lets people do with their images now instagram , which is owned by facebook , is rolling out two more new features on monday , the company is unveiling one feature focused on live video and one on ephemeral messaging both tap into a type of sharing popularized in recent years by companies like snap inc , which runs snapchat , and twitter , in its live streaming video app periscope we want instagram to be a place where you can share all of your moments , to create a pressure free space to do so , kevin weil , head of product at instagram , said in an interview mr weil said this philosophy , and the feature choices that stem from it , would encourage people to use instagram for more than the selected , highly polished feeds for which it is known the new features thrust instagram more directly into competition with twitter and into a heightened rivalry with snap , which is particularly notable as snap recently filed paperwork to go public instagram has steadily been introducing features to compete with snap this year , it unveiled a feature called instagram stories , which mimics a snapchat feature called snapchat stories , in which people can organize their photos into a story line instagrams live video feature will be released to a small test group on monday a wider rollout is planned for the weeks to come the feature lets instagram users broadcast live video to their followers through the stories section of the app much as in twitters periscope , friends and followers watching instagram live videos can comment and send cartoon hearts to the broadcaster during the stream but live instagram videos are meant to be fleeting and cannot be saved to watch later that gives broadcasters room to express themselves more fully , mr weil said , without the added pressure of the raw video sticking around indefinitely instagrams other new feature , disappearing photos and videos within the companys private messaging tool , will be available to all its users while an ephemeral live broadcast may be seen by many , disappearing messages are for the few , usually friends or family in a tighter circle than the wider audience of followers disappearing messages were made famous by snapchat , which was able to draw a generation of young regular users snapchat rose to prominence in a post facebook era of social media , one in which people grew fond of the idea that their digital history did not have to follow them around the internet in perpetuity mr weil defended the companys move into ephemeral sharing and pointed to improvements and product adjustments that he said highlighted instagrams innovation with the format the format is definitely something that snapchat innovated on , mr weil said but its just like how hashtags started on twitter and are used everywhere i think this particular format is one that we will see adopted everywhere else
ten days removed from the still fresh shock of donald trumps election , around lunchtime on a friday , i navigated the jagged lines of steel barriers , police officers and secret service battalions with big dogs and big guns surrounding trump tower the glass and marble shopping mall , tourist trap and tv set had been transformed into the unlikely plotting ground for the nations immediate future it was anybodys guess what was taking shape inside the gilded bunkers clots of media people , passers by and protesters crowded the lobby and nearby streets for the occasional clue , or at least glimpses of marla maples and prime minister shinzo abe of japan kellyanne conway posed for a selfie with a few lucky cops the locus of the scene was a bank of elevators ferrying staff , cabinet candidates and the competing maestros of the trump transition to and from various nerve centers over several floors every time a bell sounded , announcing the opening of an elevator door , lobby heads would bob expectantly is that what jeff sessions looks like \? i heard a photographer ask \( no , it is not , and it was not \) no doubt a host of key trump orchestrators and luminary actors were making ample use of auxiliary entrances and exits , sneaking in and out new rumors , predictions and potential firestorms seemed to materialize every hour the kremlinology of the incoming white house is shaping up as knotty , to say the least not one of trumps initial high level hires has any experience working in a white house how will they work with the volatile real estate and reality show maven in the oval office \? with his proclivity to make decisions based on the last person he speaks to \? with his children playing an uncertain role , his son in law a possibly ever present whisperer \? how will it all work with trumps senior adviser steve bannon , former head of breitbart news , who has a long rap sheet of racial , ethnic and sexist affronts and a long running war on washington republicans \? i had gone to trump tower to see reince priebus , the republican national committee chairman , whom trump named as his chief of staff five days after his election , in the same release in which bannon was named chief strategist and senior counselor bannon was mentioned first , for kremlinologists scoring at home , and his appointment has consumed the bulk of the attention , given his hyperprovocative ways but priebus , in a sense , filled a more exotic role he would be the chief establishment ambassador for a president whose brief and meteoric political career has been predicated on blowing that establishment up a generous reading is that trump is trying to foster a yin yang tension between his top deputies , who will represent his own diametrically opposed impulses \( bannon the bomb throwing devil on one shoulder , priebus the peacemaking angel on the other \) the simpler reading is that trump hasnt thought that much about this and is simply trying to reward and surround himself with people he feels served him well in the campaign its almost like a puzzle mystery , priebus told me last summer i dont recall what we were talking about , but priebus had a knack for homespun wisconsin logic and , particularly , throwaway lines that would stick with me i kept thinking of the puzzle mysteries that were playing out up and down trump tower , even though i showed up friday without an appointment with priebus and was confined to the lobby watching tourists ride up and down its now famous escalators priebus and i started talking last spring , as i was undertaking an article for this magazine about the seemingly fracturing state of the republican party we kept in touch during the campaign , drank the occasional miller high life in his office and exchanged the sporadic email priebus was constantly going on tv saying he was certain trump would win , even though he could read polls and precedents like everyone else still , he carried on as the chief carrier of trumps choppy water because thats what a party chairman does he smiles and spins and swallows his best laid plans and audibles in the name of getting his nominee to the finish line in a sense , priebus , who squired his future wife to a local g o p banquet on their first date , was the purest form of political hack that trump would rail against as he bulldozed the g o p for his efforts during the campaign , priebus gained the respect and gratitude of trump loyalists especially the fiercest loyalist , donald j trump himself he also won derision and ridicule he was the subject of multiple stories in the onion \( reince priebus smiles , shakes head while flipping through old briefing on g o p s plans for 2016 \) his spirited tv defenses of trumps indefensible behavior drew him comparisons to baghdad bob \( muhammad said al sahhaf \) , saddam husseins chief propagandist during the early months of the iraq war , whose dubious predictions of imminent victory despite growing devastation all around made him an international laughingstock long before trumps victory , back when it seemed like a long shot , i asked priebus whether he would consider taking a job in a trump administration maybe a plum ambassadorship to somewhere yes , he said wisconsin it was a throwaway answer to a throwaway question , which was laughably hypothetical anyway but i never had a sense he had thought that much about a trump administration job , besides possibly staying on as r n c chairman whether or not the donald prevailed for all his well honed sheepishness , priebuss just a kid from kenosha , wisc shtick belies a penchant for main stages , big ticket rooms and high level company no shortage of reince priebus photos hang on the walls of the r n c s headquarters on capitol hill he can be a little star struck he travels far and often to appear with candidates and party dignitaries at events where his presence is not necessarily required priebus was giddy when i spoke to him last spring as he prepared to attend a party for times 100 most influential people at lincoln center we were on the phone , him walking through the lobby of the j w marriott after a packed day of fund raising he sounded almost out of breath , less from exhaustion than what seemed like pure excitement he told me how stoked he was to meet the golfer jordan spieth and the pro wrestler turned actor the rock those are my top two , priebus said , especially the rock i was a big pro wrestling fan back in the day , he added , noting his childhood admiration for hulk hogan and mad dog vachon growing up in kenosha , wisc , being named to the top 100 list is a pretty cool thing , priebus told me at this point , i reminded him that no national party chairman would ever be named to the top 100 except in extraordinary circumstances like these and these were not particularly enviable ones the white house chief of staffs post is arguably the most grueling job in washington it would be a burnout caldron under even the most predictable and disciplined of presidents the average tenure of a white house chief of staff is about two years chief of staff jobs are so synonymous with thanklessness that a whole white house mythology surrounds them a good chief of staff is seldom popular , richard nixon wrote in his 1990 memoir he must see that his chief gets the credit for the administrations successes and must take the heat for its failures , even when they are not his fault he sometimes finds he doesnt have many friends or supporters some may well call him just a prat boy some may call priebus worse than that , and maybe already have eat rocks is an expression ive heard priebus use a few times it refers to being game to do what is needed swallowing pride and taking one \( or one thousand \) for the team if serving as r n c chairman in 2016 has been the definition of eating rocks , priebuss next gig could go down even harder its 24 7 and never stops , says andy card of the job he held in george w bushs white house for more than five years , making him the second longest serving chief of staff in history my only area of angst on priebus is that he has young children , card added , referring to priebuss son and daughter card has a few other concerns , one of which he says presented itself as soon as trump jumped all over megyn kelly in the first republican primary debate last year im thinking he would be a very hard president to work for if he doesnt accept people speaking candidly to him card , who remains close to the bush family and supported jeb bush for president , said the most important part of being a chief of staff is remembering that the staff part is far more important than the chief part the president is by far his most important client i know of one chief of staff who failed because he was used to being a principal , says beth myers , who served as mitt romneys chief of staff during his four years as governor of massachusetts priebus may not have that problem he has been described with that most anodyne term for a washington manager , the consensus builder but the white house chief of staff job is not so much about building consensus , card told me its all about serving the only principal who matters chief of staff is the only job in washington that really is defined by what the presidents idiosyncrasies are , card says are they a morning person or an evening person \? disciplined or not \? do they suffer fools kindly or not \? priebus and the future president elect had their dicey stretches , but their relationship grew as the campaign wore on trump told me over and over again , i trust reince , i trust him , priebus felt a need to tell me one day in his office last spring they have both proved a lot of people wrong and were both aggressively underestimated along the way , if not outright dismissed i dont buy this theory that unpredictable is necessarily bad , priebus said back when trump was just his ruffian nominee and not yet his future boss you cant appreciate the magnitude of priebuss changing loyalties until you consider just how much time , energy and dignity he expended before nov 8 trying to protect the party from being defiled by trump donald trump is donald trump , and the party is the party , priebus used to tell me during the campaign his ultimate allegiance was never in question it was only six years ago that priebus was happily ensconced in kenosha as chairman of the republican party of wisconsin now he is being described as the consummate washington insider in the trump white house he certainly has a line to republican officials , namely his close friend and fellow wisconsinite paul ryan but in the end , for priebus , its now all about serving trump , whose partisan impulses have proved flexible through the years let alone his allegiance to the g o p he ran , foremost , as a candidate of disruption he fashioned himself a dealmaker no doubt this could immediately run afoul of the conservative orthodoxy that has driven the republican agenda on capitol hill trump also vowed to drain the swamp of the bloodsucker lobbyists and blood money fund raisers , political hacks and various other parasites and hangers on that have fattened themselves so spectacularly in suck up city in many ways , these are priebuss people he has cavorted , fund raised and campaigned with them for years , attended their crack of dawn donors breakfasts and mediated their disputes he will most likely be looked upon as a chief emissary to the capitol hill , k street and donor constituencies that trump explicitly campaigned against the chief of swamp for his part , bannon has undertaken an incendiary mission over the years to upend the g o p establishment , no one more so than ryan \( a total and complete sellout of the american people , breitbart once declared , referring to ryans stewardship of house appropriations \) bannon could occupy something of a mysterious svengali role in the tradition of presumed all powerful presidential whisperers like karl rove \( for george w bush \) and valerie jarrett \( for barack obama \) both rove and jarrett represented wild cards in their respective white houses and regular thorns in the sides of the various chiefs of staffs with whom they served but one notable difference is that neither rove nor jarrett made it his or her goal to obliterate the establishments that their presidents were trying to fold themselves into nor did either have close ties to fringe elements of their parties , as bannon has to the so called alt right and its main platform breitbart has been described as a white ethno nationalist propaganda mill by the southern poverty law center the site has posted articles linking undocumented immigrants to disease , declared in a headline that birth control makes women unattractive and crazy , promoted the confederate flag \( hoist it high and proud the confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage \) and referred to gabby giffords as the gun control movements human shield bannon , who has tried to play down the most extreme elements of the alt right in recent days , nonetheless viewed trump as a kindred provocateur a feeling that appears mutual in one form or another , priebus will try to integrate his establishment orientations with these disruptive forces operating all around him back during the campaign , priebus used to refer admiringly to trump as an earthquake in a box in a separate conversation \( and metaphor \) , he described his challenge to me as keeping trump inside the funnel presumably this meant keeping him directed and contained , easier said than done , but still fascinating and somewhat entertaining to watch unfold in the campaign but with the presence of bannon and the weight of trump leading a nervous and divided nation , the challenge in the white house is considerably less entertaining to contemplate washington like the presidency , certainly creates its own distinct funnel that will shape trump and everyone around him in inexplicable and perhaps dark ways as it turned out , priebus never showed his face in the lobby of trumps building , at least when i was there like many key players inside trumps ragtag circle of collaborators , priebus has gone largely dark since election day , holing up in transition tower with occasional hops down to washington he was not responding to my emails and was described by gatekeepers as drinking from multiple fire hoses so for now , my most recent and enduring image of priebus is watching him beaming and red faced and a bit stunned on tv in the early hours of nov 9 a triumphant trump had just called him to the podium , declared him a superstar and compared him to secretariat but ill tell you , reince is really a star , trump exulted reince , come up here where is reince \? get over here , reince trump offered him the mike and insisted he say something there could be no more of a pinnacle moment for an avowed republican party animal who used to listen to newt gingrich speeches in the car as a teenager he would soon go from being one of the most dumped on figures in american politics to one of the most sucked up to insiders in a white house of insurgents ladies and gentleman , the next president of the united states , donald trump , was all priebus could muster there were worse images to dwell on before the drama intensified and puzzle mysteries inevitably presented themselves who knew what the nights result would lead to or what normal would become for any of the trumpians soon , or any of us \?
aman was on a train in japan , reading a novel set in japan the train slid past the mountains , bound for kyoto , where the man , bearded , bright eyed , was headed the year was 1989 the train was a bullet train the man on the train was in a quandary , and the man in the novel he was reading was in a quandary and as he read the novel , it emerged that his quandary and the one in the novel were essentially the same the man in the novel was sebastian rodrigues , a portuguese jesuit priest sent to japan in the 17th century he was there to minister to japanese catholics suffering under a brutal regime and also to find out what had happened to his mentor , a priest rumored to have renounced the faith under torture the man on the train was martin scorsese he was in japan to play the part of vincent van gogh in a movie by akira kurosawa , another master filmmaker he was also there to move past a brutal battle in americas culture wars over a picture of his , the last temptation of christ the film had been pilloried by conservative christians for a dream sequence in which christ has sex with mary magdalene in depicting christs life as a doubt ridden struggle between his human and divine natures , scorsese had intended to make a film that was at once an act of doubt and an act of faith in the novel he was reading , the priest was shown profaning an image of christ , and yet the act was an act of faith the train slid past the mountains scorsese turned the pages this novel spoke to him all at once he saw it as a picture he would like to make the novel was silence , by shusaku endo , a japanese convert steeped in european literature and the history of catholicism in japan published in japan in 1966 , silence sold 800 , 000 copies , a huge number in that country endo was called the japanese graham greene and was considered for the nobel prize greene referred to silence as one of the finest novels of our time the jesuit missionary francis xavier brought catholicism to japan in 1549 in the next century , it was suppressed through the torture of missionaries and their followers , who were forced to apostatize by stepping on the a piece of copper impressed with an image of christ in silence , endo took the missionaries point of view , casting much of the novel in the form of letters by rodrigues reporting back to his superior he goes to japan with another young priest , francisco garrpe , vowing to seek the truth about their mentor , father cristvo ferreira , but they are captured and shown the dogma defying reality of human suffering under torture the shogunate invites the japanese converts to avoid torture by stepping on the many do some are tortured anyway rodrigues sees converts crucified , burned alive , drowned a magistrate fluent in christianity makes a grim proposal rodrigues can save the lives of the converts under torture if only he will step on the and apostatize when scorsese returned from japan , he procured the film rights to silence as the years passed , hardly a day went by without his mentioning the project to the people around him actors , friends and even his old parish priest , father principe as he made the aviator and the departed , shutter island and hugo , he insisted that silence was the picture he really wanted to make a jesuit was elected pope islamic terrorists began targeting christians in the middle east in 2014 , with the wolf of wall street a hit , scorsese declared that silence would be his next picture he wouldnt commit to another until it was finished twenty six years in , filming began what led this great american artist to make a story of missionaries in japan his ultimate passion project \? he is known for his gangster pictures he is a grandmaster of the profane from the beginning , he has revealed himself to be an artist of intensely catholic preoccupations , and the poisoned arrow of religious conflict runs straight through his career taxi driver a vietnam vet as a spiritual avenger , bent on cleansing the city of filth through violence cape fear a tattooed fundamentalist determined to exact gods justice kundun a young man raised to be a spiritual master , thrust up against spirit killing communism even living in the material world , scorseses documentary about george harrison , takes as its theme the conflict between flesh and spirit , between beatle and seeker silence is a novel for our time it locates , in the missionary past , so many of the religious matters that vex us in the postsecular present the claims to universal truths in diverse societies , the conflict between a profession of faith and the expression of it , and the seeming silence of god while believers are drawn into violence on his behalf as material for scorsese , then , silence is apt , and yet scorseses commitment to it has been extraordinary , even by his exacting standards to understand that commitment , i spoke with the filmmaker , with members of the cast and the production team and with others who know the novel well trying to grasp just what kind of an act of faith this film is i dont know if theres redemption , but there is such a thing as trying to get it right , scorsese said to me , in the ungentrified new york voice familiar from the cameos in his movies but how do you do it \? the right way to live has to do with selflessness i believe that but how does one act that out \? i dont think you practice it consciously it has to be something that develops in you maybe through a lot of mistakes he had invited me to his east side townhouse at 9 p m , having spent a full day editing silence in midtown the living room , high ceilinged , oak paneled , is decorated with a vintage movie camera , billboard size posters for jean renoirs the grand illusion and photographs of his wife and daughter he is 74 , compact and gray , with tremendous life in his eyes and a youthful ardor that seems to have its source in reverence for his elders like the polish filmmaker andrzej wajda , who had signed a storyboard that scorsese unhooked from the wall to show me we took seats , and he began to talk as the hours passed , the room , already dark , seemed to diminish around us , until it resembled a screening room , or a chapel , a place where questions of how to live are posed through stories and images it goes back to what father principe was telling me the last time i saw him , a couple of years ago , he said failing , doing something that is morally reprehensible , that is a great sin well , many people will never come back from that but the christian way would be to get up and try again maybe not consciously , but you get yourself into a situation where you can make another choice and thats the situation rodrigues is in he can choose to save the lives of others by renouncing his faith , the act he considers most reprehensible of all silence , no less than scorseses informal new york trilogy mean streets , taxi driver , raging bull is rooted in his childhood as a boy in little italy , he wanted to be a missionary his parents were not religious , in part because their parents had felt the churchs heavy hand in sicily , but for him the church a malign force in so many coming of age stories was a portal to the world beyond family and neighborhood i trusted the church , because it made sense , what they preached , what they taught , he said i understood that theres another way to think , outside the closed , hidden , frightened , tough world i grew up in the movies , likewise , pointed to the wider world his father , a presser in the garment district , didnt make much but always had enough money to take him to the movies a local tv station broadcast italian films on friday nights he grew up watching the crucial works of italian neorealism , many of them with a strong catholic dimension like roberto rossellinis rome , open city , in which a priest is executed for cooperating with the resistance the italian american catholicism of the area was centered on street processions devoted to saints brought over from the old country san gandolfo for the sicilians on elizabeth street , san gennaro for the neapolitans on mulberry street when i was there , it was already dying out , scorsese told me it hooked him even so the vast , vaulted interior of st patricks old cathedral on mott street was a sharp contrast to the familys small apartment , the latin mass a formal counterpoint to their mealtime banter i think fast , i move fast , and i think it has something to do with the medication i was given for asthma , scorsese said it affected the way i breathe , the way i think i needed to pull back film did that for me , and so did the church they slowed me down they allowed me to meditate they gave me a different sense of time francis principe , a young priest assigned to the neighborhood , brought faith and film together he was the one who opened up things for us , scorsese recalled who said you dont have to live this way you dont have to follow in this cultural cycle you dont have to get married at 21 scorsese had become an altar boy , and each year principe would take the altar boys to a movie uptown around the world in 80 days , the bridge on the river kwai and sit talking about it with them afterward on the steps of the rectory on mulberry street they went to the roxy near times square to see the gospel drama the robe and then heard him put it down father principe detested christian sentimentality or comic book religious aspects , scorsese said oh , its so clich , he said , meaning the thunder when judas mentions his name , and theres the thunder in stereophonic sound to this day i havent heard thunder as good as that and yet at age 11 he conceived of the wish to do it differently , to take the biblical epic to another place faith and film offset the asthma that kept him out of sports and off the streets indoors , he drew movie storyboards , including some , a few years later , for a life of christ i set it right in the neighborhood , he told me , with the crucifixion taking place on the west side piers and the n y p d involved can you see it \? indoors , he had a front row seat for adult matters , especially his fathers dealings with a spendthrift uncle who seemed to take money from his father freely and with impunity to pay the loan shark it was a pattern he knew from the scripture passages read in church my brothers keeper its my brothers keeper ! he said , chortling with recognition and it goes beyond your brother are we responsible for other people \? what is our obligation , when somebody does something that is so upsetting \? do you really have to do it because theyre a brother , or youre related , or you made vows of marriage \? what is the right thing to do for the other person , and for yourself \? all of this carried through i would see it acted out one way in reality , and i would hear it another way from father principe and a couple of priests at cardinal hayes cardinal hayes is a high school in the bronx , and after a year of minor seminary a tryout for the priesthood once a regular stop for bright catholic boys of limited means scorsese went there \( don delillo , the novelist , was a few years ahead \) rejected by fordham university because of poor grades , scorsese enrolled at n y u s washington square college and its film program from there , he plunged into the 60s a concertgoer at the fillmore east , an expatriate in england and holland , an assistant director at woodstock \( he became an editor on the concert film \) and then a maker of his own movies whos that knocking at my door , about a young man in the suddenly liberated 60s whose catholic principles keep him out of bed with his girlfriend , and boxcar bertha , a film about a female rabble rouser freeer than most when he returned to little italy in 1972 to make mean streets , some of the young men in his generation were stepping into the underworld roles their fathers had occupied early in the picture , charlie , an entry level mobster played by harvey keitel , talks about going to confession in the old cathedral he wishes he could choose his own penance instead of having one assigned by the priest he gets his wish , in a way it falls to him to look out for johnny boy , played by robert de niro the lost boy of the neighborhood , a reckless gambler who puts them both in danger charlie becomes his brothers keeper and charlie , eager to rise in the mob , lets his friend dangle without reaching out to the powerful uncle who could save him pauline kael , in the new yorker , struck a biblical note charlie talks a lot to johnny boy about friendship and does nothing hes judas the betrayer it is striking to see the brothers keeper pattern show up at the other end of scorseses career , in silence as the two jesuits set out for japan , they find a translator named kichijiro in a seedy neighborhood and drag him into their mission he resists he drinks himself sick he lies he bemoans his fate a convert , he apostatized and was allowed to live , while the shogunate killed his brothers and sisters rodrigues decides that he is kichijiros keeper and grimly bears up as kichijiro apostatizes again and again and finally betrays him to the shogunate but as rodrigues is racked by doubts , the peasant becomes the priests keeper , a man whose faith is rooted in his recognition of his own weakness who is more christlike the person who is strong in faith or the one who is weak , who is humiliated \? humiliation thats the key , scorsese told me as kichijiro says in the movie where is the place for a weak person in the world were in \? why wasnt i born when there wasnt any persecution \? i would have been a great christian for half a century , scorsese has been a missionary for the cinema making his own movies , promoting the work of great international directors , consolidating the history of the medium in a brilliant group of documentaries and advocating for the preservation of classics over time , this picture of his about a missionary adventure became a mission in its own right , and the act of getting it made became an act of faith i knew he had this script and was terribly disappointed that he couldnt get it made , irwin winkler , who produced raging bull and goodfellas , told me and i thought , what a sad state hollywood is in when martin scorsese , with all his success , with all the honors hes gotten , cant get a movie made there began an intense collective effort guided by emma tillinger koskoff , the films producer , to make the project materialize winkler worked through dozens of legal disputes attached to the project randall emmett , a producer , secured new funding , and in 2013 scorsese and some associates went to cannes and returned with 21 million in distribution commitments i dont think hed ever done that before , koskoff told me , but for this picture he has done a lot of things he hadnt done before he would direct the picture without a fee all the principal actors andrew garfield , adam driver , liam neeson have action movie pedigrees but would work for screen actors guild scale or for greatly reduced fees \( a pittance , neeson called it , uncomplainingly \) paramount pictures signed on as the u s distributor in 2014 koskoff and the production designer dante ferretti scouted locations in vancouver , montreal , the pacific northwest and new zealand after four trips to taiwan , they decided that taiwan it would be for eight months in all , 750 people , cast and crew and production team , would put their faith in scorseses act of faith silence is a novel about the necessity of belief fighting the voice of experience , as scorsese has put it to get the jesuits beliefs right , he engaged the rev james martin , an author and editor at large of the jesuit weekly america filmmaker and priest had several colloquies at scorseses home , and martin worked intensively with garfield and driver just as de niro learned to box for raging bull , they familiarized themselves with the rites and disciplines of the jesuit priesthood to bring authenticity to their performances garfield , known for his role in two spider man movies , prepared to play father rodrigues by entering fully into the process that jesuits call spiritual direction raised outside london , with a secular jewish father , garfield developed his character by undergoing the spiritual exercises of st ignatius of loyola , the founder of the jesuit order the exercises , devised in the 1520s , invite the exercitant to use his imagination to place himself in the company of jesus , at the foot of the cross , among tormented souls in hell garfield met with martin for spiritual direction , and they swapped reflections via email and skype then he set out for st beunos , a jesuit house in wales , to undertake a seven day silent retreat if id had 10 years , it wouldnt have been enough to prepare for this role , garfield told me i got totally swept up in all things jesuit and very taken with jesuit spirituality the preparation went on for nearly a year , and by the time we got to taiwan , it was bursting out of me its not unusual for performers to allude vaguely to their spirituality but garfield describes the process with guileless specificity on retreat , you enter into your imagination to accompany jesus through his life from his conception to his crucifixion and resurrection you are walking , talking , praying with jesus , suffering with him and its devastating to see someone who has been your friend , whom you love , be so brutalized before garfield left for taiwan , martin gave him a cross he had received as a gift while a jesuit novice andrew got to the point where he could out jesuit a jesuit , martin told me there were places in the script where he would stop and say , a jesuit wouldnt say that , and we would come up with something else i dont think i am called to be a priest , garfield said to me resolutely , as if making this film had spurred him to consider the prospect but i had the feeling that i was being called to something called to work with one of the great directors , and called to this role as something i had to pursue for my spiritual development driver has played the unreliable boyfriend in girls and the villainous kylo ren in star wars the force awakens to play francisco garrupe \( garrpe in the novel \) , rodriguess slightly more skeptical companion , driver , who was raised a baptist in indiana , worked by analogy this movie is the story of a crisis of faith , he said , and explained that he tried to apply the ideas of faith and doubt generally it could be faith in your work , in the project or in a marriage it could be doubts about the work or the project or the marriage when you think about it that way , its very relatable so he related to faith and doubt and he lost nearly a third of his weight for the role fifty one pounds , he told me over black coffee its about control , and as an actor you want to have control but its also about suffering it gives you information you can use in the role he lost the weight over four and a half months , supervised by a nutrition coach early on , he spent a week at st beunos garfield was already two days into his retreat when driver arrived at the place , a victorian gothic pile where the jesuit poet gerard manley hopkins was once in residence pledged to silence , the two actors waved when they spied each other in the refectory liam neeson , raised catholic in ireland , brought to silence the insights he gained during the mission , roland joffs 1986 film about jesuit adventures in south america daniel berrigan , the jesuit poet and pacifist , was an adviser to that picture and celebrated mass with the actors neeson , de niro , jeremy irons on location in colombia neeson told me i remember father dan saying , do you know that stanislavski based his exercises for actors on the spiritual exercises of st ignatius \? id come all this way to hear that ! that had a real effect on me this time , in taiwan to play father ferreira the older jesuit who apostatized after being tortured neeson underwent a simulacrum of the torture , suspended upside down by ropes over a pit of excreta the japanese actor yoshi oida , determined to do his best to play a character crucified in the sea , hung on a cross as a wave machine pushed rising tides of water over him oida was 82 by the time driver filmed his final scene in which garrupe , long unseen , staggers into view , starved by his captors he was hallucinating from hunger i did the scene and hopped on a plane to new york to do a table reading for girls , he told me , and then began a regimen of triple breakfasts at a diner in brooklyn a o scott , now a chief film critic for the new york times , once wrote that scorsese approaches filmmaking as a priestly avocation , a set of spiritual exercises embedded in technical problems so it was with silence marty insists on having silence on the set , garfield told me the silence says something is happening here scorsese arranged the shooting script chronologically , so the cast could feel the characters emotions in sequence finally garfield reached the scene in which rodrigues steps on the , profaning the god he believes in and renouncing the faith he has come halfway across the world to preach actor and director prepared the shot a bare foot pressed to a piece of copper , the face of christ worn smooth by the feet of countless apostates before him its something we had both waited for , garfield said , but marty had waited much longer he had waited decades to film that scene the director was ready the priest stepped and then there was a technical difficulty i almost lost my mind , and i think marty did , too , garfield recalled he wanted it to be done in one take there was a second take , and the priest profaned the image of christ once and for all step by step , silence got made the picture scorsese saw in his head on the bullet train took 27 years and 46 5 million to realize all in gods good time , he said to me philosophically as we sat together in his house in the near dark it was one oclock in the morning we dont know why , but this is how this picture got made it had to be this way scorsese could speak philosophically , because he had been through all this before a passion project , religious in nature , based on a novel delays , funding difficulties and reluctance among studio executives such was the last temptation of christ , his adaptation of the novel by nikos kazantzakis when the novel was published in athens in 1955 , its conceit that jesus felt a temptation to climb down from the cross and live an earthly life with mary magdalene was seen as a challenge to conservative christianity , represented by the greek orthodox church by the time it reached the united states in english translation , the 60s were on , and the novel was taken up by the counterculture as a template for religious illumination through carnal knowledge scorsese read the novel in the 70s after it was given to him by barbara hershey and david carradine , the two stars of boxcar bertha by the time he set to making a movie adaptation , it was the reagan era , and the novel was again seen as a challenge to conservative christianity , then at full volume scorseses stated aims for the picture were straightforward he wanted to give the gospel story a contemporary accent , the way great artists like caravaggio had done and he wanted to fulfill his childhood vision and take the biblical epic to a different place but the project soon turned complicated beyond belief after committing to the picture in 1983 , paramount pictures began to have doubts scorsese shrank the shooting schedule \( planned for israel \) and the budget , agreeing to forgo his fee as fundamentalist christian leaders got wind of the project , they organized a hostile letter writing campaign against paramounts parent company , gulf and western salah hassanein , the head of united artists , then the second largest movie theater chain , declared that u a wouldnt show the picture on its screens , citing trouble with the life of brian and other christian themed films , as well as with a film called mohammed messenger of god that had prompted bomb threats in an agonizing meeting with scorsese and studio executives , paramounts chief , barry diller , canceled the picture by now scorseses intentions for it were a good deal more complicated i told him that god cant be only in the hands of the churches , he later said , recalling the meeting with hassanein there are so many obstacles in between us and the spirit in a sense , to make this film was to try to make god accessible to people in the audience who feel alienated from the churches i said i have had three divorces does this mean i cant speak to god because the church says i cant \? no , no ! i can talk for myself because im me angry and restive , he took on two projects initiated by others after hours , set in lower manhattan , and the color of money , a pool hall drama starring paul newman and tom cruise the color of money grossed 52 million the biggest hit hed ever had emboldened , he switched agents to newmans agent , michael ovitz , the head of creative artists agency mike said what is it you want to get done \? what is the film you really want to get made \? i said , the last temptation of christ and he said , o k and i said , ive heard that before ovitz swiftly got last temptation greenlighted at universal scorsese filmed in morocco with willem dafoe as jesus , harvey keitel as judas , david bowie as pontius pilate and barbara hershey as mary magdalene what happened next still stands as a central episode in the culture wars as scorsese worked round the clock to edit the picture , the religious right moved against it donald wildmon , a right wing instigator and head of the american family association , organized a picketing campaign at universal pictures in los angeles the rev r l hymers jr of the baptist tabernacle of los angeles did the same outside the home of lew wasserman , the chairman of mca , which owned universal the leader of the campus crusade for christ , bill bright , offered to buy the film from universal in order to destroy it universal moved up the films release date and took out full page newspaper ads in its support in an interview with reporters in rome , the italian director franco zeffirelli , who hadnt seen the movie , called it truly horrible and completely deranged reports attributed to him a remark that the movie was the product of hollywoods jewish scum zeffirelli denied this , but the notion took root that the movie was the sinister work of a cabal of jewish movie executives conspiring against the christian faith the day the film had its premiere at the ziegfeld aug 12 , 1988 hundreds of picketers were there so were several television news crews after the premiere , scorsese recalled to me , a group of us went to dinner at the regency hotel the group included universal executives the celebrated director michael powell scorseses longtime editor and collaborator , thelma schoonmaker and prominent christians who had supported the movie paul moore , the episcopal bishop of new york , had written a letter to the new york times declaring that the movie dramatized the core church teaching that jesus is both fully human and fully divine at the regency , moore told scorsese about a book he should read the next day he had it sent over silence , by shusaku endo in egypt , syria , pakistan , china , and elsewhere , the persecution of christians often to the point of martyrdom is real and continuing since the sept 11 attacks , the word martyr has taken on awful new connotations silence , then , is inadvertently topical like the novel , the picture interrogates the very idea of christian martyrdom , by proposing that there are instances when martyrdom the believer holding fast to christ to the bitter end is not holy or even right it makes in the way of art the arguments made in defense of last temptation that an act cant be fully understood if the intentions behind it arent taken into account , and that a seeming act of profanation can be an act of devotion if done out of an underlying faith at a dramatic moment in the novel , rodrigues hears the cries of christians who are being tortured outside his cell he has been told that he can save their lives if he will step on the he agonizes he prays he feels the offer as a temptation weary , hungry , surrounded by suffering and death , he hears a voice he takes to be jesus trample ! it was to be trampled on by men that i was born into this world the novel poses a very profound theological question , peter c phan , a catholic theologian at georgetown who was born in vietnam , told me the question is this are we allowed to do an essentially evil act to obtain a good result \? if it is done to save himself , then the answer is no but the novel is so complex because he does it for his followers , for the good end of saving his flock he will go to hell but he will go to hell for their sake rodrigues tramples on the because his intention is right to save the lives of others the act seems right and because it entails the sacrifice of his exalted sense of himself , it seems a christian act , a loss of self for others sake the novel doesnt work through theological questions so scholastically rather , it enfolds them within other questions whether missionary activity is ipso facto a form of imperialism , and whether the content of a religious faith is lost in translation when it is promulgated in a new language in a new land should the church adapt to particular cultures , or should it maintain an approach distinctively its own \? in christian theology , that is a question of inculturation since the council of jerusalem when the apostles , jews by birth , clashed over whether new christians should be held to jewish law the history of christianity has turned on questions of inculturation the brilliance of silence is that it shows how these questions increase and multiply the young jesuits seem to favor inculturation , adopting peasant dress , taking the sacraments directly to the people and calling their hut the monastery a magistrate a figure akin to dostoyevskys grand inquisitor tells rodrigues that christianity cannot take root in the swamp that is japan when rodrigues finally meets him , ferreira concurs the converts \? they are breakaway buddhists , the apostate priest says they worship the sun of god , not the son of god those martyrs , dying upside down in the pit \? they didnt die for christ , he tells rodrigues , they died for you for all that , silence is itself a complex act of inculturation a novel , featuring a european priests point of view , that could not have been written by anyone but a japanese the , too , is an expression of inculturation , a point developed in a new book by the artist makoto fujimura it is an image of god devised by the shogunate for the purpose of abuse , but over the course of the novel , it becomes an authentic image of christ under threat , the converts abuse it they renounce their faith but that doesnt mean they stop believing they keep hidden faith in mysterious ways scorseses own body of work is a strong argument for inculturation , in that he instinctively finds religious patterns and images in modern , urban , vulgar , dispirited society his silence is an act of cultural adaptation \( some would call it appropriation \) to the third degree here an italian american catholic adapts a japanese catholics novel about portuguese catholics for a hollywood movie arguably american cultures most distinctive art form and yet scorseses silence suggests that inculturation of the usual kind is impossible instead , it makes vivid the idea that the act called apostasy can be a shrewd adaptation of religious faith to a hostile culture , and that faith maintained in spite of a believers outward acts of apostasy is faith nonetheless the question the novel comes down to , then , is this are you a christian \? this question , posed by garrpe to the peasant kichijiro , is one that rodrigues must answer for himself before he approaches the , and long after he tramples on it it is a question that cannot be answered for the would be believer by the church , or a mentor , or society the novel is not about a missionarys struggle with a hostile culture when the magistrate says as much , rodrigues denies it no , no unconsciously the priest raised his voice as he spoke my struggle was with christianity in my own heart before it opens in new york and los angeles in december , silence will be screened in rome for several hundred jesuits and for cinephiles at the vatican its no stretch to suppose that pope francis , a jesuit himself , will find a way to be there scorsese assuredly will be there , and its striking to envision him sitting in the dark with the pope as his new picture plays their boyhoods were a lot alike six years older , jorge mario bergoglio was brought up in buenos aires in a family of italian immigrants who took him to the movies often , and he grew up cherishing italian cinema , especially fellinis la strada a film about the possibility of sainthood , scorsese calls it i asked scorsese how he would describe his work to pope francis he paused , then replied , i would say that ive tried , in my work , to find out how to live life tried to explore what our existence really is and the meaning of it one day not long ago , scorsese stepped out of a black car in front of the old cathedral he had on an overcoat , a scarf and a broad brimmed hat he tightened the scarf , pulled the hat low and stood near the graveyard adjoining the cathedral we used to play hide and seek right here , he said you could hide behind the gravestones you knew which ones were the right size for you little italy today is largely symbolic territory , like the vatican within italy the old ravenite social club a headquarters for the gambino crime syndicate is now a cydwoq shoe tique chinatown , once south of canal street , extends most of the way up mott street at the catholic churches , mass is offered in vietnamese and cantonese scorsese looked up mott street toward houston street where the korean restaurant is , that used to be a two family house past it was a funeral home the funeral procession would come out and bear the coffin along the sidewalk here and into the cathedral i remember two kids from the neighborhood , 16 or 17 they died of cancer , and the families had to be carried from the funeral home to the church , they were so devastated it was terrible ill never forget it inside the old cathedral , it became clear how literally scorsese has never forgotten not the splendor of the church , nor the presence of suffering and death , sin and redemption , nearby the pastor pointed out the details of a renovation the saints retouched in their original colors , the marble and brass altar fixtures restored to the way they were before a 1970 modernizing effort scorsese , who left the neighborhood in 1965 , didnt need a guide he knew every inch of the place picture an 8 year old boy standing right here in a white cassock , reciting a prayer in latin , he mused aloud thats me the closing scenes of his silence follow rodrigues through the decades after he apostatizes a priest no more , rodrigues represents the shogunate in its dealings with traders from europe what is his inner life \? what does he believe \? working from the imagination rather than from the text of the novel , scorsese found a final image , subtle but not cryptic , for the characters position and its an image that suggests the nature of scorseses own engagement with matters of faith i asked him to draw a connection between silence and what he was seeing in the old cathedral he tapped his forehead with two fingers the connection is that it has never been interrupted its continuous i never left in my mind , i am here every day
seoul , south korea a popular south korean singer , lee seung chul , recently posted on twitter what he called a sad joke that reflected public outrage over a scandal involving the countrys president , park geun hye if hillary is elected , the united states will have its first female president if trump is elected , it will have its first crazy president , went the joke , which was widely shared online south korea got both in 2012 ms parks 2012 victory was hailed as a milestone for south koreas deeply patriarchal society but four years later , pressure is mounting across the country and even from within her party for ms park to step down or face impeachment this week , she became south koreas first sitting president to be accused by prosecutors of a criminal conspiracy the scandal surrounding ms park has left many south korean women infuriated with the president and fearful that it could be used to argue that women are unfit to lead they worry that the country , already among the lowest in global gender equality rankings , could become even more resistant to elevating women to positions of power we have had more than our share of outrageous male politicians , said kim yun jeong , 22 , who had a placard that said park geun hye , out ! at a recent demonstration in seoul , the capital but i feel men now saying , behind our back and with a smirk on their faces see ! this is what we get when we have a woman president for a change ms parks troubles stem from her decades of ties to choi soon sil , a daughter of choi tae min , the founder of a fringe religious sect who befriended ms park in the 1970s ms choi was indicted sunday on charges of using her influence with ms park to extort millions from businesses prosecutors said ms park was an accomplice of ms choi , but she is protected by the constitution from criminal indictment ms park has agreed to submit to an inquiry but on tuesday , her lawyer , yoo yeong ha , tried to use ms parks gender as a shield , saying that she was a woman before being president and that her privacy as a woman should be protected from prosecutors who sought to question her womens groups were having none of it they are not investigating her privacy as a woman but her acts of destroying constitutional order as president , a group of womens advocacy organizations said in a joint statement \( mr yoo declined to elaborate on what ms parks privacy had to do with the investigation \) south koreas women have been just as loud as its men in denouncing ms park recent polls have found her to be deeply unpopular among both men and women and in the huge protests that have filled central seoul over the past four weekends , women have often led peaceful marches an unusual sight in south korea , where anti government demonstrations often feature men clashing with riot police officers during a nov 12 rally that attracted one million people by some estimates , a student from the sacred heart girls high school in seoul , ms parks alma mater , took the podium you have become an object of shame for us , the student said of ms park , prompting wild cheers from the crowd we can no longer tolerate you representing our nation although ms park is often called south koreas first female president , that label fails to capture the complicated ways in which people here regard her presidency ms park has never been considered a champion of womens rights , either as the president or as a legislator before that according to kim young soon , a leader at the korean womens associations united , gender inequality has actually worsened under ms park , with sex crimes on the rise and a growing wealth gap taking a harder toll on women her presidential campaign was aimed at securing the support of older conservatives who still revered her father , the military dictator park chung hee , for leading the country out of poverty in the 1960s and 70s many saw in ms park a modern version of her charismatic father south koreans like to say that they see ms park not as a female president but as park chung hees daughter that places her in a peculiar and precarious position in south korea , where patriarchy rules the political and corporate worlds a widely shared twitter post last year summed up the challenges ms park has faced in the shadow of her fathers legacy and with the cultural misgivings over female leaders when president park geun hye does well , she wears the clothes of park chung hee but when she does badly , she becomes a woman so far , ms parks gender has not been an outright issue in the scandal , but it has colored the outrage older conservative men who have turned against ms park since the scandal often disdainfully refer to her as an unfilial daughter online , men have attacked ms

politics , a feminist group said last week , protesting what it called gender prejudices tainting the campaign against ms park ms park has seldom spoken of her gender but she has styled herself after her mother , yuk young soo , who is seen as a symbol of feminine sacrifice among older koreans the former first lady was fatally shot in 1974 by a pro north korean assassin who had targeted her husband for decades , ms parks hairstyle has reminded people of her mother she has also built a muscular political reputation in what some analysts have called an attempt to dispel the notion that a female leader would be weak on security issues she has been hawkish on north korea , predicting its collapse and promising military retaliation if provoked at home , she has been a disciplinarian , stressing national order and calling her critics unclean forces her upbringing and manners have led critics to accuse her of acting with a sense of entitlement those accusations have carried a powerful punch in south korea , where many have grown disillusioned with so called imperial male leaders in politics and in the corporate world , and expected a less rigid style from the first female president many of the most bitter criticisms have come from other women ms park once sat motionless in the rain , waiting for an aide to step forward and pull her hood over her head , according to the

president elect donald j trumps wife , melania , and their 10 year old son , barron , will not immediately move to the white house after mr trump takes office in january , out of concern for uprooting barron in the middle of the school year , transition officials said on sunday ms trump and barron will remain in new york for at least another six months , the officials said speaking to reporters on sunday at his golf course in bedminster , n j , mr trump said they would join him very soon after hes finished with school mr trump said he would move to the white house still , with his family remaining at trump tower , the likelihood may increase that mr trump will spend part of the week in new york jason miller , a spokesman for mr trump , said , no official statement has been released by the trump family regarding transition timing , but like any parents , they are concerned about pulling their 10 year old son out of school in the middle of the year mr miller urged that the same privacy and security considerations given to previous first families with regard to minor children be extended to the trumps as well the new york times previously reported that ms trump was planning to move to the white house eventually but was concerned about disrupting her sons routine the new york post reported on sunday that she and barron would not join her husband immediately after the inauguration for all of the enthusiasm that the president elect displayed on the campaign trail , ms trump , a former model , never shared in it she did not join her husband other than for major events like the republican national convention , and she granted few interviews she is the main caregiver for their son , who attends a private school in manhattan and is taken there most days by his mother she is said to be concerned not just about the potential disruption to her sons life , but also about bringing him closer to the news media spotlight people who know her have said she plans to revisit the issue at the end of the school year the situation is similar in ways to the one michelle obama faced in 2008 after her husband was elected mrs obama also did not care for the attention that came with the campaign , and she was said to be considering remaining in chicago with their two daughters but she ultimately made the move with their children mr trump and his aides have not said whether he plans to move to the white house full time but he has told aides he would like to be in new york when he can keeping trump tower as a residence for the incoming presidents family will create security and logistical hurdles for the secret service and the police department the tower is on fifth avenue , a major thoroughfare
friday night , the facebook co founder mark zuckerberg went on his vast social network to convince an expanding chorus of critics including the departing president of the united states that he honest to goodness wants to combat the fake news that is running wild across his site and others , and turning our politics into a paranoiac fantasy come to life weve been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility seriously , he wrote weve made significant progress , but there is more work to be done , he continued , listing various steps facebook was taking , like making it easier to report bad information and enlisting fact checking organizations it was heartening to hear , especially after his earlier assertion that it was crazy to believe that misinformation on facebook had affected the presidential election in any real way despite copious evidence that it was disturbingly in the mix , whether it directly swung the result or not but as mr zuckerberg went on to say that facebook had to be careful not to mistakenly block accurate content , he added this we do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves , which was why he said facebook would continue to rely on our community and trusted third parties his statement pointed up how much facebook struggles to find the balance between its mission to be a free expression utopia for its 1 8 billion users and its responsibility to protect them from all that is defamatory , dangerous \( like terrorist propaganda \) and untrue but more to the point , it appeared to buy into the notion that truth is relative at a time when that notion has to finally go away do you really need an outside arbiter to determine whether a video suggesting without basis that hillary clinton was involved in john f kennedy jr s fatal plane crash in 1999 should be allowed to stand \? truth doesnt need arbiters it needs defenders and it needs them now more than ever as the american democracy staggers into its next uncertain phase with a mainstream news media that works hard to separate fact from fiction under economic and political threat , facebook which has contributed to that economic threat by gobbling up so much of the online advertising market is going to have a special responsibility to do its part just imagine what things will look like if the unsavory elements that tore through the 2016 election false narratives , fake news and aggressive efforts to delegitimize traditional journalism come back into play as donald j trump presses to enact his agenda if the past week provided any indication of where politics are going , the next four years are going to require an all hands on deck effort to keep the national conversation honest the national security adviser mr trump named last week , michael t flynn , a retired army lieutenant general , has subscribed to the conspiracy theory that shariah law is taking root in the united states \( it isnt \) , contributing to his insistence that americans have every reason to view islam as a threat he recently used twitter to circulate a fake news item that the federal bureau of investigation was sitting on evidence from anthony weiners laptop that would put hillary and her crew away for life mr trumps nominee for attorney general , senator jeff sessions of alabama , has falsely claimed that hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants are successfully crossing the border annually then there was the announcement by the conspiracy theorist alex jones that mr trump had called to thank him and his radio and internet audience for their support in the campaign add to that the fact that mr trump was the most prominent promoter of the false notion that president obama wasnt born here , and didnt hesitate to repeat the outrageous suggestion that the father of senator ted cruz was linked to the assassination of president john f kennedy then consider what it may look like when mr trump pursues policies regarding muslim immigrants and undocumented immigrants its not so outlandish to envision mr trumps attempts to sell his plans getting a lift from the likes of mr jones or a fake site out of macedonia perhaps claiming that democrats are working with isis to use undocumented immigrants to poison local water supplies or some such president obama seemed to have had something like that in mind when he told reporters in germany on thursday , if we are not serious about facts and whats true and whats not , and if we cant discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda , then we have problems mr obama knows of what he speaks he had to muddle through the first wave of this you might remember how his health care plan was marred by a false accusation that the plan included so called death panels that would decide who lived and who died based on their level of productivity to society , as former gov sarah palin put it \( on her facebook page ! \) the false death panel allegation was partly based on proposals to reimburse doctors for optional consultations with families over end of life care decisions the accusations took on such power that even newt gingrich signed on to the falsehood despite the fact that he had previously expressed bullish support for end of life planning \( he explained himself in a 2009 letter to the new york times \) news organizations , including this one , debunked the myth but the bills authors stripped out the provision just the same and by then the death panel fiction had negated any shot at a reasoned , ideological debate as dan pfeiffer , who was the presidents chief communications strategist at the time , so grimly put it to me last week , the faux death panels were the canary in the coal mine about the coming death of truth things have advanced since then todays fake news is limited only by the imaginations of its inventors and the number of shares it can garner on facebook or twitter \( to wit the one million shares of the preposterous notion that mrs clinton secretly sold weapons to isis buzzfeed news which has excelled at illuminating the fake news problem highlighted that example in its alarming analysis showing that during the campaign cycle fake news was shared among facebook users more often than real news was \) thats why people who care about the truth citizens , journalists and , lets hope , social media giants like facebook , too will have to come up with a solution to this informational nihilism , fast its easier said than done the combination of attacks seeking to delegitimize serious news organizations and a drop in overall trust in the news media has made many people wary of legitimate fact checking and , as my colleague john herrman noted last weekend , politicized voices can easily drown honest journalism all too easily on social media there is growing talk of an ambitious journalistic collaboration to beat back the tide industry thinkers and leaders are coming together online to brainstorm solutions , as jeff jarvis , the city university of new york journalism professor , and eli pariser , the upworthy co founder , have done \( check them out online \) and id say its high time that television news with its still huge audiences gets into the act with more than just token gestures at fact checking but this much seems clear the moment calls for some sort of hyperfactual counterinsurgency that treats every false meme as a baby hitler to be killed in its crib with irrefutable facts so hey , zuck , lets roll
for a brand seeking to reach the podcast listening public , there is one thing better than sponsoring a hit series creating your own general electric pulled it off last year with its quaintly named ge podcast theater its eight part science fiction thriller the message , produced with the panoply podcasting network , hit no 1 on the itunes podcast chart and had nearly five million downloads now comes lifeafter , a futuristic 10 episode drama , the first installment of which was released this month it tells the story of a low level worker at the federal bureau of investigation who is obsessed with the traces of life his dead wife left behind on social media , particularly a fictional audio service the first episode kicks off with what sounds like an ad for that service but perhaps thats a wink of sorts as with the message , a notable detail in this branding experiment is that the sponsoring brand is , by design , almost never mentioned distributing and helping create such sponsor content has been part of panoplys business for a while think of it as a variation on the so called native advertising or branded content now so familiar online material flagged as having been paid for , but crafted to resemble editorial content according to matt turck , panoplys chief revenue officer , the company has produced more than 100 episodes of custom podcast series for brands including purina , umpqua bank , prudential and starbucks its been an important part of our business , he said it generates revenue and differentiates us in the marketplace that last part may change for example , another podcast network , gimlet media , now has a unit called gimlet creative , which this year created a six episode branded podcast for ebay called open for business panoply spun out of the podcast unit of the online magazine slate in 2015 , positioning itself as a platform for shows produced with partners like the wall street journal and vox , as well as its own roster of programs relatively quickly , mr turck said , the possibility of sponsored shows was added to the mix g e , which previously worked with slate custom , the sites sponsored content division , and became intrigued by podcasting , ended up being one of the first examples but its approach has been distinct most sponsored podcasts follow a fairly traditional hosts and interviews format the decision to turn the message into a multipart series was inspired in part by the runaway success of the true crime podcast serial but the fictional form was an attempt to do something different a new way of reprising the kind of radio dramas of the 30s , 40s , 50s , said alexa christon , head of media innovation for g e \( the name ge podcast theater echoes general electric theater , an anthology series on radio and television in the 1950s and early 1960s that was hosted by ronald reagan \) one of the plot twists in the message its story unfolded as a fake podcast documenting efforts to decode an alien communiqu was loosely inspired by sound therapy technology that g e is working on but since that connection is never mentioned , most listeners probably never got it the name ge podcast theater is noted at the beginning and end of the series , and on the cover art people see when playing an episode on smartphones but thats it andy goldberg , g e s chief creative officer , said this was in line with the companys branded entertainment work in other media such as the six episode science series breakthrough , made last year in collaboration with the national geographic channel too many references to the sponsor turns people off , mr goldberg said people knew it was ge podcast theater , he said , suggesting that listeners gave the company a lot of credit for keeping a light touch backing up that assertion is tricky one of the widely noted shortcomings of podcast advertising is the dearth of detailed audience data outside of download numbers , ms christon said , g e judged the success of the message partly by way of the organic groups that have sprung up in places like reddit , swapping plot theories and even generating fan fiction g e used a similar method to create lifeafter the internal marketing group zeroed in on the companys digital twin research , which seeks to precisely replicate physical objects \( like a specific aircraft engine \) applying that idea to humans was a jumping off point for a fictional story , fleshed out in collaboration with the creative agency bbdo , the agency giant spoon and panoply panoply essentially runs the production out of its studios , with its team of sound engineers and producers , helping recruit writers \( it brought in the playwright mac rogers for the message \) and voice actors this was the most collaborative effort that ive worked on , said mr turck of panoply of course , the success of the message added some pressure and the more crowded the podcast market becomes including a wave of fiction shows the harder it is to break through weve got very high expectations , mr turck said , adding that the first episode of lifeafter cracked the top 20 on itunes within a week of its release the most prominent form of podcast sponsorship remains the familiar advertising break , often referring to specific instructions for listeners to get a discount or other offer a direct response style that makes ad performance more bluntly measurable but mr turck says plenty of clients want to experiment he points to prudentials moneymind project with panoply , which involves taking a finance themed sponsored quiz on slate that leads to a podcast episode chosen according to your answers some marketers want to brainstorm , others want advice attitudes vary on formats and how heavy handed the branding should be the only thing thats consistent , he said , is that theres just more and more interest neither g e nor panoply would disclose specifics about costs , but mr goldberg acknowledges that compared with , say , film or tv , even a slick sounding podcast is not a massive expense and despite the challenges in measuring the impact , it also means an opportunity for g e to insert itself , however obliquely , into broader cultural conversations lifeafter will ultimately address such trendy topics as artificial intelligence and the possibility of a digital afterlife its a means , ms christon said , for doing something the best advertising always strives for capitalizing on the zeitgeist
kanye west likened himself to donald j trump at a concert on saturday in california before tumbling into a 17 minute , free associative speech addressing radio programmers , mtv , his friends and collaborators jay z and beyonc , hillary clinton , mark zuckerberg and more after getting an array of grievances off his chest from real world politics to awards show politics mr west ended the performance with a microphone drop , having played only three songs , leaving fans bitter and upset , according to reactions on social media its a new world , hillary clinton , its a new world , mr west said from his floating platform stage above the crowd feelings matter because guess what \? everybody in middle america felt a way and they showed you how they felt the brief concert , at the golden 1 center in sacramento , came two nights after mr west shocked his audience by announcing at a show in san jose , calif , that he had not voted , but would have cast a ballot for mr trump if he had though the rapper affirmed his belief in the importance of issues like black lives matter and womens rights , he praised mr trumps method of communication as very futuristic on saturday night , in a trademark polemic the likes of which had been mostly absent from his current saint pablo tour , mr west doubled down on his embrace of trump like political incorrectness and opined on the state of the media yeah , im taking his lead , mr west said of the president elect a lot of people here tonight felt like they lost , the rapper began you know why \? because yall been lied to google lied to you facebook lied to you radio lied to you turning his focus on the music industry , mr west questioned gatekeepers for promoting songs by drake but not frank ocean , and wondered once again why he is often overlooked at awards shows referring to this years mtv video music awards , mr west pulled back the curtain on what he said was the political behind the scenes dealings that go into booking celebrities for such events beyonc , i was hurt because i heard that you said you wouldnt perform unless you won video of the year over me and over hotline bling , he said sometimes we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win , he continued ive been sitting here to give yall my truth even at the risk of my own life even at the risk of my own success , my own career however , mr west said , such truth telling was necessary for real progress obama couldnt make america great because he couldnt be him to be who he was , he said black men have been slaves obama wasnt allowed to do this the rapper screamed and still win he had to be perfect but being perfect dont always change things when more music failed to follow the impromptu stump speech , disappointed fans turned to social media to demand refunds on sunday , the golden 1 center announced that ticketholders would be paid back in full , including ticketmaster fees on monday , a representative for mr west said that remaining dates on the second leg of the saint pablo tour have been canceled even amid his raw , spontaneous and sometimes rambling monologue , mr west seemed to know he was courting controversy im not always going to say things the perfect way , the right way , he said but im going to say how i feel he added , get ready to have a field day , press get ready , get ready because the shows over
beijing zhou yunfei , a technology executive who owns a villa in eastern china , did not have much in common with an impoverished farmer more than 500 miles away who was convicted of murdering a village chief with a nail gun but when mr zhou heard last week that the chinese government had executed the farmer , jia jinglong , he was furious he saw it as a sign that the ruling communist party was imposing harsh punishments on the most vulnerable members of society while coddling the well connected elite the legal system isnt fair , mr zhou , 57 , said , adding that local officials had turned against the common people president xi jinping has made restoring confidence in chinese courts a centerpiece of his rule , vowing to promote social justice and equality in a legal system long plagued by favoritism and abuse since coming to power in 2012 , he has led a high profile campaign against corruption , ensnaring thousands of low level officials and even some of the partys most senior leaders but the furor over the execution of mr jia , who had sought revenge on officials for demolishing his home , has raised doubts about mr xis efforts , with people across the country publicly assailing inequities in the justice system and asking why high level officials often escape the death penalty the perception is that the people are powerless and vulnerable against corrupt officials , said fu hualing , a law professor at the university of hong kong what is surprising is that xi jinping has been in power for four years , and that narrative has not changed the uproar has placed the party , which is working to tighten its grip on courts while promoting the idea of fairness , in an awkward position mr xi has cultivated an image as a champion of the people willing to take on corrupt officials of any stripe yet mr jias case has reawakened concerns , especially among rural residents and members of the urban working class , that the communist party is protecting its own members in fiery social media posts and dinner table conversations , some have argued for making punishments against corrupt officials more severe others have suggested that china , believed to be the worlds top executioner , should substantially reduce its use of the death penalty against impoverished citizens chinas leaders seem conflicted about how to respond to complaints of unfair treatment , which have plagued the judiciary for decades but have taken on new urgency as mr xi attempts a top to bottom overhaul of the system on the one hand , party leaders might be wary of exacerbating the anger felt by many chinese people , who often side with villagers like mr jia , seeing them as folk heroes standing up against venal forces at the same time , beijing might not want to be seen as endorsing an attack on a government official and some party leaders may not like the idea of setting a precedent for using the death penalty against senior officials , at a time when critics of mr xi say he is using the anticorruption campaign to go after political enemies theres a strong incentive for the elite within the party to protect itself , said jerome a cohen , a new york university law professor people realize today theyre free , but tomorrow they could be the targets in recent days , the partys hesitation has seeped into public view the government at first appeared to tolerate , and even encourage , debate about mr jias case lawyers issued open letters pointing to flaws in the prosecutions argument , and state media outlets published sanctimonious editorials calling for the court to show humanity but as discontent spread on social media in the days leading up to mr jias execution , the government reversed course and began censoring some online discussions about the case state run media organizations adopted a scolding tone , warning that public opinion had hijacked the case peoples daily , the partys flagship newspaper , went a step further , arguing that citizens should not express contrarian views about court cases in public we can see that online public opinion can deviate from reason and even become a terrifying tool that kills humanity and conscience , an editorial in the newspaper said while the government has historically tolerated some debate about judicial decisions , mr xi has generally sought to rein in dissent , especially when it gathers force online li wei , an activist in beijing who was imprisoned for two years under mr xi for helping organize protests demanding financial disclosures from party leaders , circulated a four page petition online in late october calling for mr jia to be spared and for the government to adopt a more humane justice system soon his cellphone was buzzing with messages from university students , professors , security guards and others he gathered 1 , 274 signatures over a few days , he said , before the authorities shut down his social media accounts the so called anticorruption campaign is not genuine , mr li , 45 , said in an interview at a beijing teahouse the reason why they were doing this is because they want to salvage the communist party regime chinese leaders appear to be working to counter perceptions that officials are being treated with kid gloves over the past year , party leaders have vowed to consider punishing officials who commit grave crimes , including stealing more than about 436 , 000 , with the death penalty they have also introduced new forms of punishment aimed at corrupt officials , including lifetime jail sentences without the possibility of parole but the government has yet to systematically invoke any of those punishments against prominent officials and critics can point to a raft of recent cases in which powerful people and their families escaped the death penalty there is the example of zhou yongkang , chinas former security chief , who was sentenced to life in prison last year for taking bribes and revealing state secrets he was the most senior leader to be jailed for corruption in more than 65 years of communist rule and many people note the case of gu kailai , the wife of one of chinas most prominent politicians , whose death sentence for the murder of a british business associate was commuted to life in prison last year fan zhewang , 42 , a teacher of maoism at xian university of posts and telecommunications in central china , said the treatment of ms gu epitomized the inequities in the system mr fan said that while the governments decision to execute mr jia was legal , he was concerned that a lingering sense of injustice and resentment among villagers would prompt more violence against officials in the future , mr fan said , i worry that people will just kill whole families of village chiefs on wednesday , a day after mr jia was executed , a farmer in yanan , a northwestern city celebrated as a stronghold of the communist revolution , was arrested and charged with killing a village official and several of his relatives , according to local reports the man was said to be angry after officials seized his land in the days after the execution of mr jia , friends and relatives in his village in the northern province of hebei circulated a poem he wrote while in prison in which he described being in a dreamlike state ill miss the smell of flowers , he wrote , and the serenity of grass , something i love villagers said they did not want to talk about the case anymore a man who gave his last name as li said residents had grown accustomed to suffering injustices at the hands of wealthy government officials who do you turn to in order to vent your anger \? he said theres no one we can seek help from many people are angry , he added , but we dont dare speak up
jerusalem dogged for decades by scandals ranging from the funding of family trips to enormous ice cream bills , prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel is again under scrutiny , this time over a billion dollar deal with germany for the acquisition of three new submarines political opponents are calling for an inquiry into what they view as the murky circumstances surrounding the framework agreement reached with germany over the past year , apparently at mr netanyahus urging , to buy the boats mr netanyahu , one of israels longest serving prime ministers , who is now serving a fourth term in office , faces allegations of a possible conflict of interest within his inner circle in making the deal the issue came to light when israels channel 10 news reported last week that mr netanyahus personal lawyer also represents the israeli agent of the german shipyard that builds the submarines , thyssenkrupp marine systems both mr netanyahu and the lawyer , david shimron , have denied any impropriety the security of israel requires the acquisition of submarines and the renewal of the submarine fleet , mr netanyahu said on sunday in remarks broadcast at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting increasing the security and strength of the state of israel is the only consideration that guided me in acquiring the submarines the justice ministry issued a statement later sunday saying the attorney generals office was examining the matter at this stage , it has decided not to involve the police there were conflicting reports in the israeli news media on whether the three submarines were meant to replace aging ones or to increase israels current fleet of five submarines , with a sixth to be delivered in 2017 submarines ordered now would not go into service for another decade moshe yaalon , a former israeli defense minister who resigned in may after mr netanyahu promised his job to another politician , wrote on twitter that he had strenuously opposed increasing the fleet by three submarines , saying the military did not need them israeli security experts said it was the prime ministers prerogative to make such strategic decisions about increasing or updating the fleet but israeli commentators have focused on the role of mr shimron , mr netanyahus lawyer a statement issued by the prime ministers office on thursday said that mr shimron had never discussed submarines with mr netanyahu the first mr netanyahu knew of mr shimron representing the businessman linked to the naval project , it said , was when channel 10 asked for a response to its report yair lapid , the leader of a centrist opposition party , said that if mr netanyahu did not know , he should have why did the germans retain shimron \? mr lapid asked on israels channel 2 news , saying it was not because of his expertise in submarines they retained him because he is the man closest to the israeli prime minister , mr lapid said the germans knew that the prime ministers personal lawyer was working for them , and we didnt know mr shimron has denied any ethical offense in not reporting his association with miki ganor , the israeli representative of the german shipyard but some israeli analysts were skeptical given mr shimrons ties to mr netanyahu on sunday , the political columnist ben dror yemini wrote in yediot aharonot after all , this is the prime ministers royal attorney , who is also a private attorney , and the netanyahu family lawyer , and also a lawyer who serves as the prime ministers official representative he has a finger in every pot and it was netanyahu , of all people , who did not know that shimron was involved with the submarines \? strange
san salvador on a sultry evening in late july , the salvadoran authorities executed their very first assault on what they called the financial cupola of mara salvatrucha , or ms 13 , the largest of the ruthless gangs that have made el salvador the murder capital of the world until that point , the national civil police had followed an almost choreographed routine , again and again , as they sought to cripple the gangs economically in the dead of night , often accompanied by television cameras , officers would batter down the doors of ramshackle houses in marginalized communities and then arrest and put on display a cluster of tattooed and half naked men between 2012 and 2015 , the total amount confiscated in these showy anti extortion raids was 34 , 664 75 an absurdly tiny sum considering that the united states has designated ms 13 as a global criminal organization on a par with the zetas of mexico , or the yakuza of japan on july 27 , however , in a mission baptized operation check , the authorities shifted gears they deployed 1 , 127 police officers to raid scores of supposed gang fronts , including car dealerships and bars , motels and brothels with great fanfare , they presented to the news media rows and rows of impounded buses and cars , along with 77 suspects identified as the financial operatives of ms 13 and their collaborators among them were the supposed c e o of the street gang , marvin ramos quintanilla , and two other leaders portrayed as controlling millions and possessing luxuries unimaginable to the destitute gang members beneath them but the presentation was something of an exaggeration , as are many official characterizations of the gangs whose criminal sophistication and global reach tend to be overstated by authorities frustrated that they cannot vanquish them for instance , that supposed chief executive officer hardly lived like a kingpin he leased a squat concrete house with a corrugated roof in a neighborhood where rents rarely reach 400 he owned an old honda civic and a nissan van in collaboration with the new york times , el faro , a digital newspaper based in san salvador , sought to pierce the secrecy surrounding the finances of the gangs that terrorize el salvador , which is experiencing a level of deadly violence unparalleled outside war zones 103 homicides per 100 , 000 residents last year , compared with five in the united states with an estimated 60 , 000 members in a country of 6 5 million people , the gangs hold power disproportionate to their numbers they maintain a menacing presence in 247 of 262 municipalities they extort about 70 percent of businesses they dislodge entire communities from their homes , and help propel thousands of salvadorans to undertake dangerous journeys to the united states their violence costs el salvador 4 billion a year , according to a study by the countrys central reserve bank and yet , the reporting determined , ms 13 and its rival street gangs in el salvador are not sophisticated transnational criminal enterprises they do not begin to belong in the same financial league with the billion dollar mexican , japanese and russian syndicates with which they are grouped if they are mafias , they are mafias of the poor el salvador has been brought to its knees by an army of flies ms 13s annual revenue appears to be about 31 2 million that estimate is based on information in the 1 , 355 page file of operation check , to which el faro got exclusive access wiretapped conversations reveal that the gangs national leadership ordered its 49 programs , or chapters , to turn over all the money earned in a single , typical week , which happened to be in april it collected 600 , 852 it sounds like a lot of money but if divided equitably among the estimated 40 , 000 members of ms 13 , each gang member would earn 15 a week and about 65 a month that is half the minimum wage of an agricultural day laborer but the gangs ms 13 and its main rival , the 18th street gang do not distribute their proceeds equitably they use them to pay for lawyers and funeral services , for weapons and munitions , and for the support of those serving long prison terms and their families theirs is a criminal subsistence economy even many of their leaders are barely solvent that the authorities call them businessmen either their intelligence is invalid or its pretty crude , said rolando monroy , a former salvadoran prosecutor who oversaw money laundering investigations until 2013 the gangs are like an anthill they are all after the same thing something to eat unlike other groups considered global organized crime syndicates , the salvadoran gangs do not survive on the international trafficking of cocaine , arms and humans while they dabble in small time drug dealing , gun sales and prostitution , they engage primarily in a single crime committed over and over within salvadoran territory extortion inside el salvador , they hold the reins of power largely because of a chilling demand repeated or implied daily across the country pay or die look , the thing is were not joking around , said one threat in childlike handwriting delivered to a bus owner recently get something together if not , we are going to burn one of your new minibuses it was signed by the 18th street gang 18 sends its best at 4 p m on a summer day in 2015 , two young gang members intercepted a businessman as he was returning home from work i have kids calm down , please , he managed to say before the youths grabbed him , threw him to the ground and shot him in a shoulder , in the stomach , and twice in the face they were delivering a message written in lead it was because of the extortion , not for any other reason , the mans son said the man owned a bus his son , who also owned a bus , said his father , tired of being extorted , had finally stopped making his 1 daily payment to the gang three weeks before his death it murdered him because of 21 among salvadoran businesses , transportation companies , whose vehicles crisscross gang territory , have proved especially vulnerable to extortion over the last five years , it has been more dangerous to drive a bus than to fight gang crime the gangs have killed 692 transportation workers and 93 police officers \( this is according to an analysis of internal government data that , like most data in this article , is not considered public information but was obtained by el faro \) genaro ramrez , the owner of a large bus company and a former member of congress , calculates that he has handed over 500 , 000 in gang extortion payments over the last 19 years its a matter of survival , he said when they tell you they are going to kill you , you dont have a choice between 2013 and 2015 , the national police received 7 , 506 reports of extortion , which the authorities see as just a small fraction of the total in the same period , some 424 gang members were convicted of this crime , most of them low level people who made the pickups and were caught with the cash the payment of extortion by bus companies is so commonplace that some have employees whose principal role is to negotiate with the gangs , which are continually raising their rates and demanding extras like christmas bonuses or buses to take them to the beach or to the funerals of associates the only transportation company chief who has refused to be extorted and has made his refusal public is catalino miranda mr miranda owns a fleet of several hundred buses since 2004 , the gangs have killed 26 of his employees but he refuses to reconsider his position as i told one of them , he said , referring to a gang representative , go ahead and kill them this cannot continue for a lifetime mr miranda spoke in his office , with a 9 millimeter pistol lying atop a mess of papers on his desk , and rifles and flak jackets piled in a corner he spends 30 , 000 a month on security , he said he has cameras posted in all his buses and stations , and eight security guards , armed with assault weapons , who patrol the gang zones his buses move through when his employees are killed , he hires private detectives to investigate , because the state does not have the capacity to protect witnesses they use you , mr miranda continued , and they abandon you resisting the gangs is not an option for small business owners , however many of them live in gang controlled neighborhoods themselves and cannot escape the pressure to pay that was the situation for the bus owner killed in the summer of 2015 the bus owners son , who is 38 , spoke of his fathers death in an open air restaurant beside the pan american highway the son carried a pistol he always has one by his side , even when he sleeps , he said and sat facing the entrance , with his back to a ravine , so he could track comings and goings like most businessmen who recounted their experiences with shakedowns , the man spoke on the condition of anonymity his father was one of 154 transportation workers who lost their lives to gang run extortion rings in 2015 to talk is to risk becoming another statistic it all started one afternoon in 2004 , he recounted , when a couple of teenage gangsters boarded a bus on their route the youths demanded the drivers license and registration , reviewed the documents and then handed the driver a disposable phone before jumping off after the shaken driver returned to the terminal , the phone rang the voice on the other end laid out the terms of their new relationship 10 a week not just for the one bus but for each of the 10 buses on the route the man , his father and the other bus owners held an emergency meeting to discuss whether to report the demand to the police many victims do not bother extortion investigations require them to make payments to the gangs while the police watch and collect evidence but the gangs almost always find out , and the victim is threatened or killed before the investigation is completed even so , the men decided to call the police soon , two detectives stationed themselves inside their terminal and , posing as bus owners , negotiated a rate with the gang 1 a day per bus over the next three years , the police arrested three gang leaders , including one who lived next door to the mans father the investigation expanded to other crimes and dragged on the bus owners kept paying extortion the situation deteriorated between 2004 and 2012 , ms 13 killed five bus drivers on their routes and one of the police investigators assigned to their case in 2012 , the gang tried to kill the man himself , surrounding his house , he said at the restaurant after his fathers murder , the gang increased its extortion on the route to 1 50 a day the man sold his bus when the salvadoran authorities draw a flow chart of ms 13s organizational structure , they always put a mug shot of el diablito de hollywood , the little devil of hollywood , at the very top hierarchically , el diablito borromeo henrquez solrzano , 38 is as far above homeboy as one can get if gang leaders are enriching themselves at the expense of the rank and file , mr henrquez should be the wealthiest capo di tutti and yet in the late 1970s or early 1980s , mr henrquez and his family fled the salvadoran civil war along with thousands of their compatriots who resettled in los angeles neighborhoods dominated by mexican gangs mara salvatrucha was born there and then at the end of the 1990s , as part of an anti gang offensive and a crackdown on criminal aliens , the united states shipped planeloads of gang members made in the united states back to el salvador and other central american countries el diablito returned to his homeland in one of those waves of deportation he was just a teenager , but in that era coming from los angeles conferred status in the branch of mara salvatrucha that had sprouted in el salvador \( loosely affiliated but largely autonomous branches now exist in other central american countries and in pockets of the united states outside california \) it was like arriving with a seal of original product , and el diablito , clever and garrulous , quickly parlayed that into a position of power prison , where he was sent in 1998 after getting a 30 year sentence for homicide , only solidified his stature soon after he was first locked up , mr henrquez summoned the leader of one of mara salvatruchas most powerful cells to visit him in prison , the leader related in an interview at that time , the gang had no reliable revenue stream , though members sold drugs on street corners , committed petty robberies and demanded small handouts from bus drivers but mr henrquez had a moneymaking plan , he told the leader el diablito said he wanted to institutionalize extortion nationwide , the leader related he was insistent that the leader accede to the plan , or quit ms 13 would tolerate no dissidents the leader communicated the new directive to his troops a few years later , the leader quit and emigrated to washington , d c , where he now owns a small business in a salvadoran neighborhood like el diablito , most of the national gang leaders operate from behind bars through ready access to cellphones and private visits with lawyers , they retain tight control of their organizations the money the gangs earn and the havoc they wreak this became chillingly apparent in 2012 when the government was negotiating a truce with the gangs and mr henrquez was emerging into the public eye as a spokesman for ms 13 the leaders sent out an order from behind bars stop killing and from one day to the next , homicides dropped 60 percent to a level that , with small variations , was maintained until the governments negotiations with the gangs , which were highly unpopular , ended two years later during the truce , a team from el faro was allowed to interview gang leaders in the ciudad barrios jail , which was dominated by ms 13 for over a decade , the gangs have been separated by institution to reduce internecine warfare this has had the unintended effect of strengthening them by uniting rather than dispersing their leadership dressed gang fashionably in baggy , black athletic attire , mr henrquez insisted that he survived on money sent by relatives in the united states and by a brother who sold used cars in el salvador do you realize it is difficult to believe that one of the most visible leaders of ms 13 does not derive a penny of his income from illicit activities \? a reporter from el faro said mr henrquez paused , then responded my money does not come from extortion but he was pressed what about illicit activities more generally \? el diablito answered with a derisive smile it doesnt come from extortion and all the other gang leaders laughed , cryptically that year 2012 the united states treasury department designated ms 13 as a transnational criminal organization , alongside four criminal syndicates the zetas , the yakuza , the russian brothers circle and the italian camorra it was the first street gang that had ever received that designation the next year , the treasury put personal sanctions on mr henrquez , which had the effect of forbidding americans to do business with him and authorizing federal investigators to freeze his financial assets no evidence has surfaced that any of mr henrquezs properties or assets in the united states were frozen sanctions were also placed on el diablitos wife , jenny judith corado the salvadoran government arrested her in 2013 and accused her of belonging to a mara salvatrucha extortion ring it could not prove her connection to the ring , however she was freed and ordered to turn over the money that a judge considered the provenance of extortion 50 now , ms corado does not appear to be enjoying a life of luxury or even comfort with her children beside her , she spends her days hawking used clothing and lingerie from a stall constructed of tin cans in the busy public marketplace of san salvador in the news conference announcing operation check \( as in the chess move \) , the authorities spoke of gang leaders luxuries , their investments and their various millions of dollars these leaders are living a different life than the gang members beneath them , douglas melndez , the attorney general , said the gang members beneath them should know it was a communiqu directed at the street , at those rank and file gangsters who put their lives on the line for little tangible reward while their leaders may have been preaching a doctrine of brotherhood , they were secretly enriching themselves at the expense of their brothers , their soldiers , their homeboys the luxuries , however , consisted of 22 imported but used cars , each valued at about 8 , 000 the confiscated cash amounted to 34 , 500 and the investments numbered three a taqueria and bar in soyapango , a working class community in the san salvador metropolitan area a vegetable stand in a rural marketplace and a highway restaurant that is decorated with a deers head , offers karaoke and has three waiters who primarily serve buckets of beer bottles the gangs credo of fraternity and equality does not allow for any personal gain at the expense of the brotherhood , and they at least theoretically enforce it brutally he who makes himself rich at the expense of the street is going to die , a leader of the 18th street gang said in an interview so even a vegetable stand is a risky venture , and the wiretapped conversations in the operation check file reveal that some gang leaders went so far as to pay extortion fees to their own gangs on their private businesses in order to hide their involvement with them howard cotto , the general director of the national police , estimated in an interview that 50 to 70 gang leaders , including mr henrquez , have accumulated some money or business interests but only enough , he said , to permit their families to escape conditions of poverty , overcrowding , unhealthy conditions and sheet metal and have a chance at a future i cannot say the leaders are living in places of luxury , he acknowledged most of the leaders , in fact , are expected to spend the rest of their lives in prison , either in solitary confinement or in malodorous cells shared with dozens of others one day in 2014 , an imprisoned leader of the 18th street gang who goes by the alias chiki was issuing instructions to a low level gang member identified as shaggy speaking by phone from the izalco penitentiary , chiki , who was serving time for extortion , ordered shaggy to make a pickup of an extortion payment it was 100 from an operation in colonia rubio in the department of la unin and , though shaggy risked up to 20 years in prison if caught , there was something special in it for him , chiki said keep two bucks so you can get yourself something to eat , chiki said , in what turned out to be a wiretapped conversation he added and tell el demente , the demented one , to give you some custards for your kid chiki , whose real name is jos luis guzmn , was the third in command of the 18th street gangs southerners faction in eastern el salvador another prison wiretap recording showed an even higher level 18th street leader , carlos ernesto mojica , getting involved in negotiations with a chicken vendor who sought to lower her monthly extortion payment to 200 from 400 that these leaders were overseeing such small bore operations typifies the pettiness of gang business while officials publicly portray the gangs as international criminal syndicates and narco gangs , law enforcement records and data tell a different story as do some authorities when speaking privately or in one on one interviews in the four years before operation check , the biggest sum collected in a police anti extortion raid was 6 , 377 some raids netted only 5 i have never had a case involving the quantity of money necessary to maintain organized crime , said nora montoya , a judge who has handled gang extortion cases for decades similarly , mr cotto , the police director , said the term narco gang was sensationalism and could be misinterpreted as suggesting that salvadoran street gangs were working directly with the gulf cartel or the zetas in the transshipment of drugs from south america to the united states this is not the case it is definitely not the case , he said although salvadoran gangs sell drugs , they do it like street corner dealers , not international operatives from 2011 to 2015 , the national police seized 13 9 kilograms of cocaine from gangs that was less than 1 percent of the total seized three quarters of the gang members prosecuted on drug charges over the last few years were charged with possessing less than an ounce a veteran cocaine dealer in san salvador said serious drug trafficking organizations wanted nothing to do with the street gangs , which are considered unreliable and volatile the wholesalers i work with would not sell to the gang guys , he said they dont trust them over a decade ago , the police confiscated an account ledger from jos luis mendoza figueroa , a founder of ms 13 , that contained no evidence of any drug business instead it showed weekly receipts that averaged 14 from the 19 cliques the smallest gang units he controlled , and trivial outlays for bullets \( 8 \) , taxis \( 25 \) , christmas dinners , liquor and 50 for the homeboys in prison a couple of years ago , federal agents seized a similar ledger from the treasurer of the park view locos clique of the ms 13 in usulutn in southeast el salvador a log of one days expenses showed 30 for a cellphone chip , 10 for mujer chief \( the chiefs wife or woman \) , 35 for another woman and 10 for food , with 29 listed as the balance the notebook also contained the gang members grandiose musings the day i die i want to be remembered as a strong street level soldier , a committed delinquent , and at the hour that the shots ring out , i want to be marked present according to an internal code , only leaders can speak on behalf of the 18th street gang but in the rural department of la paz , one of the most violent in el salvador , a 15 year old gang member clambered to his feet from an old mattress on the dirt floor of a mud walled house to defy that rule he had agreed to grant an interview on two conditions that his identity be protected , and that breakfast be provided the boy , gangly and pimply , is a fledgling member of the 18th street revolutionaries , a faction of the 18th street gang , and he works as an extremely small time roadside extortionist he collects 15 monthly from each of three food trucks that rumble through his district carrying chewing gum , pepsi sodas and bimbo bread he then turns over the proceeds to the leader of his clique all the loot goes to weapons , the youth said he himself was awarded a 9 millimeter pistol and many nights takes it out on patrol like so many young recruits , the teenager is an obedient soldier who risks his life to protect his territory without earning a penny from his organization it is a bargain for the gang leaders who manage the gang economy tens of thousands of grunts who are not seeking personal profit , only respect and a sense of belonging one of 14 children , the boy never went to school and does not know how to read or write he probably could have found work in the nearby sugar cane fields , where , even if conditions were miserable , he would have earned 100 a month but , feeling bullied and vulnerable at 13 , he believed that gang membership would give him something less tangible but more valuable at that age i was a kid i was stupid , he said about joining a bunch of crazy guys were messing with me because i was a kid , smacking me in the head , knocking me around it made me think i have had enough since i joined up , nobody screws with me the department of la paz , with all its sugar cane production , is fairly lucrative for the gangs the federation of associations of sugar cane producers said in june that its members had paid 1 5 million in extortion fees over a recent five month period but none of that trickles down to the rank and file so in order to survive , the boy runs his own little racket on the side private extortion , gang members call it his particular clique forbids members to extort their neighbors instead , he collects and pockets rent from a few poor businesses on the periphery of his cliques zone he said he netted 40 a month only enough for what im going to eat despite his age , he is mostly left to fend for himself by a hapless mother with too many mouths to feed while the teenage gang member talked , three of his little siblings circled the breakfast scrambled eggs , beans and plantains that waited in cartons on the floor he gave his younger brother permission to open a carton the little boy , who had matted hair and a dirty face , let out a squeal of delight , and proceeded to attack the meal with his hands in two years of gang life , the teenager has already witnessed and participated in significant bloodshed he said he had been involved in two collective homicides in both cases , members of a rival gang had dared to breach the invisible border that separates ms 13 from 18th street territory one man was looking to buy some marijuana the other to meet girls at a village festival they were killed for their defiance in the spring , the 26 year old leader of the teenagers clique whom he knew as shadow died in what the police described as a clash between the authorities and gang members the boy was not present , but he had witnessed the deaths of three other clique members in february in another encounter described as a clash , he said the boy said none of his homeboys had been carrying weapons that winter day hiding in a trash pile , he watched as the police killed his friends , teenagers like him , and then , he said , placed guns around their bodies to make it look as if they had fallen in crossfire two neighbors who are not gang members supported his version of events in interviews , and it is not far fetched el salvadors attorney general for human rights has 31 open cases against the police for alleged summary executions of 100 gang members over the last year and a half the day of that interview and in follow up conversations throughout the summer , the boy made it clear he was scared of the police since february , officers had been stopping by his house from time to time , and he had spent much of his time hiding from them in the mountains i need to save money to get out of here , he said if they catch me , theyre not going to let me live they did catch him , in october , and arrested him for extorting 40 his private extortion from a local merchant he was jailed , and faces up to 15 years in prison as violence peaked in 2015 , reaching levels unseen since the aftermath of el salvadors long and brutal civil war , entire communities abandoned their homes because of gang threats it became such a recurring phenomenon that television channels interrupted their programming to broadcast live the precise moment in which dozens of families fled , on foot or in pickup trucks tightly packed with suitcases , mattresses , chickens and pigs having failed to guarantee them daily security , the police nonetheless supervised their moves pedro gonzlez , the chief of the anti gang unit , showed up at one mass exodus , from a condominium building in suburban san salvador after imploring residents in vain to stay put , he led them in an alternate response it doesnt matter who here is catholic or evangelical , let us raise a prayer , he said that is the most important , let us turn to god over the years , the salvadoran authorities have tried to quash the gangs with military might , to prosecute them into oblivion , to banish them with lengthy prison terms and , briefly , to negotiate with them \( the dialogue was corrupted by , among other things , the secret efforts of the two major political parties to court the gang leaders electoral support at the same time \) when the government ratcheted up its iron fist approach last year , three gangs , working in coordination , responded with a show of force on a sunday night , they distributed written and oral messages to bus owners and employees he who takes out a vehicle tomorrow is going to end up glued to his steering wheel to underscore their seriousness , they killed a driver and burned three microbuses as a warning the next day , six drivers who had disobeyed their order were killed the authorities sent soldiers and tanks into the streets , and deployed government vehicles to substitute for the buses , but the gangs succeeded in almost completely paralyzing san salvadors transportation system for four days some 1 3 million salvadorans were affected many high schools and universities suspended classes and the economy suffered an 80 million loss , according to the chamber of commerce it was a ruthless show of force this year , with operation check , the government conducted one of its most professional law enforcement efforts to date , and comments by senior officials suggested a new willingness to approach the gangs as a complex phenomenon with deep roots in the profound inequalities of a country where a third of the population lives in poverty yet by hyping its findings , the government continued to misrepresent the gangs as sophisticated criminal organizations , ruthlessly driven by a thirst for financial gain and though in operation check it acknowledged a distinction between the culpability of leaders and rank and file members , that distinction was lost on the street the authorities have continued to treat all gangsters as mortal enemies and have doubled down on their use of force some 424 gang members had died in confrontations with the police this year as of september if the use of force is not the correct path in this moment , at this stage , at this juncture , then what is \? scar ortiz , the countrys vice president , asked in late october the government cites as evidence a recent drop in murders 4 , 431 by mid october , compared with 5 , 363 by that point in 2015 but that is still the second highest toll since 1995 in operation check , the government sought to sow dissent in gang ranks by portraying the leaders of ms 13 as self interested profiteers afterward , a written message sent out from a mara salvatrucha dominated prison demanded that justice be meted out to those revealed by operation check to have betrayed the gang , according to an american official in el salvador who monitors the gangs as of yet , though , there do not seem to have been any revenge killings , internal purges or mass defections for a gang member tired of the gang life , at any rate , there is nowhere to go those who are not incarcerated are marked , quite literally with tattoos , for life there are no rehabilitation centers where they can seek refuge , no programs to reintegrate them into society and no gang prevention initiatives aimed at high risk youths the only alternatives appear to be those that gang members themselves spray paint on walls throughout the country jail or the cemetery

homestead , fla the nascar season heads into its finale this weekend , with history on the line for jimmie johnson , who can tie richard petty and dale earnhardt sr with his seventh series championship but the final report card on the season will not be clear until after sundays race at homestead miami speedway race attendance has been dwindling , which was particularly noticeable at marquee tracks like indianapolis and bristol , tenn although nascar is buoyed by an 8 2 billion , 10 year multinetwork tv contract signed last year , many races have been subject to double digit drops in ratings from the previous two years races are often on cable channels like fox sports 1 , nbcsn and cnbc rather than major networks and there is the unanswered billion dollar question who will replace sprint as the title sponsor of nascars premier series \? as johnson , the defending champion kyle busch , joey logano and carl edwards vie for the drivers crown sunday , sprint will be making its final appearance as title sponsor despite more than two years notice of sprints departure , nascar has yet to announce a replacement brian france , nascars chief executive and chairman , has given conflicting signals about when , or if , he might be making any statement on the subject in september , he suggested word could be coming in as soon as a couple of weeks originally , nascar was said to be looking for a 10 year commitment , for 1 billion , from sprints replacement despite the continued uncertainty , france said last week at the race in phoenix , on balance , were having a very solid year he pointed to huge increases in digital and online social media engagement as signs the sport remains a solid draw we are well positioned for the digital age , he said were making a big investment in it france added that digital delivery of streamed content and increased online engagement are where all sports are headed , not just nascar this seasons financial issues have raised some eyebrows on the track and in the garage , as some teams have dropped out and others have consolidated operations , or cut back on entries a blow to nascars public profile came midseason when its most popular driver , dale earnhardt jr , sustained a concussion that sidelined him the rest of the year his return , not scheduled until the daytona 500 in february , is not assured he still is undergoing extensive therapy , and now wears thick glasses typically prescribed to cope with double vision while he was unable to drive , his team , hendrick motorsports , coaxed jeff gordon out of retirement a somewhat awkward development , after his elaborate farewell tour in 2015 tony stewart , another popular driver , is retiring at this seasons end gordon competed in eight races with lackluster results and no clear exit date stewart , despite an unexpected victory at a race in june , was eliminated early on in the process to set the final four contenders for the championship here sunday still , the story lines for sundays fordecoboost 400 have enormous appeal for the sports faithful logano and edwards are looking for their first titles after coming close previously loganos chances were snuffed out last year in a controversial accident instigated by matt kenseth edwards tied with stewart for the 2011 title but lost it on a tiebreaker last year , busch came back from broken legs sustained in the season opener to take an unlikely title , despite missing much of the season recuperating and then there is johnson , 41 , who is going for nascar immortality gordon , a teammate of johnsons and a former series champion , said he expected johnson to be at the top of his game , as he aims to join the sports greatest drivers in total titles he deserves to be ranked among the best drivers there has ever been in this sport , gordon said , and his team has been on fire lately johnson said he did not normally consider the homestead layout his best track but he credited his longtime crew chief , chad knaus , with finding a burst of speed at midseason , beginning with a third place finish at indianapolis motor speedway in late july two of his four victories , and five other top 10 finishes , have come since thats why we are here , said johnson , who last won the title in 2013 what he has been able to do , to get us back up from midpack in midseason , is just phenomenal the highest finisher sunday among johnson , busch , logano and edwards will win the championship a win on the track is what i figure it will take for the championship , johnson said
london during a tennis season pockmarked by match fixing reports , high profile doping busts , sexist comments by tournament directors and superstars sidelined by injuries , tanking would seem to be low on the list of priorities yet with only the atp world tour finals and the davis cup final between croatia and argentina left on the calendar , a deliberate lack of effort on the part of players has emerged as a pressing topic its something that were looking at very closely , said chris kermode , the atps chief executive atp officials are grappling with the knotty issue because some of the sports up and coming male stars have been perceived to be thumbing their noses at the game the talented but volatile nick kyrgios was suspended last month for disrespecting fans , his opponents and the sport deliberately trying to lose , which violates the best effort clause in the atps code of conduct , is a serious offense it cuts to the heart of the games integrity in an era when bettors can wager on individual games and points in matches across the globe , it raises additional match fixing worries but like obscenity , tanking can be hard to define , even if most people believe they know it when they see it its a difficult one to police , the top ranked andy murray said last week at the world tour finals , the atps elite year end event in london effort , or the perception of effort , is subjective and situational one players tanking is anothers tactical act of disruption depending on the circumstance , it could be a conscious decision to throw away a couple of games or points to conserve physical or emotional energy for a coming decisive set in interviews last week in london , several former and current players admitted to periodic lack of effort when , for whatever reason , they had mentally checked out is that worthy of punishment \? its a gray area , isnt it \? said tim henman , the former british standout who is now a bbc commentator this years united states open semifinal between novak djokovic and gal monfils vividly expressed this tension trailing by 5 0 in the first set , monfils began to loop and chip balls back into the center of the court , barely moving his feet on television , john mcenroe criticized his effort and called it borderline unprofessional the strange tactics worked monfils , who did not receive a warning from the umpire , pulled the score back to 5 3 and went on to play more conventionally in a four set defeat he later defended his tactics and said they were a gutsy attempt to work his way back into the match there was little ambiguity when kyrgios threw away a second round match against mischa zverev , who was ranked outside the top 100 , at the shanghai masters last month the 13th ranked kyrgios , a 21 year old australian , gave little effort during the 6 3 , 6 1 defeat , at one point tapping in a first serve midway through the first set and walking toward the sideline before his opponent had struck his return kyrgios went on to tell the umpire to call time so he could finish this match and go home he argued with fans in the stands he disparaged the paying public in comments to the news media afterward kyrgios was fined a total of 16 , 500 for lack of best effort , unsportsmanlike conduct and verbal abuse of a spectator after further review , the atp gave him an additional 25 , 000 penalty and effectively suspended him for the rest of the season while encouraging him to see a sports psychologist while the umpire , ali nili , spoke to kyrgios about his performance after his dubious serve , he never issued a warning for tanking obviously , there were missed opportunities to take official action , said gayle david bradshaw , the executive vice president for rules and competition at the atp kyrgios is not the only perpetrator of desultory efforts this season his fellow australian bernard tomic inverted his racket and tried to return serve with the handle on match point in a loss to fabio fognini in madrid he was fined for unsportsmanlike conduct tomic , 24 , has a history of suspect efforts and off court run ins with authorities that have earned him the nickname tomic the tank engine he also had a 6 0 , 6 1 defeat to jarkko nieminen in 2014 that lasted 28 minutes , the quickest match since the atp began keeping records in 1991 these and other incidents in a long and enervating season have prompted bradshaw to step up efforts to deal with tanking bradshaw said the atp intends to streamline its procedures to publicize egregious cases and push them up the chain of review more quickly the tour is considering more than doubling on site fines for various code violations , including best effort , in 2017 the current maximum is 10 , 000 bradshaw also plans to give tanking renewed emphasis at his annual gathering with umpires and supervisors at the atp americas headquarters in florida this month he said he had to make sure that officials arent afraid to step in when they see it bradshaw added , i dont want them to be trigger happy , but its something we cant keep saying you should have done the key for umpires is keeping a players style and history in mind , along with factors like the score and the weather its so subjective in every single case , said ross hutchins , a former doubles specialist now serving as the atps chief player officer its always a balance do you speak to him \? do you warn him \? do you tell him \? do you ban him \? do you default him \? its all in that very moment that the umpire has to make a decision murray , the thoughtful and outspoken scot , said kyrgioss transparency had a silver lining it brought the issue out of the shadows he also admitted to it , as well , which is actually good in some ways because a lot of people dont try their best , then would just say nothing to sort of defend themselves so they dont get in a bad situation , said murray , who sits on the tours player council board djokovic , a 12 time major winner and the president of the player council , said dealing with tanking should not rest with players its up to referees , really , chair umpires , to make that call , he said some think that more decisive officials and better training are necessary im massively convinced that if the umpire or supervisor had done a better job , it would have helped kyrgios pull out of it or understand the situation , the espn commentator brad gilbert said just like if someone screws up at work , if their supervisor calls them out , i think that can help them the doubles specialist mike bryan said blatant bouts of tanking too often went unheeded by officials theres been very few instances where a fine has been involved , he said most agree that cases are isolated the danger , especially with young players , is that a cavalier attitude can set examples inside and outside the professional ranks the more that the new generation does it , the more youll see it in the game , bryan said thats a problem
im a millennial computer scientist who also writes books and runs a blog demographically speaking i should be a heavy social media user , but that is not the case ive never had a social media account at the moment , this makes me an outlier , but i think many more people should follow my lead and quit these services there are many issues with social media , from its corrosion of civic life to its cultural shallowness , but the argument i want to make here is more pragmatic you should quit social media because it can hurt your career this claim , of course , runs counter to our current understanding of social medias role in the professional sphere weve been told that its important to tend to your so called social media brand , as this provides you access to opportunities you might otherwise miss and supports the diverse contact network you need to get ahead many people in my generation fear that without a social media presence , they would be invisible to the job market in a recent new york magazine essay , andrew sullivan recalled when he started to feel obligated to update his blog every half hour or so it seemed as if everyone with a facebook account and a smartphone now felt pressured to run their own high stress , one person media operation , and the once unimaginable pace of the professional blogger was now the default for everyone , he wrote i think this behavior is misguided in a capitalist economy , the market rewards things that are rare and valuable social media use is decidedly not rare or valuable any 16 year old with a smartphone can invent a hashtag or repost a viral article the idea that if you engage in enough of this low value activity , it will somehow add up to something of high value in your career is the same dubious alchemy that forms the core of most snake oil and flimflam in business professional success is hard , but its not complicated the foundation to achievement and fulfillment , almost without exception , requires that you hone a useful craft and then apply it to things that people care about this is a philosophy perhaps best summarized by the advice steve martin used to give aspiring entertainers be so good they cant ignore you if you do that , the rest will work itself out , regardless of the size of your instagram following a common response to my social media skepticism is the idea that using these services cant hurt in addition to honing skills and producing things that are valuable , my critics note , why not also expose yourself to the opportunities and connections that social media can generate \? i have two objections to this line of thinking first , interesting opportunities and useful connections are not as scarce as social media proponents claim in my own professional life , for example , as i improved my standing as an academic and a writer , i began receiving more interesting opportunities than i could handle i currently have filters on my website aimed at , not increasing , the number of offers and introductions i receive my research on successful professionals underscores that this experience is common as you become more valuable to the marketplace , good things will find you to be clear , im not arguing that new opportunities and connections are unimportant im instead arguing that you dont need social medias help to attract them my second objection concerns the idea that social media is harmless consider that the ability to concentrate without distraction on hard tasks is becoming increasingly valuable in an increasingly complicated economy social media weakens this skill because its engineered to be addictive the more you use social media in the way its designed to be used persistently throughout your waking hours the more your brain learns to crave a quick hit of stimulus at the slightest hint of boredom once this pavlovian connection is solidified , it becomes hard to give difficult tasks the unbroken concentration they require , and your brain simply wont tolerate such a long period without a fix indeed , part of my own rejection of social media comes from this fear that these services will diminish my ability to concentrate the skill on which i make my living the idea of purposefully introducing into my life a service designed to fragment my attention is as scary to me as the idea of smoking would be to an endurance athlete , and it should be to you if youre serious about creating things that matter perhaps more important , however , than my specific objections to the idea that social media is a harmless lift to your career , is my general unease with the mind set this belief fosters a dedication to cultivating your social media brand is a fundamentally passive approach to professional advancement it diverts your time and attention away from producing work that matters and toward convincing the world that matter the latter activity is seductive , especially for many members of my generation who were raised on this message , but it can be disastrously counterproductive most social media is best described as a collection of somewhat trivial entertainment services that are currently having a good run these networks are fun , but youre deluding yourself if you think that twitter messages , posts and likes are a productive use of your time if youre serious about making an impact in the world , power down your smartphone , close your browser tabs , roll up your sleeves and get to work
behind much of the middle easts chaos the wars in syria and yemen , the political upheaval in iraq and lebanon and bahrain there is another conflict saudi arabia and iran are waging a struggle for dominance that has turned much of the middle east into their battlefield rather than fighting directly , they wield and in that way worsen the regions direst problems dictatorship , militia violence and religious extremism the history of their rivalry tracks and helps to explain the middle easts disintegration , particularly the sunni shiite sectarianism both powers have found useful to cultivate it is a story in which the united states has been a supporting but constant player , most recently by backing the saudi war in yemen , which kills hundreds of civilians these dynamics , scholars warn , point toward a future of civil wars , divided societies and unstable governments f gregory gause iii , an international relations scholar at texas a m university , struggled to name another region that had been torn apart in this way central africa could be similar , he suggested , referring to the two decades of interrelated wars and genocides that , driven by meddling regional powers , killed five million but in the middle east , it is just getting started saudi arabia , a young country pieced together only in the 1930s , has built its legitimacy on religion by promoting its stewardship of the holy sites at mecca and medina , it could justify its royal familys grip on power irans revolution , in 1979 , threatened that legitimacy iranians toppled their authoritarian government , installing islamists who claimed to represent a revolution for the entire islamic world , said kenneth m pollack , a senior fellow at the brookings institution the revolutionaries encouraged all muslims , especially saudis , to overthrow their rulers as well but because iran is mostly shiite , they had the greatest influence with , and tended to reach out to , shia groups , dr pollack said some saudi shiites , who make up about 10 percent of the population , protested in solidarity or even set up offices in tehran stoking saudi fears of internal unrest and separatism this was the opening shot in the sectarianization of their rivalry , which would encompass the whole region the saudis have looked at iran as a domestic threat from the get go , from 1979 , dr gause said seeing the threat as intolerable , they began looking for a way to strike back they found that way the next year , when saddam husseins iraq invaded iran , hoping to seize oil rich territory saudi arabia , dr pollack said , backed the iraqis to the hilt because they want the iranian revolution stopped the war , over eight years of trench warfare and chemical weapons attacks , killed perhaps a million people it set a pattern of iranian saudi struggle through proxies , and of sucking in the united states , whose policy is to maintain access to the vast oil and gas reserves that lie between the rivals the conflicts toll exhausted irans zeal for sowing revolution abroad , but gave it a new mission to overturn the saudi led , american backed regional order that tehran saw as an existential threat that sense of insecurity would later drive irans meddling abroad , said marc lynch , a political scientist at george washington university , and perhaps its missile and nuclear programs the 1990s provided a pause in the regional rivalry , but also set up the conditions that would allow it to later explode in such force saudi arabia , wishing to contain irans reach to the regions minority shiite populations , sought to harden sunni shiite rifts government programs promoted anti shia incitement in schools , islamic universities , and the media , toby matthiesen , an oxford university scholar , wrote in a brief for the carnegie endowment these policies , dr matthiesen warned , cultivated sectarian fears and sometimes violence that would later feed into the ideology of the islamic state in 1990 , iraq invaded kuwait , a saudi ally the united states , after expelling the iraqis , established military bases in the region to defend its allies from iraq this further tilted the regional power balance against iran , which saw the american forces as a threat iraqs humiliating defeat also spurred many of its citizens to rise up , particularly in poorer communities that happened to be shiite arab in response , dr gause said , saddams regime became explicitly sectarian , widening sunni shiite divides to deter future uprisings that allowed iran , still worried about iraq , to cultivate allies among iraqs increasingly disenfranchised shiites , including militias that had risen up though it was not obvious at the time , iraq had become a powder keg , one that would ignite when its government was toppled a decade later the 2003 american led invasion , by toppling an iraqi government that had been hostile to both saudi arabia and iran , upended the regions power balance iran , convinced that the united states and saudi arabia would install a pliant iraqi government and remembering the horrors they had inflicted on iran in the 1980s raced to fill the postwar vacuum its leverage with shiite groups , which are iraqs largest demographic group , allowed it to influence baghdad politics iran also wielded shiite militias to control iraqi streets and undermine the american led occupation but sectarian violence took on its own inevitable momentum , hastening the countrys slide into civil war saudi arabia sought to match irans reach but , after years of oppressing its own shiite population , struggled to make inroads with those in iraq the problem for the saudis is that their natural allies in iraq , dr gause said , referring to sunni groups that were increasingly turning to jihadism , wanted to kill them this was the first sign that saudi arabias strategy for containing iran , by fostering sectarianism and aligning itself with the regions sunni majority , had backfired as sunni governments collapsed and sunni militias turned to jihadism , riyadh would be left with few reliable proxies as their competition in iraq heated up , saudi arabia and iran sought to counterbalance each other through another weak state lebanon lebanon provided the perfect opening a frail democracy recovering from civil war , with parties and lingering militias primarily organized by religion iran and saudi arabia exploited those dynamics , waging a new kind of proxy struggle not on conventional military battlefields , dr gause said , but within the domestic politics of weakened institutional structures iran , for instance , supported hezbollah , the shiite militia and political movement , which it had earlier cultivated to use against israel riyadh , in turn , funneled money to political allies such as the sunni prime minister , rafik hariri by competing along lebanons religious lines , they helped drive the lebanese governments frequent breakdowns , as parties relied on foreign backers who wanted to oppose one another more than build a functioning state with iran promoting hezbollah as the nations defender and saudi arabia backing the lebanese military , neither had a full mandate , and lebanon struggled to maintain order as the foreign powers escalated their antagonism , lebanons dysfunction spiraled into violence in 2005 , after mr hariri called for the withdrawal of iranian backed syrian troops , he was assassinated \( hezbollah has long been suspected \) another political crisis , in 2008 , culminated with hezbollah overpowering sunni militias to seize much of beirut saudi arabia requested united states air cover , according to a wikileaks cable , for a pan arab force to retake the city though the intervention never materialized , the episode was a dress rehearsal for the turmoil that would soon come to the wider region when the arab spring toppled governments across the middle east , many of them saudi allies , riyadh feared that iran would again fill the vacuums so it rushed to close them , at times with force it promised billions in aid to jordan , yemen , egypt and others , often urging those governments to crack down after pro democracy protesters rose up in bahrain , a saudi ally whose sunni king rules over a majority shiite population , saudi arabia sent 1 , 200 troops in egypt , saudi arabia tacitly supported a 2013 military takeover , seeing the military as a more reliable ally than the elected islamist government it replaced as libya fell into civil war , it backed a hard line general who was driving to consolidate control though iran has little influence in either country , saudi arabias fear of losing ground to iran made it fight harder to retain influence wherever it could , analysts believe syria , an iranian ally , reversed the usual dynamic saudi arabia and other oil rich sunni states steered money and arms to rebels , including sunni islamists iran intervened in turn , sending officers and later hezbollah to fight on behalf of syrias government , whose leaders mostly follow a sect of shiism their interventions , civil war scholars say , helped lock syria in the ever worsening stalemate that has killed over 400 , 000 the united states has struggled to restore the regions balance president obama has urged iran and saudi arabia to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace , he told the atlantic but dr lynch called this plan for a self regulating equilibrium between the mideast powers far fetched the nuclear agreement with iran , instead of calming saudi nerves , hit on fears that the united states wants to abandon them in order to ally with iran , dr lynch said , calling the belief crazy but widespread mr pollack said he often heard sunni arab leaders express this as a metaphor they would say , what is wrong with you people \? you have this good , loving , loyal wife in us , and this crazy mistress in iran you dont understand how bad she is for you , and yet you endlessly run off to her the moment that she winks at you , he recounted the white house looked for other ways to reassure saudi leaders , facilitating arms sales and overlooking saudi actions in egypt and bahrain then came yemen a rebel group with loose ties to iran ousted the saudi backed president , deepening riyadhs fears saudi arabia launched a bombing campaign that inflicted horror on civilians but accomplished little else the assault receives heavy american support , though the united states has few interests in yemen other than counterterrorism and sometimes criticizes the campaign in exchange , riyadh acquiesced to the iran deal and began to follow washingtons lead on syria but the underlying proxy war remained asked when the iran saudi struggle might cool , mr pollack said he doubted that it would where were headed with the middle east is the current trend extrapolated , with more failed and failing governments in yemen , this is already reorganizing yemeni society along sectarian lines and rearranging peoples relationships to one another on a non nationalist basis , farea al muslimi , an analyst , wrote in a carnegie endowment paper , which cited similar trends across the region continued crises will risk sucking in the united states again , mr lynch said , adding that no american president was likely to persuade saudi arabia or iran to stay out of regional conflicts that it saw as potentially existential threats president elect donald j trump will enter office having echoed saudi arabias view of the region iran took over iraq , he said at a rally in january theyre going to have yemen theyre going to have syria theyre going to have everything mentioning both the president elect and hillary clinton , dr gause said he doubted that any administration could reset the middle easts power struggles i do not think that the fundamental problem of the region , he said , is something that either mr trump or mrs clinton could do that much about
when dylan ratigan was last on daily television , he was often in a bit of a rage after two highly publicized rants about unseemly ties between corporations and politicians on msnbc , he left his show in 2012 disillusioned , he decided that rather than complain about the state of the world , he would at least try to be part of the solution he was especially intrigued by something he had heard over the years from both silicon valley entrepreneurs and war veterans if you really want to combat conflicts , bring the things that we fight over , said mr ratigan , 44 dont bring more bullets and boots bring water , food , shelter , communications , so we can empower women and children who are physically left in the villages that took him , eventually , to this line of questioning why not use hydroponics , solar panels and reverse osmosis water filtration to reduce poverty and conflict , in the united states and abroad \? why not use agriculture technology to help people in inner cities , refugee camps or war zones , and after natural disasters \? and why not recruit veterans to help with everything from manufacturing to installation to operations \? the vets i was meeting argued that easily deployed resource kits that can be packed and unpacked from a container are the best way to do this , mr ratigan said this continues the same mission but with a new set of equipment mr ratigan moved to california and volunteered at archis acres , in escondido , which trains veterans for careers in agriculture he taught communications and business development , and his interest grew along with the crops through a mutual friend , mr ratigan met kohlie frantzen , an oilman from lafayette , la , who had lived through hurricane katrina at mr ratigans urging , mr frantzen completed the six week training class at archis and became a certified hydroponic organic farmer \( mr ratigan did not \) not long after , the two men formed a manufacturing and design company , helical holdings , investing a few million dollars between them the companys first product is the outpost , a 20 or 40 foot shipping container that can house a hydroponic farm and a solar power station , and provide wi fi and satellite communication the outpost includes a filtration system that can provide up to 4 , 000 gallons of clean water a day it can also generate 45 kilowatt hours of solar power , and can produce 2 , 300 heads of leafy greens a week it uses a fifth of the water and a tenth of the land of a traditional organic farm , the company says each unit costs 125 , 000 to 500 , 000 , depending on size and configuration , and can be erected anywhere its like a hair dryer with a set of adapters , said eric g strauss , the executive director of the center for urban resilience at loyola marymount university , los angeles you plug into any adapter in the world urban agriculture growing food on vacant lots , on rooftops or in inner cities is not new freight farms and podponics grow produce inside shipping containers ikea sells hydroponic indoor gardening kits in its british stores farm from a box , which started in 2013 , takes an approach similar to that of helical holdings brandi decarli , 39 , a co founder of farm from a box , said both companies help communities become more sustainable or can help them rebuild after crises shifting the focus from large scale mass production to production by the masses can help contribute to greater stability in the food system , she said the united nations food and agriculture organization estimates that about 795 million people worldwide suffer from chronic undernourishment nearly all live in developing nations , where poverty and conflicts over limited resources are rampant while the helical holdings containers have not been used overseas yet , mr ratigan said he was in preliminary talks with the united states agency for international development , the united states department of agriculture and representatives from the mexican , french , kuwaiti , canadian and philippine governments an outpost has been installed at an elementary school in lafayette , la there is also one at patriot farms of america , in berryville , va , which trains veterans in agriculture and is a nonprofit partner of helical holdings patriot farmers was founded by kory apton , the wife of phil griffin , mr ratigans former boss at msnbc so far , mr ratigan said , the outposts in louisiana and virginia have purified 75 , 000 gallons of water while growing 13 , 000 leafy greens and 1 , 200 pounds of vine crops , such as cucumbers , tomatoes and watermelons they have also created 28 jobs mr ratigan said in general he did not miss the grind of daily television , although a part of him wishes he were on the air for postelection coverage his temper still flares , especially during the news but im better at seeing u s politics for what it is a very sick system in need of help , he said the people of america are painfully aware of the fact that a few very wealthy people have controlled our politicians for years , and hillary clinton is a symbol for that relationship , he said its why senator sanders and president elect trump had so much support , and its why mr trump won in addition to his work with helical holdings , he stays busy by minding his stakes in two financial companies , producing films and serving as a global brand ambassador for hotelplanner com mr ratigan said the biggest surprise was realizing how much time and money it took to start a business but he said he was proud that he was finally putting his money where his opinionated mouth was , even though the uncertainty of the entrepreneurial life makes it a double edged sword when im well rested , i like it , he said when im tired , it is scary
milan victor massiah has grown weary of talk that the italian banking system is so threadbare and stuffed with terrible loans that it threatens europe with another financial crisis the mansion that serves as local headquarters for the bank he runs , ubi banca , one of italys largest lenders , does not feel like a place on the verge of running out of money an inlaid marble fireplace sits in a conference room beneath wooden beams worthy of a castle a statue of the greek goddess athena stands triumphantly over a staircase as you can see , he says , sweeping a hand across the scene , were not necessarily bankrupt among policy makers alert for signs of the next financial disaster , italys mountain of uncollectable bank debt is a subject discussed in tones ordinarily reserved for piles of plutonium its banks seem at once too big to fail and eminently capable of doing so , menacing the global economy for years , italian lenders have muddled through , hoping time would cure their afflictions but italys economy has been terminally weak , not growing at all over a recent 13 year stretch bad loans have festered good loans have deteriorated italys problems are europes problems nearly one fifth of all loans in the italian banking system are classified as troubled , a toll worth 360 billion euros , or nearly 400 billion , at the end of last year , according to the international monetary fund that represents roughly 40 percent of all the bad loans within the countries sharing the euro in recent weeks , the worlds focus has shifted to germanys largest lender , deutsche bank , on fears that it could be forced to seek a rescue but if deutsche has become the crisis of the moment , italy is the perpetual threat that could , at any moment , present the world with an unpleasant surprise potent enough to send legions of officials descending on rome to try to contain the damage the italian government has sought to spend more money to spur the economy but european leaders , led by germany , have enforced rules limiting budget deficits and italian banks have held tight to cash and are reluctant to lend , starving an already anemic economy of capital all of which leaves italy and europe , and to some extent the global economy , with a formidable conundrum europe may never regain economic vigor so long as italys banks are a slow motion emergency but italys banks cannot get healthy without growth and italys economy cant grow without healthy banks mr massiah has no patience for stories that cast banking as the source of danger a few irresponsible cases aside , italys lenders are not the cause of trouble , he insisted rather , they are the victims of their times a recession that lasted seven years wiped out nearly a quarter of italian industry the unemployment rate sits above 11 percent the population is aging , and too few women are working , limiting spending power too many italian businesses are small operations that are especially vulnerable to globalization family run craft and apparel makers have been destroyed by low cost competition from china negative interest rates maintained by the european central bank to encourage lending have cut into bank profit margins this is a bank centric country , and there was a huge crisis , mr massiah said when the tide goes out , you dont see everything nice in the sea italys banking pain is a symptom of an italian business style that has traditionally favored relationships and community ties over a dispassionate analysis of the bottom line a perception the nation is eager to alter to visit senior italian officials in their offices decked out like personal versions of the sistine chapel is to hear a recitation of complaints that reforms have gone underappreciated they betray resentment that italy continues to be caricatured as the reckless debacle at the center of european economic decline the comically ineffectual former prime minister silvio berlusconi a fiercely tanned media magnate has been dispatched to history at the controls today is the young technocrat matteo renzi , who has delivered a spate of politically perilous reforms long sought by solemn faced officials in brussels under mr renzis direction , italy has made it easier to fire workers this has somewhat diminished a major disincentive to giving people jobs the not irrational fear that problem hires will stick around forever , like grown children tethered to the refrigerator italy has also sped up civil processes in its notoriously inefficient courts the prime minister is now seeking a constitutional change that would refashion the entire legislative process in an effort to break a logjam in the upper chamber of parliament he argues it would eliminate obstructions to further pro growth measures italians vote on the amendments next month if they reject the proposal , mr renzi has suggested he may step down yet in the telling of some economists , the reforms are a sideshow the trouble lies with the banks they prop up so called zombie companies that will never repay their loans , extending just enough credit to keep them current on their debts suggest this to the man in charge of the system , ignazio visco , governor of the bank of italy , and he recoils as if someone has thrown an offensive object on his elegant silk carpet the bulk of italys bad debt is backed by collateral , he said most of the remainder has a solid chance of turning into collectible debt , provided that economic growth returns it is the result of bad economic conditions , seven years of almost continuous recession , mr visco said banking is a symptom , not the cause banking is also an activity that in such conditions seems equal parts math and hope mr massiah , the man heading ubi banca , confronts a contradictory set of imperatives his bank is strong in northern italy , home to some of the most productive industrial areas in europe if he frets too much about limiting risk , he may deprive the companies that could build a more vibrant future but if he lends too aggressively , he risks creating more bad loans he is putting stock in darwin the weaker companies are dying , he said the survivors will be of higher quality if natural selection is playing out , workers in the industrial enclave of nave fear that they are threatened with extinction a speck of a town carved into the foothills of the alps some 60 miles east of milan , nave has long drawn sustenance from its steel mills now many of those plants are abandoned , their concrete walls disintegrating , their windows broken locals call the old factories the cemeteries outside the stefana steel mill , beyond the shuttered gates , idled workers hold vigil , waving placards at the occasional passing vehicle in the hopes that their presence will somehow translate into a resumption of their jobs stefanas business has disintegrated in the face of a global glut of steel and the disappearance of construction projects in italy and spain in late 2014 , workers began hearing that management was having difficulty paying for gas and electricity for two weeks , the plant shut down , then work resumed then , ubi and other italian lenders stopped delivering bank loans the end came in june most of the workers used to earn about 1 , 800 euros a month \( about 1 , 964 \) , plus pension and other benefits now they get half that via state aid and a local emergency fund the company sits in legal limbo as a judge sifts through claims from creditors twenty years have passed since fabio stefana \( no relation to the plant owners \) moved out on his own , courtesy of the wages he earned making steel when his wages stopped in june , he found himself asking his parents for help with groceries his father worked at the mill and retired from there now the fathers pension payments are supporting his 39 year old son i have to have lunch with my mother , said mr stefana , who frequently goes home for meals as a way to save money its not the right reason to eat with your parents mr massiah acknowledges the pain when his bank stops lending , but he does not dwell on it the son of libyan jews who fled to italy in the early 1960s , he favors pinstriped suits and round tortoiseshell glasses he looks at once like the university of rome graduate student in economics he used to be , and the head of a bank large enough to be regulated by the european central bank you have winners and losers , he said some of the steel companies are doing very well , because they are more sophisticated they do specialized stuff and others that were not managed in a proper way went bankrupt ubi may be the quintessential large italian lender it is not a grandiose disaster like banca monte dei paschi di siena , which mr renzi tried to resuscitate by injecting public money but new european rules prohibit taxpayer funded bailouts the bank is now laying off staff members and shutting branches in a desperate bid to win private investment nor is ubi like unicredit , the one italian financial institution large enough to be deemed systemically important on a global scale though unicredit also feels pressure to raise capital , it has a portfolio stocked with choice assets it would most likely be able to sell ubi was created by combining local cooperative lenders institutions meant to aid local merchants , not churn out profits for investors it reflects a spirit of collective undertaking that has made italy a beloved vacation destination and trusted source for food and fashion people paying a premium for a bottle of italian wine may savor the idea that the vintner feels a kinship with the people harvesting the grapes but such emotional dealings do not generally produce positive results when it comes to managing money since becoming chief executive of ubi in 2008 , mr massiah has sought to inculcate a modern banking culture he has been in the socially awkward position of having to honor the sense of community while saying no to people who feel entitled to hear yes we say , lets sit , he said lets see the business plan because if its not feasible , we are just making your agony longer the bad loans on ubis books dropped to 8 3 billion from 9 3 billion at the end of last year yet ubi , too , faces allegations of wrongdoing on thursday , italian prosecutors announced they had concluded an investigation finding evidence that mr massiah and 38 other bank officials obstructed italian regulators who had been looking into claims that the company had improperly elected a supervisory board in 2013 those accused have three weeks to prove that they do not deserve to be charged mr massiah dismissed the prosecution as the outgrowth of a highly politicized battle for control of the bank following a merger under the rules that had governed the entity , then a cooperative , the new board was formed through an election in which all individual shareholders had equal votes , regardless of how much of the bank they owned when a group of investors holding less than 1 percent lost the election seeking board seats , they accused bank executives of rigging the outcome , mr massiah said the people who lost were saying the bank was influencing the people who went to vote , mr massiah said its absolutely not true they are doing this because the ones who lost were trying to take control of the bank theres no accusation that we mismanaged one single euro its not a money story mr massiah added that he and the board ultimately changed the structure of ubi to ensure transparency votes are now apportioned to the size of the investment mr massiah spends hours with his branch managers , counseling them on how to more intently scrutinize balance sheets while delivering bad news even when they face a clash between cold numbers and what he calls the important values of life a young couple wanting a mortgage , for example , so they can buy a home and start a family its difficult for the people to manage the emotional part of the story , mr massiah said the guys that we do have at the branch are human beings and feel bad its terrible to say no , in particular in our culture in a way , in the anglo saxon culture , there is a more direct way to interact our culture is less straight our culture is less confrontational but italy is awash in the expensive consequences of social graces governing banking sometimes a no is protecting somebody , mr massiah said its a polite way of saying to a young couple , im killing you , accepting that mortgage please rent a house for the moment , and then when you earn more you can buy a house , he said we have to understand that we have to live at the level that we can allow sometimes no is just another word for not knowing how to assess the deal this is marco rossis takeaway , as he looks back at his futile effort to pry loose a loan mr rossi had been working as a business consultant when , six years ago , he stumbled on an opportunity of his own a german pharmaceutical company was in the process of merging with an israeli firm the two companies needed to sell some overlapping operations one unit sold over the counter drugs like aspirin another owned a respiratory drug mr rossi purchased the two units for the grand total of nothing he merely agreed to take responsibility for paying 80 workers along with their pension obligations he negotiated a deal with the union , agreeing to eschew layoffs and he bought licenses from other italian pharmaceutical companies enabling him to sell additional drugs , seeking to squeeze more revenue out of his sales force in his first two years of existence , he doubled his revenue to 12 million from about 6 million but achieving profitability required that he increase his sales further mr rossi purchased a license to sell a new cholesterol drug , but he needed funds to buy it wholesale all he needed was 300 , 000 , he said that was the last piece of the puzzle ubi had always seemed keen for his business , mr rossi said when he started the company , he had promptly deposited 2 million in his account they were very happy about that , he said mr rossi went to his local branch in central milan and sought a loan they asked for collateral , and he presented invoices worth 2 million but the bankers were unimpressed it was not a building , mr rossi said it was not something solid it was paper the local branch sent him to a central office , which told him there was no guarantee his business would continue to grow they said , give us your balance sheets for the last three years , and i told them that i only had two , mr rossi said they said , oh , youre a new company this was not a good thing to be i had to face ignorant people , mr rossi said , fuming they refused me the loan desperate , mr rossi tried another bank , veneto banca its bankers were prepared to extend a loan with one major catch they said , you need 300 , 000 we are prepared to give you 600 , 000 , mr rossi recalled but you have to take the extra 300 , 000 and buy the banks stock that would have doubled his payments while placing a sizable bet on a dicey bank if it failed , he would still be responsible for the loan this seemed dangerous and unsavory the next step is the mafia , mr rossi said his reluctance was ultimately validated this summer , as veneto banca teetered toward collapse and was eventually bailed out by a private investment fund , depositors yanked money out of branches and shareholders savings were wiped out in august , the italian authorities arrested a former chief executive of the bank on allegations that the bank had lent customers cash so they could buy company shares for mr rossi , his inability to borrow stopped his expansion plan in january 2013 , he sold the company for 3 million , he said 10 times what he had been seeking to borrow he rented a ballroom at a local hotel and gathered his entire staff there , he delivered the grim news sixty people three fourths of the work force were losing their jobs , though the sale enabled him to pay severance and maintain pensions i wanted to grow in italy , and the support that i received was zero , mr rossi said this is a country where we have a huge unemployment rate we have a lot of skilled people we have smart people with ideas why dont we create something \? mr massiah of ubi listened to this account with a pained grin no one ever tells the story of the bad idea that we didnt give money to , he said and yet , he offered , maybe his bank is overdoing it maybe , in their understandable eagerness to avoid a future with more bad loans , his bankers are being so conservative that they are perpetuating a long and lean present i could be wrong and overshoot it , mr massiah said we are asking ourselves always if we are doing something wrong
in the broadway classic the music man , set in 1912 , the con artist harold hill shows up in river city , iowa , and attempts to persuade the otherwise contented townspeople that their youth are slipping into degradation he singles out a billiard parlor , the devils playground , as the root you got trouble , he sings with a capital t and that rhymes with p and that stands for pool ! these days , you dont need goosed up threats of nicotine stains and rebuckled knickerbockers to rouse the anxieties of parents all you need is to broach the one subject that everyone views as trouble by now , all parents know that technology poses at least some threat to children just last month , the american academy of pediatrics released a study that said while digital and social media can help early learning , they also come with a host of risks , including negative effects on sleep , attention and learning , along with higher incidence of obesity and depression the group recommends that parents develop a family media use plan fair enough , but what should be in such a plan \? as the parent of adolescents , i want more than bromides i want to know what other parents are actually doing that works for the last six weeks , ive circulated \( on social media ! \) 20 questions covering topics like homework , passwords , bedtime and punishments i received responses from more than 60 families , and though the survey was unscientific , the answers have already changed how we manage tech at my house first phones the vast majority of parents who responded gave their children their first phones in sixth or seventh grade , with a few holding out until high school but those devices arent always cutting edge parents opted for dumb phones , flip phones or hand me down phones from siblings or grown ups they also turn off features , including wi fi , siri , even internet access other popular restrictions include writing an expected behavior contract no use of the internet on school days \( except schoolwork \) screen time limited to 30 to 60 minutes per day during the week , unlimited on saturday mornings another is a partial ban on group texting i was able to help my son feel better about not having this by allowing him to view group texts on the family ipad , one parent said it helped him see how little value the group chatter has phones during friend visits are another issue nothing more disappointing than seeing my childrens friends bring their devices to my home and have them focus on the devices to the exclusion of hanging out with my children my own favorite way to limit tech use poor reception the phones dont always work asked to give other parents advice on when to give their children a phone , the consensus answer was wait as long as possible once you provide it , its very difficult to take back homework should children be allowed to communicate with friends while doing homework \? two thirds of the parents say yes one third say no among the comments by the yeses were , only if they are in common areas of the house or only with the door open \( so we can monitor \) another added , depends if they are working on a project together , which is difficult to enforce the nos said that homework is done independently , and that if kids need help , they should find a parent , or the parents contact a teacher wider use of computers for homework also drew mixed reactions some parents are quite strict , limiting all technology outside of a computer for spelling or google docs only homework related sites and no social media only certain educational sites are allowed wikipedia is completely discouraged i strongly believe that actual books should be read for research purposes as opposed to googling everything others are more lax you have to let them use the tools they will need in their lifetime otherwise , lets give them coal and a slate slab , like lincoln bedtime researchers at kings college london have found strong and consistent association between using devices at bedtime and inadequate sleep , poor sleep and increased sleepiness during daytime parents have gotten the message an overwhelming majority ban phones from bedrooms at bedtime tech needs a bedtime , too , in our house , 30 mins before lights out no technology one hour before bedtime at 9 p m she brings her phone downstairs , where it stays until 7 a m devices are supposed to be parked outside the kids bedrooms before they turn in for the night some parents make exceptions on weekends or as kids get older a few have no restrictions at all , though one otherwise tech friendly mom said no earbuds ! our carbon monoxide detector went off one night and he did not wake up because he was sleeping with earbuds in at least one dad goes to the opposite extreme , turning off the wi fi in the house at an appointed time each night same rules , better enforcement , he said also popular is to require phones to be charged outside the bedroom everyone in our house puts phones on a charging station in our kitchen before going to bed devices are charged in the kitchen \( i cook a lot and i can keep an eye on them , especially when the children are punished and still try to sneak off with them \) at bedtime , devices go in the bathroom for charging one mother has no specific place , only not in the childs room my husband and i simply ask where the phones are charging during our audits of responsibility if the children try to work around the rule , they know the device will be placed in jail social media many parents restrict first time phone users to a single social media platform only snapchat no instagram , twitter , facebook only instagram , and i check it occasionally one platform at a time regardless of the sites , most parents insist on knowing passwords and logins my rules , until he was 18 , were that i get all the passwords to all accounts i did spot check from time to time i have all usernames and passwords , and if they change , she has to update my list if i try to log on and cannot , i get the phone until it pleases me to give it back do parents actually monitor their childrens online behavior \? some do i read texts frequently we are friends or following all of his social media accounts , so we see every post i have asked to read texts when daughter was hiding device as i came into the room i do random audits we talk about digital citizenship and positive words but others prefer to give their children freedom when they each began texting , i read random texts and i asked about the ones i read \( i see you and friend are chatting about the jets , or i see you and friend are chatting about another child in class \) that way they know i can read any text at any time , even though i dont theyre almost all very boring punishments what happens if children violate the family rules \? is it actually possible to separate a digital native from a device for an extended period of time \? behold , skeptical ones many parents say yes yes when younger yes , she responds to it yes ! ! its the ultimate motivator ! yes weeping and gnashing of teeth , and then they find other things to do i have he gets very angry initially but eventually he calms down last spring i implemented a 3 week digital cleanse he was angry each day for 3 days but also became more pleasant another common way to get children to adhere to restrictions is to have them pay for overages we pay the fee but have her pay overages we also cut data off she now babysits family friends to earn more and has to learn basic budgeting family time perhaps the biggest complaint about technology is that it eats into family time so what techniques have parents used to take back that time \? first , tech free dining no devices for all meals no phones at the table , and thats not just at our house siblings , nieces , nephews and my moms home have the same rule no one gripes about it , they just do it no devices at meals no earbuds in the car second , consider positive alternatives doing things that make phones a burden playing a fast moving game , hiking , attending concerts or performances we watch movies together , have a fire in the yard or swim when its warm and have game night , only board games allowed they used to complain , but have found favorite games and look forward to it now do something constructive together make sure everyone \( even mommy and daddy \) get their hands dirty we often will cook together and make some of the worst meals ever , but its o k because we did it together finally , when all else fails , many rely on the old parental standbys threats , bribes and public humiliation threats randomly i scream , take that phone out of your hand ! it limits their use for the next five minutes bribes parent child date night \( parents alternate taking one child out for a treat fourth week is parents night out \) public humiliation if a device is picked up during family time , we get to open texts , and my husband and i do dramatic text reading now thats a technique even the parents of river city might embrace these days , trouble may start with the phone , but the solution still begins at home
two days before the start of last years winter meetings , major league baseballs annual convention , the mets announced that general manager sandy alderson could not attend the event in nashville because he was dealing with a treatable form of cancer everyone in baseball attends the winter meetings all 30 teams send the members of their front offices , often accompanied by scouts and owners most agents are there , too with alderson beginning chemotherapy , his main lieutenants agreed to turn to one point man during what turned out to be four busy and critical days in their off season john ricco , the teams assistant general manager since 2004 john handled it in such a way that everything that was done , i felt it was being done by sandy , and thats a compliment to john , said yankees general manager brian cashman , who watched from afar before those meetings , casual mets fans knew of ricco , if they had heard of him at all , as the teams longtime assistant general manager yet inside the mets and across baseball , ricco was a well known and respected executive , a steadying force inside the teams baseball operations through years of both contending and rebuilding he has served as the right hand man to three mets general managers jim duquette , omar minaya and alderson during riccos time , the mets have reached the national league championship series in 2006 and rebounded from financial losses sustained in the bernard l madoff scandal to reach the world series in 2015 but perhaps the best effort yet was riccos role in helping the mets front office patch up an injury riddled 2016 team with in season moves that turned them into a wild card team were fortunate to have him , alderson said as time has gone on , hes taken on more responsibility , and i have tremendous faith in his judgment aldersons health has improved since last winter , but riccos function will remain the same during another important off season for the mets with many injured players expected to have recovered , the mets may be a force next season to contend , they hope to retain the free agent outfielder yoenis cespedes , an all star last season , but they may have to display the same nimbleness as they did last december with alderson at home during the winter meetings , the mets courted ben zobrist , but he signed with the chicago cubs a day later , the mets traded for neil walker to shore up second base and signed asdrubal cabrera to play shortstop ricco , 48 , helped lead the mets efforts in nashville while staying in constant touch with alderson , and he spoke to reporters at every turn what everyone saw at the winter meetings is what we see on a day to day basis , said adam fisher , the mets director of baseball operations , who has worked with ricco for a dozen years hes calm , cool and collected in pressure situations , and he can handle himself fine as a leader hes been in the middle of every single one of our big acquisitions for the last 12 years riccos path to the mets front office began in a newsroom growing up in cresskill , n j , ricco was a yankees fan an allegiance that has long since fizzled he wanted a career in sports but was not sure in exactly what capacity he worked at the student newspaper at villanova , where he earned a degree in communications , and by his second semester he was the sports editor he secured an internship at the abc affiliate in philadelphia and did some freelance work for television production companies after he graduated in 1990 , ricco sent his rsum to every television network and baseball team and received no interest disappointed , he cast a wider net to public relations firms , and through a chance connection he landed an interview with jeff idelson , then the yankees director of media relations ricco spent 1991 as an intern in the yankees media relations department i was open to anything in sports , and this is kind of what happened , he said that internship led to another , this time in the american league media relations office , back when each league had its own office that led to a full time job , and then an offer to run the leagues waiver wire he administered all of the a l teams transactions , learning the nuances of baseballs rules i was 23 years old doing that , and that was kind of my ticket into where i am today , ricco said i started working with the g m s and assistant g m s on a daily basis and advising them on different rules that sparked riccos love for the details of baseball navigating the rules , juggling the moving pieces of the major league and minor league rosters , balancing a budget after four years of transactions , ricco moved to major league baseballs labor relations department a breeding ground for future team executives and learned about the salary arbitration system and the collective bargaining agreement with the players union over the next 12 years , ricco moved his way up in the commissioners office , handling matters including player grievances , dealing with agents and helping rob manfred , before he became commissioner , determine the financial components of the labor agreements with the players union i made a lot of connections , ricco said in 1998 , when cashman took over as general manager of the yankees , he remembered the former intern who had blossomed in the commissioners office and tried to hire him ricco turned down the offer of an assistant general manager position because he felt there was more he wanted to learn abut contract negotiations and the economics of baseball other teams tried to lure ricco as well when minaya became the general manager of the montreal expos in 2002 , his first call was to ricco finally , in 2004 , ricco interviewed with the mets and accepted duquettes offer to become his assistant general manager i was brought in more because they knew i had experience with the rules and contracts , ricco said those were the two areas and still remain my bread and butter after a 91 loss season , duquette was pushed aside and replaced by minaya the mets made splashes over the next two years , trading for carlos delgado and paul lo duca and signing pedro martinez , carlos beltran and billy wagner he kept everything together when i was there and allowed me to go and pursue the talent , minaya said in a lot of ways , he was running the whole operation minaya pushed ricco to watch games alongside the mets top scouts ricco learned how to evaluate scouts , hire capable ones and rely on them like most modern general managers , alderson did not come from a scouting background , but he has proved to be a successful executive because of qualities that he said ricco also possessed john is a good decision maker and takes input from a lot of different sources , and hes able to synthesize them to make good decisions , alderson said hes been exposed enough to scouting and player development that hes able to manage them after minaya was fired in 2010 , the mets owners told ricco they wanted to hire a general manager from outside the organization ricco helped line up interviews and prepared questions for the man who became his new boss alderson knew ricco well from their dealings during his time in the commissioners office , as well as his turns as the top executive of the oakland athletics and the san diego padres riccos duties encompass every aspect of the organization as vice president and assistant general manager , ricco is responsible for the day to day operation of an organization that has about 250 players across all levels and 175 nonplayer employees he , alderson and the special assistant j p ricciardi are the key baseball decision makers for the mets ricco oversees the budget the mets major league payroll was about 140 million in 2016 , and their nonplayer budget was about 45 million ricco coordinates the medical and training staff , and keeps the owners and manager terry collins abreast of players health he travels with the team on about half the road trips , giving him a chance to spend time with his wife , blakely , and their three children when he is not on the road he spends half his day on his email or on the phone , including time on the drive to citi field from his home in cedar grove , n j because its something i love , its energizing , he said but it is relentless there are no two ways about it it is 24 7 and because the demands are great on a general manager in the largest market in the country , ricco has helped alderson with the media aspect of his job while recuperating at home during last years winter meetings , alderson watched how ricco handled himself during his televised interviews he said he believed ricco was ready to lead a team one day hes worked for three different general managers and learned something from every one of them , alderson said and hes done it in a difficult market that doesnt tolerate any mistakes too well
something is deeply wrong when the popes voice , reputation and influence can be borrowed by a source that describes itself as a fantasy news site to claim that he has endorsed a presidential candidate , and then be amplified , unchallenged , through a million individual shares the attention paid to fake news since the election has focused largely on fabrications and outright lies , because they are indefensible , easy to identify and extraordinarily viral fake news is created by the kinds of people who , when asked , might call their work satire , or admit that theyre in it for the money or for the thrill of deception theirs is a behavior that can and should be shunned , and that facebook is equipped , and maybe willing , to deal with for many people , and especially opponents of president elect donald j trump , the attention paid to fake news and its role in the election has provided a small relief , the discovery of the error that explains everything but as the attention has spread widely even president obama talked passionately about it on thursday it may lead to an unwanted outcome for those who see it not just as an explanation , but also as a way to correct the course it misunderstands a new media world in which every story , and source , is at risk of being discredited , not by argument but by sheer force false news stories posted on fly by night websites were prevalent in this election so , too , were widely shared political videos some styled as newscasts containing outright falsehoods , newslike image memes posted by individuals and shared by millions , and endlessly shared quotes and video clips of the candidates themselves repeating falsehoods during the months i spent talking to partisan facebook page operators for a magazine article this year , it became clear that while the ecosystem contained easily identifiable and intentional fabrication , it contained much , much more of something else i recall a conversation with a fact checker about how to describe a story , posted on a pro trump website and promoted on a pro trump facebook page and , incidentally , copied from another pro trump site by overseas contractors it tried to cast suspicion on khizr khan , the father of a slain american soldier , who had spoken out against donald j trump the overarching claims of the story were disingenuous and horrifying the facts it included had been removed from all useful context and placed in a new , sinister one its insinuating mention of muslim martyrs , in proximity to mentions of mr khans son , and its misleading and strategic mention of shariah law , amounted to a repulsive smear it was a story that appealed to bigoted ideas and that would clearly appeal to those who held them this was a story the likes of which was an enormous force in this election , clearly designed to function well within facebooks economy of sharing and it probably would not run afoul of the narrow definition of fake news stories like that one get to the heart of the rhetorical and strategic risk of holding up fake news as a broad media offensive position , especially after an election cycle characterized by the euphoric inversion of rhetoric by some of mr trumps supporters , and by the candidate himself as the campaign progressed , criticism of mr trump was instantly projected back at his opponent , or at the critics themselves no puppet no puppet youre the puppet this tactic was used on the language of social justice , which was appropriated by opponents and redeployed nihilistically , in an open effort to sap its power while simultaneously taking advantage of what power it retained anti racists were cast as the real racists progressives were cast as secretly regressive on their own terms this was not a new tactic , but it was newly effective it didnt matter that its targets knew that it was a bad faith maneuver , a clear bid for power rather than an attempt to engage or reason the referees called foul , but nobody could hear them over the roar of the crowds or maybe they could , but realized that nobody could make them listen fake news as shorthand will almost surely be returned upon the media tenfold the fake news narrative , as widely understood and deployed , has already begun to encompass not just falsified , fabricated stories , but a wider swath of traditional media on facebook and elsewhere fox news \? fake news mr trumps misleading claims about ford keeping jobs in america \? fake news the entirety of hyperpartisan facebook \? fake news this wide formulation of fake news will be applied back to the traditional news media , which does not yet understand how threatened its ability is to declare things true , even when they are facebook may try to address the narrow version of the problem , the clearly fabricated posts facebook has plenty of tools at its disposal and has already promised to use one , to bar sites that have been flagged as promoting falsified content from using its advertising platform but the worst identified defenders make their money outside facebook anyway another narrow response from facebook could be to assert editorial control over external forces facebook tried this , to a very limited extent , with trending topics members of the companys editorial staff wrote descriptions of trending news stories , accompanied by links they deemed credible this initiative collapsed in a frenzy of bias accusations and political fear but it is easy to imagine a system in which a story , upon reaching some high threshold of shares , or a source , upon reaching some cumulative audience , could be audited and declared unreliable this could resemble facebooks short lived experiment to tag satire articles as such a number of narrow measures could stop a fake story about the pope , for example but where would that leave the rest of the media \? answered and rebutted , and barely better positioned against everything else that remained it would be a still dominant news environment in which almost everything there before remained intact , the main difference being that it would have all been declared , implicitly , not fake facebook is a place where people construct and project identities to friends , family and peers it is a marketplace in which news is valuable mainly to the extent that it serves those identities it is a system built on ranking and vetting and voting , and yet one where negative inputs are scarcely possible , and where conflict is resolved with isolation \( not that provisions for open conflict on a platform present any easy alternatives for twitter , it has been a source of constant crisis \) fake news operations are closely aligned with the experienced incentives of the facebook economy more closely , perhaps , than most of the organizations that are identifying them their removal will be an improvement the outrage at their mere existence , and at their promotion on a platform with the stated goal of connecting the world , will have been justified but the outrage is at risk of being misdirected , and will be followed by the realization that the colloquial fake news the newslike media , amateur and professional , for which truth is defined first in personal and political terms , and which must only meet the bar of not being obviously , inarguably , demonstrably false will continue growing apace , gaining authority by sheer force , not despite facebook but because of it the company that created the system that resulted in hoax news stories should try to eliminate them , and with any luck it will but the system stands to remain intact media companies have spent years looking to facebook , waiting for the company to present a solution to their mounting business concerns despite , or perhaps because of , its being credited with causing those concerns some have come to the realization that this was mistaken , even absurd those who expect the operator of the dominant media ecosystem of our time , in response to getting caught promoting lies , to suddenly return authority to the companies it has superseded are in for a similar surprise
off broadway theaters , under pressure from an aggressive social media campaign by performers , have agreed to pay higher salaries to hundreds of actors and stage managers the actors equity association , the labor union representing actors and stage managers , and the league of off broadway theaters and producers , a trade group representing nonprofit and commercial theaters in new york with between 100 and 499 seats , said friday that they had reached an agreement after weeks of contentious contract talks the settlement averts a possible strike or other job action the two sides did not immediately release full details of the agreement , which was approved friday afternoon by the eastern regional board of actors equity but kate shindle , the equity president , said it would provide hefty wage increases ranging from 32 to 81 percent over the five year contract , which covers members working in off broadway theaters of all types and budgets this is really a fantastic day for professional actors , ms shindle said we are so pleased and proud that our off broadway partners recognize the value of our actors and stage managers adam hess , president of the off broadway league , in a statement , cited the groups role as a fair and progressive leader we champion new voices , we have been at the forefront of diversity on our stages , and we are proud to also support our actors and stage managers with a fair wage , he said stage acting has long been a poorly paid profession , and it is not unusual for union members to agitate for higher wages but off broadway performers said their campaign this time was different because their wages had become increasingly unacceptable in most cases , off broadway actors are paid no more than 593 a week , in roles that generally last only a few weeks , and they have to pay 10 percent to an agent , 2 25 percent to their union , and about 30 percent in taxes , leaving them with take home pay that does not , they say , cover the cost of living in new york acting off broadway pays significantly less well than acting on broadway \( where the minimum salary is about 1 , 900 a week \) , and many professional nonprofit theaters outside new york also pay significantly higher salaries than the off broadway theaters the performers waged a high visibility social media campaign , using a hashtag , fairwageonstage , to enlist support from celebrities as they sought to pressure the citys nonprofit theaters and commercial producers to pay higher salaries off broadway , where many of the nations most critically acclaimed productions are developed actors said they were motivated to action in part by the increasing cost of living in new york city , and in part by an awareness that the citys biggest nonprofits have become increasingly large the public theater has a 41 million annual budget , and the signature theater hired frank gehry to build a multimillion dollar stage complex nicholas westrate , an actor and organizer for the fair wage onstage campaign , noted in an interview that the agreement did not force smaller theaters to offer the same increases as the larger ones the old one size fits all wasnt working for anybody , he said im so glad equity and the producers came to an agreement on that the new agreement makes sense , and is going to allow both the actors and stage managers and the theaters to thrive
whenever you withdraw money from an automated teller machine , the a t m deposits microbes onto you that shouldnt be surprising because germs and bacteria are everywhere on doorknobs , subway seats , staircases , your cat , your dog , your face you cant avoid them , especially when youre punching in your pin researchers in new york city swabbed the keypads of 66 a t m s at banks , bodegas and other places across manhattan , brooklyn and queens they found that a t m s are mostly covered in microbes from human skin , similar to the ones found in bathrooms , on pillowcases and on televisions they also found that in addition to leaving bits of ourselves behind whenever we touch the keypads , we also litter the machines with leftovers traces of chicken , fish and other seafood were among the most commonly found microbes in manhattan they found a mold called xeromyces bisporus , which is associated with spoiled cakes and other baked goods new yorkers love their food , its not that surprising , said jane carlton , an urban microbiology ecologist from new york university and an author of the study , which was published wednesday in the journal msphere she added that the microbes they found were pretty consistent across boroughs and stressed that the majority of the microbes they found were harmless gross , perhaps , but mostly harmless to researchers like dr carlton , a t m s act like miniature laboratories where they can study the dna of the city the machines house a unique microcosm on their keypads that reflects the people who use them every day the team did not look at touch screen a t m s the study is part of a larger research project to investigate new york citys urban microbiome so far , researchers have already looked at microbes on the subway system , which provide insight into people from all around the city the a t m findings , dr carlton said , were just another piece in the jigsaw puzzle of microbes in new york city to complete their portrait they plan to next look at the citys pets and pests that means swabbing cats , dogs , squirrels , pigeons , rats and cockroaches
tunis mothers trembled with anger demanding justice for sons shot dead during protests that ushered in democracy former prisoners described being tortured , humiliated and forced to engage in homosexual acts the abuses , they recalled , were deliberate , sadistic and aimed to break them torture in the prison was not systematic , it was chaotic , said sami brahim , who was arrested as a student in the 1990s everything that happened in abu ghraib has already happened in tunisia , he said , referring to the abuses by american troops in the notorious prison in iraq that was just the first day of testimony in long awaited public hearings by tunisias truth and dignity commission , an effort unique in the arab world to salve the wounds from nearly 60 years of dictatorship and give a modicum of recognition and respect to the victims and their families seven witnesses testified live on national television and radio thursday evening in a highly charged ceremony a second evening of testimony is scheduled for friday much of the nation is riveted it is the first time that tunisians have been given a state venue to air the horrors of decades of systematic human rights violations

the rule of law , sihem bensedrine , the president of the truth and dignity commission , said in an opening speech victims of despotism are entitled to fairness and justice , and this is the message we are conveying to the whole world over the past two years , the commission has taken in 65 , 000 complaints from victims investigating about 10 , 000 of them so far but has struggled against political and institutional resistance and a hostile national news media , which has accused it of spending money but doing nothing with the public hearings , ms bensedrine said she hoped to win greater public support and push back against the current governments argument that stability and reconciliation are more important than reopening old wounds the audience on thursday included many politicians and activists who themselves had suffered imprisonment , torture and exile under the dictatorships there were also representatives of truth commissions from africa , asia and latin america , and foreign diplomats senior tunisian government officials were conspicuously absent the setting was fittingly symbolic , a reminder of the corrupt regime that oversaw some of the worst abuses club elyssa , a luxurious spa in a northern suburb of tunis that was once owned by leila trabelsi , the former first lady and wife of the ousted president , mr ben ali it is a way for us to say that society is finally recovering such ill gotten places to underscore the principle of the rule of law , ms bensedrine said when announcing the venue the significance of the setting was not lost on those who testified , including ourida kaddouss , whose 27 year old son , raouf , was shot in the head during protests in sidi bouzid , where a young man had set himself on fire and initiated the arab spring nearly six years ago you could not even say leilas name , she said , recalling the times under mr ben ali and here we are now in leilas palace if leila comes back , we will be ready we are not going to let them but mostly , she said , she wanted justice for her son and her family we gave our most valuable thing we have and you forgot us , ms kaddouss said we want the rights of the revolution , we want dignity , we want to live freely she and two other mothers who testified complained that the military tribunals that tried the killers of their sons had handed down lenient or suspended sentences for the perpetrators ribeh briki , whose son slah dachroui was one of 300 people who died in tunisia during the arab spring protests of 2011 , held up her sons picture you the commission will bring back our rights , she said we want the truth , and my appeal is for those traitors and killers of our children to be punished properly she , too , challenged the ousted president , mr ben ali , who she hoped was watching from his home in exile in saudi arabia if you are brave enough , come back , she said we are sitting where you used to sit in an interview on tuesday , ms bensedrine said she wanted to see some cases go to trial , and also to have some of the perpetrators testify before the commission at a later stage her ultimate goal remains to dismantle the system so dictatorship can never return , she said we have to reflect how injustice went unpunished , and how it was allowed to happen , she told the audience the mothers testimonies were a nod to the importance of the revolution in allowing democratic change in tunisia the testimonies that followed were examples of some of the worst abuses that occurred throughout tunisias modern history death from torture , forced disappearance , political imprisonment , sexual and psychological torture , and persecution of prisoners and their families for years after their release latifa and fatma matmati , the wife and mother of kamel matmati , described how he was detained and killed under torture within hours of his arrest in 1991 in the town of gabs the police hid it from them for years for nearly two decades the family was harassed by the police , accused of helping mr matmati abscond , or told to search for him in different prisons around the country only in 2009 were mr matmatis relatives finally told that he had died in 2015 they received a death certificate , but they have never been given his body i want his body to be honored with a funeral , and for these people to be held accountable , his wife said they are walking around during his testimony , mr brahim , who is now studying for his doctorate , described how on the day of legislative elections in the 1990s , a group of prisoners were ordered into a courtyard by a unit with police dogs we were made to strip of all clothing and shoved up against each other , with batons , he said it was sexual violence after he collapsed at the scene , he was moved to the infirmary , where a doctor poured a liter of ether on him , burning his genitals the prisoners were then branded by the prison staff members as homosexuals the torture was supervised by a psychologist this man who was in charge of our reform was in fact in charge of the moral collapse of the prisoners , mr brahim said he called on his torturers to come forward and explain their actions i chose not to name them , but i dont think their brothers or wives would expect they were capable of this , he said i am willing to forgive them as long as they admit to this and explain , he said i am not going to sue if you ask me personally , i just want the truth and for this black period to be written down so this does not happen again at least our sons and daughters would not have to live this way
when all def comedy , my showcase for up and coming black comedians , had its premiere on nov 12 on hbo , it brought back memories of def comedy jam , its 90s era predecessor in the new york times , jason zinoman wrote an appreciation of the old show , calling it trailblazing and filled with a staggering amount of talent while i liked a lot of what he said , he lacked insight on one point how important a platform like this still is the new show arrives in a very different comedy climate , he wrote , adding , there are more platforms today and noting that the scene is less segregated the fact is , the scene is still largely as segregated as it was 25 years ago though emerging and creative voices are readily accessible my media company , all def digital , has put a great deal of such talent in front of audiences on youtube , facebook , snapchat and spotify hollywoods traditional gatekeepers still reach around the black community and its most cutting edge comedic talent in favor of much safer performers the comics favored by these gatekeepers are fine for television , but do you see any of them being cast in major motion pictures \? im currently circulating scripts for 13 different big screen comedies , and the response from studio executives to almost every one is the same can you get kevin hart to do it \? kevin hart happens to be great , but hes also apparently the only black comedian that any of these executives believe can carry a movie today there is a ton of black , asian and latino comedy talent in hollywood now but these performers are segregated into a few performing spots politically , of course , hollywood is very well intentioned and liberal culturally , its a backwater in the current setup , black comedians are restricted to black comedy nights in various clubs , like mo betta monday itd be funny if it werent so pathetic meanwhile , these specialty showcases are often the biggest nights of the week for the clubs that host them if there were more than just a few black talent agents in this city , the world would already have heard much more from the comedy stars of this new generation but thats not happening hollywood so white describes the problem in a nutshell i guess this blindness on the part of hollywood gatekeepers represents a huge opportunity for me for the last 30 months , ive been producing a weekly showcase at the tcl chinese theater its called all def comedy live , it always sells out , and , as you probably guessed , it was the inspiration for the show on hbo im pretty confident that the show will succeed on tv and that it will provide a gateway for new black talent to help fill this hole in the market call it the hip hop effect or the tanning of america hip hop music rescued and revitalized rock n roll and the music industry in the 80s and 90s , then quickly did the same for the fashion industry in politics , hip hop not only brought millions of otherwise alienated young people into the electoral process , but it was also instrumental in putting a black man into the white house def comedy jam introduced the world to martin lawrence , chris tucker , bernie mac , jamie foxx , cedric the entertainer , steve harvey , tracy morgan , kevin hart , katt williams and many others mr zinoman zeroed in on the genius of black style when he noted that chris tucker had a delivery with such momentum and snap that he made jokes sound like music eventually , the movie industry jumped on the bandwagon for a while , the biggest movie star in the world was a former rapper who began his career as the fresh prince but the industrys current gatekeepers seem to have forgotten just how potent creatively and economically the black community can be whatever im back in hollywood , im paying attention , and its my great honor and pleasure to present all this new talent to the world
a century ago , almost all black americans lived in the south , largely in rural areas by 1970 , most lived outside the south , a great many in northern and western industrial cities driven , in part , by hopes for greater economic opportunity , millions of black migrants made this move did they find what they were looking for \? in ways , yes black workers in the north and west , in addition to experiencing greater social and political freedoms , made much more money than did their counterparts in the south but there were also disappointments black migration to industrial cities was not met with steadily growing economic equality between black and white workers \( in fact , from 1940 to 2010 , the earnings gap between the two groups in the north was virtually unchanged \) and as migration increased , so did black residential isolation exacerbated by white flight to the suburbs and eventually , economic stagnation by 1970 , seven out of 10 black americans in northern and western cities resided in majority black neighborhoods , which were often beset by high levels of poverty and crime scholars in the early part of the 20th century had predicted migration would do more for black americans than it did what happened \? in her rich and technical account competition in the promised land black migrants in northern cities and labor markets \( princeton university , 29 95 \) , the economist leah platt boustan employs the tools of her trade resourceful matching of data sets , rigorous modeling of labor phenomena , sweeping use of census figures to analyze the demographics and economics of the great migration as a whole more traditional historians , often focusing on a single city \( or a couple of cities \) and relying on less nationally representative sources like oral histories and newspaper accounts , have not typically done this boustan does not aim to overturn the conventional explanation for sluggish black economic growth in the north namely , the decline of american manufacturing and the persistence of racism in labor and housing markets but here , as with many other aspects of the migration story , her investigation both deepens our understanding of what we think we know and adds new complexities and wrinkles for example , as the title of her book suggests , boustan is interested in whether black economic progress in the north was hamstrung by labor competition between southern born and northern born black workers \( a fear voiced as early as 1923 by w e b du bois \) she finds that between 1940 and 1970 \( the years of heaviest migration \) such competition did indeed lower wages for black men in the north by 4 billion a year \( in 2010 dollars \) , or 10 percent of their median earnings absent such competition , she argues , black workers already living in the north would have closed more of the earnings gap with white workers she stresses , however , that this finding does not let racism off the hook black workers were competing with one another , as opposed to with white workers , sometimes because of discriminatory hiring practices that excluded blacks from jobs for which they were qualified and sometimes \( boustan suggests even more often \) because they were genuinely less qualified than similarly trained white workers on account of the lower quality of their schooling \( itself a reflection of racial inequities \) as for the poor black urban neighborhoods that arose in the wake of the great migration , many of which are still characterized by various forms of disadvantage what should be done \? in his provocative book dark ghettos injustice , dissent , and reform \( belknap harvard university , 29 95 \) , the philosopher tommie shelby tackles this question but he doesnt lay out a jobs program or a housing initiative indeed , as he freely admits , he offers no new political strategies or policy proposals what he aims to do instead is both more abstract and more radical to challenge the assumption , common to liberals and conservatives alike , that ghettos are problems best addressed with narrowly targeted government programs or civic interventions for shelby , ghettos are something more troubling and less tractable symptoms of the systemic injustice of the united states they represent not aberrant dysfunction but the natural workings of a deeply unfair scheme the only real solution , in this way of thinking , is the fundamental reform of the basic structure of our society this proposal may sound too ambitious to be of much relevance to everyday debates about how to help struggling urban neighborhoods shelby is asking for no less than an overhaul of our major political , economic and social institutions \( roughly along the lines of those of a progressive scandinavian country \) even if you agree that the ghetto poor are not merely disadvantaged but unjustly disadvantaged , you may still deem it wiser to focus on more immediate measures but here is where shelbys argument becomes more germane he contends that the injustice of american ghettos places certain moral constraints on what the government may do to try to improve them in his view , for example , the state may not justifiably require people to work in order to receive welfare benefits likewise , the injustice of ghettos relaxes certain moral constraints , shelby believes , on the behavior of the ghetto poor , some of whose otherwise blameworthy and punishable actions are , as he sees it , sound expressions of self respect and legitimate resistance to an oppressive status quo \( he cites shoplifting , welfare fraud and tax evasion as examples \) at the heart of these arguments is a simple principle reciprocity in a just society , you receive your fair share and contribute your fair share but if you are born into a ghetto with its social stigma , its poor schools , its go nowhere jobs , its high levels of crime , drug use and incarceration in what sense , shelby asks , have you received your fair share , your equitable shot at life \? and if society has not held up its end of the bargain , the least it can do , when trying to patch things up , is respect the autonomy and self esteem of those it aims to help a poor single woman in a ghetto may not have the resources to be an ideal parent , shelby is willing to concede but if that is ultimately a shortcoming of our society , it adds insult to injury to structure welfare benefits \( as has been done in the united states \) so as to discourage nonmarital childbearing thereby hindering her reproductive freedom similarly , shelby does not deny that high jobless rates in ghettos are a problem but if some of the ghetto poor choose not to work , he says , maybe that is because they refuse to accommodate themselves to their place in a social order where it is possible to work full time and still live in poverty this refusal , he allows , may not be the most constructive basis of self esteem or the purest ethic of resistance but at least its something perhaps , he suggests , its something that will serve to make the ghetto poor active allies in a collective effort at fundamental change in the united states is a welfare program that mandates work justified in taking even this away \? another way of stating shelbys position is that even if , controversially , you were to grant a culture of poverty argument that disrespect of authority , single parent homes and reluctance to work are helping to perpetuate or worsen ghetto conditions he would still oppose government efforts to coerce better behavior , out of respect for the autonomy , dignity and political resistance , however inchoate , of the wrongly oppressed though shelbys ghetto abolitionism draws on the writings of such canonical liberal thinkers as john rawls , in key respects it echoes a more radical text the black panther partys 10 point platform and program , drafted by huey p newton and bobby seale in 1966 , which also conceived the problem of the ghetto as one not merely of poverty and racism , but also of more systemic economic , educational , labor , housing , criminal justice and heath care injustices in the revolution has come black power , gender , and the black panther party in oakland \( duke university , paper , 24 95 \) , her detailed organizational history of the party , the historian robyn c spencer reminds us that for the partys leaders , it was critical that their platform be accessible , as newton put it , to the brothers on the block like shelby , they believed ghetto residents were crucial actors in any efforts at radical reform
the daily fantasy sports companies draftkings and fanduel have agreed to merge after a turbulent year in which both of their values plummeted as several attorneys general questioned the legality of their games in their states the merger must be approved by regulators and will take time the companies said they expected the deal to close in the second half of 2017 until then , both sides will operate under their own brands the merger was one of necessity lobbying and legal costs had damaged both companies bottom lines to the extent that representatives of the companies last month asked the new york attorney generals office to allow them to pay a combined 12 million settlement in installments after claims that they employed false and deceptive advertising practices , two people familiar with those negotiations said in recent weeks , according to these two people , fanduel , based in new york , laid off more than 60 people , and both companies have acknowledged that they are months behind in their payments to vendors , especially to the array of public relations and lobbying firms that they have employed across the nation to persuade individual state legislatures to legalize daily fantasy games the most critical component of rebuilding their business joining forces will allow us to truly realize the potential of our vision , and as a combined company , we will be able to accelerate the pace of innovation and bring a richer experience to our customers than we ever could have done separately , jason robins , chief executive of draftkings , said in a statement if the merger is approved , robins will retain that title in a new company , while fanduels chief executive , nigel eccles , will become chairman of the board while both companies have accomplished much already , eccles said , this transaction will create a business that can offer a greater variety of offerings , appealing to new users , including the tens of millions of season long fantasy players that havent yet tried our products last year , at the beginning of the n f l season , draftkings and fanduel overwhelmed sports broadcasts with hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising that emphasized their get rich quick prize payoffs at the time , it was a largely unregulated , multibillion dollar industry in which players paid a fee on a website , assembled virtual rosters of players in pursuit of jackpots ranging from 22 to 2 million , and scored points based on the real world outcomes of professional games daily fantasy sports appeared to be a virtual cash machine the companies were valued at more than 1 billion each their investors included major league baseball and the n b a the dallas cowboys owner jerry jones and the new england patriots owner robert k kraft and major media companies like nbc after a draftkings employee won a major jackpot on fanduels site in october 2015 , however , eric t schneiderman , the new york state attorney general , began an inquiry into whether employees of the companies had used inside information to prey on customers on each others sites soon , scores of class action lawsuits were filed in courts across the country schneiderman shut down the industry in new york , declaring daily fantasy sports to be illegal gambling , but he laid the groundwork for a deal in march when he suggested a june 30 deadline for the state legislature to act to address the games legal status it did , and gov andrew m cuomo signed the bill into law in august new york was the eighth state to declare daily fantasy sports legal , and the companies are facing expensive efforts to have their games legalized in the big markets of illinois and texas

sukhumi , georgia he is blind in one eye and has a bad hip that makes it painful to sit , never mind endure the kicks and punches that are an essential part of his job as a mixed martial arts fighter he is also nearly twice the age of many of his rivals at the top of his harrowingly brutal profession yet , as happens whenever jeff monson , a 45 year old american known as the snowman , visits a town in russia or , in this case , abkhazia , one of the pro russian enclaves in the lands of the former soviet union he was greeted with whoops of delight last month when he limped from the dynamo stadium locker room and clambered into a cage to battle a fit russian in his 20s after just a few minutes , the referee declared the combat over and the snowman , a former world champion , the loser on points all the same , the battered american remained the undisputed star of the show as he and his victorious opponent walked back into the locker room , fans ignored the russian and surged around mr monson , pleading for selfies and autographs the russian , 29 year old levan persaev , apologized for winning and told mr monson that the fight not a full mixed martial arts bout but a slightly more subdued grappling match should have been declared a draw jeff , i just want to say how much i respect you we all respect you you are a model for us all , mr persaev said the referee later took back his initial decision and declared the fight a draw at a time when the united states and russia do little but insult each other , mr monson has become perhaps russias favorite american , hugely admired for his tenacity , his readiness to endure pain and , not an insignificant factor , his outspoken belief that russia is right about most things , including the united states his views are so in sync with those of the kremlin that he has been given his own show on rt , a state funded television channel that promotes russias take on the world what makes this particular american so popular , however , is that he is in many ways a russian , or at least a close approximation of the image that many russians have of themselves as tough , unrelenting underdogs , righteous champions of the weak against the powerful and pure hearted avengers of the crimes committed by the strong , notably the united states in america , we think that they just drink vodka and want to take over the world , mr monson said in an interview before the fight in sukhumi but it is america that wrecks countries like iraq and then just walks away with total impunity born in minnesota and raised in washington state , he said he grew up rooting for the u s a but after studying psychology at the university of illinois and traveling overseas , he says , he figured out that the world is a little different from what he had believed his view of his home country today is summed up by the tattoo on his leg land of hypocrisy , it says over an upside down stars and stripes other tattoos include the hammer and sickle , several anarchist emblems , the faces of marx and lenin and , on his neck , words that pretty much define his political philosophy , at least with regard to the united states destroy authority although he has been a big name in the fighting world since the late 1990s , mr monson did not enter russias pantheon of popular heroes until 2011 , when , watched from ringside in moscow by vladimir v putin , then russias prime minister , he got pummeled by the countrys best known fighter , fedor emelianenko the russian shattered his leg and beat his face to a bloody pulp impressed by mr monsons tenacity in the face of defeat , mr putin telephoned him the next day and told him you have the russian spirit you never give up after that , mr monson , a father of three , started visiting russia regularly from his home in florida , traveling the country for cage fights , including one in st petersburg that was also watched by mr putin , a martial arts enthusiast mr monson now spends much of his time in russia and in other parts of the former soviet union , notably pro russian enclaves that crave recognition the president of abkhazia , a breakaway region of georgia that only russia and three other countries recognize and that does not get many foreign visitors other than russian budget tourists , appreciated mr monsons visit so much that he gave him a gold watch and pronounced him an honorary citizen of what much of the world views as a make believe country mr monson seemed bemused where is my passport \? he asked on leaving the abkhaz presidents office with only the watch and a letter thanking him for his great personal contribution to the protection and defense of the right of peoples to self determination and independence mr monson later acknowledged that he did not know much about abkhazia , which broke away from georgia in the early 1990s , and was alarmed to learn that getting citizenship there would almost certainly make it difficult for him to visit georgia i always wanted to visit georgia , but i guess that is not on the cards anymore , he said also probably unadvisable is a visit to chechnya , whose kremlin backed leader , ramzan a kadyrov , loves mixed martial arts but brooks no lip from veteran fighters mr emelianenko , mr monsons old opponent and now a good friend , got on the wrong side of mr kadyrov recently by criticizing a cage fighting contest involving the chechen leaders three underage sons the feud , initially confined to threats on social media , took a violent turn last month when an unidentified assailant beat up mr emelianenkos teenage daughter in moscow and put her in the hospital mr kadyrov denied any hand in the assault mr monson delights in defying the caricature of cage fighters as muscle bound masochists and morons with a masters degree in psychology and a former career in mental health , he is well read , highly articulate and , outside the fighting cage , gentle in manner just because i am a fighter does not mean i dont know what is going on , he said im a smart guy instilled with a fierce competitive spirit by his stepfather , who was in the military , mr monson said he always wanted to win , win , win he took up wrestling in college , and continued as a graduate student at the university of minnesota at duluth , where he earned a masters degree in psychology in 1997 after graduation , he worked at a community health center in seattle but , appalled by republican cuts in government health spending , decided that americas system was entirely broken and that he needed a new career by 2002 , he had quit counseling to take up fighting full time his political views , he said , generated lots of hate mail but also reached a wide audience thanks to fighting it gives me a platform , he said guided by the principle that the united states is usually wrong , he has thrown his support behind not only abkhazia , but other causes rejected by the west that would include things like the russian communist party , of which he is an ardent supporter , and breakaway regions of eastern ukraine he visited one such region , the self proclaimed luhansk peoples republic , in september with his second wife to accept another citizenship offer and promote efforts to set up a mixed martial arts school in the impoverished territory he hopes to get a russian passport and citizenship soon so that he can go into russian politics full time and even run for a seat in parliament on the ticket of the communist party , a tame and therefore tolerated russian opposition party he said he found the party too old fashioned and too docile but supports it because he views socialism as the only hope for russia and the world he said he was shocked by donald j trumps election victory and thinks that , regardless of the outcome of elections , americans put too much faith in the president to solve their own problems anyway , he added , my calling now is in russia as for his current career , getting pummeled by opponents 20 years his junior is no fun , he acknowledged , but he still wins sometimes and thinks he has a shot at regaining a world championship he first won in 1999 for grappling , which is less violent than full on mixed martial arts after his bout in sukhumi , he traveled to belgorod , in southern russia , for another fight against a much younger russian this time , he won a decisive victory he dismisses criticism that he has become a kremlin tool who too readily lends his name to oddball , anti western causes of course they are trying to get something out of me , he said but i have an agenda , too i believe in socialism he said he had no illusions about the russian authorities and was worried by the rising nationalist clamor promoted by mr putin , now the president it is dangerous , very dangerous , he said all the same , he thinks mr putin gets bad press and should be credited with doing a lot of good things for russia , a view that has endeared him to the kremlin and many ordinary russians unlike the united states , which he said paid no heed to what foreigners thought of it , russia wants to be accepted , he said americans have this idea of their own exceptionalism , but russians want approval well past his prime as a fighter , mr monson is barely known in the united states outside a narrow world of mixed martial arts , a macho milieu that tends to take a dim view of his anti american politics but here it is crazy , he said , as fans swarmed him while he took a walk along sukhumis waterfront promenade he has resisted pleas from family and friends to stop fighting and come home , particularly after he got knocked out in a christmas day fight in moscow against a young african that lasted under a minute it is hard to stop , man , he said

hamilton , bermuda kazuhiko sofuku sat on a leather couch in the base for his americas cup team , with the pale blue waters of bermudas great sound for a backdrop , pinched his cheek and gave it a shake to make sure this was not just a maritime mirage you know , this whole thing is beyond my dreams almost , he said last week on the eve of making the marathon journey to fukuoka , japan , for the louis vuitton americas cup world series event that begins on friday two years ago , sofuku was still living in valencia , spain , working as a freelance sailor and wondering whether it was time to take a new tack i was getting old , and my family was getting worried , he said but that was before sofuku , known in the international sailing community as fuku , received a call from russell coutts , who is chief executive of the americas cup event authority in charge of planning the next cup in bermuda in 2017 coutts told him that people in japan had preliminary interest in forming a new team could fuku provide advice and support \? i stopped everything i already had planned and went for it , sofuku said after months of negotiations , a new japanese syndicate , softbank team japan representing the kansai yacht club , announced in april 2015 that it would challenge for the 2017 americas cup with sofuku as general manager the teams main backer is masayoshi son , the tech billionaire who is the founder and chief executive of softbank group and who is , according to forbes , japans second wealthiest man sofuku and the team hired dean barker , the star helmsman from new zealand , as skipper and chief executive , and then added another major talent , chris draper of britain , as tactician and sailing team manager the last time a japanese syndicate participated in the cup was in 2000 in auckland , new zealand , when sofuku was a bowman on the crew of nippon challenge sixteen years later , fuku remains the most prominent japanese sailor in the cup community even though the cup has changed radically with the shift from monohulls to much faster foiling catamarans to be honest with you , the challenge and physical demands of this new type of boat are extremely hard , said sofuku , 50 but somehow i still enjoy to wake up early in the morning and go to the gym and push hard with the boys luckily , im still healthy enough and reasonably fit , but obviously age doesnt help asian involvement was important to coutts and his boss , larry ellison , the american billionaire who has a personal relationship with son and whose syndicate , oracle team usa , holds the trophy together , coutts and ellison made the controversial decision to take the 2017 americas cup outside of the united states to bermuda , a british overseas territory in the north atlantic they wanted a better commercial deal than they could find in the united states and also wanted a time zone that would still work for television coverage in major markets though bermuda could not be much farther from japan 12 , 000 kilometers , or about 7 , 500 miles , and an 11 hour time change from tokyo softbank team japan will get the chance to compete at home this week in fukuoka the world series regatta is the last before the cup next year and will be the first americas cup preliminary event contested in east asia hopefully this racing in fukuoka engages some of the japanese public in a sport which theyve been involved with in the past but not for the last 16 years , barker said the only other japanese team to challenge for the cup was nippon challenge in 1992 , 1995 and 2000 it also relied heavily on foreign talent first chris dickson and john cutler of new zealand and then australias peter gilmour , the gifted match racer who has long been one of sofukus mentors though sofuku grew up in the coastal city of niigata , he never sailed competitively until his early 20s his interest was piqued by a television program about the 1987 cup in fremantle , australia he was a truck driver at the time , but after responding to a job posting , he joined a japanese sailing team , bengal bay challenge , that eventually folded without competing in the cup we had a big ryokan that the company rented , sofuku said , referring to a japanese inn , and we were like 10 young guys living together there and training and we got like a thousand dollars 930 euros a month we went bankrupt like three times , and every time more people left by the end there were just three of us left in that same ryokan every day we washed the boat and went to the gym for training , but we couldnt really sail with just three of us he later joined nippon challenge for the 1995 and 2000 cups and was also a bowman for the american challenger oneworld in 2003 in auckland , new zealand , and a crew member for ellison and oracle in 2007 in valencia , where sofuku and his family were based until this latest , unexpected chance initially , he was to sail only in the world series races this year before giving way to younger competitors next year when the vuitton cup , which will select a challenger for oracle team usa , gets underway in earnest in may in bermuda the crew work is grueling with at least four of the six sailors on board working as grinders by operating manual winches to perform maneuvers and generate power , some of which is stored to fuel the yachts control systems but barker said sofuku has demonstrated remarkable endurance this season with at least one japanese sailor required by cup rules to be on board at all times and multiple races scheduled per day , barker said it was likely that sofuku would rotate during the cup with the two other japanese sailors on the team , yugo yoshida , 33 , and yuki kasatani , 27 fuku has really got a big ticker on him , barker said he pushes himself right to the edge and looks after himself very well but what drives fuku at this stage is not just keeping up with the next generation of japanese sailors , but inspiring the next generation of japanese sailors japan is a maritime nation , he said we have a great history with the ocean you cant talk about the culture without talking about the sea we eat fish , and lots of people go out fishing but somehow we are not really friends with the ocean its more like a hunting field so i think this is a good opportunity to change the existing culture
from a sidewalk in lower manhattan , the building at 33 thomas street , known as the long lines building , looks like nothing less than a monument to the prize of privacy with not a window in its walls from the ground up to its height of 550 feet , 33 thomas looms over church street with an architectural blank face nothing about it resembles a place of human habitation , and in fact it was built for machines an at t subsidiary commissioned the tower to house long distance phone lines completed in 1974 , it was fortified to withstand a nuclear attack on new york , and the architect made plans to include enough food , water and generator fuel to sustain 1 , 500 people for two weeks during a catastrophic loss of power to the city now , an investigative article in the intercept and an accompanying 10 minute documentary film , project x , opening on friday at the ifc center in greenwich village , say the building appears to have served another purpose as a listening post code named titanpointe by the national security agency the article and film say that titanpointe was one of the facilities used to collect communications with permission granted by judges from international entities that have at least some operations in new york , such as the united nations , the international monetary fund , the world bank and 38 countries according to the article and film , n s a employees and contractors who traveled to titanpointe were given detailed instructions about how to rent cars anonymously through the f b i , how to dress \( not surprisingly , they were not to wear badges that said n s a \) and even what to do if they got into a car accident \( dont make a fuss , make a call everything would be taken care of \) equipment in the building monitored international long distance phone calls , faxes , videoconferencing , voice calls made over the internet much of the documentation for the article and film draws on material provided by edward snowden , a former contractor for the agency who released information in 2013 about the n s a s collaboration with telecommunication companies in vast surveillance programs laura poitras , who collaborated with henrik moltke on the documentary film , was a member of a group of journalists awarded a 2014 pulitzer prize for its reporting on mr snowdens revelations the new article and film say that n s a memos from 2013 refer to titanpointe by its code name and activities that take place there but do not mention its address mr moltke said a number of details in the snowden material pointed to 33 thomas street , including references to a known code name for at t the buildings location about a block from f b i offices at 26 federal plaza and a reference to satellite intercepts for a program called skidrowe the building has satellite dishes on the roof and is the only site in new york city where at t has a federal communications commission license for such stations , according to mr moltke , who wrote the article with ryan gallagher the new york times and pro publica reported in august 2015 , that at t had had a close relationship with the n s a for decades and had been lauded by the agency for its extreme willingness to help however , neither the materials from mr snowden nor the new reports state with certainty that the n s a was using at t space or equipment as it happens , while at t inc owns the land at 33 thomas , it has only about 87 percent of the floor space the balance is owned by verizon asked about the intercept report , fletcher cook , an at t spokesman , did not directly respond but said the company provided information when legally required or in specific emergency cases we do not allow any government agency to connect directly to or otherwise control our network to obtain our customers information , he said a verizon spokesman took questions about his companys space but did not provide answers the n s a did not reply to a request for comment for all the powerful machinery available to government surveillance programs , they are subject to some court jurisdiction that is not the case for commercial surveillance every aspect of daily life is tracked by smartphone apps , social media and websites whatever spying may go on at 33 thomas street would at least still be subject to legal oversight the building really may be a monument to quaint ideas about privacy

with the election now in the rearview mirror , bloomberg has decided to terminate its daily politics show with all due respect hosted by the political journalists john heilemann and mark halperin and refocus its bloomberg politics team , according to a staff memo on thursday in the coming weeks , as washington transitions from the obama administration to the incoming trump administration , our bloomberg politics team will transition as well shifting our focus to the impact of politics and policy on the business and financial world , john micklethwait , the editor in chief of bloomberg , and justin b smith , chief executive of bloomberg media , said in the memo will all due respect , which began in october 2014 and was broadcast on bloomberg tv at 5 p m and msnbc at 6 p m , will run daily until dec 2 , after which there will be four hourlong specials setting up the presidency of donald j trump the show will end with coverage of mr trumps inauguration on jan 20 errol cockfield , a spokesman for msnbc , declined to comment on the networks plans for the 6 p m hour mr heilemann and mr halperin , the authors of the popular book game change about the 2008 election , joined bloomberg in may 2014 but their hiring caused discord between bloombergs offices in new york and washington , where journalists felt they were being overshadowed by the new politics team the show initially struggled to find an audience and was criticized in some quarters for being too frivolous with all of that in mind , the inauguration could be viewed as both a natural and convenient endpoint the duo are in discussions about staying on as contributors and columnists for bloomberg , according to the memo , though they will no longer have day to day roles bloomberg politics will shift to a more global outlook , and there are plans to start a new television show focused on global politics and the impact of the new administrations policies on business and finance worldwide , according to the memo , which was reported earlier by the huffington post the moves are part of a broader reshuffling at bloomberg , which said in a separate memo on thursday that it was revamping its magazine , bloomberg businessweek , to focus more on business and finance megan murphy , who was bloombergs washington bureau chief , was named editor of the magazine , which is expected to begin publishing in its new form in the second quarter of next year what will emerge from this will be very different from the stand alone magazine you all write for at the moment , the memo said the memo also said the editorial team at the magazine may well be smaller

a baltimore public school teacher is no longer employed after a cellphone video showed her berating minority students with abusive language that included a racial slur , the school district said on thursday the teacher , who was not named in the statement from the baltimore city public schools , was recorded on tuesday disciplining a student in her middle school science class at harlem park elementary middle school after she ejected the student from the room , she turned to the other students who remained , raised her voice and said she was going to give them all zeros for not doing their work the teacher , who is white , then called the students idiots and asked them if they wanted to get an education or to be a punk ass who is gonna get shot , using a common racial slur on thursday , the school authorities said in the statement that the teacher had engaged in verbally abusive behavior and made racially charged comments directed at students the teacher involved in the incident is no longer employed by city schools an email seeking information , including the name of the teacher and what she had told the authorities about the episode , was not answered immediately on thursday by the city schools the baltimore teachers union said in a statement that it condemns the language used by the teacher a spokesman for the union , ray baker , declined by telephone to answer further questions , including whether the teacher had a lawyer or whether she had been fired but sonja brookins santelises , the chief executive officer of the school district , said in a telephone interview on thursday afternoon that the woman was an eighth grade science teacher in her second year she said she could not provide further details because it was a personnel matter ms santelises said that although many teachers struggled with classroom management , the teacher crossed the line by using the racial epithet the recording was posted on twitter by shaun king , a reporter for the daily news , who said it had been sent to him by a reader the newspaper reported on thursday that the cellphone video was posted on facebook on wednesday by a baltimore woman named erica deminds by thursday afternoon , it had been viewed more than 1 5 million times ms deminds told the daily news that one of her sons classmates had recorded the video she said the teacher had taught her son for two or three years and that she had met with her one on one shes a very nice teacher , ms deminds was quoted as saying i cant say what happened that day i think she was at a breaking point ms deminds could not immediately be reached by telephone on thursday
in the debate over fracking of oil and gas wells , opponents often cite the risk that the process can set off nearby earthquakes but scientists say that in the united states , fracking induced earthquakes are not common in canada , however , a spate of earthquakes in alberta within the last five years has been attributed to fracking , or hydraulic fracturing , in which water , chemicals and sand are injected at high pressure into a well drilled in a shale formation to break up the rock and release oil and gas now , scientists at the university of calgary who studied those earthquakes , near fox creek in the central part of the province , say the quakes were induced in two ways by increases in pressure as the fracking occurred , and , for a time after the process was completed , by pressure changes brought on by the lingering presence of fracking fluid the key message is that the primary cause of injection induced seismicity in western canada is different from the central united states , said david w eaton , a professor of geophysics at the university of calgary and co author of a paper in the journal science describing the research the findings could help regulators take steps to avoid such induced earthquakes , he said scientists say most of the recent earthquakes in oklahoma and other parts of the united states have been caused by the burial of wastewater from all kinds of oil and gas wells rather than by the fracking process itself wastewater is injected under pressure into disposal wells drilled into a sandstone or other permeable formation , and flows into the rock that can cause pressure changes in the formation that can upset the equilibrium around a fault zone , causing an earthquake as the fault slips in the fox creek area in alberta , where oil and gas companies have been drilling in recent years into a formation called the duvernay shale , earlier research had seen links between the earthquakes all of which were minor and caused little damage and fracking , rather than wastewater injection in their work , dr eaton and xuewei bao , a postdoctoral researcher , looked into the links in more detail , analyzing seismic data from a series of quakes at fox creek in late 2014 and early 2015 , and records from wells where fracking was occurring at the time they found two patterns to the seismicity to the east in the fault zone , most of the earthquakes occurred during the fracking process itself , which lasted up to a month to the west , there were few immediate quakes they occurred intermittently over several months after the fracking ended dr eaton said the fracking process could be likened to small underground explosions , shocks that travel into the rock formation and rapidly change the stress patterns within if there is a critically stressed fault , those stress changes are sufficient to push it over the edge , he said that appears to be what happened in the eastern direction once the fracking stops , those stresses relax fairly quickly , he said but they found that to the west , much of the fracking fluid remained underground in the fractured shale that would lead to more persistent pressure within the fault zone , and more earthquakes over time dr eaton said he and others were conducting more research to understand why alberta responds differently to fracking than oklahoma and other parts of the united states its a different situation , he said , and understanding the origin of the differences is important

how can my team make the n f l playoffs \? its a simple question , but answering it can be devilishly complicated at this point in the season , when teams have six or seven games remaining , the playoff picture is delightfully foggy for a normal fan particularly one for whom sports are a blissful escape from , say , the tumultuous world of american electoral politics its surprisingly difficult to figure out and , more often than not , the television commentators dont make things any easier its always bothered us , too , so we built an interactive tool to help us understand our n f l playoff simulator now entering its third year of existence is built for one purpose to help you explore the paths to the playoffs for every team in the n f l it works like this we let you choose the outcomes of any game you select and simulate every other game remaining in the 2016 season \( in its first rendition , we considered each game a coin flip since then , weve used sagarin ratings , which reflect the fact that , even though anything can happen on a given sunday , not all teams are created equal \) what makes this tool more useful than other online calculators , like the ones at espn , yahoo or nfl com , is that we do the work for you theres no need to pick the outcomes of every game left in the season pick any outcomes or none at all and our tool will simulate the rest of the season for you , instantly identifying the most important games remaining for each team and turning you into a playoff scenarios expert consider the minnesota vikings , who started the season 5 0 but have slipped , in minnesotan fashion , to 5 4 at the moment , we give them just better than 50 50 odds of making the playoffs if they beat the cardinals in minnesota on sunday , their odds move to 64 percent if they lose , those odds drop to about 40 percent but what if the detroit lions , who share the vikings record , lose all their remaining games \? that kind of thinking is precisely what this tool was made for our simulator also lets you explore specific and unrealistic paths , like one in which the vikings finish the season with the n f c s best record , a bye week and home field advantage throughout the playoffs \( roughly a 2 in 100 shot , but go for it \) finally , weve added a feature this year , for fans of teams like the 0 10 cleveland browns , whose season is effectively over we now let you use the simulator backward to see how the browns could have their best shot at a no 1 pick in the 2017 n f l draft as the season comes to an end , figuring out who will finish last can get just as complicated as figuring out who will finish first if youre going to root against your own team , you might as well do it as intelligently as possible
american officials accuse him of being part of the inner leadership circle of al qaedas syrian affiliate , most widely known as the nusra front , and of raising as much as 5 million for the terrorist group while signing up thousands of fighters but abdallah muhammad al muhaysini insists that he could not be more surprised to learn that the united states treasury department had designated him as a terrorist and ordered his funds frozen today , syrians are shocked to find that the united states has put on the terror list a person whom they consider to be a national symbol , mr muhaysini said in a skype interview with the new york times last week its a very bizarre thing , abdallah al muhaysini is an independent figure , he added how can the american state department describe abdallah al muhaysini as belonging to fath al sham \? he said , using a version of the nusra fronts new name until now , mr muhaysini , a 31 year old saudi born cleric who said he was calling from syria , had not been the type to contact western publications that he is doing so is most likely a reflection of how the nusra front is trying to buy itself some flexibility by publicly rebranding even if no one in counterterrorism circles believes it is truly changing public relations efforts have become paramount in the contest within the jihadist world for recruits and resources , and in the effort to evade military reprisals from foreign powers in what analysts say is a calculated move to hide its ties to al qaeda , the nusra front recently rebranded itself as a local insurgency against the government of bashar al assad , declaring that it no longer intended to target the west and changing its name to jabhat fath al sham , or the levant conquest front but experts and intelligence officials say the group is still an essential part of al qaeda , committed as ever to competing with the islamic state for territory and support and leaving the fight against pro assad forces a lower priority colin p clarke , an analyst at the rand corporation , argues that the nusra front is actually the biggest of al qaedas branches , with approximately 10 , 000 fighters and he characterized the groups public split from al qaeda as simply a feint , a way for the group to hunker down and rebuild as the islamic state gets pounded by airstrikes it has been used to give themselves a little bit of breathing room , mr clarke said just as officials and analysts were not buying the nusra fronts attempt to rebrand , they will not be trusting mr muhaysinis protests that he is merely a religious scholar with no stake in the jihadist competition in syria experts on the nusra front agree with american and european officials in considering mr muhaysini to be a senior leader in the group , with deep ties to al qaedas international network and in his public communications up to now , mr muhaysini himself has left little room between his positions and al qaedas , appearing in social media posts eulogizing dead qaeda leaders and encouraging suicide bombers his biography has even appeared in the qaeda magazine al risalah in a skype interview on friday , from a room illuminated by a single fluorescent bulb , mr muhaysini seemed relaxed , often breaking into a toothy grin as he insisted that he posed no threat to the west when asked , he acknowledged having contacted ayman al zawahri , the global chief of al qaeda in 2014 , yes , i talked to ayman zawahri because he is an old and generous sheikh and i asked him to speak about daesh because he has a huge audience , he said , using a derogatory acronym for the islamic state i wanted him to talk about daesh to prevent the youth from joining he describes the images that have appeared of him with other well known qaeda leaders , and the comments he has made about them , as similar to photographs that might emerge from a summit meeting in which president obama is seen sitting next to president vladimir v putin of russia it doesnt mean that they share an ideology , he said after he was listed by the treasury department , mr muhaysini contacted the times via an intermediary to confirm his identity , the times compared his image on skype to his official portrait , as well as his voice to previous recordings issued by him he further interacted with the times using his official twitter account which , with over 60 , 000 followers , has become a reference point for jihadists in syria i am very well known i am like a sheikh , he said , saying he was skyping from a location in aleppo province a detail that could not be confirmed people around me told me to hide my location but i cant hide anything because im known to everyone i couldnt be working secretly for anyone thomas joscelyn is an analyst who has been tracking mr muhaysini since 2013 and has documented his close ties to al qaeda among the signs that mr joscelyn says point to mr muhaysinis allegiance to al qaeda is the fact that he tried to play a mediating role after the islamic state began clashing with al qaeda in syria after al qaedas leadership disowned the islamic state in 2014 , mr muhaysini took to his popular twitter feed to tell islamic state members to defect to the qaeda group , referring to al qaedas leader as the sheikh of the mujahedeen mr muhaysinis description of himself as an independent observer is part of al qaedas strategy of not broadcasting its allegiance , and of using local groups as a fig leaf to obscure its real goals , mr joscelyn said we consider this be to be a play out of al qaedas playbook , he said they want to have ambiguity about their organizational affiliations , because it makes it more difficult for them to achieve their goals if they are known as al qaeda so we dont take these denials at face value

heres how president elect trump could unify a bitterly divided america , provide well paying jobs to many of the millions of disaffected workers who voted for him , and lift the economy , stock market and tax rolls all he needs to do is what he presumably does best build something and i dont mean a few miles of asphalt or a paint job on a rusting bridge build something awe inspiring something americans can be proud of something that will repay the investment many times over for generations to come build the modern day equivalent of the golden gate bridge , the hoover dam , the lincoln tunnel or the timberline lodge or even , given mr trumps passion for the sport , another bethpage state park black course the first public golf course to host the prestigious united states open all of these are depression era public works projects that are still in use can anyone name even one infrastructure project from president obamas 800 billion american recovery and reinvestment act \? i didnt think so in fairness to mr obama , republicans in congress bitterly opposed his public works spending plans , and he lamented there were too few shovel ready projects that didnt stop franklin delano roosevelt his public works administration and works progress administration , using combinations of public and private money , solicited proposals from states and cities , hired millions of workers and eventually built 78 , 000 bridges , 650 , 000 miles of roads , 700 miles of airport runways , 13 , 000 playgrounds and 125 , 000 military and civilian buildings , including more than 40 , 000 schools in most cases to high standards of quality and design the federal government built the la guardia , ronald reagan washington national and los angeles international airports , the upper mississippi locks and dams , the bonneville power project on the columbia river , the robert f kennedy bridge in new york , and the florida keys overseas highway most are still in use today to a large degree , this is the infrastructure that made america great , to borrow mr trumps catchphrase what roosevelt accomplished is astounding , said scott myers lipton , a sociology professor at san jose state university and author of the books rebuild america solving the economic crisis through civic works and ending extreme inequality but its not so much the numbers people remember today most people just know there was an alphabet soup of organizations , he said what they see and remember are the landmarks the bay bridge , reagan national airport or the baseball stadium in san jose were living on that legacy today repealing obamacare , lowering taxes for businesses and mostly wealthy people , overhauling the immigration system and privatizing medicare what congressional republicans have cited as their top legislative priorities would be divisive in a nation bitterly split along partisan and geographic lines but nearly everyone agrees that america has grossly neglected its infrastructure even as the rest of the world , notably china , has raced ahead our airports are like from a third world country , mr trump said at hofstra university during the first presidential debate you land at la guardia , you land at kennedy , you land at lax , you land at newark , and you come in from dubai and qatar and you see these incredible you come in from china , you see these incredible airports , and you land weve become a third world country who could disagree \? hillary clinton also called for a big increase in infrastructure spending the single best thing the federal government can do to promote economic growth is to repair and build the transportation network , the highways , railroads and airports , said roger noll , an emeritus professor of economics at stanford and a senior fellow at the stanford institute for economic policy research its been neglected for 30 years last year , dan mcnichol , author of the book the roads that built america , a history of the interstate highway system , and a white house adviser on transportation issues for president george h w bush , navigated the country in a 1949 hudson commodore on a mission to investigate the state of americas infrastructure i was trying to see if this was really a crisis or a media sensation , he told me this week from california , where hes working on the states high speed rail project i found out its pretty dire in terms of total infrastructure for a nation that leads the world in global trade , our systems are failing mr trump has pledged 1 trillion over 10 years , but no one i spoke to thought that was enough doubling that would be more realistic , mr mcnichol said and mr trumps campaign proposal was limited to infrastructure projects that could pay for themselves out of user fees , which seems like a shortsighted approach most economists say the best way to finance a big public works program , particularly given todays low interest rates , would be for the government to borrow most of the money from investors pulling off something on the scale of the depression era public works programs would be no small feat recent federal infrastructure efforts , including reconstruction after hurricanes katrina and sandy , as well as the obama stimulus program , hardly inspire confidence alan brinkley , a professor of history at columbia , said he doubted mr trump could replicate roosevelts achievements roosevelt had a coherent mission , if not always a consistent way to address the depression and the economic crisis , mr brinkley said he was eclectic in his approach because he was pragmatic even more important , roosevelt was informed , surrounded himself with informed people , and was prepared on day 1 to begin im not sure that trumps policies go beyond his electioneering slogans , mr brinkley said im afraid a new p w a , he added , referring to the public works administration , will stand for promises without actions but in the spirit of magnanimity , lets give mr trump the benefit of the doubt , as mr obama has suggested hell need his own versions of harold l ickes , roosevelts interior secretary , who ran the p w a , and his close adviser harry l hopkins , who ran the w p a mr trump will also need to be hands on roosevelt asked states and cities for proposals , but he made nearly all the final decisions himself f d r was a fanatic about infrastructure , roads , planning , mr mcnichol said as a commissioner in new york , he helped lay out the taconic parkway he even helped design the picnic tables so where should president trump start \? for a sense of what might be possible , i asked mr mcnichol to pretend he had just been tapped as mr trumps new infrastructure czar and to come up with a list of his top 10 infrastructure projects , balanced between red and blue states most are shovel ready , or close to it heres what he suggested , along with estimated costs the northeast corridor desperately needs another rail link connecting manhattan and northern new jersey the current overcrowded tunnel is over 100 years old and was severely damaged by hurricane sandy americas first modern high speed rail project would connect san francisco and los angeles , about 400 miles apart , in under three hours a rebounding detroit needs another link to canada the privately owned ambassador bridge , which connects detroit and windsor , ontario , serves over three million vehicles a year and is one of the busiest border crossings in north america seven new sewage and water tunnels would rescue clevelands antiquated lines , which are overwhelmed by even moderate rainfall and feed contaminated water into lake erie picture pristine beaches and fishing , swimming and kayaking along a rejuvenated north coast traveling at 300 miles per hour on a cushion of air , magnetically levitated trains could cut the commute from new york to washington to an hour and render the painfully slow acela obsolete miami is one of the cities most vulnerable to rising sea levels and ocean surges if the atlantic ocean rises just five feet , 96 percent of miami beach will be submerged a system of levees , sea walls and storm surge protectors like the maeslantkering in rotterdam , the netherlands giant sea doors that open and close automatically to protect the harbor could be both attractive and effective miami could be a prototype for other endangered american coastal cities and ports , including boston charleston , s c galveston , tex savannah , ga and new orleans denver is trying to put a section of interstate 70 underground to reconnect the citys urban fabric and use four acres of the reclaimed space for parks , bike paths and walks , and farmers markets the green space could be much larger , further reducing pollution the washington metro area suffers from some of the worst traffic congestion in the country maryland wants to build more than 16 miles of light rail to link its suburbs to washingtons existing metro system \( which needs extensive repairs \) and amtrak supporters say it would remove 17 , 000 cars each day from area roads after a single heavy rain in 2015 breached more than 50 dams and caused widespread flooding , the army corps of engineers assessed over 600 dams in south carolina as either high or significant hazards a single large project could modernize the states system of dams and water control even without a federal program , texans are actively looking for private investors for a high speed rail link between dallas fort worth and houston passengers would make the 240 mile , one stop trip in 90 minutes if successful , the line could be extended to san antonio and austin , covering the so called texaplex , which includes 75 percent of the states population and is home to 52 fortune 500 companies the right public works projects , said mr myers lipton of san jose state , would address the public anger that elected trump , which is that the regular folks arent being taken care of during the depression , the government built beautiful hotels and golf courses and parks the vision was , whats usually for the elite should be for everybody thats the power of public works
san francisco an automated army of pro donald j trump chatbots overwhelmed similar programs supporting hillary clinton five to one in the days leading up to the presidential election , according to a report published thursday by researchers at oxford university the chatbots basic software programs with a bit of artificial intelligence and rudimentary communication skills would send messages on twitter based on a topic , usually defined on the social network by a word preceded by a hashtag symbol , like clinton their purpose to rant , confuse people on facts , or simply muddy discussions , said philip n howard , a sociologist at the oxford internet institute and one of the authors of the report if you were looking for a real debate of the issues , you werent going to find it with a chatbot theyre yelling fools , dr howard said and a lot of what they pass around is false news the role fake news played in the presidential election has become a sore point for the technology industry , particularly google , twitter and facebook on monday , google said it would ban websites that peddle fake news from using its online advertising service facebook also updated the language in its facebook audience network policy , which already says it will not display ads in sites that show misleading or illegal content , to include fake news sites in some cases , the bots would post embarrassing photos , make references to the federal bureau of investigation inquiry into mrs clintons private email server , or produce false statements , for instance , that mrs clinton was about to go to jail or was already in jail the use of automated accounts was deliberate and strategic throughout the election , the researchers wrote in the report , published by the project on algorithms , computational propaganda and digital politics at oxford because the chatbots were almost entirely anonymous and were frequently bought in secret from companies or individual programmers , it was not possible to directly link the activity to either campaign , except for a handful of joke bots created by mrs clintons campaign , they noted however , there was evidence that the mystery chatbots were part of an organized effort there does seem to be strategy behind the bots , dr howard said by the third debate , trump bots were launching into their activity early and we noticed that automated accounts were actually colonizing clinton hashtags a hashtag is used to indicate a twitter posts topic by adopting hashtags relating to mrs clinton , the opposition bots were most likely able to wiggle their way into an online conversation among clinton supporters after the election , the bot traffic declined rapidly , with the exception of some pro trump programs that gloated , we won and you lost , dr howard said trump campaign officials did not respond to requests for comment twitter executives argued that more people would not follow the programs and so they would be picked up only by those who looked for particular hashtags anyone who claims that automated spam accounts that tweeted about the u s election had an effect on voters opinions or influenced the national twitter conversation clearly underestimates voters and fails to understand how twitter works , said nick pacilio , a twitter spokesman the researchers based their study on a collection of about 19 4 million twitter posts gathered in the first nine days of november they selected tweets based on hashtags identifying certain subjects and identified automated posting by finding accounts that post at least 50 times a day for example , the top 20 accounts , which were mostly bots and highly automated accounts , averaged over 1 , 300 tweets a day and they generated more than 234 , 000 tweets , the researchers noted the top 100 accounts , which still used high levels of automation , generated around 450 , 000 tweets at an average rate of 500 tweets per day the oxford researchers had previously reported that political chatbots had played a role in shaping the political landscape that led to britains brexit vote the researchers have coined the term computational propaganda to describe the explosion of deceptive social media campaigns on services like facebook and twitter in a previous research paper , dr howard and bence kollanyi , a researcher at corvinus university of budapest , described how political chatbots had a small but strategic role in shaping the online conversation during the run up to the brexit referendum the bot managers seem to repurpose the programs as well during the british campaign , they discovered that a family of bots that had been tweeting around israeli palestinian issues for three or four years had suddenly become pro brexit after the vote , the bots returned to their original issue in the case of the american election , the researchers noted that highly automated accounts the accounts that tweeted 450 or more times with a related hashtag and user mention during the data collection period generated close to 18 percent of all twitter traffic about the presidential election they also noted that bots tend to circulate negative news much more effectively than positive reports one of the consequences of the intense social media campaigns will be a rise in what social scientists call selective affinity clinton supporters will cut the trump supporters out of their network , and trump supporters will do the same , dr howard said the polarization of the election is going to make this stuff worse as we self groom our news networks
i was 19 and had fallen in love he was a grad student who lived in a long , narrow apartment with a room devoted solely to books i didnt live there with him , but my toothbrush did i lived in a dorm a 10 minute drive away , but he and i hardly spent a night apart when id finished my work for the day , hed pick me up at the back gate of my dorm i always ran to his car , because it was cold and because walking would not get me to him fast enough this was first love , the real thing , the full symphony but i thought his love was predicated on my ability to keep a secret from him ill tell you that secret , because im not afraid you wont love me for a year and a half , i had been struggling with a bout of anorexia that had knocked 20 pounds off my already slim frame i had to be weighed multiple times a week at the medical center at yale , where i went to school , and i saw a therapist almost as often the causes for my eating disorder ran along the usual lines depression , an inability to express my rage , a desire to exert control , a desire to feel less , a desire to have my body express the things my voice could not that , and i had gotten in the habit of believing it was better to take up less space when i met the boy i fell in love with , i was a year into this disease and subsisting on less than 500 calories a day love didnt make me better , but it made me happier and it gave me the incentive to appear well , even if i was not my boyfriend would make a full pot of persian style rice and put half of it on my plate hed buy me a giant bowl of oatmeal , loaded with peaches and granola and nuts i ate everything he gave me this was when i was still chugging liters of water before my appointments , to bring up my weight but in his presence , i ate , because i thought if he knew there was something wrong with me , he wouldnt want me and i ate because the food came from him , which pardoned it in my disordered mind anything he touched was good , including me i gained a little weight this way , pretending to be o k at the end of the school year , my nurse told me i wouldnt have to be weighed over the summer i trust you , she said this made me anxious what if i failed \? my summer internship took me back to los angeles , to my parents house my boyfriend stayed in new haven to do research i cried so much when he dropped me off at the hartford airport , my face was still puffy when i landed at lax my parents were leaving for the summer , so id be living in the house by myself our old craftsman house , which even family skeptics agreed was haunted and the spirits had always seemed most active around me are you sure youll be all right \? my mother asked at 19 , i had never lived alone i still occasionally slept with my teddy bear i was still afraid of the dark but i had an investment in being brave i wanted not only to seem well but also to seem like an adult yes , ill be fine the noises began at night footsteps on the stairs running water voices and laughter from the other room it had been bad before , but never like this i started waking up in the middle of the night with all the lights turned on one morning , i came downstairs , and the chairs had been pulled out from the dining room table i took to sleeping in my parents room , with the television on full blast if i was brave enough to get through the night , i thought , surely i could take care of myself in other ways but i had a practical problem i had no idea how to feed myself in sickness , i had constructed a mode of eating that relied heavily on props filling a plate and eating only the vegetables , for instance with my boyfriend , i was eating real meals but again , under his gaze now , no one was watching no one was weighing me i was the only arbiter of my body what does a person eat when her only goal is satiation \? who was i , when i was alone \? finally , i hit on a system mornings were yogurt and granola lunches were whatever they ordered at work and on sundays , i would buy frozen tamales , fresh zucchini and tofu carbohydrate , vegetable , protein every night , i would roast the tofu and zucchini in the oven while i steamed a tamale then i would put on a movie , to fill the darkness of the empty house , and eat it wasnt wellness exactly , but night after night , i filled my plate and ate everything on it when i saw my boyfriend again at the end of the summer , i thought i could see surprise in his eyes , at the changed shape of my body it made me defensive full feeling had returned to me , and with sentience came sharpness , rage one warm night , walking home together , he asked if i had ever had an eating disorder i pulled away , stung , and pretended i didnt know what he was talking about but later , in bed , with a strange silence between us , i asked him to cover his face with his pillow i didnt want to watch the love drain from him when i told him the truth it all came out , more than i thought i had to say when i finished , he pulled the pillow away and met my eyes i saw love there before he said anything dragging the terrible thing into the light can strip it of its potency i didnt get better all at once it took years for me to stop counting calories , stop needing a system to get through a meal years to get my brain back but i set a change in motion that night , by telling that one person many years later , on the cusp of my 30s , i read stephen kings carrie in his introduction , he explains that the germ of the idea came from reading about paranormal activity , how it often clusters around teenage girls he theorizes such activity might be a skewed manifestation of the girls own power their nascent sexuality and maturity bursting through the cracks of their girlhood , i thought
istanbul a prominent columnist wrote recently about how president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey hates cigarettes so much that he confiscates packs from his followers , lecturing them on the evils of smoking the columnist , kadri gursel , then urged his readers to protest the presidents anti democratic ways by lighting a cigarette and not putting it out for that , mr gursel was arrested on terrorism charges and is being held in pretrial detention , one of 120 journalists who have been jailed in turkeys crackdown on the news media since a failed coup attempt in july there , he has the company of 10 colleagues from his newspaper , cumhuriyet , the countrys last major independent publication among them are its editor and the papers chief executive , arrested as he stepped off a flight to istanbul last friday turkey now has handily outstripped china as the worlds biggest jailer of journalists , according to figures compiled by the committee to protect journalists the jailings are the most obvious example of an effort to muzzle not just the free press , but free speech generally more than 3 , 000 turks have faced charges of insulting the president , including a former miss turkey , merve buyuksarac , who posted on instagram a satirical rewording of the countrys national anthem as if mr erdogan were singing she was sentenced to 14 months in prison , suspended on the condition that she not repeat any offensive remarks the government and its supporters are behind a wave of demands to twitter to remove offending posts , more than all other countries in the world put together , according to twitters transparency report \( of 20 , 000 twitter accounts affected worldwide this year , 15 , 000 were turkish \) several journalists including mr gursel , whose column was published three days before the coup attempt have been retroactively accused of subliminal messaging in support of the july uprising even more risky now is anything viewed as support for the outlawed kurdish nationalist party , the pkk some have been attacked for calling members of the group militants , rather than terrorists others are in jail for advocating a resumption of the collapsed peace process with the kurdish guerrillas although few here dare use the word guerrilla failing to mention how many people were killed in the attempted coup , in any article about it , is also considered proof of terrorist sympathies others have been convicted of terrorism charges for reporting on a 2015 scandal in which mr erdogans government was accused of supplying weapons to the islamic state , which it is now fighting in syria one of those is cumhuriyets former editor in chief , can dundar , who was free on appeal when he announced in august that he was not returning from a trip to germany , saying he could not expect a fair trial in the wake of the coup attempt in addition to the jailings here , some 150 news outlets have been shuttered , ranging from tv stations to online enterprises , according to erol onderoglu , the turkish representative for reporters without borders but probably the most corrosive long term effect of the crackdown has been a highly effective government push for businessmen who are loyal to it to take over ownership of many of the remaining outlets , turning them into avid cheerleaders for mr erdogan and his policies whats left , they are all basically pravda , said gulsin harman , who left her job as a foreign editor at milliyet , a once independent newspaper that is now owned by an erdogan crony there is no more critical journalism , 90 percent of the free press is destroyed directly or indirectly , mr onderoglu said investigative journalism is considered treason journalism has been stolen by the government asked for comment , a senior government official , who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with official policy , maintained that the journalists in jail in turkey were there for criminal and terrorist offenses , not for their journalism he also said there remained many publications in turkey that were critical of the government there have been press crackdowns in turkey before , especially during periods of military rule , and even mr erdogan and his government have used press laws and intimidation against journalists on a large scale since 2012 but the sweeping emergency powers granted to mr erdogan after the failed military coup against him , by supporters of the exiled muslim cleric fethullah gulen , have greatly accelerated the crackdown never has there been such a dark period as this , said ayse yildirim , a cumhuriyet columnist , who found out by accident that criminal charges had been lodged against her for reporting on a kurdish baby killed by a police bullet at a protest in addition to mr dundar and the 11 cumhuriyet staff members in jail , the papers employees are fending off an estimated 100 other criminal cases against them on a variety of charges , such as offending turkishness , the president or local officials terrorism and membership in the pkk now even publishing a not nice picture of erdogan would be trouble , said one prominent journalist , who spoke only on condition of anonymity because she feared she would be arrested , as many of her colleagues have been now we even have ministers calling us and saying , why did you run that picture of me \? i dont like the way it looks , she said some of the most virulent attacks on independent minded journalists have come from journalists in the pro erdogan press who are known by their colleagues as hit men first they attack the target by name , then personally lobby with intimidated media owners or the government to have the person fired or jailed the most notorious and effective of such hit men is a television commentator and social media activist named cem kucuk , a nationalist who many journalists say is really a government operative when a new york times journalist telephoned to arrange an interview with him , his colleagues said he could more easily be reached at the presidents office mr kucuk laughed about that comment , saying , no , no , im very close to erdogan he denied he was a presidential employee , but made no apologies for advocating the jailing of journalists he views as traitors and supporters of terrorists i dont care what they call me , he said in all of turkey , people like me as for the spectacle of so many turkish journalists behind bars , he said , they deserve it he said that western countries had also jailed journalists , citing examples like the former new york times reporter judith miller , jailed for refusing to reveal a source , and employees of the british tabloid news of the world , jailed for telephone hacking and the bribery of police officers recently , a wiretap of a phone call between mr erdogan and erdogan demiroren , the owner of the milliyet newspaper , was posted on youtube in it , mr demiroren is heard apologizing for the papers publication of leaked minutes of a secret meeting between kurdish leaders who were discussing peace negotiations that have since been abandoned mr demiroren says to the president , did i upset you , boss \? as mr erdogan berates him , the papers owner begins weeping as he apologizes and promises to find out who leaked the documents to his paper mr erdogan denounces this disgraceful , dishonest , vile man who puts a headline and wants to sabotage this process no one has challenged the tapes authenticity there have been efforts at solidarity among some journalists when the kurdish daily ozgur gundem was under attack , prominent journalists from many other publications took turns guest editing it , one each day a hundred did so , and 50 of them were hit with criminal charges , accused of various terrorism offenses for what the paper published the next day mr kucuk said it would not be necessary for turkeys remaining big newspapers to be shut down , as so many other outlets have been , because they had been brought to heel the foundation that owns cumhuriyet , he predicted , would soon be taken over by a group of hard liners more friendly to the president i can foresee things , he said in the last three years , i am the only journalist whose writings became the truth the other surviving major daily papers are widely seen as beginning to pull their punches under immense pressure , including milliyet and also hurriyet , the countrys most distinguished daily the government hit that newspaper with a huge tax fine in 2009 , and hurriyet has paid hundreds of millions of dollars toward it since then in an email , hurriyets editor in chief , sedat ergin , insisted that the paper has maintained its editorial integrity hurriyet will continue to honor its commitment to independent journalism despite all the hardships this might entail , he said mr kucuk , meanwhile , is reveling in the influence that he suggests his closeness to the president offers him in the media

monterrey , mexico like many football crazed boys , luis carranza grew up with a poster of emmitt smith , his hero , on his bedroom wall and vowed to emulate him he took a one hour bus ride to football practice , starting at age 4 , and the discipline of study , running , study , running earned him a spot first on an elite high school team and then on what may as well be mexicos crimson tide the rams of tec de monterrey he is now a star running back , and pint size fans cried out his name and engulfed him for autographs after a recent victory , even though an injury had knocked him out of the game early a star is a star its such a big tradition here , carranza said everybody is committed , even the little fans there is no tailgating here , but the stadium tacos arent bad nobody cries gooooool ! at a big score , but the touch in touchdown ! gets more gusto instead of billion dollar television deals , the games are limited to local tv and streamed on an internet site and whatever signing bonus these players have in their future will probably come not from the n f l but from the law firms and businesses many are headed to after graduation the addiction to the other ftbol ftbol soccer , as people make the distinction here is better known in this country but the fever for american football ftbol americano feeds a vibrant subculture rooted in college teams that attract thousands of fans and players for the tigres \( tigers \) , the potros \( colts \) , the aztecas \( aztecs \) , the pumas , the guilas \( eagles \) and one of the oldest and most winning teams , the borregos salvajes \( rams \) the big difference with the americans is size and speed , in which they have an advantage over us , carranza , 23 , said , explaining the appeal but here we play with heart on monday , the n f l , picking up on the american football passion here , will play its first regular season game in mexico in 11 years , the houston texans versus the oakland raiders at the famed azteca stadium in mexico city the game , the first monday night football contest to be played outside the united states , is sold out , with 76 , 000 expected to attend american football does not have the global reach of basketball and baseball , but it is played in dozens of countries in an international tournament of college teams , mexico has won back to back championships , this year defeating a team from the united states made up of division iii players mexico has also done well in postcollegiate international tournaments this surprises nobody in monterrey , where the borregos salvajes have long exemplified the best football in the country it was only a scrimmage , but the teams 2009 defeat of blinn college in texas , which featured cam newton at quarterback , is still recalled here with the fervor of the catch and other great n f l plays we didnt know anything about the team , but we heard all this talk about this great division i quarterback playing for them , said sergio cantu muoz , a tec coach and former player who intercepted newton , then playing for blinn between stops at the university of florida and auburn pulling up the video of the play he keeps on his cellphone , he added , i didnt realize until later how important it was a handful of its players over the years have landed on practice squads in the n f l , but mexico has had only fledgling professional leagues , including one that started in february but has only four teams most players here know that college is the pinnacle of the sport and then they graduate and move on to careers the league gives players seven years of eligibility as long as they remain enrolled in classes , meaning some are earning masters degrees carranza is studying to be a lawyer , as are several of his teammates , while other players are working toward jobs in finance , engineering and other professions the team claims a 90 percent graduation rate it makes tec de monterrey , one of the highest ranking universities academically in latin america , something more of a stanford , then but with more championships than any other college , it can brag of the winning tradition of an alabama i would say they are like a midway division ii team or a strong division iii , said frank gonzalez , a former longtime coach who unsuccessfully sought to have the university join the n c a a there have been many players good enough to play in the n f l , but there are many more players good enough in the united states there is no pipeline here to send them to the league the players say they are in it more for the game than for the fame unlike soccer , with a powerful professional league and a system of clubs and academies to recruit and mold young players , american football has a pipeline that is more ad hoc many have followed a similar progression , the sons of players who joined one of the hundreds of youth football clubs in the country and then landed on high school and college teams , most often with the help of scholarships tec de monterrey has had a football team for nearly 70 years , an outgrowth of the sport carried to mexico by american visitors years before television , and more recently the internet , have helped stoke interest in the game n f l and college games have regularly aired for years , and cable and satellite television has expanded the offerings with tec and the proximity to the border about a three hour drive to texas monterrey has been a football hotbed on a recent night , hundreds of children clad in helmets and pads raced up and down a field under stadium lights , aspiring to join tec or one of its rival teams some of the rams coach the younger players concerns about concussions and their serious consequences into adulthood have been raised by parents here , though the issue has not been as extensively covered as in the united states hugo barberi , the coach of one of the largest teams here , said that membership dropped off about 15 percent after the 2015 movie concussion , about a forensic pathologists fight against the n f l to recognize brain disease in players linked to their years of playing , but that it had rebounded in recent months the club reduced contact at practices and changed tackling techniques to de emphasize head to head collisions likewise , at the college level , neurological testing has been introduced before and during the season , and coaches said efforts had been made to curtail dangerous hits the thinking here is that while the level of awareness of the health consequences might not be the same as in the united states , neither is the intensity of the game the game is not as physical here , said alberto garca castillo , the owner and editor of receptor com mx , an online publication in mexico that covers american football there are hits , but it is done without losing valor and respect for the other side still , teams want to win , and the dominance of tec and its sister campuses , fed in part by robust scholarship offers , resulted in the college leagues being divided several years ago tec campuses they all wear blue and white uniforms and have the same borregos nickname joined with a handful of other private universities , while the public universities have their own league they are fierce rivals and , garca castillo said , have accused one another of unfair recruiting practices this year , there were some interleague games some of them drawing thousands of fans and the champions of the two conferences will meet in a super bowl for the first time since the split for the rams in monterrey , the pressure is on to win it they entered the playoffs saturday with a 6 4 record , while they have previously been undefeated or had only one or two losses they won their playoff game , though , and advanced to the final next saturday nevertheless , it has been a trying season carlos altamirano is the third coach this season , after one was fired for manhandling a player in practice , and an interim coach did not get the top job eso ! eso ! thats it ! he barked , pushing the quarterbacks through a set of scrambling drills as highway to hell and other rock and hip hop hits blared from speakers instruction and cursing in spanish mixed with the usual english football terms touchdown , quarterback , lineman plays are written and called in english , as well , partly because many are adapted from the teams american counterparts and several of the coaches have attended training clinics in the united states for a time , coaches wanted the players to play in english so they would be familiar with the terms if they earned a tryout with an american team that largely remains a dream carlos martell , 23 , a linebacker who is carranzas classmate in legal studies , grew up surrounded by football memorabilia , and his father invites friends and family members over every sunday to watch n f l games martell has been playing the game since he was 4 , but he knows he is not big or fast enough to play at the n f l level here , the main thing is school , your studies , he said we may have dreams about playing in the n f l , but we also know so few have made it before the last regular season game , the rams players gathered for a vulgarity laced pep rally among themselves in the stands of the football stadium , which was set to host its final game after 66 years , it will be demolished and a new football stadium built the players hung a banner reading always home and signed it leave everything on the field , said one what happens tomorrow , keep it in your heart , man , urged another lets rip this mother up , boys ! said another and so they did , demolishing their opponent , the rams of tecs mexico city campus , 28 0 in the fourth quarter , when the stadium loudspeaker played jump around , that is what the monterrey players did on the sideline only a few hundred people attended the game tec usually wins , after all , and many players and coaches believe the leagues should reunite so that the best teams across the country face each other more regularly the level of competition needs to improve , said eduardo marcos califa , 23 , who scored one of the touchdowns if that happens , the interest will grow more carranza ended up on the sideline for much of the game , and not for the first time he had torn a ligament in his knee a couple of years ago but managed to bounce back the ups and downs , this is what american football teaches you , he said dont give up overcome challenges our classes give you constant challenges , and you have to find solutions you have to try something different thats the same on the field thats been my life on the field
cairo the student leader spoke in english to the chanting crowd at the elite american university of cairo the leader , amr el alfy , 20 , told his peers that he was frustrated over the university administrations lack of clarity about whether tuition would rise as much as 40 percent in response to egypts flailing economy and floating currency mr el alfy said that he was so frustrated that he thought about blocking the campus gate with his car , a volkswagen golf this should be an economic sanctuary , he declared for days , hundreds of students have been marching through the palm dotted campus , demanding a cap on their tuition the demonstrations are the largest and longest running at the institution in years , reflecting how egypts economic woes have touched nearly everybody in this stratified society of 91 million people while the poor have scrambled to find food staples and to absorb price increases of even a penny , middle class and wealthy egyptians are car pooling more and shopping less , putting their savings into stable assets like real estate , bank bonds and gold , and even waiting to have children when the economic crisis hits the elite , it means the suffering is all over the place , said malak rostom , the vice president of the student union if we cant afford it , we can tell how much other people are suffering some egyptians may sneer at the problems of the children of middle and upper class families , worried about tuition increases that dwarf the salaries of the countrys vast legions of impoverished but generations of graduates of the american university have helped lead egypts government , business and nonprofit sectors , so any problem on the campus can spiral outward with magnified effect youll say , those are the proletariat \? one prominent television host , amr adeeb , said in a recent broadcast , as if expecting a collective eye roll among his audience fine , but dont you want to have some educated people in this society \? the american university protests began a week ago , after the university administration staged a forum to discuss the repercussions of the central banks decision to decrease the value of the egyptian pound against the dollar , in an effort to thwart black market currency traders and shore up the economy the pound is now trading at about 15 per dollar , up from 8 8 on nov 3 , when the pound was floated the banks decision was part of a government effort to win a 12 billion loan from the international monetary fund , which came through last friday but for students whose tuition is tied to the united states dollar , the currency flotation threatened to translate to an instant increase in fees , to about 187 , 000 egyptian pounds a year for the cheapest degree , from about 133 , 000 pounds the american universitys 6 , 559 students are the apex of an elite group of 111 , 600 students enrolled at private universities , where the curriculum is often taught in english and fees reach thousands of dollars each semester the vast majority of the countrys 1 8 million university students attend overcrowded , ramshackle public institutions , often looking at the elite campuses with envy and disdain though the american universitys fees have long been out of reach for most egyptians , two thirds of its students receive scholarships based on financial need , according to the administration , and some families sell off assets to pay for the education salam hefzi , who is 20 and studying marketing , said that her mother , a widow , sold two apartments that salam was meant to inherit to cover her tuition the money is good for another two years , if the tuition stays the same , ms hefzi said my tuition might reach a quarter of a million pounds im dead scared the effects of the foundering economy on the middle class may pale compared with the suffering of poor people now unable to afford basic foodstuffs , but that does not mean they are not felt at a cairo mall that was all but abandoned one recent afternoon , clothing prices at h m were going up so fast that the tags were obsolete and a cashier was informing customers of the new prices instead outside another nearly empty mall , one shopper , roaya iskander , 22 , said that she and her husband were putting off having children because of the unstable economy many workers said they had been car pooling since gas prices rose to the equivalent of 21 cents a liter this month , up from 16 cents many others have lost jobs because their employers can no longer afford to import raw materials , or because sales have contracted amr alaa , 28 , and his pregnant wife , ala mashour , 27 , worked at abbvie , an american pharmaceutical research and development company they said they were out for sushi one night last month when they saw emails on their smartphones announcing a meeting the next day to discuss their future instead , they said , they turned up at the office to find themselves and 20 colleagues locked out fired we are just sitting at home depressed now , mr alaa said just looking for jobs online other well off egyptians have tried to stave off losing their savings by purchasing apartments , bonds and gold bars sales of gold are up 30 to 40 percent this year , according to ehab wassef , who represents gold sellers in the union of chambers of commerce but many more , it seems , woke up the day after the currency was floated and found their savings had been halved you live at a certain level , and its hard to go down , said sana saleh , 45 , a widow who had cut back on food and dialed down her electricity use , trying to keep her daughter in a private school whose tuition is 1 , 700 egyptian pounds \( 113 \) a month timothy kaldas , a nonresident fellow at the tahrir institute for middle east policy , said that wealthy egyptians spent a significant amount on education , and that most private schools based tuition on the value of the dollar , because they had many foreigners as faculty members american universitys tuition which already went up 6 percent for this academic year is particularly vulnerable to currency fluctuations one half of the tuition is set in egyptian pounds , the other half in united states dollars , but students generally pay the total in pounds , according to the official rate set at the central bank on the day they are paying after the student protests began , the university administration agreed to keep this semesters fees based on the 8 8 pound per dollar rate , regardless of when they are paid now students are worried about next semester there will not be a quick fix or an instant solution , the university president , francis j ricciardone , said in a statement we are looking at ways now to ensure that no student is forced to leave a u c due to inability to pay tuition its too late for mohamed , a 20 year old mechanical engineering student , who spoke on the condition that his family name not be used because he was ashamed of his situation mohamed said that he relied on a scholarship to cover 30 percent of his tuition , which he expected to jump to 230 , 000 egyptian pounds a year from about 170 , 000 his father , the principal of an upscale private school , would not be able to afford it now i am looking for another university , mohamed said my dreams have been thrown away

every day on her way to the practice floor at pauley pavilion , u c l a s womens basketball coach , cori close , makes a point of walking past the 10 banners for the national championships the bruins mens team won under john wooden close , born in 1971 , is too young to remember watching woodens teams but after a stellar playing career at the university of california , santa barbara , she received the chance to meet and then get to know wooden through her first job out of college , as an assistant for u c l a s womens team steve lavin , who coached the bruins men at the time , introduced them close and wooden bonded over closes first name , which she shared with woodens great granddaughter but that initial encounter spawned regular meetings , usually on tuesday nights , for years , with close returning to woodens house every chance she got wooden died in 2010 , a year before close returned to westwood as head coach , but the lessons she took from those conversations continue to serve her today i dont know why he let me continue that relationship with him , close said the reality is , hes a much closer person to me than i am to him and im just really humbled and thankful not only just the stuff he talked to me about , but that i got to watch him live over a long period of time , for 15 years , really i dont know exactly how it started , but im grateful that it did in important ways , she said , her teams are building on woodens legacy while some critics of the womens game take pains to point out its differences with mens basketball , the similarities between the mens game of woodens time and the womens game of today are striking much more so than the mens games of then and now , particularly in the aspects of coaching most important to wooden thats one of the reasons i love coaching womens basketball , close said i dont have any one and doners its not just about helping them develop on the court one of the things coach wooden talked about was being a part of young mens lives nothing short of creating a transformational experience that helps them reach elite levels in basketball but also prepares them for life , equips them for something bigger and deeper i do think the parallels are strong with womens basketball going back to coach woodens time its still about growing young women its still about seeing their growth over four years , and thats really a joy to be a part of there is a logic to the idea that womens college basketball has , in many ways , reached the rough equivalent of what the wooden era was for the mens game consider that the n c a a tournament began in 1939 for the men , and wooden won his 10th title in 1975 , 36 years later the obvious analogue to wooden in the womens game is connecticuts geno auriemma , who won his 11th title in 2016 , 34 years after the n c a a created the womens tournament auriemma , whose third ranked huskies meet no 2 baylor on thursday night in one of the seasons most eagerly awaited games , has long argued that the relative lack of parity at the very top of the womens college game is a consequence of a simple difference between the mens and womens versions many of the top male players leave after a single season , while women are not even eligible to declare for the w n b a unless they turn 22 during the calendar year of a draft maybe this year , well look up and see four completely different teams that have never been in the final four , auriemma said what are the chances of that \? slim and the reason for that is that everybody stays four years if we played with one and done , thered be a lot of different teams every year in the final four as long as we get to keep our players for four years , were going to have a lot of the same teams close is set to benefit from that reality the bruins 2014 recruiting class , led by guard jordin canada and forward monique billings and rated as the best in the country at the time , has ripened , with the players now entering their junior seasons u c l a reached the n c a a tournaments round of 16 in march and was picked by pacific 12 coaches and the news media as the preseason favorite to win this seasons conference title an appearance in the final four would hardly be a surprise but for close , woodens lessons have as much to do with appreciating the shared experiences she has enjoyed through her job as they do with continuing to develop a winning program i remember having a conversation with jordin canada and monique billings about what they dream of doing in their hometowns , close said , and why theyd want the chance to create a legacy and watching those building blocks right in front of my eyes , those are really special moments woodens most tangible , and best known , guide to motivation is his celebrated pyramid of success so close had a huge version of the pyramid installed in her office in her first two years , only the traits wooden placed on the bottom level industriousness , friendship , loyalty , cooperation and enthusiasm were lit in the next phase , the bruins focused on level 2 self control , alertness , initiative and intentness i would say that were progressing to the third level , if im being honest , close said and were talking about skill now the first several years were all about culture , habits , building the internal workings culture was very adult driven the first few years and now its very player driven theyre starting to protect the culture , fight for the culture , believe in the culture , and reinforce that and thats really been a blessing for me because its not about me its about equipping them to be leaders because wooden died before she took the u c l a job , close knows that it is up to her to determine exactly when and how her team reaches the top of the pyramid competitive greatness winning multiple national championships , the way wooden did and auriemma has , is not likely to be the determining factor instead , close looks back to a conversation she had , only days after taking the job , with one of woodens former players , john vallely , a member of the bruins 1969 and 1970 title teams close said he sat across from me and said ive been married 38 years because of lessons coach wooden taught me i started three successful businesses because of what coach wooden taught me i conquered cancer because of what coach wooden taught me i survived the death of my 12 year old daughter because coach wooden loved me and for me , thats the standard and so thats why we wont know the top of the pyramid is really just the peace of mind , knowing you did your very best
when iran conducted a mass hanging in august of sunni prisoners accused of attacks in its restive western kurdish region , the executions were widely criticized as an egregious human rights violation but death penalty opponents also were appalled at what came next videos that showed apparently coerced confessions of the prisoners interwoven with ominous sounding music and clips of unrelated assaults by militants of the islamic state have been shown on iranian state television in the months since the executions produced and disseminated by official media outlets , the videos contain no apologies for the mass hangings they apparently are meant to exploit fears among the countrys majority shiite population about the islamic state , the sunni extremist group ensconced in syria and iraq that shares antipathy for both iran and the west human rights groups say the hangings in iran on aug 2 put 20 to 25 prisoners to death , one of the largest mass executions ever carried out in that country in a report about the videos issued wednesday , titled broadcasting injustice , boasting of mass killing , the rights group amnesty international accused iran of having used stage managed confessions , falsehoods and sensationalist screen titles like in the devils hands and in the depth of darkness to justify the mass hangings to a domestic audience in some cases , the rights group said , the confessions covered crimes committed well after the condemned had been incarcerated by parading death row prisoners on national tv , the authorities are blatantly attempting to convince the public of their guilt , but they cannot mask the disturbing truth that the executed men were convicted of vague and broadly defined offenses and sentenced to death after grossly unfair trials , said philip luther , amnesty internationals research and advocacy director for the middle east and north africa since the 1979 islamic revolution , iran has been among the worlds leaders in administering the death penalty , and has applied it for a wide range of crimes beyond homicide many of the executed have been convicted of drug offenses or on the more vaguely defined charge of enmity against god use of the death penalty in the region is not limited to iran saudi arabia and iraq , for example , also have been singled out by amnesty international and other human rights groups while these groups have long accused the judicial authorities in iran of using torture and other coercive methods against suspects , the use of recorded confessions in sophisticated videos shown on national television is relatively new it seems iran has joined the regions propaganda industry , producing slick videos featuring the apparently forced confessions of men they later executed as terrorists , bizarrely interspersed with scary videos of islamic state attacks they had nothing to do with , wrote sarah leah whitson , the middle east director at human rights watch , in an emailed reaction to the amnesty international report ms whitson also said she was troubled by the role of iranian media agencies in producing and distributing these videos , which implicate them in a rather macabre and ugly form of abuse the amnesty report scrutinized the confessions shown in the videos , in which the condemned men repeatedly described themselves as terrorists and heinous criminals who deserve their punishment the men confessed to membership in an outlawed sunni extremist group known as tohid and jihad , which they said carried out attacks and plotted assassinations in some of the videos , they compared themselves to the islamic state and said they would have committed atrocities worse than is if we had not been stopped the amnesty international report uncovered what it described as several inconsistencies in the videos , suggesting the confessions had been scripted in some cases , the men are linked to crimes that occurred months after they had been arrested or the nature of their involvement in the crimes attributed to them change massively from one video to another , the report said there was no immediate response to the amnesty international report from iranian officials while they have often ignored criticism from amnesty international and other rights groups , they are not immune to it a number of countries in the european union , angered over irans use of the death penalty in drug related crimes , have severed contributions to the united nations agency that helps iran finance its counternarcotics campaign last month , iranian media reported that irans parliament was debating a measure to reduce use of the death penalty in 2013 , iranian judges were given the discretion to impose alternative penalties on juveniles convicted of capital offenses precisely how judges have used this discretion remains unclear , but the change was seen as a response to criticism of iran for putting some children on death row the iranian government is sensitive to global public concern , said sunjeev bery , the advocacy director for the middle east and north africa at amnesty internationals washington office like many governments , iranian officials may attempt to portray themselves as impervious to international criticism , mr bery said , but it can lead to many costs
facebook is moving to restore confidence among advertisers and publishers that it is accurately measuring how often and how long users see videos , news articles , ads and corporate messages on its social network the steps , announced on wednesday , followed the companys apology in september for an error that resulted in considerably overstating how long , on average , users spent watching videos on facebook facebook said that it would increase its use of outside measurement services for display and video ads the company said it is expanding its use of metrics services like comscore , moat , nielsen and integral ad science , and looking to add others facebook said it would form a measurement council of ad agency executives and marketers to develop metrics suited to the needs of advertisers to communicate more openly , facebook established a blog , metrics fyi , to post regular updates on the metrics it uses and what its analysts have found this is an important evolution for facebook , said randall rothenberg , chief executive of the interactive advertising bureau , a trade group of media and technology companies , including facebook this is facebook saying , yes , we know that we need to be and are getting more involved in advertising transparency in the first blog post , facebook , after a lengthy internal audit , said it had uncovered a few more bugs one such miscalculation involved double counting of repeat visitors to view what are known as marketers organic messages regular facebook posts by companies rather than paid ads , the post said correcting that problem , it said , would have reduced the measurement of the number of unique users seeing the marketers messages by 33 percent on average over a seven day period , and by 55 percent over the 28 day span the facebook data analysts also found that the time spent on what are known as instant articles fast loading news items tailored for easier reading on smartphones was overstated on average by 7 to 8 percent , the blog said but another bug resulted in undercounting a video metric the facebook research found that the number of people viewing video ads from beginning to end was 35 percent higher than it had previously calculated facebook emphasized that that newly uncovered flaws involve only a few of the more than 220 metrics facebook deploys the impact of the disclosure of further calculation miscues , after the september apology , is uncertain advertisers and publishers have little choice but to embrace facebook given its huge audience and its dominance , with google , of online advertising early this month , facebook reported that its third quarter profits surged 166 percent from a year ago to nearly 2 4 billion but analysts said concerns about the accuracy of facebooks metrics could prompt some to question whether they should invest so much time , money and resources with the company its not like you can not use facebook as an advertiser or as a publisher , said brian wieser , a media industry analyst at pivotal research but it is a question of who do you prioritize and how many resources do you send that way \? the moves facebook has taken are intended to quell such doubts and restore its credibility among advertisers and publishers our goal going forward , facebook said in its web post , is to communicate more regularly about our metrics , so that our partners can focus on doing what they do best servicing their customers with the best insights possible yet a more skeptical view of digital advertising is emerging , not only for reasons of measurement but some major advertisers wonder if it is as effective as they had assumed the ascendant view had been if its digital , its better , mr wieser said and i think with every passing incident , those who have not been appropriately skeptical or appropriately critical have come down to earth a bit
a packed , sweaty , ready to mosh crowd greeted metallica in september at webster hall in manhattan a rare chance to see the band in a club rather than an arena for a set including two songs from hardwired to self destruct , the bands first studio album in eight years eight years went by fast , said a grinning james hetfield , the bands singer , rhythm guitarist and lyricist but not for you , i guess the set included two songs from the new album that rev up to the punky , speed metal tempos of 1980s metallica hardwired , with a chorus delivering unbridled pessimism in four letter words , and moth into flame , a tirade at the corrosive effects of fame and social media infamy , all for publicity destruction going viral songs about rage , mayhem , madness and annihilation are business as usual for metallica on hardwired to self destruct its metallicas 10th studio album , its first on its own blackened recordings label and its first since death magnetic in 2008 although its 12 songs clock in at under 78 minutes , which means they could be squeezed onto a single cd , its being released on friday as a double album a grander statement by phone from paris on tuesday , mr hetfield said that in his latest lyrics a lot of it is tongue in cheek , a lot of it is cynicism as an adult , you get to stand back and see what is happening in the world , and put your 2 cents in metallica has embraced its adulthood , reclaiming the attack of its music while jettisoning the image of a hard rock band as young , fast and out of control were a bunch of fairly happy go lucky people who , when we get together , theres a lot of energy that happens in the music , said lars ulrich , the bands drummer , who writes the songs with mr hetfield james certainly acknowledges that he carries a lot of things within him but i think its still possible to make energetic , thrashy music without necessarily walking around being these sulky , angry , sullen , dark people with black cartoon thunderstorms over their heads band members have gone through rehab and group therapy , making the process public in the 2004 film metallica some kind of monster , which showed the band working through entrenched hostilities to record an album its members are now settled family men who separate life and art back in the day , making records and touring was pretty much the only thing that was going on , mr ulrich said by phone from his home in san francisco now the band is basically secondary to our families , to our domestic needs , to our attempts at keeping our sanity checked we have a whole way of doing things that may not be the most efficient if people are counting the days until the next record but in terms of keeping the band somewhat sane and keeping the collective healthy , its a different model for the new album , metallica polished a style it has honed for 35 years , ever since mr hetfield answered an ad placed by mr ulrich to start the band mr hetfield howls his tidings of looming catastrophe over a fastidious , fine tuned thrust and roar mr ulrichs drums , mr hetfields rhythm guitar and robert trujillos bass hurtle through riff after riff , fast and hard , behind mr hetfields muscular growl and kirk hammetts screaming , wriggling lead guitar solos instead of reinventing itself for this album , metallica subtly tightened up , notching up the amount of melody in guitars and vocals and trying to limit sprawling songs there was this strange thing for many years in our band , mr ulrich said we were in such a hurry to move forward , and in such a hurry to move away from certain perceptions about us , that we kept chasing something that we didnt really need to chase he was referring to the albums often reviled by longtime fans that metallica made between its 1991 blockbuster , metallica \( usually known as the black album \) , which sold 16 million copies worldwide , and death magnetic , on which the producer rick rubin persuaded the band to embrace its past with the release of death magnetic , metallica toured for three years , but at a manageable , adult pace we basically dont leave the house for more than two weeks at a time , mr ulrich said theres almost a whole european soccer team between us in terms of the kids , and we like to see them every couple of weeks so a tour takes a bit longer than it did when we used to play 26 shows in 29 days after its main three year tour , metallica also put together two of its own ambitious \( and unprofitable \) orion music and more festivals for much of 2011 , they collaborated with lou reed on his last album , lulu in 2013 , the band performed on all seven continents , including antarctica , mr hetfield noted work on hardwired to self destruct started in 2014 songwriting for metallica is like a giant jigsaw puzzle , mr ulrich said the band records everything shows , rehearsals , soundchecks , backstage jam sessions then it selects riffs and melodies and starts to fit them together theres just so much material that we accumulate , all the time , mr ulrich said james hetfield , every time he turns his amp on , its wait a minute , stop , did somebody record that riff \? put an x next to the thing he played at 2 37 p m , because it was awesome mr ulrich spent the summer of 2014 with an ipod holding every single note that wed recorded since death magnetic some 1 , 500 tracks many were labeled by the city they were recorded in the album has riffs from chicago vilnius , lithuania and glastonbury , england in september , mr ulrich said , i walked into the studio with 30 ideas from that ipod i thought , this sounds like a good place to pop a blister , and we just threw ourselves at it they recorded at metallica hq , their rehearsal studio in san rafael , calif on death magnetic , songs had stretched out this time , when the band found itself pushing toward extremes , it made an effort to rein this in , mr ulrich said there was more of a conscious effort to tighten the songs up , make them leaner theres still musical friction in the band , mr hetfield noted song length lars and i argue about that constantly , he said its not that he wants longer songs , but its hard for him to trim anything down its his personality if somethings good , he wants to put it in there and make it longer and bigger i want to streamline things , make them shorter and more powerful we go back and forth on that but if thats the worst thing thats happening to metallica , thats great the band was nearly done with the album when it decided , mr hetfield recalled , that theres no opening song theres nothing that really kicks you in the face right off instead of reopening what mr hetfield called the pandoras box of riffs , the songwriters started from scratch , as in their early days , and ended up with hardwired we wrote it on a monday and tuesday , and tweaked it on wednesday and recorded it on thursday , mr ulrich recalled after two painstaking years , it was great to just knock a song like that out of the park superquick , he said hopefully thats a good indication of the next record we did it , mr hetfield said i got my short song

there was no stopping black beatles once paul mccartney got involved though the song by the rambunctious young rap duo rae sremmurd had been bubbling up steadily , it hit no 1 on the billboard singles chart this week in a most unexpected fashion after becoming the de facto soundtrack to the mannequin challenge , the online video craze of the moment , where subjects hold a pose as the camera pans across a comically eerie tableau love those black beatles mannequinchallenge , the 74 year old mr mccartney posted to twitter last thursday , along with a video of him still at a piano as the songs spare , ominous intro blooms into a joyous number about partying and rocking john lennon lenses he wasnt the only catalyst for the tracks spectacular rise while the new york giants , dane cook , the west point mens gymnastics team and blac chyna , in a hospital delivery room scene , all starred in mannequin challenge clips that went viral , most crucial were the california high school students who , by chance , made black beatles the score of choice for the rampant trend with its jump to no 1 from no 9 in one meme filled week , black beatles joins a peculiar lineage of recent hits also including the dance along juju on that beat \( tz anthem \) , currently no 8 on the hot 100 that have been boosted by organic user generated content on social media , outside of the traditional channels of music promotion as the charts have evolved , the components of what makes a hit have changed so dramatically , said david bakula , a senior analyst for nielsen music , which supplies the data for billboard this is not a world that is dominated by just radio and sales there are new creative outlets to market songs , albums and artists luckily for major labels such as interscope , which released rae sremmurds sophomore album , sremmlife 2 , to modest sales in august , fans can now take it upon themselves to spread music on an almost unimaginable scale on nov 2 , students at colony high school in ontario , calif , choreographed an elaborate mannequinchallenge video just as the fad was taking off among young people , having not yet reached the today show or the white house a student there , joseph day , 17 , became the first to use black beatles with the video because , as he explained via direct message on twitter , its my favorite song and i wanted my friends and the internet to all hear it and enjoy it as well the next night , at a concert in denver , rae sremmurd led the crowd in its own rendition of the meme , eventually earning nearly 60 , 000 retweets of the video and inextricably linking black beatles to the challenge the synergy could not have come at a better time , said john janick , the chairman and chief executive of interscope , because the label had recently begun pushing black beatles as a single it was like a lightning strike , mr janick said without the mannequin challenge , this song wouldve been a hit who knows how far it would go but with the mannequin challenge , its gigantic streams of black beatles have nearly tripled from 15 million in the final week of october to 43 million last week and paid downloads of the track shot up even more , reaching 144 , 000 in the most recent chart period , compared to just 22 , 000 two weeks prior , according to nielsen music even radio play far from guaranteed for viral hits has been rising consistently such a trajectory , from social media to the top of the charts , has become increasingly common since billboard began tweaking its formulas , factoring in youtube views in 2013 and adding digital streams and downloads the following year psys gangnam style was an early beneficiary , as was harlem shake by baauer , an obscure electronic track that hit no 1 after fans began making clips of themselves thrashing to the songs breakdown more carefully choreographed dance crazes that all but demand homemade videos , such as juju on that beat \( tz anthem \) , by the detroit teenagers zay hilfigerrr and zayion mccall , are more pointed attempts to go viral , but have found near instant success as well when the tzanthemchallenge ascended to meme level in september , thanks in large part to instagram and teenage girls , the track was not even available at digital retailers but atlantic records soon announced that it had signed the pair , in what has become an annual occurrence \( last years model , watch me \( whip nae nae \) by silento , is but a memory \) black beatles may have wider reach while fans mannequinchallenge clips that use the song on twitter and instagram are not properly licensed through interscope , and therefore do not count as official streams on the billboard chart , the videos have succeeded in driving people back to rae sremmurds music this isnt gangnam style , this isnt harlem shake , which did not find as much success removed from their videos , mr bakula of nielsen said \( juju on that beat , too , tallied about three times more video streams than audio last week , not necessarily translating to downloads and radio play \) but black beatles has so far proven to be a gateway recent facebook chatter about rae sremmurd was up 250 percent , according to nielsen , while the groups previous hits have also seen an uptick its not just this one song , its not just this one video , mr bakula said thats the kind of thing that can buoy a career
social media has been in the glare since the election for its perceived harmful qualities , such as the spreading of hate speech and the false information but the effect of social media on world affairs is much larger than just misinformation and mean tweets , farhad manjoo writes in his new state of the art column , he argues that social media now collectively used by billions of people worldwide through services like facebook , snapchat , twitter , wechat and weibo has grown to a point where it is increasingly influencing the course of global events the election of donald j trump , who used twitter to magnify his message , is evidence of that shift , farhad writes so was the rise of bernie sanders , whose liberal philosophy and policies were also spread by social media and there are many other examples , such as brexit and the momentum behind isis , of events and movements most likely enabled by social media now each person with once maligned views can see that hes not alone , farhad writes and when these people find one another , they can get things done create memes , publications and entire online worlds that bolster their worldview , and then break into the mainstream social media is also in the spotlight for a different reason these days the kind involving big dollar signs that comes in the form of snap , the parent company of the social media service snapchat , which has filed confidentially for an initial public offering , michael j de la merced and katie benner write snaps i p o , which is likely to take place early next year , is set to be the biggest tech offering since that of the chinese e commerce company alibaba in 2014 it presages a wave of other possible public offerings from highly valued tech start ups such as airbnb and uber time to mark your calendars
a swedish union has set up a hotline for workers to report instances of mansplaining as part of a weeklong effort to raise awareness of a certain kind of condescending elocution that men use to explain to women things they already understand well , actually , its not all men who do it , of course , but a certain kind of man you know him he is probably getting ready to mansplain this article to you the hotline , which is temporary and open to men and women , was set up by unionen , a trade union that represents about 600 , 000 private sector employees in sweden and describes itself as the largest white collar union in the world our objective is to contribute to awareness and start a discussion which we hope will be the first step in changing the way we treat each other and talk about each other in the workplace , jennie zetterstrm , a union spokeswoman , said in an email on wednesday its important to create awareness about how seemingly small things that we do or say add up to a larger issue between 10 a m and 4 p m every day this week , members are being encouraged to phone the hotline to talk about mansplaining in their working lives the calls will be answered by 20 men and women , who are gender experts , authors , academics and others the most important thing when we consulted these people is that they have knowledge and interest in the issue , ms zetterstrm said both women and men carrying valuable experience for such a type of activity so far , ms zetterstrm said , callers have asked for advice on speaking up when they feel run over by male colleagues , and on how to help female colleagues who are being ignored by men in their working groups others have asked how to address clients or colleagues who address only the male employees even when a woman is in charge and how to address men who get credit for a womans work the term mansplaining a portmanteau of explain and man entered popular usage after the author and historian rebecca solnit published a 2008 essay titled men explain things to me she described attending a party at which a man insisted on explaining to her a very important book he had heard about and did not immediately seem to absorb that she had written the book with a knowing roll of the eyes and a deep sigh , women and some men recognized the experience ms solnit relayed , and a new word was born just this year , a man wrote to the advice columnist amy dickinson to complain that she had misused the term in her response to an earlier letter she replied that his letter contained an almost magical dynamic others complained that i had misused the word mansplaining , but you are the only person to mansplain while doing it and last month , the word was featured as an answer on jeopardy \( the correct response was given by a male contestant , for 600 \) predictably , the hotline in sweden has prompted a strong reaction the independent newspaper reported that unionens facebook page had been inundated with negative comments , particularly from men our intention has never been to point fingers or blame all men , our intention has simply been to spark an interest and start a debate at our work places and in society , ms zetterstrm said she added that the debate had been lively , and said , of course its regretful if someone feels offended but the union says it hopes the hotline raises awareness of gender discrimination in the workplace and , in doing so , perhaps helps to alleviate it obviously not all men subject all women to mansplaining all of the time , wrote peter tai christensen , one of the gender experts who will be manning the phone lines that would be an absurd assertion and not based in reality but enough women are subjected to it by enough men for it to be a problem that warrants being addressed , discussed and resolved
shenzhen , china in a one man war room in his apartment , a laid off walmart employee named wang shishu was tapping out a message on his phone to a group of workers and plotting his next move over the past few months , mr wang , 56 , has helped organize a national movement in china against walmart labor strikes have hit stores in the south simultaneously there have been boycotts in the northeast and here in shenzhen , where walmart opened its first outlet in china two decades ago , employees have filed a lawsuit demanding back pay we want a snowball effect , he said in the booming baritone of a street preacher we want everybody to know what to do next as the chinese economy has slowed , strikes and labor protests have broken out across the country , mostly scattered episodes targeting a single factory or business the government has responded aggressively , detaining activists and increasing censorship to keep unrest from spreading but activism against walmarts more than 400 stores in china in recent months has followed a different pattern workers in several cities agitating against the same company , bypassing official unions controlled by the communist party and using social media to coordinate their actions while the authorities largely stand aside across china , walmart employees have raised their fists at protests , chanting , workers , stand up ! they have appealed to local officials with patriotic fervor , invoking the struggles of mao zedong against foreign imperialists they have posted screeds online against unkind bosses and union puppets in doing so , the chinese work force of the worlds largest retail chain has put the ruling communist party in an uncomfortable position , publicly testing its marxist commitment to defend the working class and pitting that against its fear of independent labor activism ever since the solidarity trade union helped topple communist rule in poland , beijing has sought to prevent the emergence of a nationwide labor movement , suppressing efforts by workers to organize across industries or localities but the authorities appear to be hesitating in the case of walmart , whose workers have complained of low wages and a new scheduling system they say has left them poorer and exhausted in recent months , as many as 20 , 000 people , about a fifth of the companys work force in china , have joined messaging groups set up by mr wang and other activists on wechat , a popular app in these forums , they vent about company policies , share protest slogans and discuss plans to coordinate demonstrations for maximum effect mr wang , a former customer service representative whom walmart has fired twice , spends his days babysitting his granddaughter and trading messages with workers across the country , often as late as 2 a m what theyre doing is inhumane , he said i want walmart to return to the sympathetic company it used to be eli friedman , a labor scholar at cornell university , said the walmart movement was probably the most substantive example of sustained , cross workplace , independent worker organizing weve ever seen in chinas private sector the government appears to be keeping a distance because it is worried about provoking a backlash , or about acting on behalf of a prominent american company against chinese workers at a time when nationalism in china is rising but by doing little or nothing , it risks encouraging disaffected workers elsewhere , especially at the growing number of national chain businesses with operations across china already , workers at neutrogena stores and china unicom , a state owned telecom operator , have used similar tactics , while avoiding serious punishment we can only expect that online organizing will continue to break down local barriers , said keegan elmer , a researcher for china labour bulletin , an advocacy group based in hong kong the retail sector in particular has become a hotbed of worker activism the government wants to shift growth from manufacturing to service industries , but many new jobs at restaurants , hotels and stores are low paying or part time from july through september , there were 124 strikes and protests at service sector firms , about double the number last year , outpacing episodes in manufacturing for the first time since at least 2011 , according to china labour bulletin chinese law requires businesses to establish labor unions , but they are almost always controlled by management , and companies generally use the unions to contain worker activism in the face of labor strife , some businesses have offered back pay , bonuses and other benefits to workers but others , concerned that labor activism could force costly concessions , have resorted to tougher tactics , retaliating against those who help organize protests at walmart , some of the most vocal workers have been deprived of raises , reassigned , or in some cases fired , according to interviews with more than a dozen employees at one store in zhongshan , west of shenzhen , a labor activist said a supervisor photographed her in the bathroom as retribution for speaking out she asked not to be identified for fear of further antagonizing her bosses much of the discontent stems from a new scheduling system that walmart put in place this summer as a way , the company said , of giving workers more flexibility workers have argued that it has resulted in cuts to overtime pay and excessively long shifts , and some say they were coerced into signing new contracts agreeing to the system walmart denied that it had treated its employees unfairly or had pressured them to accept the new schedules rebecca lui , a spokeswoman , said that the vast majority of its work force supported the new system , and that employees were free to keep their old schedules our associates are our most valuable asset , she said in a statement zhai xiuhua , a former greeter at a walmart store in shenzhen , said she was fired in september after leading a fight against the new scheduling system i told them , even if you put a knife to my neck , ill never agree , she recalled at her home , where her uniform and identification badge no 14470 still hang on the wall ms zhai , worried about medical bills , says she now hopes to find work in her hometown in the southwestern province of sichuan walmart , which has resisted unionization at its thousands of stores across the world , was forced by the government in 2006 to establish branches of the communist party controlled all china federation of trade unions for its roughly 100 , 000 chinese employees , part of a broader push by the party to unionize foreign businesses but union branches at many walmart stores are under the thumb of store managers , and higher level union officials appear torn about how to respond to complaints from workers like ms zhai while union officials here in guangdong province have criticized walmart for not seeking governmental approval for the new scheduling system , they have not taken more forceful action or helped mobilize workers labor activists at walmart have cited the ideals of president xi jinping and the communist partys history of protecting workers , and experts said they appeared to be benefiting from a belief among some officials that the influence of foreign companies such as walmart should be curtailed if the chinese authorities try to suppress the workers on behalf of walmart , said wang jiangsong , a chinese labor scholar , it will hurt the countrys image when walmart opened its first store in china in 1996 , workers rushed to snap up jobs that paid more than those at chinese competitors now , some employees say , a walmart job does not pay enough to comfortably support a family , with wages hovering around minimum wage , or about 300 a month while walmart has led a high profile campaign in the united states to raise pay , salaries in china have remained largely stagnant , workers said , barely keeping pace with inflation walmart has struggled to keep up with the fast changing tastes of chinese consumers and tried to re energize its business by making investments in online retailers but the continuing labor unrest poses a potential hurdle you tianyu , 45 , a customer service employee at a walmart store in shenzhen , caught the attention of her supervisors in august when she wrote a letter to the president of walmart , doug mcmillon , to complain about the companys efforts to silence aggrieved workers ms you said her bosses now harassed her daily because she spoke out , and she has received a diagnosis of anxiety and depression she spends most of her nonworking hours rummaging through a mess of worker manifestoes , union laws and pay slips in her tiny apartment , hoping to find a new line of attack against walmart im on the verge of collapsing , she said i dont know how much longer ill last

reykjavik , iceland iceland has discovered the secret to a booming tourist industry first have a mammoth financial implosion , then an enormous volcanic explosion the collapse of the icelandic krona after the 2008 financial crisis transformed this arctic island packed with 35 active volcanoes into a top destination by making it cheap for visitors two years later , eyjafjallajokull erupted , spewing thick ash clouds into european skies millions of passengers were grounded for days and airlines suffered financial losses but the explosion put iceland on the map the foreign news media descended on the island , beaming images around the world of spectacular landscapes , even as journalists struggled to pronounce the volcanos name iceland has been saved by the crash and the eruption , said fridrik palsson , who owns hotel ranga , a luxury resort just 19 miles from the slopes of eyjafjallajokull , the 16 letter volcano that is often shortened to e 16 by foreigners i have never seen anything take off so fast , he said the combined effect of the catastrophes has been an invasion on a scale possibly unseen since vikings raided the island hundreds of years ago tourists are expected to outnumber the local population of 330 , 000 by seven to one next year , according to official data by comparison , last year visitors to france outnumbered the french by two to one tourism is now the islands biggest industry , taking over from fishing and aluminum smelting , much as the financial sector did in the years before the crash the influx could be even higher following the rise of the pirate party with its black pirate flag and anarchist leanings , it recently gained more seats in parliament and even more attention , helping to burnish icelands image as cool and alternative the number of tourists has risen by as much as 30 percent every year for the last four years , according to icelands tourist board they brought in revenues of 3 2 billion in 2015 , a third of the countrys export earnings tourism is the single biggest employer , and many icelanders are pouring money into services and new construction mr palsson , who used to sell iceland as a place to see the northern lights , employs an astronomer in his hotel he has also invested in three expensive telescopes that are powerful enough for guests to see the rings on saturn or the fuzzy glow of a distant dying star landsbref , a fund management company that was spun off from one of three failed icelandic banks , set up a 37 million tourism fund reykjavik looks like a scandinavian version of singapore compact , clean , orderly , and rich streets are lined with crayola color houses and mercedes cars chic coffeehouses sell kale and date sandwiches , and play ethiopian jazz restaurants offer inventive nordic cuisine using local ingredients like puffin and shark \( one chef also proudly announced that iceland now grows cucumbers , albeit in a greenhouse \) the 101 , a boutique hotel that was once an exclusive hangout for bankers \( 101 is also the citys richest postal code \) , is now filled with tourists in a possible dig at the hotels former denizens , a sculpture of what looked like a gray suited banker hung on one wall , with a cryptic instruction , disconnect the battery , remove the rear hood and hinge brackets , inscribed beneath it tourists come from as far as hong kong they chase the northern lights they scale glaciers they dive in the arctic circle with puffins , go horseback riding or take helicopter tours listening to ethereal , whale like sounds by the icelandic band sigur ros fans of game of thrones flock to filming locations around the island , some , apparently , genuinely in search of wildlings outside the capital , thick white plumes of steam , which are harnessed for icelands energy needs , rise in the sky , as if the earth were vaping hot springs are everywhere , even in peoples backyards but there is growing concern that uncontrolled tourism is placing too large a burden on this small island housing prices and rents are rising quickly , forcing young people to live with their parents car rentals have tripled , clogging traffic littering and light pollution are spoiling parts of the landscape , many icelanders say its like the city is not my city anymore , birgitta jonsdottir , the leader of the pirate party , complained last month its like disneyland downtown a poll in october conducted by the national broadcaster ruv reported that 87 percent of icelanders want the government to raise fees or taxes on tourists the tourist boom is making some icelanders uneasy another crash like the one that hit the banks is just a matter of time , and many said they are saving money or investing in hard assets pessimists say all it takes to prick the tourism bubble is a sudden drop in visitors , triggered by something like a financial crisis overseas or the adverse effects of britains exit from the european union its happening all over again , said kristjan asjaersson , 51 , a cabdriver during icelands short lived heyday , he recalled having to crisscross the island just to deliver fish caught by icelandic billionaires they had forgotten to pack their catch before flying off in their private jets too many people rely on tourism , he said when tourist numbers fall , the economy will collapse again i know it will happen but i will be prepared diddi bardarson , a tall man with russet locks that reveal his viking roots , also predicted another crash instead of relying so heavily on tourism , he is putting his financial security into a living asset icelands famous horses mr bardarson breeds hundreds of icelandic horses on a 900 acre ranch in hella , a small town 55 miles southeast of reykjavik that straddles the salmon rich ranga river iceland exports nearly 4 , 000 horses a year , many of them to the united states and canada a fine stallion can fetch more than 2 million horses are deep in our soul , mr bardarson said , feeding a 21 year old black stallion named markus , eyes hidden under luxuriously thick bangs , who has sired more than 150 horses horses were , and still are , our lifeline mr bardarson has also benefited from the tourism boom demand for his horses has grown sevenfold over the past few years , he said , partly because some rich tourists become so enamored of the animals that they just have to have one or two icelandic horses are purebred because of contamination fears , once a horse leaves the island it is prohibited from returning unlike other breeds , icelandic horses have five gaits and can travel up to 74 miles a day on rough terrain , breeders say most important , mr bardarson said , the hardy animals are reliable currency during times of financial instability when the kronas value evaporated during the crash , they came to his rescue he bartered horses for cars and tractors mr bardarson said he and his horses were preparing for leaner times horses start slowing down their heartbeat they try to get fatter and grow a thicker coat for the coming hard winter , he said so should humans
perth , australia for this competition , the most astonishing name on the start list for 100 meters did not belong to usain bolt but what dharam pal singh of india lacked in renown , he more than made up for as an international man of mystery if singh really was 119 , born on oct 6 , 1897 , as his passport said , his presence would be extraordinary at the world masters athletics championships this would make him not only the oldest known runner in the world but probably the oldest man in the world the problem was , many people did not believe his story we suspect that he is lying about his age , said vinod kumar , the senior joint secretary of the masters athletics federation of india dr thomas t perls of boston , a leading researcher on centenarians , said the oldest age ever validated for a man was 115 the eldest confirmed person was jeanne calment , a frenchwoman who died in 1997 at 122 in his experience , said perls , the director of the new england centenarian study at boston medical center , 99 percent of all claims of being 115 or older are false the chances of singhs being 119 and a competitive runner probably equaled the odds of building a rocket ship and going to pluto , perls said inconceivable and yet , he added , if singh was , say , in his 90s , any running he did was still spectacular singh denied exaggerating his age in late october , he had more immediate concerns a farmer , he lived in the indian village of gudha , nearly 5 , 000 miles from the world masters championships he wanted to reach perth by oct 24 to prepare to run the 100 , 200 and 400 meters he had paid his entry fee but did not have money to buy an airline ticket he also needed a visa he would travel to new delhi maybe a politician there would arrange the necessary funds for australia im willing to stay in a cheap room , singh said , but i want to go otherwise , the oldest competitor would be an australian legend , john gilmour , 97 , a world war ii veteran who was captured by the japanese and put into forced labor malnutrition and the harsh conditions permanently shrouded his vision still , he resumed his running career after the war he knew what a body could withstand the pain of sport was nothing compared with the pain of capture to read , gilmour needed a magnifying glass he wore sunglasses outdoors to shield his eyes he could see the lanes of a track , but he could not read the bib numbers of his competitors faces were smudged he met people and shook hands and said hi and hoped that was enough not to be considered a stuck up bugger if he did not recognize a friend despite his impaired vision , he once set world masters records from 800 meters to the marathon he went 10 years without a defeat on the track in his mid 60s , he could still run a marathon under three hours his shock of white hair , always combed in a neat pompadour , even in the middle of races , gave him the serene , yearning look of a pioneer despite all the adversity in life , theres a way to survive , said stan perkins , an australian who is president of world masters athletics , the sports governing body thats john he should have died as a prisoner of war , but he didnt he came home and recovered he got back to competing at the absolutely top level on a track a half hour from his home , gilmour was coming out of retirement for his first meet in 11 years four thousand athletes from 91 countries were scheduled to compete at the world masters championships from oct 26 to nov 6 , the equivalent of the olympics for runners and throwers and jumpers 35 and older gilmour had entered the 800 , 1 , 500 and 400 , in that order in his final event , one of his opponents could be dharam pal singh hard to believe , gilmour said of any athlete who could be 119 hes lucky to be alive , much less jogging around yet , despite uncertainty about his age , singh was as stirring to some indian athletes as gilmour was to australian athletes hes healthy and active thats inspiring to me , said abdussamed ambzhthingal , a relative sprinting novice at 75 unlike gilmour , who lived a cataloged life verified by documents , photographs , trophies , medals and two biographies singh could not produce a birth certificate they were not regularly issued in indias villages when he was said to have been born such gaps in birth registration tended to skew masters records toward athletes from more developed nations and disproportionately hindered athletes from africa , india and elsewhere in asia , said harmander singh , a social policy analyst and marathon coach from london he had coached another runner born in india named fauja singh now a british citizen , fauja singh gained widespread attention in 2011 when he ostensibly set eight world age group records at a track meet in toronto and became the first centenarian to complete a marathon yet fauja singh , now said to be 105 , also lacked a birth certificate he could not convince masters officials or guinness world records of his age none of his achievements have been certified as records people in the third world are at a disadvantage for being taken seriously , said his coach , harmander singh masters officials vigorously denied bias in the way they treated athletes or apportioned records they were simply trying to be fair to everyone , said sandy pashkin , an american who is the chief record keeper for world masters athletics this was not considered a trivial matter for competitions and world records , given that age groups were divided into five year increments a runner in , say , the 70 74 category could have a considerable advantage over someone in the 80 84 category for four years , officials said , they had patiently requested that dharam pal singh provide reliable evidence to verify his birth date school records , military records , baptismal records , medical records , school records of his children we have absolutely nothing to prove how old he really is , pashkin said he could be 80 he could be 100 we dont know through the years , singh had not been consistent in listing his age at meets , officials said one said that he registered for this world masters championship as a 117 year old , not a 119 year old but he was given the benefit of the doubt , and his entry was accepted , with an asterisk if he traveled to perth , singh would be allowed to compete in the 95 to 99 category any record that he set would not be validated , but any medal that he won would be awarded a duplicate medal would be given to any competitor he beat everyone elses age in that group had been verified there were mixed feelings among meet officials singh might distract news media attention from all other competitors but , whatever his age , his presence would promote healthy living and he might also draw bigger crowds people could decide for themselves how old he appeared tall and thin , wearing a turban and a beard , singh was said by officials who had seen him run to possess a fluid stride and a great sense of theater before races , he sometimes went into the grandstand to be photographed and he pulled out his cellphone to speak to someone , or to pretend to speak to someone when he runs the 100 , he spends five minutes cheerleading , winston thomas of britain , the secretary of world masters athletics , said with a chuckle come on at that age , who does that \? perkins , the president of world masters athletics , said he , for one , hoped that singh showed up we like the old guy , perkins said hes a really lovely man look , he probably really has no idea how old he is , to be quite honest dharam pal singh arrived for an interview in new delhi carrying his own traveling bag and a handbag he did not wear glasses or use a walking stick for two or three hours in the company of a reporter , he appeared alert and comprehending his passport said his birthday was oct 6 , 1897 the same date appeared on his election voting card and his permanent account number , a code used for taxes these are all valid government documents but not the primary documents to certify age singh said he did not have a birth certificate he said he was illiterate and did not have a school certificate , either his mother provided a horoscope , which became the basis of his age , he said , but he was not carrying it with him his eldest son , born in 1949 , was also illiterate and lacked a birth certificate and a school certificate , singh said he also said that none of his contemporaries in his village were still alive singh carried two more documents one listed him as the first place finisher at 200 meters \( 50 26 seconds \) for sprinters 100 and over at the 2014 malaysian masters athletics championships the other document was perhaps more significant it was an age certificate , dated may 21 , 2014 , and stamped and issued by the chief medical officer of the meerut district in the indian state of uttar pradesh singh had not provided any documentary evidence to substantiate his age , the certificate said but based on general appearance and x rays taken at p l sharma hospital meerut , singh appeared to be 100 it was unclear how credible the certificate was but it was signed by the chief government doctor in the region where singh lived those who accuse him of inflating his age are jealous of my health , my age , my running , singh said , speaking hindi people say i do not look like 119 , he said if i walk with a stick and with a bent back , then i would look like 100 plus without a stick , with a straight back , i look like 80 to 90 plus my good health has become my misfortune age fraud was uncommon at the world masters championships because there was not much incentive beyond a medal and a certificate , said ken stone of la mesa , calif , the founder and editor of masterstrack com and a watchdog over age group running its much more common to find evidence of doping than to find evidence of age fraud , stone said yet , within the niche sport , there had been a small number of high profile cases of masters athletes who performed remarkable feats but could not satisfactorily prove their age to record keepers an ostentatious incident , stone said , had occurred at the 2011 world meet in sacramento , calif a 46 year old egyptian named mohamed megahed finished 14th in the long jump in the 45 49 age group then he borrowed a bib and entered the 50 54 age group , furtively seeking a better result against older competitors , only to be disqualified douglas kalembo , an olympian who represented zambia at the 1988 seoul games , appeared in 2010 to become the first 50 year old to run faster than 50 seconds in the 400 meters but his mark was never ratified , masters officials said , because of conflicting documents that suggested he might have been 39 or 40 at the time instead of 50 in september 2015 , a dispute arose about which of two men , both said to be 105 , had become the worlds oldest , fastest sprinter at 100 meters guinness world records sided with hidekichi miyazaki of japan world masters athletics sided with stanislaw kowalski of poland at the time , officials also wrestled with the case of an 80 ish greek man named symeon symeonidis his father was said to have altered his birth certificate , making him appear younger so that he could be eligible for food rations after world war ii but the story could not be verified , said kurt kaschke , a german who is president of european masters athletics symeonidis , kaschke said , was later penalized for age falsification kaschke wrote a plaintive letter about the uncertainty that officials faced with some of the most elderly runners was a birth certificate valid if the original no longer existed \? what should be done about athletes born during the first or second world war , when many records were destroyed \? how could a birth date be proved when a government was not able to verify a birth on a particular day \? or when a country did not issue birth certificates \? these were questions without clear answers , kaschke wrote to stone last fall , but you see it makes it difficult for all statisticians in the world to find the truth the situation may be further complicated by the refugee crisis in europe , as people flee countries like syria , afghanistan and iraq , often without documents , as they seek a new life , masters officials said the issue of older athletes of indeterminate age was not so much growing , but i wouldnt say it was rare , said thomas , the secretary of world masters athletics most times , weve been able to sort something out historically , there have been numerous reasons people made false , inaccurate or unsubstantiated claims to extreme longevity , according to perls , the boston medical center expert on aging the fountain of youth and shangri la myths appealed to personal vanity the soviet union asserted that people supposedly living into their 150s or 160s in the caucasus the birthplace of stalin proved the superiority of communism some hindu yogis in india claimed to be 200 or older , drawing followers to their religious beliefs a person claiming to be of extreme age could also draw great attention and could be a source of pride and reverence for a family , a village , a country not all told deliberate falsehoods , perls and colleagues wrote in a 2010 study some who purported to be 110 or older were convinced of their ages , having been told so by others , the study said or they had forgotten as they grew older about an intentional or erroneous change in their birth date from a long time ago yogendra singh , a sociologist who has done field work in indias villages , said older people tend to relate their ages to historical or other events in the past in the process , they have a tendency to orchestrate their age as it suits them , said singh , a professor emeritus at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi it is always relative and rarely absolute dharam pal singh said that his long life had nothing to do with fabricating his age his secret was cows milk , herbal chutney and seasonal fruit that ripened in sunshine he avoided butter , fried food , sugar , tobacco , alcohol , even tea and coffee intoxicants make you empty from inside , he said he grew wheat , rice , sugar cane and vegetables , slept on a hard bed to keep his back straight and awakened at 4 in the morning after retiring at 11 p m he began running while herding cows when he was a teenager even now he tried to run four to five kilometers a day i may compete until im 125 , singh said he said he had been inspired by fauja singh , supposedly the first centenarian to complete a marathon he had seen him on television and read about him in newspapers but , he noted , i have broken all of his records his wife , lakhmiri , was between 90 and 95 he had three sons , four daughters and 21 grandkids , though one of his suggestions for good health , besides running , was to marry late and produce no more than two children he was not competing for his own sake , dharam pal singh said i am trying to increase the pride of my nation , he said my body is dedicated to my country at 6 30 a m , hours before he was to run the 800 , john gilmour dressed in a track suit and shuffled a couple of laps in his backyard a retired gardener , he had built a small earthen track years ago amid the bottle brush trees and geraniums sixty laps equaled a mile he had used the track when recovering from injury or when his wife , alma , was sick with his poor eyesight , he did not have to worry about getting lost or being hit by a car or , if alma needed him , he was right there he mowed his yard and spread grass clippings on the sandy soil to make it spongy for his thick legs alma had died four years ago after struggling with arthritis and liver cancer john quit running in 2005 to take care of her she had let him compete all over the world , he said , and he wanted to let her see i thought more of her than my running into his 70s , gilmour had kept a rigorous training schedule if it rained , he rode an exercise bike in the backyard shed until the weather cleared weekly , he headed into the bush to run in soft sand , using a power line overhead to keep him from straying off course sometimes he spray painted markings on the road like dharam pal singh , he avoided tobacco and alcohol his comeback for the world masters championships seemed a natural curtain call for a brilliant career perth was his adopted hometown but he had not been able to train as fully as he wanted , saying he had been slowed by prostate cancer , a bladder infection and a chest infection he fretted about a urostomy bag that would protrude below his running shorts still , gilmour had tried to run two or three kilometers each day , waking early and circling the perimeter of his brick home each lap was precisely 80 meters old age always wins , gilmour had said in his kitchen the previous afternoon , displaying various medications and supplements he had been taking its shocking no matter how hard you try , it beats you he had the stamina to keep going , but speed eluded him now , as if it were a baton he could not grasp in a relay you seize up , gilmour said if you lose your balance , you fall over if you fall , how do you get up \? but his motto , as a prisoner of war and as a runner , had been dont give in eight hundred meters on the track would equal 10 laps around his house at least im going to finish , he said i just hope i dont embarrass anybody four runners were scheduled in the 95 99 age group gilmour was particularly concerned about arthur carbon , a fellow australian and a former professional runner carbon had not run in 50 years but was also tempted out of retirement by the world masters championships the night before the race , gilmour had felt a bit restless he had struggled to get to sleep , worried about strategy , of all things if hes too fast , ill let him go , he had said of carbon hes 96 , a young guy as gilmour arrived at the track , he said he felt a bit nervous he wore a green and gold uniform , the colors of australia it was a perfect spring afternoon , cloudless , breezy , a bit of chill in the shade he had worried needlessly carbon withdrew from the 800 to concentrate on the sprints two other runners in the 95 99 age group also scratched , citing injury and illness so two age groups were combined gilmour was paired with dumitru radu , 90 , a trim romanian who wore a black bathing suit decorated with soccer balls and the logo of the 1990 world cup in italy animated , with a popeye ish look , radu spoke german and told vivid stories complete with sound effects he said he had been a wood cutter who fought in russia in world war ii he hugged volunteers and drank brown liquid from a water bottle coca cola \? he was asked nicht coca cola , he said kaffee brasilien coca cola kaput ! before the race , the two men shook hands radu bowed he seemed frail , keeping his legs wide and stiff as if running on stilts but his form was overcome by determination and stamina radu had already won the eight kilometer cross country race again , he took the lead because the men were in different age groups , each would receive a gold medal if he crossed the finish line gilmour persisted with a run walk style he had not been on a track in more than a decade and was no longer accustomed to the long straightaways wind gusted in his face along the backstretch as both men headed toward the finish , the small crowd began clapping and rose to its feet alan bell , the race director , said this is not athletics this is more an example of the human spirit radu crossed first in 8 minutes 59 53 seconds gilmour finished in 9 19 53 a small smile creased his face each runner sat in a chair and had a cup of water im really pleased that i managed to finish , gilmour said gold medals were placed around the runners necks in separate ceremonies each stood atop the podium as his national anthem was played well done , john ! gina grayson , 42 , told gilmour she and her sister , sue malaxos , a marathoner at the 1996 atlanta olympics , had been coached by gilmour grayson brought her two children to watch him run and gave him a kiss on the cheek everyone was standing on their feet , grayson said good on you brian kennedy , 83 , a longtime friend , touched gilmour on the shoulder and joked the drug testing people are out there they want to see you two more races remained on gilmours schedule , but there would be no meeting with dharam pal singh in the 400 the indian runner did not show up for the 100 he said by telephone that he had received travel money from supporters but had not received an official entry card for the meet so he could not obtain a visa there were no official entry cards , officials said was this an excuse by singh \? a misunderstanding \? the mystery deepened i dont have any regrets for myself , singh said but i regret that my going to australia would have increased the pride of india there was other bad news arvind kumar singh , a subdivisional magistrate , or civil servant , in the district where dharam pal singh lived , said that the authorities had received a complaint about him last year it was related to an award he was to receive and whether he was eligible we found his claim about his age as false , arvind kumar singh said a school transfer certificate had been found based on the certificate , he said , dharam pal singh was 78 or so and he was not illiterate the age was corrected on singhs election card , but he continued to use an old card to hide his age , the civil servant said this seemed to verify something a reporter had noticed earlier singh said he was illiterate but he could clearly read signs on the new delhi metro rail system and emails on his mobile phone id love to know just what age the man was , stan perkins , the president of world masters athletics , said anything from 80 years and up , he would be competitive , without a doubt singh ran so well that he would probably still be competing in 10 years , perkins predicted sandy pashkin , the organizations chief record keeper , laughed thatll make him 130 \? quite possibly , perkins said
new delhi the indian government has banned a nongovernmental organization run by a popular televangelist preacher , zakir naik , after accusations that he promoted terrorism through his speeches the decision to ban the organization , the islamic research foundation , was made at a cabinet meeting on tuesday , said k s dhatwalia , a spokesman for the ministry of home affairs the foundation , based in mumbai , will be banned for five years under the unlawful activities prevention act , a law governing groups and individuals who act counter to the integrity of india mr dhatwalia said that the foundation had violated certain provisions of the act he declined to specify what those provisions were but said that they had been conveyed to the organization the authorities have expressed alarm about dr naiks message and the reach of his influence dr naik , who was trained as a medical doctor and who addresses his followers in western style suits , has a television channel , peace tv , that is popular with muslims globally in his speeches , dr naik has harshly criticized the united states , saying that the sept 11 attacks may have been an inside job by president george w bush dr naik has also refused to renounce osama bin laden as a terrorist i am hesitant to accept him as a terrorist or a saint , dr naik said in a 2009 interview he also characterized islam as the most misunderstood religion in the world dr naik is often evasive when questioned over his more inflammatory statements , including one that supported suicide attacks in a news conference in mumbai in july , in which he appeared by videoconference from saudi arabia , he said that suicide attacks in which innocent people were killed were un islamic , but that the use of the tactic was justified in war the authorities in india , with its long history of tension between hindus and muslims , have monitored dr naiks activities , including his speeches and charitable work with the islamic research foundation , which seeks to spread the proper presentation , understanding and appreciation of islam , according to its website that scrutiny escalated after a bangladeshi newspaper reported that one of the attackers in the july assault on a bakery in dhaka that left 22 people dead had quoted dr naiks teachings in a facebook post peace tv has been banned in bangladesh , and indian satellite channels have refused to carry it , but dr naiks sermons still have a large audience in india and abroad at the july news conference in mumbai , he denied supporting terrorist activities and said that he did not encourage the dhaka attacks in past years , the indian police have registered cases against dr naik over objectionable speeches he has made , the local news media reported at the conference in july , however , dr naik said , never ever in my full life have i been called for investigation dr naik said that one of his videotaped speeches that was used as the basis for one of the cases filed in india was doctored , and because of the clip , many of the hindus were hurt and i said that i apologize for hurting their feelings the islamic research foundation was not immediately available for comment on wednesday
lod , israel it would be easy to miss the mosque in a temporary building with a concrete floor and corrugated roof but it is impossible to miss the constellation of six loudspeakers atop a giant metal structure resembling the eiffel tower five times a day , starting well before dawn , these loudspeakers broadcast the muezzins call to prayer in lod , a city of arabs and jews near ben gurion international airport , and therein lies one more friction point in a country full of them one groups expression of faith is anothers noise pollution , and israels government is planning a crackdown a proposal backed by prime minister benjamin netanyahu and initially endorsed this week by his ministers would authorize the government to ban the use of loudspeakers by mosques and other houses of worship across israel for many on both sides of the nations sectarian line , few questions could prove more provocative than whether the muezzin should be muzzled the call to prayer is a symbol of islam , said adel elfar , the imam of the lod mosque , one of several that have been controversial here this is something thats existed for 1 , 426 years he said that he could hear bells from a christian church in town and that jewish residents drove around the city every couple of months broadcasting from loudspeakers on their vehicles the call of every religion , if you get rid of extremism , shouldnt bother anybody , he added and yet it does among those bothered is lods mayor , yair revivo , who is jewish and announced last month that the city would broadcast the shema , a central prayer that begins hear o israel , to counter the mosques call the first of islams five daily prayers begins before dawn , noted col motti yogev , a member of parliament who introduced the new ban the goal of the law is to prevent peoples sleep from being disturbed , he said we have no desire to harm the prayer of the muslims the fight over the muezzin underscores a fundamental societal challenge for israel beyond its conflict with palestinians living in gaza or the occupied west bank about 20 percent of israels citizens are arabs , and cities like lod , where about a third of the nearly 73 , 000 residents are arab , perennially struggle to find a comfortable balance the conflict has also grown in jerusalem , which is divided between largely jewish and arab communities the proposed ban , approved on sunday by mr netanyahus ministers and sent to parliament , has drawn denunciations from jordan and the palestinian authority in a sign of the complexity of the issue , it drew surprise opposition on tuesday from israels ultra orthodox health minister , yaakov litzman , who temporarily blocked parliamentary debate and sent the issue back to the ministers because it might also affect the use of sirens to announce the beginning of the jewish sabbath ahmad tibi , a leader of the arab members of the israeli parliament , or knesset , said mr netanyahu was inflaming anti muslim sentiments if the muezzin law passes the knesset , i call on the arab public in israel to rise up i call for a civil popular uprising , he told a lebanese television outlet all muslims must be called to protect mosques , to defend the calls from the mosques amnon beeri sulitzeanu of the abraham fund initiatives , a nonprofit organization that promotes coexistence between jews and arabs , said the proposal conflicted with mr netanyahus recent drive to increase investment in arab communities to reduce gaps in educational and economic opportunities you see those two conflicting trends yet again , which basically tells me that the israeli establishment still hasnt made up its mind in regard to its arab citizens , he said what do we want from the arab palestinian minority \? do we want to really integrate it and include it as an integrated part of israeli society \? the text of the proposed ban on mosque loudspeakers says that hundreds of thousands of citizens in parts of israel suffer habitually and daily from loud and unreasonable noise that is caused by the call of muezzin from mosques colonel yogev said it could be narrowed to apply only to sleeping hours mr netanyahu has said he is trying to balance competing interests israel is committed to freedom for all religions , but is also responsible for protecting citizens from noise , he said this week in lod , which traces its history to the days of canaan , frustration over the mosques has grown as more jewish residents have moved in since the evacuation of settlements in gaza a decade ago there is already a noise law on the books , but advocates of the new legislation said it was not applied to the muezzin if someone is having a karaoke party with loudspeakers at night and you call the police , they will come and take down the loudspeakers , said amichai langfeld , a member of the city council but if you call about the mosque , they wont under existing law , mr langfeld added , the police must test the level of the call to prayer or of any noise to see if it exceeded the limit the new law would simply ban loudspeakers at mr elfars mosque , the call to prayer was broadcast on tuesday at 4 45 a m , 11 25 a m , 2 21 p m , 4 47 p m and 6 05 p m the tension over the loudspeakers was easy to detect in a visit to a clothes and jewelry market a few blocks away several jewish shoppers and salespeople said that they did not mind the call during daylight hours , but that the earliest one invariably woke them up some described trying to muffle the noise with curtains or blankets , often to little effect naama reichmann , 32 , who moved to lod about five years ago , said the 4 45 a m call made it hard for her and her 2 year old daughter to sleep through the night we dont say they cant do it , but not so loud , she said chaim koti , 80 , who was selling clothes , was more pointed they do it intentionally loud in order to bother us , he said a few feet away , a group of muslim vendors said the proposal to limit the muezzin was a slap in the face to them they noted that the call to prayer had been sounded in lod since long before mr netanyahu came to power theres hate for arabs , said muhyi sharabati , 22 there are people who are against islam safiya matweeye , 19 , said the authorities should focus on crime and violence instead of things that could discourage prayer its a good thing , because people come to pray instead of shooting each other in the street , she said religion keeps people honest as they spoke , the afternoon call to prayer sounded no one looked up after a few minutes , it was over , the latest trumpet in israels culture war
cannon ball , n d on any given night , supper lines here at the dusty prairie camps near the missouri river where the last piece of a 1 , 170 mile pipeline is set to be placed might include young navajo women from arizona who have never camped in the cold , and older white women for whom chaining themselves to a fence for a cause is nothing new there are protest tourists in new boots , lakota elders who spend hours in prayer , parents from the suburbs who have dragged the children away from their video games they have all driven for hours sometimes days to join hundreds of protesters at the standing rock sioux reservation and they all need to eat the camps grew fast over the summer , sometimes swelling on the weekends to what both organizers and the north dakota state patrol said was well over 3 , 000 people the original intent was to stop or at least change the route of the dakota access pipeline , a 3 7 billion project that will stretch across four states the camps have since broadened into a gathering of people focused on bringing attention to environmental issues and the rights of indigenous people as the number of teepees and yurts built to withstand the brutal north dakota winter has grown , so , too , have the camp kitchens no one is directly in charge of the chaotic but robust network of what amounts to several free restaurants , which reflect both the broad spectrum of the nations diet and its battles over food politics there is no rhyme or reason , but everyone gets fed , rosetta buan , 40 , a cook from asheville , n c , who is on her third trip here , said sunday there are little miracles every day dishes get washed bellies get filled the roster of cooks can change daily , bringing the kind of cutthroat power plays any chef will tell you is inherent in many professional kitchens writing a daily menu is a challenge the voluminous stream of food donations might produce 50 pound bags of rice , cases of funyuns , butternut squash from an urban farm in detroit and roadkill deer supplies , supplemented by runs to bismarck , about an hours drive away , are spread among pop up and permanent tents , refrigerated trucks and wooden palettes on the ground anyone who is hungry heads to the dining tent , grabs a plastic plate from a mismatched pile and lines up under a sign that reads , lakota rules women and children first all that is asked is that you take a minute to wash dishes , sort food or find some other way to pay for your meal with labor ms buan , who owns the vegetarian restaurant rosettas kitchen in asheville , was called upon during one trip to help figure out what to do with a donated buffalo that was hanging from the bucket of a bulldozer on this visit , she is setting up a snug vegetarian kitchen that will feed about 30 of her family members and friends who plan to stay through the winter even if energy transfer partners , the dallas based company building the pipeline , meets its goal and finishes the project by january like almost every cook here , she will feed anyone who walks in the main kitchen is at the oceti sakowin camp , the biggest of four camps within a short hike of one another most of the meals are prepared in a military tent outfitted with a 12 burner propane stove and a few other large pieces of cooking equipment , including a black smoker just outside the door members of the news media are warned that no images can be captured from within the main food tents , for fear that health inspectors might spot violations and use them as an excuse to shut down the camps its hard to be up to code when you are camp cooking , but were getting there , said mateo cadena , 29 , who took a break from his kitchen job at the yellowstone club , a private resort in big sky , mont , to cook at the main kitchen for several days earlier this month the clash of food cultures is writ large here a sizable contingent of vegans and vegetarians struggle in a culture that is based on hunting game although everyone tries to be respectful , a kitchen shift can get tense at the nearby sacred stone camp , the lakota woman who runs a kitchen that can feed up to 200 people a day struggles with a white cook from montana who insists that using propane is disingenuous when they are fighting an oil company , and that children should not be fed white sugar caitlyn huss , 25 , a manager of a vegan hostel in los angeles , was closing up late one night last month when the tent flap opened and someone dropped off a deer that had just been killed by a car we knew we had to find an elder from the sacred fire to come and bless it , then find someone who could skin it for us , she recalled it was crazy brian yazzie , a navajo chef who works for the sioux chef , a native food company based in minneapolis , said the cultural gap even among tribe members can be wide he spent a few days last month cooking at the camps , and is gathering donations so he can head back during the week of thanksgiving he cooks food he describes as pre colonization local meat and vegetables and no gluten , dairy or processed products its difficult at the camps , he said when he first surveyed the supply tent , he saw stacks of flour , canned goods and vegetable oil it was like the mid 1850s when my ancestors were put on reservations or internment camps and given government rations to eat instead of their natural resources at the camp , he made hominy and bison soup and roasted pumpkin with quinoa flavored with maple syrup it was not an automatic hit the palates of most of my people are used to that survival food , he said savannah jo begay , 29 , a navajo from pinon , ariz , spends her evenings making fry bread from flour , water and lard its the kind of food mr yazzie battles against , but something a lot of people at the camps crave you put some love into the fry bread and it makes it feel like home , she said that desire for homey food led to breakaway kitchens run by different tribes that have the feel of extremely rustic neighborhood bistros pueblo cooks might serve bowls of red chili stew while the oglala sioux fry venison one night last week , the upper klamath basin kitchen offered elk stroganoff winona kasto , 47 , a lakota cook from green grass , a small community on the cheyenne river sioux reservation , ran the big kitchen for a time she left to start a little kitchen she calls the soup kettle house with help from a rotating band of volunteers , she turns donations delivered by sympathetic national food companies and whatever else shows up into meals that lakotas want to eat i just want to feed the people and our ancestors the proper way , she said when a donated buffalo was butchered , she got the lungs and some other internal organs she boiled them into soup that day , some young protesters tried to swim across the river to the construction site and clashed with the police someone rushed into her kitchen and said they needed hot soup at the front lines i packed it up and they ran it out there , she said even the white people were eating that lung soup
in the moments after villanovas kris jenkins hit a game winning shot to beat north carolina in the final of last seasons n c a a tournament , i was lying on my couch with my phone held a few inches from my face the crying jordan meme was all over my social media feeds , and although i had drifted from my tar heels obsessed childhood , i felt unusually bummed out two powerhouse programs with huge followings had just played a game that featured a furious comeback in the final minutes a magic game tying shot by marcus paige , north carolinas senior guard and , of course , jenkinss buzzer beater after the game , paige choked up at the news conference and carolinas fan base let out a long sigh for a player it had cheered on for four years the game felt as if it had been scripted to hit all the nerve endings of what makes us care about college sports , and if the quality of the actual play was not up to par , no one but the most hardened sports wonk would have noticed quality of play does not have to be an expression of nostalgia , but thats almost always the underlying sentiment like so many other slogans weve been hearing this year , theres an unspoken condemnation of the inadequate present compared with some vaguely glorious past college basketball , whose new season tips off this month , used to be relatively immune from these sorts of comparisons nobody could watch , say , the duke maryland games of the early 00s , which featured eight or nine future pros and were contested in front of rabid crowds and a national television audience , and persuasively argue that the game was better when jump shots required two ungainly seconds of setup before being fired from the hip progress was implicit that has changed over the past two years now there is a movement to make college basketball great again the doomsayers will tell you that the sport has become too slow and mechanical and low scoring , thanks to coaching that banishes improvisation and enforces deliberate , often excruciating to watch play the complaint began to ring during the 2014 2015 season , when everyone from mark cuban , the owner of the dallas mavericks , to jay bilas , an espn announcer whose twitter feed offers the best running commentary on college basketball , spoke up to say that it was in dire need of change the case was most clearly laid out by sports illustrateds seth davis he blamed the incessant timeouts , fouls that dragged out the ends of games , control freak coaches and physical defense davis , drawing on the work of ken pomeroy , the quant who has all but single handedly brought sabermetric rigor to college basketball , provided a lot of statistics to support his case most notable , overall scoring had reached its lowest point since 1952 and concluded with an edict until the pace of change speeds up dramatically , this once beautiful game will grind to a halt last year , in an attempt to reverse some of these trends , the n c a a reduced the shot clock to 30 seconds and told officials to make calls that would reduce physicality and ease freedom of movement the results were mixed teams played faster and scored more and with greater offensive efficiency but interest in the sport , at least judging by tv ratings and overall attendance , stagnated those who would restore or fix the quality of play may sound progressive , but theirs is ultimately an argument based on a couple of flimsy assumptions that a higher scoring game is a more popular game and that anyone not paid to watch hundreds of college basketball games a year can really tell the difference between teams averaging 63 points per game and those that score 66 maybe the best \( but not the only \) counter to the false belief that low scoring equals poor play can be found at the university of virginia , coached by tony bennett over the past three years , the team has gone 89 19 despite ranking consistently in the bottom third in scoring in the atlantic coast conference bennetts teams slow down the game into a half court battle that allows them to capitalize on their defensive strengths on offense , they tend to pass the ball around the perimeter for the first 15 seconds of each possession , patiently waiting for their opponents to slip up , which they usually do theres some truth to the whole fun , fast play thing , bennett told me recently but what i say is that its more about quality , whether its higher scoring or lower scoring , and if theres success with what youre doing , youll draw attention to why it works his team shows that success , determined by victories , defines quality a random tv viewer who happens upon a virginia game , in which the halftime score is typically in the 20s and low 30s , might see confirmation that college basketball is in crisis if he or she didnt know that the team was winning so much if the quality of the play on the court hasnt become worse , then why do some consider the game to be in decline \? one factor is simply that there is now so much more college basketball on tv , and therefore a much wider range of quality to watch and judge espn , which heavily promoted college basketball during the late 90s and early 00s , has increased its focus on big time college football ilan ben hanan , vice president of espns college programming , emphasized to me that while the network was still fully committed to college basketball , the focus has been spread around to showing more teams in more markets generally speaking , college basketball has become a tonnage in quantity play , ben hanan said the tonnage is not itself a problem , but it exposes more teams to scrutiny bad games played by bad teams always existed they just werent on television all the time college basketballs exposure to the public , at least on the national level , used to be limited to big name programs and the drama of tournament play if they had played 20 years ago , when national college basketball coverage was mostly limited to saturday network broadcasts , bennetts virginia teams might have been more appreciated because the very fact of their being on television would have signaled that their style was worth watching today an early season snoozer between wyoming and boise state can turn off an irritated viewer who , when he sees virginia , misses out on the intricate quality of their basketball , notices only the low scores and unmade shots and flips over to the n b a college basketball is suffering from the same issue that every other sport is suffering from , pomeroy told me the viewing options are so diverse and the audiences are fragmented , and so popularity is being pulled away and into other places theres another way to account for what might be ailing college basketball , one that risks feeling almost recklessly emotional some of the scandals that have hit big programs as well as all the bad press directed at the n c a a for exploiting college football and basketball players reaping millions from broadcast fees while the athletes are paid only in easily revoked scholarships have chipped away at the myth of innocent collegiate competition slow , sloppy play in 2016 might just feel worse than it did in , say , 1982 , when michael jordan and patrick ewing played in the national championship game bricked shots are more readily condemned in 2016 , when we have all seen college basketball for what it is the kid from 1982 could be more easily forgiven for missing his shot when he was just playing for the love of the game or the name on his uniform ill admit that , as a college basketball sentimentalist who grew up on tobacco road enthralled with dean smiths north carolina teams , this sort of explanation exerts a pull over me a seemingly benevolent paternalism hung over that era smith was credited as a civil rights pioneer and his program seen as an emblem of a progressive , egalitarian south in stark contrast to the rich jersey kids who went to duke all that should have started to crumble in 2010 , when a series of academic scandals in the athletic department began coming to light the revelations , which included the existence of fake classes for athletes offered in the schools african and afro american studies department , leaked out steadily over the next four years , but they only kicked up in me the slight anxiety that n c a a sanctions might hurt recruiting , which , in turn , would hurt the teams chances of beating duke i have not cared about the scandals because my connection to the team is not tied to administrators , coaches and professors it resides , instead , in a hyperlocal identity within the long history of carolina basketball my friends and i hated the quiet crowds and the cabal of rich whitehairs who sat together in matching , powder blue sweaters , but our fandom was built on the teams identity as an athletic , fast paced and pro ready answer to dukes line of pious white players and on a vision of the south if my enthusiasm for this season has dimmed , its not because the best u n c players graduated last year or the school has fallen into scandal but rather because the idea of being a progressive north carolinian has become undone by the states politics this is a wildly sentimental and nostalgic reaction , but college basketball , perhaps more than any other major american sport , runs on this sort of locally produced sensibility and how it gets projected , however hard it may be to identify , onto the court quality of play , whatever it means , will always be , and should be , an afterthought
christopher rea is a literary and cultural historian at the university of british columbia a 39 year old native of berkeley , calif , he has written on major figures in modern chinese literature , including qian zhongshu and yang jiang his new work , the age of irreverence a new history of laughter in china , shows how the early 20th century inspired a flowering of comedy , farce , cursing and satire in it , one finds interesting parallels to today , especially in how people stick it to authority academic books do not always reflect their subject matter studies of sex , for example , are notoriously unsexy but mr reas book is funny , beginning with its hilarious executive preface it even carries a blurb by eric idle of the british comedy troupe monty python in an interview , mr rea discussed cursing as a spectator sport , the invention of humor and his debt to monty python what led you to write about chinese humor \? i grew up watching monty python and the marx brothers i loved the zaniness , the silly gags , the outrageous conceits and , later , grouchos double entendres in college i discovered that chinese is a fantastic language for wordplay so when i started delving into literary and cultural history , the question in the back of my mind was did china have anything similar to the pythons or to vaudeville \? china isnt usually thought of as a funny place state repression is one reason for that chinas leaders are deathly afraid of ridicule and the china story has , for various reasons , tended to emphasize suffering , struggle and grievance this is whats so refreshing about writers like qian zhongshu , who had an ear for wordplay , a nose for ingenious disingenuousness and the guts for scorched earth satire china in the early 20th century my books focus was , to put it mildly , a rough and tumble place but it fostered a whole industry of mirth populated with cultural figures from hack jokesters to respectable writers slumming it as humorists it seems that many chinese humorists back then turned to cursing why \? for a couple reasons first , a print culture boom made disputes public as never before now youre taking down your adversary not in a teahouse , but in the newspaper slights and sarcasm quickly escalate to name calling and character assassination writers with a penchant for funny insults became famous as renowned revilers ming ma cursing celebrities , if you will second , early 20th century china was a violent place of rampaging militarists , political assassinations , foreign invasion and crushing poverty many critics felt that extreme conditions called for extreme rhetoric hypocrites , traitors and wimps became objects of contempt can you share an example that could be printed in a family newspaper \? in 1923 , when the northern warlord cao kun bribed his way into the third presidency of the republic of china , wu zhihui , one of the founders of the chinese nationalist party , called him the sperm president wu reportedly explained this epithet as follows if a man could turn each of his sperm into a human in one go , cao could have just had his millions of descendants elect him and saved all the money he spent on bribes what was the role of the writer lin yutang , who coined a term for humor youmo \? lin yutang was out to break a language barrier chinese had words for serious talk and funny talk , he claimed , but nothing in between existing chinese terms for humor were tainted with associations like abusiveness , triviality or cynicism youmo would symbolize a new type of talk that was at once engaged and amusing more than that , youmo was a new outlook china was in crisis , but lin wanted his countrymen to be self confident enough to face it with a smile and humor would enable him to be a critic of the government without getting shot your book mentions the invention of humor , but it wasnt that humor didnt exist in china previously , right \? right most of my book is about cultures of humor in the decades before the 1930s , when proponents of youmo essentially reinvented humor as an idealized moral concept looking further back , you have collections of jokes , amusing stories and anecdotes , comedic verse and essays performing arts featured slapstick interludes , banter and stock clown roles and theres no shortage of bawdy sexual humor , like li yus the carnal prayer mat lin yutangs view was that people had either forgotten about this side of chinas past or had repressed it song dynasty thinkers had suckered everyone into thinking that confucius was uptight , when in the analects hes actually making self deprecatory jokes and kidding his disciples the 1930s humor crowd dug up a lot of oldies but goodies while introducing a slew of foreign humor and their own creations how did people respond to the promotion of humor \? it was a hit the press dubbed 1933 the year of humor , and the term youmo has stayed with us since but chinese humor writers had traditionally been on the defensive when they cracked jokes , theyd say it was just a way to pass the time over a cup of tea the reflex was to belittle humor the moderns , too , felt they had to justify what they were doing lin yutang wanted it to be o k to be funny without losing face but he acknowledged that the general prejudice was that no one except a clown would condescend to crack a joke in public what are some of your favorites from this period \? the shanghai writer xu zhuodai , who went by the pen name master of the broken chamber pot studio , was a master of farce and a trickster extraordinaire hes a good one for hoaxes ye qianyus pioneering comic strip mr wang is inspired works by lao she , lin yutang and lu xun are justifiably famous and one major discovery was a series of essays curated by qian zhongshus teacher wen yuanning in 1934 , short profiles of public figures , like one whose real profession is to be a celebrity what does this history tell us about xi jinpings china , which doesnt seem very funny \? xis regime is pretty grim , so it makes headlines when he cracks a joke the chinese state has attempted to employ humor for a charm offensive , but its behavior is mostly repressive still , there are plenty of parallels to the period i discuss one concerns how humor makes use of , and is shaped by , available media publishing a newspaper became cheaper in the late qing , and you got lots of ads , essays and poetry followed quickly by parodies of the same likewise , photoshop and digital platforms have made it cheap and popular to create and circulate all sorts of spoofs , or egao you see similar types of wordplay when the qing collapsed in 1911 , yuan shikai seized power his family name is a homonym for ape yuan so ape became president yuans meme you find the same type of wit in the code words and puns used today to evade censorship bots , or just for fun like the chinese title of the 2016 german horror film friend request fei si bu ke which means certain death and sounds like facebook you also get joking communities the website lets have fun , for example , allows you to cut and paste preset icons and add your own text to create a comic strip back in the day , depressed qing writers would share self mocking doggerel verse in the newspaper now , people share their frustrations and embarrassments online the internet is rife with mockery too anonymous netizen pile ons are familiar , but mockery can also be a media strategy for enhancing celebrity chinese cultural icons and writers as diverse as li ao in taiwan , wang shuo and han han have made outbursts of vituperation part of their shtick predictably , unpredictability tells the public watch this space ! eighty years ago , wu zhihuis salty tongue had journalists trailing after him for his latest quip or gaffe hed be at a university to give a speech and when he pulled it out of his pocket all his change would come out then wu and the principal would spend five minutes picking his pennies off the floor so wu was catnip to the press in the 1930s , one writer said that wu was remarkable in the sense of being uncouth and yet that very uncouthness has become an attraction in itself sounds oddly familiar next year , my colleague bruce rusk and i will be coming out with another work that speaks to concerns of today its a translation of a ming dynasty story collection called the book of swindles
before this month , new balance was lucky if it generated a few hundred reactions to posts on its facebook page now , the sneaker companys page is flooded with impassioned commentary , and it has found itself compelled to make a statement distancing itself from white supremacists it started , when matt lebretton , the companys vice president for communications , told the wall street journal last week that we feel things are going to move in the right direction under donald j trump mr lebrettons comments were made in the context of mr trumps opposition to the trans pacific partnership , a trade deal that new balance says will hurt its production of shoes in the united states while rewarding competitors that make more of their products overseas some consumers , however , saw that comment as a full throated endorsement of mr trump and reacted immediately , circulating images that showed new balance shoes being burned or thrown in the trash that led the brand to clarify its position through a statement in which it noted that it publicly supported the trade positions of hillary clinton , bernie sanders and donald trump prior to election day that focused on american manufacturing job creation it also posted a statement to facebook saying , from the people who make our shoes to the people who wear them , we believe in acting with the utmost integrity and we welcome all walks of life but that was only the start over the weekend , the daily stormer , a website rife with anti semitic , anti gay hate speech and white supremacist language , derided the complaints and championed new balance as the official shoes of white people , encouraging readers to buy them \( in a blog post last year , the southern poverty law center , described the daily stormer as the newest up and comer in the heated competition to rule the hate web \) the ensuing support from white supremacists and other members of what is known as the alt right , led new balance to distance itself from such commentary and address the nature of its remark about mr trump new balance , based in boston , wrote on its twitter and facebook pages on monday night that it does not tolerate bigotry or hate in any form and that a recent comment about trade policy was taken out of context it added , as a 110 year old company with five factories in the u s and thousands of employees worldwide from all races , genders , cultures and sexual orientations , new balance is a values driven organization and culture that believes in humanity , integrity , community and mutual respect for people around the world on facebook , the post has attracted more than 5 , 000 reactions and hundreds of comments , some lauding the company and others from supporters and detractors of mr trump criticizing its response the company did not immediately respond to requests for comment on tuesday the daily stormer responded with a claim that new balances denouncement was a hoax , in a post on tuesday that turned into an anti semitic rant

los angeles porsche or tesla \? the valet asks the question hastily , humbly , eyes not quite meeting those of the contemplative man standing before him frank ocean has been staying at this secluded hotel here for a while now , long enough that when the valet spies him coming down the front path , he knows the routine on this night , its the tesla , the model x s u v with the gull wing rear doors inside , the dash looks like the helm of a spaceship , with a center console map display bigger than an ipad that , once on the road , mr ocean never consults its been more than a year since hes had a steady home most of his beloved cars are in storage he moves from city to city , hotel to hotel in a couple of days , hell be in new york , looking for an apartment a day after that , hell turn 29 four years ago , he released channel orange , a clever , sinuous , supremely confident deconstruction of contemporary soul , and announced that his first love had been with a man in the subsequent months , he was nominated for six grammys , performed at the ceremony and toured the world and then , he was gone not quite a full disappearance , but something like it what had appeared to be the beginning of a stunning ascent instead curled into a question mark finally , this past august , mr ocean returned , and with a bounty a visual album streaming online , endless , followed by another digital album , blonde , complemented by a glossy magazine , boys dont cry , distributed at pop up shops in four cities but apart from a lighthearted note and a couple of photos posted on his tumblr , mr ocean didnt speak publicly having emerged from the ether with fanfare , mr ocean returned to it quietly , his mystery intact not that you would be able to sense the swirl of curiosity that surrounds him by his demeanor during conversations over two days last month edited excerpts are below he was preternaturally calm , consistently forthright , reflexively self aware , and wryly funny this has been the case for years it made him something of an outlier when he emerged as part of the rabble rousing odd future collective , and an outlier still when he catapulted into pops top ranks , a group of people not much given to pensive remove over the past three years , his absence from the pop troposphere a void interrupted only by the occasional collaboration , tumblr post or paparazzi shot has felt like a position statement against celebrity culture , while simultaneously guaranteeing that mr oceans fame , turbo boosted by fervent curiosity , would grow even wider his exile began in earnest in 2013 he was living here , in a glass walled apartment high over sunset and vine , with a panoramic view of south los angeles but the city was choking him people had stolen money from him there were physical sorts of things going on in the streets and he grew concerned about the management of his affairs it started to weigh on me that i was responsible for the moves that had made me successful , but i wasnt reaping the lions share of the profits , and that was problematic for me i had , in the midst of all of this , this feeling of isolation , he added within my circle , there was a lot of places i thought i could turn that i felt like i couldnt turn to anymore so he left , hopping a plane to london , a city where he barely knew anyone , with only a duffel bag full of clothes and a backpack carrying the precious hard drives holding all of his music theres a fine line between a sane escape and running away did you feel you were on one side or the other of that \? i never thought about it like that i always thought about it like , if your house is on fire , you need to get out of the house did you feel that certain things in your career also hadnt gone the way you would have liked \? certain moments were drawbacks for sure now i look at things differently , but at the time , yeah audiences in excess of five million people on national tv i was always reluctant to do those things except in cases where they had this nostalgic significance to me like performing at the v m a s , being tapped to perform at the grammys me saying yes to those things had a lot to do with how those things made me feel before i was actually in the business and just wanting to be rubbing shoulders with those people and being seen at those places i still was reluctant and sort of skeptical of those things because i questioned whether or not i was prepared i feel like the public knock on you is that you want to be anonymous , or you want to be in some kind of retreat from the spotlight sometimes im fascinated with how famous my work could be while im not so famous super envious of the fact that daft punk can wear robot helmets and be one of the most famous bands in the world , while also understanding that will never be my situation its too late its hard to articulate how i think about myself as a public figure ive gotten used to being frank ocean a lot of people stopped me on the street when i hadnt put music out in a while , literally would yell out of an uber , frank , where the album \? has dating been difficult for you in this period of increased celebrity \? i think normal would be the word , whatever that word means , which is usually nothing im in a very different place than i was four or five years ago with all that stuff different in my relationship with myself , which means everything theres no , like , shame or self loathing theres no , you know , crisis have you been in love since then , since 2012 \? not the lasting kind control is often at the forefront of mr oceans mind when he was on tour , his concerts would be recorded each night , and he would watch the tape , type up notes and email them to his team to prepare for a morning meeting when blonde and endless were being recorded , he carried the hard drives with his music in his backpack , and the backups , too id rather the plane goes down in flames and the drives go down with me than somebody put out a weird posthumous release when he answers questions , he takes meaningful pauses , mulling over premises , before answering in expansive stories paired with precise bursts of logic after bouncing around hotels in london , he moved into a furnished apartment that he eventually stripped bare of all but the essentials i just wanted to be able to walk around and not run into an end table or some useless piece of furniture he rode electric bikes around the city , made new friends which is not as difficult as celebrities make it sound went on dates he recorded in a handful of studios , including abbey road , where he asked for the studio , too , to be decluttered , removing furniture and bringing in flower arrangements piece by piece , the music that would become blonde and endless was coming together , though up until then , it had been slow going hed begun recording at electric lady in new york , but after he took a pause away from the studio , the rhythm of writing was gone i had writers block for almost a year , he said during that time , he would go to the studio , stare at the monitors and come up with nothing , or nothing that i liked that dry spell broke only after he reconnected with a childhood friend from new orleans who was going through difficult times that conversation , he said , made me feel as though i should talk about the way i grew up more he decided that he wanted blonde and endless to be more autobiographical than his earlier releases i wrote channel orange in two weeks , he said the end product wasnt always that gritty , real life depiction of the real struggle that happened so he turned inward , and backward , telling stories about his childhood , family life , and romantic relationships some frivolous , like on nikes \( he dont care for me but he cares for me and thats good enough \) some meaningful , like on self control \( wish wed grown up on the same advice \) that was written about someone who i was actually in a relationship with , who wasnt an unrequited situation , he said it was mutual , it was just we couldnt really relate we werent really on the same wavelength in places , like on ivy , he manipulated his voice to sound younger , to better capture the time he was evoking many of the new songs have two or three competing narratives different points of view participating in the same story that was my version of collage or bricolage , he said how we experience memory sometimes , its not linear were not telling the stories to ourselves , we know the story , were just seeing it in flashes overlaid on blonde , especially , you used a lot of different voices sometimes i felt like you werent hearing enough versions of me within a song , cause there was a lot of hyperactive thinking even though the pace of the albums not frenetic , the pace of ideas being thrown out is are they always multiple points of view , or are they multiple franks interrupting each other to be heard \? its the same thing to me because my point of view from one emotional state to another is a different point of view sometimes i want to talk on a song and be angry , because i am angry then theres always a part of me that remembers that this record lives past my being angry , and so do i really want to be angry about that \? is that feeling going to have longevity \? were you working toward a fixed idea on these albums \? or was it mutating and evolving as you went \? when i was making the record , there was 50 versions of white ferrari i have a 15 year old little brother , and he heard one of the versions , and hes like , you gotta put that one out , thats the one and i was like , naw , thats not the version , because it didnt give me peace yet you were reaching for something ineffable \? theyre just chords , just melodies i dont know what combination of those objects is gonna make me feel how i need to feel but i know precisely the feeling that needs to happen at the same time he was chasing a perfect feeling sound , he was trying to regain control of his business relationships he replaced his team new management , new lawyer , new publicist and he began negotiations to free himself from his contract with def jam , the label that had signed him in 2009 and effectively shelved him until his self released debut mixtape nostalgia , ultra caused a stir online in 2011 a seven year chess game is how he described the process of buying himself out of his contract and purchasing back all of his master recordings using his own money , he said as a condition of the arrangement , he said , def jam took on distribution of his next project , endless , which is available only as a streaming video album on apple music then , less than two days later , came a big surprise blonde , released independently by mr ocean \( apple music paid to host the premiere of blonde , but mr ocean said there was no ongoing relationship with apple \) this was mr oceans checkmate , an album wholly his own that took center stage blonde debuted atop the billboard album chart with the third biggest opening week of the year , behind only drake and beyonc when releasing endless and blonde , he took his time i know that once its out , its out forever , so im not really tripping on how long its taking he described his mood after the release of blonde as postpartum rather than going on a promotional tour , playing radio festivals and making the usual rounds , he spent about a month traveling china , japan , oceania , france , just around casual you solved some rather intractable business issues you recalibrated the cast of professionals who work on your career were those your main goals \? with this record in particular , i wanted to feel like i won before the record came out , and i did , and so it took a lot pressure off of me about how the record even would perform after the fact once the goal is met , everything else is lagniappe its not essential for me to have a big debut week , its not essential for me to have big radio records what about the data side , the numbers , the sales \? i know exactly what the numbers are i need to know i need to know how many records ive sold , how many album equivalents from streaming , which territories are playing my music more than others , because it helps me in conversations about where were gonna be playing shows , or where i might open a retail location , like a pop up store or something do you feel like the numbers are commensurate with what you thought they would or should be \? well , we doubled channel orange first week im always gonna be like , we could have done a little bit better i guess theres a satisfaction that comes with looking at numbers like that , and im making , like , no limit type of equity , master p type of equity on my record and there have been accolades , too in 2013 , mr ocean won two grammys , and he has been nominated since , but come february , he will not win any , because he chose not to submit his music for consideration that institution certainly has nostalgic importance , he said it just doesnt seem to be representing very well for people who come from where i come from , and hold down what i hold down he noted that since he was born , just a few black artists have won album of the year , including quincy jones , herbie hancock and ray charles though mr ocean said the grammys reached out to his representatives , he never spoke with them directly before making his decision i think the infrastructure of the awarding system and the nomination system and screening system is dated , he said id rather this be my colin kaepernick moment for the grammys than sit there in the audience this willingness to remove himself from a situation not designed for him to thrive in is perhaps mr oceans greatest gift his backbone is firm though he still publishes emotional decrees on tumblr from time to time his note on the death of prince was heart rending he largely avoids social media his twitter is gone usually a handful of trusted colleagues , friends or family members make him aware of things he might need or want to know \( it was his agent who told him about kanye wests recent grammy related speech on his behalf \) he is as much refusenik as artist what he does may be less important than what he chooses not to do and moving forward , what he may choose not to do is release an album without a visual component , or even release something album length at all because im not in a record deal , i dont have to operate in an album format , he said i can operate in half a song format or he might devote less time to music i believe that im one of the best in the world at what i do , and thats all ive ever wanted to be , he said its more interesting for me to figure out how to be superior in areas where im nave , where im a novice a few weeks ago , he was flying back from washington with his mother after a white house state dinner , where he had been one of president obamas guests mr ocean told her how hed been poking around the visual arts degree offerings at the new school , thinking about what it would take to begin to learn and refine a new craft oh , you dont have time to do that , she told him and he replied , mom , im rich ! hes laughing now after a long drive , the tesla is parked behind an anonymous recording studio , where hes about to go work on new music i wasnt trying to flex up on my mom , he said rather , it was a personal service announcement to me , to just be like wait , look at your position , you have the luxury of choice now hes finished laughing , back in control this has always been my life and no one elses , he said , and thats how its always been since the day i came in it
beijing the founder of a chinese brand of high tech toilets called trump said he had no intention of soiling the name of americas next president zhong jiye , the founder , said he had not heard of donald j trump when he registered the english name of his company , shenzhen trump industrial company limited , as a trademark in 2002 in chinese , the company name means innovate universally , he said , highlighting how the toilet seats warm and wash the users backside that chinese name , he explained , also sounds a little like trump we really didnt know of this person called trump , mr zhong said in a telephone interview from the southern chinese city of shenzhen it was entirely a coincidence in the united states , mr trumps name has adorned ties , steaks , water and other products in china , it is found on computers , cosmetics , even leather goods the difference many such chinese products dont have the president elects permission of the 46 registered trademarks under the trump name in china , 29 appear to be owned by mr trump , based on data with the countrys trademark office at least 14 companies not associated with mr trump applied for the trump trademark in 2015 and 2016 alone , according to itaotm , a chinese commercial trademark website the situation highlights the difficulties that big brands and celebrities face as they navigate the countrys relatively new trademark laws in china , trademarks are generally awarded to those who are first to file with the government that has given rise to a crush of people registering the names of well known brands , in a practice known as trademark squatting many western companies like apple and starbucks have been caught up in long legal battles to win the right to use their names in china in may , a chinese company won the right to sell its leather goods under the iphone trademark after years of legal wrangling with apple michael jordan lost the rights to the name he is known by in china new balance paid 16 million in damages for what a court said was the illegal use of the chinese name for the company , which a person had trademarked its very difficult to prove bad faith , said matthew dresden , a lawyer with harris moure in seattle who specializes in chinese intellectual property law its very hard to prove that your name is well known at the time that the application is filed mr trump has fought at least once to get his name back in 2015 , he lost a legal battle against a businessman in the northern province of liaoning , dong wei , to prevent him from using the trump name for a construction company , according to a website run by chinas supreme court then the decision was reversed a notice issued on chinas trademark office website on sunday said that mr trumps trademark had been granted preliminary approval for use in construction services the wall street journal reported the decision on monday alan garten , general counsel of the trump organization , did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment mr trump isnt the first world leader wrapped up in a name dispute in china in 2004 , the countrys government officials were not favorably inclined when a chinese businessman tried to register the chinese name of former president george w bush for a brand of disposable diapers the officials said the application was likely to be rejected because it may bring about bad social impact if a leaders name is registered as a trademark , according to state media mr zhong , of the toilet maker shenzhen trump , said he had not received a challenge from mr trump or his company still , he said , he will never give up his trademark easily , if mr trump decides to sue litigating is his right , mr zhong said but we will let the government make its judgment we believe the countrys laws will protect businesses like us mr zhong said he approved of mr trumps courageous style and spirit of reform he also liked mr trumps innovative ideas when asked about the criticism directed toward mr trump in the united states , mr zhong said , democratic countries are like that i think a transformation is not bad at all
the clock has started for one of the most eagerly awaited market debuts of 2017 that of snapchat , the popular messaging service the social networks parent , snap inc , has filed confidentially to go public , with an eye toward being valued at more than 30 billion , people briefed on the matter said tuesday that would make snap the third most valuable technology company at the time of its market debut , after alibaba and facebook the company is aiming to begin having its shares traded as soon as march , though the final timing for an offering has not been determined the confidential filing , made with the securities and exchange commission before the presidential election last week , comes amid a relative drought in the market for initial public offerings there have been 96 offerings of companies with a market value of more than 50 million in the united states so far this year , down 41 percent from 2015 , according to data from renaissance capital a successful debut of snap could help revive that market , encouraging other technology companies to go public it would be the first top tier unicorn silicon valley lingo for private companies valued at 1 billion or more to go public next year unlike uber , airbnb or the lender sofi , however , snap has a main business that is not subject to a web of government regulations that make a public listing complicated a snap share sale is also expected to eschew the complexities of previous technology initial public offerings like googles in 2004 still , like google , facebook and other tech companies , snaps recently amended corporate charter shows that a different class of stock would enable its top executives , including its co founder evan spiegel , to maintain control even after the service is publicly traded yet snap will encounter intense scrutiny from potential investors , as rivals try to encroach on its turf by copying some of the photo messaging services signature features in august , facebooks instagram rolled out its version of the snapchat stories photo and video service a spokesman for snap declined to comment on the filing , which was reported earlier by reuters founded in a stanford university dorm room in 2011 , snapchat has become a darling of the tech world , as it has grown from a simple disappearing messages service into a digital video phenomenon its lofty goal is to essentially become the online generations equivalent to television it has built up its popular stories service , in which users upload photos or videos and share them with followers and it gained new levels of popularity after rolling out features like lenses , which lets users transform their likenesses into cartoon dogs , silly faces or taco bell tacos , paid for by sponsors such has been the popularity of snapchat that media organizations have rushed to establish beachheads on the service even the white house has set up a snapchat account , and president obama has given an interview on the companys in house political show analysts have estimated that snap , which began its advertising business less than two years ago , could reach 1 billion in sales next year , up from more than 350 million this year snaps financial information will be known when its offering filing is publicly disclosed if the company decides to go ahead with a sale of its shares the confidentiality of snaps filing was made possible by the jumpstart our business start ups or jobs , act of 2012 , which permits companies with less than 1 billion in revenue to conduct much of their preparation for an i p o away from the glare of public scrutiny twitter , gopro , box and even the english soccer club manchester united have filed confidentially for stock listings in the united states in this way under the law , companies must publicly disclose their offering documents some 15 days before they start pitching the proposed share offering to prospective investors in what is known as a road show the investment banks morgan stanley and goldman sachs have been hired to lead the offering , people briefed on the matter have previously said unlike some private companies , snap has had no trouble raising money on the private markets , so investors were not given preferential treatment regarding how many shares they will get in the event of a public offering , according to corporate documents filed in delaware this sets snap apart from offerings from square and box both of those companies had to give some of their private investors special deals that diluted other early shareholders when square went public last november , some investors received an additional 10 3 million shares , which came at the expense of other investors similarly , when box went public in 2014 , some of the companys earlier private investors were entitled to extra shares snapchat will certainly be an indicator of whether there is a big pile of investor cash ready to go into the market , said doug bontemps , silicon valley banks managing director of corporate finance but snapchat is unique its growing quickly , is doing some interesting things with glasses and has gotten a lot of attention there arent a lot of that ilk
tinder , the popular dating app , has updated its options to allow users to choose transgender or gender nonconforming identities the move , part of a push against persistent harassment against transgender people on the service , was hailed by community advocates as an important example for other social media platforms executives became aware of the harassment problem seven months ago , according to sean rad , the chief executive of tinder he said the abuse took two main forms transgender users being verbally attacked by people they matched with , and transgender users being reported as abusive themselves by people on the merits of who they were and not necessarily what they were saying or doing those abuse reports meant that transgender people were often blocked from the service by the sites algorithm if youre reported a certain number of times , youre in the penalty box , he said the move to let transgender users identify themselves as such is meant to let them interact with people who are more accepting of who they are , mr rad said the company has taken other steps , too , including training its staff in how to deal with reports of harassment of transgender people the company previously allowed users to pick from one of two genders either man or woman but will now let them choose from almost 40 options , including transgender woman , transgender man , transmasculine , two spirit , neutrois , non binary and other if none of those fit , users can write in their own the update , which was released on tuesday , was designed in consultation with transgender community leaders and other prominent transgender people , including the activists andrea james and nick adams and several entertainers connected to the award winning amazon show transparent , like the actress trace lysette , the musician our lady j and zackary drucker , a producer on the show gender categories are expanding , said ms drucker , who called the update a reflection of changing social attitudes toward transgender people we are a part of the world , and we date ms drucker and ms james said they hoped the update would make it easier and safer for transgender people to look for love transgender people face far higher rates of violence than the general population , in particular transgender women of color , and ms james said that in romantic situations theres a stereotype that we are trying to deceive people dating for trans people is generally safer via an app like tinder , ms james said i find it much safer to make connections online versus having a stranger approach me in a cafe or bar ms drucker said disclosing ones trans status is always stressful because of the fear of rejection or violence that is why some people prefer to come out as transgender via text message rather than face to face , she said creating a safe space where a person can swipe right or left , seems like a hassle free and safe method of allowing trans people to exist without being shamed for their difference , ms drucker said mr rad said the least visible but most impactful element of the update was one he hoped could also be used to crack down on other forms of harassment on the service , especially the sexual harassment of women he described that goal as ending locker room talk we completely rewrote and reworked out entire user moderation algorithm and tools , he said were now more than ever able to detect harassment and prioritize the queue and inquiries about harassment and react very quickly to ban users who are being harassing the push against harassment on tinder comes as other social media platforms have struggled to respond to abuse on their services twitter , in particular , has been increasingly criticized by users as a den of anti semitic , racist and misogynist abuse ms drucker called the monthslong project of responding to tinders problem of harassment against transgender people an example of inclusion and said she hoped it would serve as a model for other technology companies tinder is the worlds most popular dating app it bills itself more chastely as an app for meeting new people and says that 26 million new matches are made each day , for a total of 20 billion matches since it launched in 2012 as such , mr rad said he thought the company had a responsibility to shield its users from vitriol part of the problem is a lot of tech platforms try to stay out of complex issues because they dont want to alienate any of their users , mr rad said for us its very important to come in and particularly now given whats going on in the world , with all the division in the world , its particularly important to step in and make a statement of inclusivity and acceptance
phil jacksons description of lebron jamess business partners as his posse in an interview published by espn on monday drew an angry response from james , who took offense at the racial connotation of the word the dispute between jackson , the knicks president , and james , who plays for the cleveland cavaliers and is one of the n b a s most visible players , also left knicks forward carmelo anthony in the uncomfortable position of having to answer questions about a sudden feud involving one of his bosses and one of his good friends the espn interview was a wide ranging q and a in which jackson talked about the state of the knicks , the criticism of his management of the team , and his relationship with anthony but james took exception with jacksons description of the group of friends who travel and work with him as his posse james and maverick carter , his close friend and business partner , both took offense at jacksons use of the word carter told espn com he was bothered because of the idea that jackson said it because james and his friends are young and black , he can use that word james said he had lost respect for jackson as a result of the comments we see the success that we have , but then there is always someone that lets you know how far we still have to go as african americans , james told reporters in cleveland i dont believe that phil jackson would have used that term if he was doing business with someone else and working with another team or if he was working with anybody in sports that was owning a team that wasnt african american and had a group of guys around them that didnt agree with what they did i dont think he would have called them a posse but it just shows how far we have to go but it wont stop us from doing what we need to do as a group james , carter and two other high school friends , rich paul and randy mims , founded l r m r management company a decade ago the agency handles marketing and representation duties for james and other n b a players the company has been successful since its inception , positioning james as one of the top athletes turned entrepreneurs of his generation in the espn interview , jackson , responding to a question about jamess decision to leave the miami heat , and whether he could imagine magic johnson leaving pat riley and the los angeles lakers or michael jordan leaving jackson and the chicago bulls , turned his response back around to james when lebron was playing with the heat , they went to cleveland and he wanted to spend the night , jackson told espn com they dont do overnights teams just dont so now spoelstra a reference to the heat coach , erik spoelstra has to text riley and say , what do i do in this situation \? and pat , who has iron fist rules , answers , you are on the plane , you are with this team you cant hold up the whole team because you and your mom and your posse want to spend an extra night in cleveland jackson did not respond to jamess remarks tuesday he left knicks practice without speaking to members of the news media and did not respond to an email while posse is defined as a group of friends or associates , keith gilyard , a professor of english and african american studies at penn state , said he could understand why james took offense the cultural definition of the word has shifted toward defining drug cartels or , in cultural terms , the group of hangers on that surround a celebrity what were talking about is a rhetorical moment , and one of the things thats interesting about rhetoric is sort of the study of who can say what to whom and under what conditions or can say what whom and under what conditions , gilyard said the word in and of itself is never neutral it never means the same in all contexts and when the word is used publicly , as by jackson , instead of in a private conversation , its connotation changes , gilyard said when you have an official or executive that uses that language that makes its way into mainstream circulation , it has a different meaning , he added meaning shifts depending on contexts with jackson unavailable , it left anthony , a close friend of jamess , to answer questions about the subject anthony agreed that he considered posse a loaded term , and he said that he would not want his group of friends or family to be referred that way but anthony declined to ascribe any assumptions or intent to jackson do i think he meant it any kind of way \? anthony said i really dont know i dont think he did i would hope that he didnt sometimes phil just says things and he says the first thing that comes to mind and then probably is in his office right now regretting it i dont know when it comes to phil , you just never know whats going to be said , whats coming out it depends on whos listening people take it the right way or people take it the wrong way you just never know when it comes to phil i just dont understand him talking about lebron right now , in november i dont understand that

bangkok many expected there would be tears at the rajamangala national stadium on tuesday when thailand played australia in a world cup qualifier only a month after the death of the host countrys much loved king but it was a little surprising that they came at the end of the 90 minutes the national anthem accompanied by images on the video scoreboard of the monarch , king bhumibol adulyadej , attending soccer related events was sung with somber gusto a crowd that had once been told that cheering would not be allowed instead offered loud , appreciative support but it was only after the final whistle that thailands coach , kiatisuk senamuang , could not hold back his emotions any longer , shedding tears after his team , which had lost all four of its group stage games , had fought australia , the reigning asian champion , to a 2 2 tie it was emotional , kiatisuk said i want to thank the king , and i want to thank the fans and media for getting behind us all the way i am just disappointed we could not get the 3 points , but this 1 point can bring happiness to the thai people australia has been a member of the asian football confederation \( a f c \) since 2006 , but its trip to thailand presented perhaps its most unusual match the a f c did not exist when king bhumibol took the throne in 1946 , and with the government initiating an official yearlong period of mourning after his death in october , tuesdays match almost did not go ahead after king bhumibols death , the countrys professional soccer league ended its season with three games left to play , with final positions settled by whatever ranking each club held at the time there were calls to play the qualifier against australia behind closed doors or in a neighboring country on oct 21 , it was announced that the match would go ahead , but with no cheering permitted on nov 3 , that restriction was lifted , replaced by calls for respectful behavior i think it is important we pay respect to the people of thailand due to the passing of the king and understand that it is a difficult time for the whole country , coach ange postecoglou of australia said as visitors here , we are mindful that while there is a game of football to be played , there are more important things to be addressed with the end of the first month of mourning passing just before the game , the public intensity for it in bangkok had seemed to drop perceptibly the passengers on bangkoks metropolitan rapid transit system were still not dressed as colorfully as usual , and they occasionally bowed to the in train video monitors showing scenes of the kings life but slowly , life also was returning to normal public television stations were able to show commercials again the annual loy krathong festival had gone ahead the previous day , albeit without the usual fireworks and it was announced that christmas and new year celebrations could proceed as well , but with the entertainment levels toned down , out of respect in soccer , however , it is difficult for fans to tone anything down an official at the football association of thailand acknowledged that once it was announced that the game was on , there was never a possibility of enforcing a no cheering policy , especially with about 2 , 000 australian supporters both visitors and expats expected to attend as it was , there was a smattering of jeers from the blue shirted home fans before kickoff when the traveling supporters , some of whom wore black ribbons on their gold australia shirts , started a chant , but generally the atmosphere was genial while the traffic was typically terrible , with the usual motorcycle taxis ferrying fans from the nearest , but still distant , stations , fans sat on the grass outside the concrete stadium , receiving candles to light before kickoff there were still bottles of beer being drunk , but the prematch atmosphere was a little more subdued than usual , with some supporters all in black even if most still sported the usual blue we respect thailand and the fact that the king has passed away , said michael huckle , who was visiting from melbourne but he added that he was happy the restrictions on cheering had been lifted that was , he said , never realistic once the game starts , the emotion flows , especially when you score a goal , he said football is not tennis it is built on emotion the thai players were offered a bonus by their soccer associations president , somyot poompanmoung , of 10 million baht \( about 280 , 000 \) if they defeated australia i know that anything can happen in the match , but i want them to play with their heart , somyot said i dont want them to play for money i want them to play for his majesty the king it was a tall order thailands team may be improving , but australia is one of the continents powerhouses , and when mile jedinak , who plays his club soccer in england , put the visitors ahead with a penalty after nine minutes , the day was looking ominous yet thailand , with a fully domestic based roster , responded with two goals from the hugely popular striker teerasil dangda a famous win was in the cards until a second , hotly disputed penalty kick in the 65th minute , again converted by jedinak , gave the socceroos a tie it was the least thailand deserved thailand played really well , postecoglou , australias coach , said we knew that in these special circumstances , they would play with a lot of passion , and they did just that the home fans applauded the players off the field , the journalists applauded the coach into the news conference , and both were applauded back into the emerald hotel by hundreds of happy supporters when they returned there after the game we wanted to put a smile back on the faces of thai fans , and we did , said kiatisuk , who added that he and his team were not giving up on dreams of qualifying for the 2018 world cup despite taking just 1 point in their first five games it is not over , he said there are five games left and three at home we played well against a strong team we still have hope

it has been said before but it bears repeating twitters biggest problem is twitter when the social media site was created , its founders thought it could be the water cooler or town hall for the world it was a nice thought what they probably never anticipated was that twitter would become a meeting place for all sorts of people you would never want to meet at the water cooler even in its early days , tech writers used twitter to call one another out about their coverage who got what story first and why they got it all wrong was it juvenile \? of course but it was usually harmless what happens on twitter today , critics would argue , isnt so harmless from racist trolls to terrorist recruiting to gaslighting todays popular way to describe lying so often that people cant quite tell the truth anymore twitter has some serious issues but give twitter credit for one thing its executives realize they have a problem on tuesday , the company outlined new ways to report or hide offensive content in related news , google said on monday that it planned to crack down on fake news sites that rely on its adsense advertising network to turn fabrication into a profit making venture that both companies are taking a hard look at how their services are being misused shined a harsh light on facebook , where mark zuckerberg , the chief executive , dismissed the companys problem with fake news posts , despite the reported misgivings of some of his own employees but by late monday night , facebook did add language to the guidelines of its ad network spelling out that fake news sites were barred from the ad network to be clear , that doesnt mean theyll disappear from facebook mr zuckerberg must run in different facebook circles than the rest of us

first experienced success in america , with rumble in the bronx , the chinese actor jet li made his first appearance in an american film , lethal weapon 4 mr li went on to become a star in his own right , and he and mr chan teamed up in 2008 for the forbidden kingdom this clip shows their fight from the film 4 mr chans abilities as an action star were not confined to fight scenes he was extraordinarily adept at navigating space in all its forms , as the video a montage of clips of free running and other types of sequences shows before mr chan was a star , he was an acrobat and a stuntman , who worked with another legend , bruce lee , on the 1972 film fist of fury in an interview with inside kung fu magazine , mr chan explained that much of his physical skill was intuitive , partly because he had started basic physical training when he was 6 or 7 years old after all those years , it becomes very natural , he said its actually very hard to tell you how i train , because i just know what to do when i lose my balance , you just know how to get it back so , this way , when i do a stunt , i do get hurt sometimes but less than some other people 5 tony zhou , the movie buff who cocreates the clips on the youtube channel every frame a painting , narrates this clip , an analysis of mr chans ability to combine action and comedy \( mr zhou declined to comment for this article \) in the clip , mr zhou illustrates mr chans depth of knowledge about film more generally , including directing and editing , commenting on his framing choices and camera angles he also elaborates on the difference between movies shot in hong kong , where mr chan was often given months to get scenes right , and those made by american directors , which sometimes obscure the actors

its a great time to get your period today girls and women are talking openly about menstruation , a topic long considered taboo they have even put periods on the public agenda , demanding free feminine hygiene products in public restrooms and tax free tampons and pads some are also challenging the methods women have used to cope with periods , rejecting disposable pads and tampons altogether instead , they are using menstrual cups , reusable pads , special underwear or nothing at all to be sure , these alternative methods of menstrual management represent just a fraction of the 19 billion global market for period products while they arent for everyone , they are catching on among some women who say the alternatives make menstruation more hygienic , less costly , more discreet and less wasteful andrea velzquez , 25 , learned about a tampon alternative the reusable menstrual cup from a friend three years ago and hasnt bought a box of tampons since the major selling point for her was cost savings menstrual cups range in price from 20 to 40 and are replaced about once a year by comparison , an annual supply of tampons and pads costs about 120 if you add it up , you end up using a good chunk of money on tampons and pads , she said while tampons and pads are designed to absorb menstrual fluid and be thrown away , the cup is made of flexible silicone and is worn inside the vagina to catch menstrual blood the cup is emptied , washed and reinserted twice a day the cup also appeals to ms velzquez because its discreet she no longer has to walk home with a big box of tampons in a clear white bag or hide tampons up her sleeve especially once i entered the work force , i remember finding a way to sneakily bring them into the bathroom , she said carinne chambers , co founder and chief executive of diva international , which makes the divacup , said most consumers seem to learn about menstrual cups from one another a lot of women think theyre relatively content with their options because its all theyve ever known , ms chambers said theyre not necessarily looking for something new other options include reusable cloth products , including thinx period underwear , a moisture wicking , absorbent underwear that is washed and reused and is sold for 15 to 40 cloth pads , like those sold by lunapads and gladrags , consist of a holder and a set of absorbent fleece inserts which should be changed every two to six hours because they are made of breathable material , they resist strong odors the companies also sell small carrying pouches with separate compartments for used and fresh inserts reusable pads cost 15 to 20 nora lovotti , 27 , was intrigued when she saw ads for thinx period underwear on the new york city subway this summer for me at this point , i take birth control , and my period is relatively light , she said i was getting to the point where i felt like tampons were kind of excessive thinx markets its underwear as either an alternative to or a backup for disposable feminine products made with rayon or bleached cotton they are made up of three layers an external nylon layer a moisture wicking , antimicrobial , absorbent and leakproof gusset and an inner layer of cotton some women opt for reusable products because they worry about long term exposure to the chemicals in bleached products others are concerned about toxic shock syndrome , a rare bacterial infection associated with superabsorbent tampon use for ms lovotti , the risk of toxic shock , although very low , still nagged at her i did have a friend in college who had toxic shock , she said in the back of my mind , i was always concerned thinx also has gained attention on social media because it has featured sawyer devuyst , a transgender male model in its ad campaign mr devuyst said that , for about five years between his coming out as transgender and beginning hormone therapy , he continued to menstruate while changing a pad or a tampon in a mens room might cause embarrassment or even endanger a transgender man , wearing period boyshorts that resemble boxer briefs might make an alienating process a little easier , mr devuyst said a lot of people dont realize that some men do get their periods because its just not talked about , mr devuyst said in a video a more extreme rejection of mainstream period products comes in the form of free bleeding the method gained attention when the musician kiran gandhi crossed the finish line at the 2015 london marathon in bloodstained leggings she had gotten her period the night before and decided that a tampon would be too uncomfortable to wear through the race , and she used the moment to make a statement i ran with blood dripping down my legs for sisters who dont have access to tampons and sisters who , despite cramping and pain , hide it away and pretend like it doesnt exist , ms gandhi wrote on her blog after completing the marathon tampon free i ran to say , it does exist , and we overcome it every day maggie whalen , 24 , a longtime divacup user , said she realized that there were days during her cycle when she had a lighter flow and using the cup was irritating now on those days , she forgoes the cup entirely ive kind of started experimenting with it , she said miki agrawal , chief executive and co founder of thinx , said that new interest in alternative menstrual hygiene is part of more accepting attitudes about periods as a natural biological function women now look at their uterine lining and really feel empowered by it rather than shamed by it , said ms agrawal
al shihr , yemen when fighters from al qaeda seized control of a stretch of southern yemen in 2015 , they looted millions of dollars from the central bank , spreading such fear that other banks shut down but during the year al qaeda reigned , al omgy brothers money exchange kept running its business here in the coastal town of al shihr it held accounts for the national oil company , disbursed salaries for the yemeni government and earned the praise of local officials for providing needed services during a tough time and if members of al qaeda wanted to open accounts , too , well , the company could not really say no , according to muhammad al omgy , who runs the money exchange with his brother , said the united states was not impressed this month , the united states treasury department designated the brothers and their company as having provided financial services to or in support of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , which is widely considered to be the terrorist groups most dangerous branch any of their assets subject to united states jurisdiction are blocked , and americans are generally prohibited from having transactions with them during an interview in his office here , mr omgy acknowledged that his company had provided financial services to al qaeda we had no other option but to comply with them , he said they were the rulers of the city but he denied the treasury departments charge that he was a qaeda member , describing his ties to the group as a business relationship that had ended they withdrew their money before they left the city , he said the case of the omgy brothers is a small but telling account of the chaos that has engulfed yemen , the southernmost country on the arabian peninsula and the arab worlds poorest state since 2011 , when protests erupted against the previous president , ali abdullah saleh , much of the state has collapsed , and armed tribes and militias have taken control of significant territory in 2014 , rebels from the north known as the houthis stormed the capital , sana , forcing the government into exile and dividing the country the houthis now control the northwest , including the capital , where they have struggled to exert authority over what remains of the government much of the south and east are held by forces backed by persian gulf nations and are nominally loyal to the exiled president , abdu rabbu mansour hadi so much upheaval has often left struggling yemenis to deal with whichever armed group has most recently taken control and so it was in april 2015 , when qaeda fighters seized territory along yemens southern coast and turned to the omgy brothers for their banking needs mr omgy was so upset by the charge against him that he invited an employee of the new york times to his office in al shihr to tell his side of the story his headquarters bore testament to the businesss success , with green marble floors , comfortable sofas and central air conditioning a luxury in a country where millions struggle to find enough food , much less power to charge their phones three new lexus sport utility vehicles were parked outside the brothers opened their first money exchange in 1990 and now have 95 offices across yemen that work like banks , holding accounts and performing inexpensive money transfers , mr omgy said i received the news from social media and news sites , mr omgy said of the americans designation of him as a qaeda member i have never financed qaeda activities nor joined the organization he did , however , acknowledge doing the groups banking after the militants seized the area , the brothers closed their offices , he said , but reopened because none of the banks would the local branch of yemens national oil company maintained an account , as did the civilian council that helped run local affairs even the government relied on the company to get salaries to its employees , according to yemeni officials the united states said in its designation that a qaeda official in charge of taxation had held an account with al omgy from which he sent money to militants around yemen it also said that early this year al qaeda ordered the oil company to transfer more than 1 million to al omgy to support terrorist activities mr omgy said he had been forced to give the militants accounts we opened the accounts when they threatened us , he said then , to pay their taxes , the oil company and local businessmen would ask al omgy to transfer money from their accounts to those of al qaeda he denied that the company had paid al qaeda a 10 percent commission on all transactions , as the united states also charged , but said that individual qaeda members could have transferred money through the company we have branches everywhere , he said we could not reject their orders he dismissed the rest of the united states charges , that he had smuggled arms for al qaeda and that his brother had raised funds for the iraqi insurgency i have neither political nor religious affiliations , he said staying open had been the only way the company could provide services for others , he said , including the yemeni government , which the united states considers an ally against al qaeda the government asked us to turn to al omgy , said saeed bahmran , who works for the education ministry in al mukalla , a nearby city also seized by al qaeda al omgy has branches everywhere , and we can get our salaries at anytime , even at midnight mohammed sharem , the director of the local branch of the national oil company during al qaedas control , said , our relationship with al omgy is strong and it is an excellent company he said government owned gas stations deposited their profits directly into the oil companys account with al omgy , and kept doing so after yemeni forces pushed al qaeda out in april 2016 after the designation , the governor of hadramawt province blasted the decision in a statement , saying the omgy brothers had stood with the sons of the province during the hardest and most complicated times mr omgy is unsure how the designation , which the americans made in cooperation with the united arab emirates , will affect his business , as he has no assets in either country but he is looking for ways to challenge a decision that he says has tarnished his name its effects may have already hit others a soldier with the local force supported by the united arab emirates in southern yemen said that so many of his colleagues used to get their salaries through al omgy that the company would deliver the cash to their base to prevent backups at its branches but last month , their pay did not come this is the first time they havent paid our salaries , said the soldier , who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being associated with a company associated with al qaeda
moscow president vladimir v putin of russia and president elect donald j trump spoke by telephone for the first time on monday , agreeing to review what both consider the poor state of relations between the two countries , according to a statement from the kremlin the two agreed on the absolutely unsatisfactory state of bilateral relations , said the statement , and they both endorsed the idea of undertaking joint efforts to normalize relations and pursue constructive cooperation on the broadest possible range of issues the issues discussed included trade and economic ties as well as combating terrorism mr putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate mr trump last wednesday , sending him a telegram about an hour after he had emerged the victor , but the two men have not met nor had they spoken previously mr putin repeated the congratulations over the phone the russian president said he hoped that moscow could build a collaborative dialogue with washington on the bases of equality , mutual respect and noninterference in the others internal affairs , the release said the two men also discussed syria in the context of the need to work together in the struggle against the no 1 common enemy international terrorism and extremism , the statement said although mr putin maintained studied neutrality during the presidential race , the state run news media , which answers to him , clearly pulled for mr trump among other issues , mr putin blames hillary clinton , then secretary of state , for the mass demonstrations that greeted his return to the presidency in 2012 after mrs clinton lost , the flagship state television news broadcast took to referring to her as the blonde woman during the campaign , senior united states security officials accused russia of hacking the computers at the democratic national committee headquarters and releasing emails that proved embarrassing to the clinton campaign mr putin denied any state role in the hacking the russian government was one of the few around the world that was openly gleeful about the american election result , with members of the state duma , the lower house of the russian legislature , breaking into applause at the announcement the united russia party , loyal to mr putin , dominates the duma mr trump and mr putin developed something of a mutual admiration society during the election , particularly after mr trump suggested that crimea , which moscow annexed from ukraine , should belong to russia and that the united states should ally itself with russia and the syrian government of president bashar al assad to fight the islamic state mr trump also suggested the united states might dilute its support for nato , which russia considers a main threat much of the brief statement from the kremlin about the telephone call echoed previous statements that mr putin had made about his goals for relations with washington , including a return to pragmatic , mutually beneficial cooperation mr putin openly endorses the idea that the world should return to the era when two superpowers assumed a general responsibility for global stability and security some analysts , however , have suggested that mr trump is unpredictable and the traditional republican penchant for painting russia as a dire threat could still emerge the putin administration is hoping that the west will lift sanctions imposed over the crisis in ukraine on the phone call , which the kremlin said was arranged by mutual consent , the two men agreed to stay in contact and to meet at an unspecified date in the future earlier , mr trump described the note on his victory that he received from mr putin as beautiful for its part , russia has continued its glowing tributes to mr trump as a paragon who triumphed in what is repeatedly depicted in the russian media as the swamp of american politics the main weekly news program on state television every sunday night tends to focus mainly on the united states , with dmitry kiselyov , the anchor , suggesting this week that europe follow the american lead in replacing its leaders under president trump , mr kiselyov said , the american government would finally drop what the russian anchor called its annoying slogans about human rights and democracy russia has a lot of trust in trump , he said
lake baikal , russia yury azhichakov set out early by bike for senogda bay , his favorite beach , on the northwestern shore of lake baikal in siberia the worlds oldest , deepest and most voluminous lake , baikal holds 20 percent of the planets unfrozen freshwater it is often described as the worlds cleanest lake as mr azhichakov discovered , that is no longer the case senogdas once pristine sands were buried under thick mats of reeking greenish black goo this stuff stretched far into the distance , for several kilometers , said mr azhichakov , 61 , a retired ecological engineer the beach was in terrible condition the muck , scientists have discovered , follows mass algal blooms at dozens of sites around lake baikals 1 , 240 mile perimeter confined to shallow water and shores near towns and villages , the problem seems to stem from an influx of untreated sewage the result of inadequate wastewater treatment algal blooms threaten iconic freshwater bodies around the world , including the great lakes , lake geneva , and lake biwa in japan but lake baikal is especially precious a world heritage site home to more than 3 , 700 species , more than half found nowhere else people are dumping sewage , waste and rubbish around the lake , creating pretty appalling conditions in some places , said anson mackay , an environmental scientist at university college london runoff from fertilizers and other pollutants leads to so called eutrophication , an excessive growth of algae these blooms eventually deplete the water of oxygen , suffocating aquatic plants and animals russian scientists had assumed that lake baikal is simply too vast to suffer such a fate , but recent growth in tourism and development seem to be changing the calculus we have a saying in russia a clever person is trained on the mistakes of others , said oleg timoshkin , a biologist at the russian academy of sciences limnological institute in irkutsk , 40 miles from baikals southwestern shore unfortunately , were now repeating the mistakes of so many other countries dr timoshkin and his colleagues have found that spirogyra , a type of green algae that had rarely grown in lake baikals shallow zones , accounts for the outbreaks in severobaikalsk , mr azhichakovs town , the researchers traced spirogyra blooms to locations downstream of the towns wastewater facility , as well as to an illegal sewage dumping site the researchers also found little difference in phosphorus and nitrogen content indicators of synthetic detergents and fecal material in treated and untreated water entering the lake and , as it turned out , russian railways had been adding industrial grade waste to the towns sewage system , overwhelming it despite remedial action , high levels of phosphorus and nitrogen in severobaikalsks wastewater persist even today , and fecal bacteria in treated wastewater have turned up at various sites around lake baikal dr timoshkins team is trying to figure out which nutrients are fueling spirogyras growth spirogyra smothers other species of algae , and thousands of empty snail shells gastropod cemeteries , as dr timoshkin calls them regularly wash up alongside the blooms but the damage is more extensive than that underwater forests of native lake baikal sponges have begun dying off in nearly 90 dives around the lake , researchers have found that 30 to 100 percent of sponges are affected in a given area the green stalks some a century old are turning a dull brown , reminiscent of cattails the cause of death is unknown , although dr timoshkin and his colleagues suspect that pathogens from sewage may be causing disease outbreaks , or that the influx of nutrients is causing symbiotic algae to vacate the sponges without intervention , the researchers believe that the environmental damage will worsen algal blooms , for instance , can produce neurotoxins that are harmful to fish and crustaceans and the humans who consume them last year , the largest algal bloom ever recorded shut down the crab and clam fisheries along the west coast of the united states along lake baikal , some locals say they can no longer drink water from their taps during blooms fishermen complain of spirogyra tangling in their nets will baikal be able to attract the same amount of tourism , which is a major part of the economy , if tourists show up and see a green lake \? said ted ozersky , a limnologist at the university of minnesota duluth in 2014 , dr timoshkin testified before the duma , russias parliament , about lake baikals problems earlier this year , he and his colleagues also published their findings in the journal of great lakes researchthey are calling for an immediate ban on synthetic detergents and for help from the federal government in reforming sewage facilities around the lake but such fixes will probably be slow to come some government officials and academics insist that the problems are caused by climate change , not pollution others blame mud volcanoes , or even say that lake baikals eutrophication is a lie made up by scientists to gain funding russias ministry of natural resources and the environment has yet to formally acknowledge that the lakes health is in question at all one of the tragedies of baikal is that top level , senior scientists who are themselves never on a field expedition mistakenly believe that the lake can never be eutrophied because it is too huge , too pure and full of too much water , dr timoshkin said its an easy idea to have , but its wrong even as federal aid stalls , some people are attempting to address the problems where they live , organizing beach cleanups and trying to find ways to put the thousands of pounds of washed up spirogyra to use as fertilizer or material for making traditional siberian paper marina rikhvanova , an award winning environmental activist in irkutsk who helped raise initial awareness about the spirogyra outbreaks , persuaded a local investor to fund a plan for a prototype sewage treatment plant more and more people with various specialties and interests are working together for the lake , she said this , at least , is a source of optimism eutrophication , however , is not the only threat to lake baikal mongolia is planning to build up to eight hydroelectric dams on the selenga river and its tributaries , the source of 50 percent of lake baikals surface water despite hearings and protests in russia and mongolia , the mongolian government which imports around 8 percent of its energy from russia and 12 percent from china argues that the dams will help achieve energy independence and cut back on coal use some experts think there must be a better way mongolia can technically produce around 100 gigawatts of power from wind and solar in their part of the gobi desert alone about 90 times the countrys current capacity , said eugene simonov , an international coordinator with the nonprofit rivers without boundaries coalition instead , the plan is to first build dams , then to develop a huge capacity to produce thermal energy from coal , then to build the next generation of big dams to offset the negative effects of coal on the climate and then , finally , to use some of the proceeds to build true renewables researchers predict that mongolias dams would have significant ecological effects on lake baikal , including disrupting the flow of water and sediment into the lake , effecting the quality of breeding sites for birds and fish , and blocking migration routes this is likely to be yet another step toward biotic homogenization , where widely distributed , cosmopolitan species like pike increase while unique endemic species like taimen lose ground , said olaf jensen , an aquatic ecologist at rutgers university its kind of the ecological equivalent of starbucks replacing the local bodega heeding such warnings , china , which is funding the largest of the projects , in july froze all dam construction until mongolia and russia jointly assess potential effects on the lake this is important , but just a small step in the right direction , dr simonov said in october , however , russian and chinese tourism firms announced intentions to invest 11 billion in developing new hotels , attractions and infrastructure around the lake a plan that marianne moore , an aquatic ecologist at wellesley college , called chilling even if the project is tightly regulated by the government , im unsure whether the coastal zone could be developed sustainably without harming it , she said nutrient pollution from human waste and shoreline erosion will be enormous problems overshadowing the threat of pollution and dams , however , is climate change , the effects of which are already being felt at lake baikal summer surface waters lake wide have warmed about two degrees celsius since 1977 , and winter ice cover has decreased in duration and thickness compared with a century ago plankton species associated with warm water have also increased in summer months the question that many ecologists are asking now is whether the endemic , cold loving species will be able to adapt and persist if warm loving species begin increasing in abundance , dr moore said another unanswered question is how the triple stressors of pollution , dams and climate change might combine to produce even greater effects on the lake as dr moore said , correcting the problems that we do have control over will help the lake respond as best it can to climate change but that first requires acknowledging that lake baikal is absolutely ill , dr timoshkin said will we russians be able to show the world that baikal can avoid the common fate of so many other lakes \? that is a question i ask from the bottom of my heart
beijing it took all of five minutes for wang lei , a gruff veteran of the peoples liberation army , to start humming and stomping his feet the curtain had just risen on the long march , a new opera celebrating the early days of the chinese communist party , and a rifle toting chorus of performers dressed as soldiers was rushing onstage at the national center for the performing arts in beijing we come from different places , they sang as they took their places some wear straw sandals some wear gowns some are barefoot some are hungry we differ in status , but we have the same aspiration to join the red army to change the world ! mr wang , 73 , seated next to me in the upper balcony , closed his eyes in bliss these are the songs of our homeland , he told me at intermission they might be lost now , but they reflect the true feelings of the chinese people these are triumphant times for the communist party president xi jinping , the general secretary , governs with seemingly unobstructed authority the balance of power in asia and the pacific appears to be shifting in chinas favor extreme poverty , especially in rural areas , is nearing eradication and yet the communist government seems intensely vulnerable at times as it confronts a slowing economy and a society in the throes of staggering change in a country still working to find its place in the world , the party whips up nationalism as an elixir lately , it has gone into overdrive , inventing new forms of agitprop across china this fall , the party is turning the obscure anniversary of a cherished political touchstone into a cause for passionate celebration it has been 80 years , we are told again and again , since the end of the long march , the 6 , 000 mile retreat of communist forces that established maos pre eminence and gave the party its soul more than 80 , 000 people died in the march , which began in 1934 , but the bravery of the soldiers inspired generations of chinese people to rally behind the party and its leader on television , long march soap operas , documentaries and variety shows abound tour agencies offer packages retracing the soldiers routes students put on virtual reality goggles to relive famous battles joggers use a long march themed fitness app to measure their steps against the red armys in beijing , it is impossible to miss the patriotic fervor outside my office , a giant led screen flashes every few minutes with scenes from red star over china , a new mini series about the long march at home in beijing on a recent saturday night , i was bombarded with long march coverage on nearly every tv channel on one network , a troupe of child performers , dressed in gray military uniforms , sang of the power of the bright red star to shine through the generations on a financial channel , commentators offered analysis of the economic impact of the march president xi has been making the case for a new long march , using the anniversary to rally the public and warn against creeping complacency , especially among the young a nation that forgets its origins will find itself in a blind alley , he said in a speech late last month on the whole , the spirit of the propaganda campaign is unambiguous chinese citizens should seek to emulate the ideals of self sacrifice and perseverance that the soldiers of the long march embodied above all , the messaging makes clear , people should show unwavering loyalty to the communist party the long march allowed the red army to escape defeat at the hands of the kuomintang forces of chiang kai shek in southern china the communists regrouped in the north before going on to victory in the civil war in 1949 anne marie brady , a professor at the university of canterbury in new zealand , has challenged the official narrative , which portrays the march as a victory for the communists and a turning point in their efforts to win over the public pointing to testimonials of foreign missionaries captured by communist soldiers , she argues that it was instead a humiliating moment in which red army soldiers ransacked villages and abused peasants but by invoking the journey , she said , mr xi is betting that the partys idealized version of history will resonate across generations this is a heroic narrative that is meant to inspire young people in china , professor brady said xi wants to remind people what is unique and distinctive about china and to ask how did we get to where we are today \? what is this journey that were on \? what are we aiming toward \? mr xi has used the long march more expansively than his predecessors , linking it to his signature slogan of a china dream , a call to build a prosperous , more powerful nation with a deeper respect for traditional culture the propaganda might help rally the public behind the party as it asserts chinese military might abroad , in the disputed south china sea and elsewhere and the chinese government has also tried to draw connections between the long march and modern day social issues a book released in conjunction with the anniversary promotes the red armys support for gender equality \( women demand liberation ! who says they are inferior to men \?

frank lampard announced monday that he would leave new york city f c when his contract expires at the end of the year , ending his late starting and sometimes exasperating two year m l s tenure lampard , 38 , was among the first players signed by new york city f c before it joined the league for the 2015 season , and he was touted as an experienced midfield leader with a championship winning rsum but lampard spent considerable time on the sideline nursing injuries he appeared in only 31 of n y c f c s 70 matches over two seasons which made his battles with fitness , not his 15 goals , his m l s legacy it was not all nagging injuries and light jogging on the side , though when lampard played well , he could still dominate matches and find the net at one point last summer , he scored eight goals in eight games , including a hat trick against colorado on july 30 unfortunately for lampard , some fans never forgave him for delaying his arrival for n y c f c s inaugural season to finish out the 2014 15 premier league campaign at manchester city the decision was an embarrassment for all involved it was shrouded in secrecy , belatedly leaked to the news media and accompanied by the surprising revelation that lampard had not actually been under contract with m l s when he was introduced as the leagues big new signing nearly two weeks passed before lampard released a statement reaffirming his intention to join m l s by midsummer 2015 , but the damage had been done regardless of how well he would play , the doubts about his commitment to his new team and its league had been baked in on monday , in comments released by n y c f c , lampard thanked the team , his teammates and the fans i have very much enjoyed my time , he said , and i am very grateful to have had the opportunity to play for such a great club and in such an incredible city lampard is probably not the only former england international walking toward m l s s exit door los angeles galaxy midfielder steven gerrard , a former england teammate of lampards who joined the galaxy from liverpool in july 2015 , posted a photo of himself above the los angeles skyline to his instagram account on sunday with the caption , i will miss you la like lampard , gerrard , 36 , will be out of his contract at the end of the year the galaxy , who were eliminated from the playoffs in the conference semifinals a week ago , had made no official comment on gerrards future with the team
donald j trumps election victory was powered in part by forceful opposition to what he described as an economic and political system rigged against the american people for the benefit of shadowy forces in the news media , the banks and the government president elect trump and his allies often describe that system with one word globalism it is a word that conjures many images , none of them good shuttered factories , unchecked immigration and a distant cabal that , believers say , controls the economy and the media analysts who track extremist groups in the united states have expressed alarm at the use of the word by the president elect they say it carries multiple meanings from benign to sinister and often serves as a dog whistle for racist , anti semitic and antigovernment conspiracy theorists globalism is a principle driver for the fears that animate the radical right in the united states , said ryan lenz , the editor of hatewatch , a blog published by the southern poverty law center it is the enemy , ultimately globalism is often used as a synonym for globalization , the system of global economic interconnection that has been critiqued for decades by liberal groups like labor unions , environmental organizations and opponents of the international monetary fund and the world bank but for the far right , the term encapsulates a conspiratorial worldview based on racism , xenophobia and anti semitism , according to mark pitcavage , a researcher at the anti defamation league lauren southern , a host on the right wing canadian media site rebel media , explicitly rejected its use as a synonym for globalization in a video she posted online in september she said the word meant rule by autocrats such as president obama , former president george w bush and the united nations who value the false flag of diversity and unchecked immigration from the third world globalists almost always sneer down their nose at tradition , disdain national culture , laugh at religion and generally despise the west while holding a creepy affection for the third world , she added they want open borders , cheap labor and antinationalism to benefit their business and political visions , and are all too willing to shaft the little people to achieve it breitbart news , the hard right website run by stephen k bannon , mr trumps newly appointed chief white house strategist , frequently attacked globalism and so called globalist elites during mr bannons tenure there but no one may have done more to popularize the idea of a globalist conspiracy than alex jones , a far right radio host who commands an online audience of millions through his infowars media empire he has been called the most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary america by the southern poverty law center among his claims the sandy hook school massacre in newtown , conn , was a hoax and the sept 11 terror attacks were an inside job mr jones posted his own definition of globalism to youtube in 2014 in his trademark shout , he described it as a global digital panopticon control system engineered by shadowy corporate and political elites he called it the total form of slavery the host , who has enthusiastically supported mr trump , hailed the republican as a george washington level historical figure mr trump , who appeared on his show last year , has in turn heaped praise upon mr jones your reputation is amazing , mr trump said i will not let you down you will be very , very impressed , i hope and i think well be speaking a lot so what is mr trump talking about when he talks about globalism \? his spokeswoman , hope hicks , provided a definition in an email before the election last week far right groups in the united states began to refer to globalism at the end of the cold war , when it replaced communism as an idea that was an ever present danger to the nation , mr pitcavage said they have also referred to it as the new world order , and soon they saw its tentacles everywhere the shape of that conspiracy had distinctly anti semitic overtones , in part because many of communisms foes had historically seen communism as inextricably linked to judaism , mr pitcavage said members of the far right became fixated on prominent jews like the businessman and philanthropist george soros those conspiratorial beliefs were bolstered when former president george bush celebrated the end of the cold war in a 1991 speech by saying it was the dawn of a new world order his use of the phrase was taken as proof by many that a globalist conspiracy really was afoot it was very easy for them , especially because he was the one who said it , to take that ball and run with it , mr pitcavage said from that point on , the phrase became the short hand for that kind of globalism conspiracy theory the terms multiple meanings have made it a powerful political tool , and mr trumps and his allies frequent references to globalism have drawn in a wide and varied audience anti globalism is a very efficient net to unite disparate parts of the right from the mainstream to the extreme , said brian levin , the director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at california state university , san bernardino professor levin called globalism the defining folklore and narrative for the racist right but said it had also become a convenient boogeyman to explain the various declines that the united states is perceived to be in globalism was an important theme in the final weeks of mr trumps campaign , for example , when he told a rally in florida in october that his opponent for the presidency , hillary clinton , had sat at the heart of a globe spanning conspiracy with international bankers to plot the destruction of u s sovereignty the anti defamation league criticized the speech for evoking classic anti semitic themes conspiratorial talk has continued after the election mr trump referred to a plot against him again last thursday , when he complained on twitter that anti trump protests were the work of the news media and paid protesters lou dobbs , a trump ally and host on fox business news , later accused mr soros of inciting riots many on the far right have celebrated mr trumps election victory as a momentous blow against the globalist conspiracy last friday , mr jones claimed on youtube that mr trump had called him personally to thank him and his audience for their support and to offer to appear on his show again soon ms hicks , the trump campaigns spokeswoman , did not reply to an email seeking comment late sunday night mr jones then pivoted to what he thought was most important the coming destruction of the globalists that hijacked the country , primarily the news media and international business people soon they would be destroyed once and for all , he suggested this is america battling back to restore humanity and to break the chains , he said theres not gonna be any dtente we know youre scum , and were just here to let you know youre scum

as health and care leaders , we believe passionately in the nhs , one of this countrys proudest achievements since its creation in 1948 , it has constantly adapted to improve care for patients today is no different staff in health and social care do a superb job treating record numbers , but they are under pressure as our nations needs increase rapidly there are also new opportunities to improve care by making practical changes to the way the nhs works \( a e , cancer and maternity units to close in major nhs overhaul , 19 november \) the good news is that nhs bodies and local councils have come together for the first time across england to develop shared , long term proposals to improve health and care in the communities they serve , based on collaboration not competition their aim is to make real world improvements for patients making it easier to see a gp , providing more specialist care in peoples homes , speeding up the diagnosis of cancer and offering help faster to people with mental ill health the nhs has begun to set out its own stall to meet the challenges of the future we have a good plan in the five year forward view , and are beginning important conversations with the public about how to make its vision a reality through sustainability and transformation plans \( stps \) now is not the time to go back to the drawing board instead , we hope that all who value our health and care system will support local leaders getting on with theimportant task at hand sir andrew cash , dr amanda doyle , sir andrew morris , david pearson the guardian is right to expose the scandal unfolding regarding plans for the nhs in many areas of the uk local campaigners have mounted vociferous opposition to try to protect vital services such as consultant led maternity and a e many are also promoting save our beds campaigns to try to preserve hospital beds in places with poor public transport links although people are allowed to speak at local forums , or respond to glossy consultation documents , they wonder whether anyone is really listening to their concerns it feels as if there is a hidden agenda and that the lives of those who live in locations with scattered populations and poor infrastructure are not important it may be the case that jeremy hunt and the government are trying to shift the responsibility on to those working at local level , but local people know where the blame lies further investment in the nhs is vital the alternative is unthinkable the plan to save 22bn by 2020 must be abandoned gillian telford as a former nurse and now a grandmother i completely agree with cumbrian campaigner annette robson \( report , 19november \) that thousands of people , including mothers and babies , will die if further nhs cuts go ahead the feasibility examination of the policy must have told the government at least some of this it is no surprise that mothers along with other carers are taking action we are defending the children we have carried for nine months , given birth to and raised , invested our hearts and minds in , and others in our families and communities you report that theresa may told a health chief to ensure hospital closures did not become a big issue in the newspapers but she cannot hide the widespread opposition caroline barker centralised health services impose greater demands upon remaining hospitals as catchment areas and their populations increase , so do hospital workloads but there is little present evidence of any hospital having capacity to serve more people hospitals are required to have capacities to provide ambulance and a e services not only to individuals , but sometimes to large numbers of people affected by industrial accidents , large fires , multiple vehicle collisions , bridge and building collapse , storm damage , or by river or sea flooding and the additional transferred workload of a centralised hospital shutting down , not an unprecedented possibility , is clearly beyond conception the proposed centralisation , easy on paper , diminishes essential services of whatever kind and for contingencies of whatever cause , at times when immediate assistance is essential and close by james lewis when simon stevens announced the five year forward view he said it would cost 30bn he said he could make 22bn savings in this time and needed 8bn more from the government as the commons health select committee has shown , the nhs is not getting the 10bn that jeremy hunt insisted it was getting over six years and , as the bma says , savings are to be made using stps \( nhs plans may be cover for cuts , bma warns , 21 november \) hospitals are in deficit because the tariff has been set too low to cover costs and they cannot control the demand for a e services , or the flow of patients trapped in hospital because of lack of social care gps have had their share of the nhs budget cut and are buckling under the strain which increases pressure on emergency services the chief executive of nhs providers , chris hopson , told the health committee that stps would not work because there were insufficient funds thinktanks such as the kings fund and nuffield foundation also say that the nhs needs more money one would hope that a prime minister who promised to fight against the burning injustice that , if youre born poor , you will die on average nine years earlier than others would accept that the nhs and social care need more money we spend 9 9 of our gdp on health , while france and germany spend 11 if we spent another 1 we would have another 20bn each year to spend on health wendy savage so nhs england says that sustainability and transformation plans are to drive genuine and sustainable transformation in patient experience and health outcomes of the longer term what a wonderful double meaning our patient experience in north devon will be transformed alright , but not by a fairy godmother and the health outcomes will be transformed as , for example , women in labour are forced to travel for anything up to two hours to receive obstetric care the government is insulting our intelligence over social care , on which the stp sums depend so heavily , by discharging patients from hospital more rapidly \( a main source for its alleged savings \) local government was indeed allowed to increase council tax for 2016 17 by 2 for social care but that figure did not even cover the cost of the rise in the minimum wage , so was actually another cut , following six years of cuts sustainability means underfunding and transformation means cutting services the nhs is being destabilised staff will not apply for jobs at a hospital under threat we need to speak out now ruth funnell what a shame that margaret thatcher didnt live to see her successors implement her plan to dismantle the nhs \( thatcher pushed for breakup of welfare state despite nhs pledge , 25 november \) dr bob bury it was deeply disappointing to see the inaccurate reporting on proposals under the bedfordshire , luton and milton keynes sustainability and transformation plan \( report , 19 november \) our plans to date are all publicly available nowhere does it say that any a e , maternity department or indeed any other hospital service is being closed or moved we have repeatedly said that no decision about any service has been made , nor will any decision be made without full public involvement and consultation of course none of these messages make for exciting headlines but it is irresponsible and misleading for the reality that plans are in their early stages of being developed and that no decisions about any service have been made nor are they a forgone conclusion to be misrepresented this is causing unnecessary anxiety for local people and for staff our commitment is to providing the best possible health and social care services for our area we will be working hard to make sure we get clear , consistent information out to local people to ensure they are well informed and can get involved in how health and social care services are designed and delivered pauline philip theres nothing new about the inadequate provision of hospital beds in this country in miranda seymours book noble endeavours , which examines the relations between england and germany over many centuries , reference is made to the state of hospitals in 1843 berlin , with a population of 365 , 000 , offered 3 , 000 hospital beds paris with a population of 1 million offered 20 , 000 london , with an enormous population of 2 million could supply a mere 5 , 000 beds it seems we are determined to cling to victorian values john watkins i am wondering if there has been any modelling on the ability to staff those hospitals which will take over functions of hospitals being downgraded it cannot be assumed that nurses in downgraded hospitals will undertake to travel tens of miles each way or relocate nearer to their new jobs a strong reason to pilot this experiment in one area first dr john watt dr griffiths assertion \( letters , 24 november \) that for private companies profit comes before patients is correct this can be demonstrated in cambridgeshire where ent outpatient referrals were awarded to a private company by the clinical group commissioners its performance was so dire that in september it had to suspend accepting any new referrals for four weeks because of its failure to deal with waiting lists yet in 2015 the company paid out 1m in dividends , directors fees and profits money that should have been spent on patient care ian arnott a bit rich of andrew lansley \( plea for nhs funding , 25 november \) to criticise lack of extra funding for nhs in the autumn statement remind me , who was

as our south west train pulled out of busy vauxhall station , tim farron pleasant manner , daybreak coffee , preston accent set out his case for what the richmond park byelection is about any byelection , any kind of election , is about what the electorate says its about , he said we were heading for richmond station , travelling against the morning peak travel flow it was , the liberal democrats leader thought , the seventh time he had struck out for the famously handsome london suburban town since his party picked a candidate to try to boot the famously handsome zac goldsmith out of his famously handsome richmond park parliamentary seat my sense is that heathrow expansion was , of course , the big thing that everyone talked about in the first week , farron went on he had a point , of course indeed , the byelection is only happening because goldsmith chose to keep a promise he made to richmond park electors when challenging the then lib dem incumbent susan kramer during the 2010 general election campaign that he would , if elected , resign and re fight the seat as an independent should a conservative government go back on the promise that had been made by the then shiny new party leader david cameron in 2009 that if he became prime minister heathrow airport would not be expanded , no ifs , no buts but goldsmith isnt the only candidate against expansion the lib dems as a party are too and while labour appears in favour despite the reluctance of its leader , its richmond park hopeful is not farron argued that it is the seats electorate that has pushed the airport down the pecking order of issues , though given that the tories arent running a candidate , leaving the case in favour of expansion unmade in local hustings or media debate , its hard to see how it could have gone anywhere else its not off the agenda , but people dont seem to think this byelection is going to shift the dialogue on that , because all the candidates are against it , farron reasoned whereas the thing that is going to have the most lasting and significant impact on peoples lives is brexit and the nature of it , if it happens note that pregnant if the lib dems , historically super europhile and down to just eight mps , have said that unless the government promises british voters a second referendum on the deal it strikes at the end of negotiations over the terms of britains withdrawal from the european union , it will vote against the triggering of those negotiations through the formal mechanism of article 50 of the lisbon treaty with this stance , farrons party is effectively seeking to claim the 48 who voted to remain in the eu as their own thats 48 nationally , of course in the borough of richmond upon thames remain took a massive 69 3 of the vote , one of the highest shares in 60 remain backing greater london the scope for the byelection to be or be seen as being a sort of local referendum on the brexit one is down to goldsmith , representing one of the boroughs two constituencies , being a noted leaver moreover , he is one who has sustained damage to his formerly almost saintly reputation thanks to his shockingly negative and deservedly disastrous london mayor campaign just a few months ago , which sought to create anxiety over his labour rival sadiq khan being muslim it also offers the lib dems hope of recovery from its recent , miserable electoral decline goldsmiths defeat of kramer in 2010 was the start of the collapse of a strong lib dem position in this region of greater london , where the party has since lost three more of the five seats they once held to conservatives they also lost control of richmond council to the tories in 2010 kingston went the same way four years later sutton council and the parliamentary constituency of carshalton and wallington are all thats left of the old orange riviera across the capital as a whole the party has just 113 councillors out of 1 , 851 and one member of the 25 strong london assembly they are , though , taking heart from a generally increasing vote share in borough byelections since the general election and from gaining a richmond council seat in the neighbouring twickenham constituency last july with labour in parliament all over the place on brexit , farron hopes to build nationally on the big swing they secured at the witney byelection in october thats why hes been willing to trundle from vauxhall through clapham junction and putney to richmond so often outside the destination station , lib dem activists handed local commuters a four page spoof of square mile free sheet city am to alarm them on their journeys into town britains brexit black hole bellowed the front page , along with a snapshot of nigel farage and his giant gob and the news that ukip backs zac \( see page two \) on the pavement , candidate sarah olney sought engagement shes 39 , lives locally and works as an accountant at the national physical laboratory in nearby teddington , a world renowned metrology centre that means its good at measuring thing dimwits , it appears , need not apply though it was cold , olney was sunny bright despite the surrey comet richmond is in that zone of ambivalence where the metropolis and the home counties meet reporting that her husband had worked for heathrow between 2003 and 2007 on terminal 5 the lib dems say the project had already been signed off and that olneys husband has subsequently turned down work connected with plans for a third runway at the airport on the wide pavement , a man of south asian appearance with a professional manner and businesslike attire talked to olney for an animated couple of minutes about brexit and his disquiet over the goldsmith mayoral campaign , which tried to persuade hindus and sikhs to reject khan , before dashing for his train the candidate then stood with farron for a smart phone video shoot its eight days until a byelection that could change the direction of our country , her leader said next stop , a short uphill trip through avenues of elegant terraces , was the vineyard primary school , where , as young scholars scootered by , olney was told by a local woman accompanying a child for a friend that though she leaned towards conservatives shed go lib dem this time goldsmiths mayoral tactics came up again one of the schools governors told her in a friendly way that he was disappointed that an eight page lib dem publication called park life failed to mention education weve got rid of all the so called fat , he said , speaking of straining budgets weve only got people left to cut olney conceded that he had a point about the campaign literature , though she can certainly claim that she is going big on another cuts issue , the funding of the nhs the school stands near the lip of the terrace gardens on richmond hill close to the thames from where , on a clear day , you can see windsor castle down the slope in the hollyhock cafe , to a background of baby yowls and coffee machine hiss , farron and olney communed with locals , mostly women , both young and older goldsmith took 58 2 of the vote in 2015 , with more than triple the number of crosses in boxes the lib dem candidate secured in finishing second can she possibly overturn such a majority \? an opinion poll conducted near the end of october gave goldsmith 45 to olneys 22 after shed chatted with some voters i asked her what she would consider a good result naturally , she said shes going all out to win but im fairly sure that we can take a big chunk out of his majority , and i hope that would be enough to send a message if we didnt win that message would be that theresa may is going to lose seats if she pursues a hard brexit and that , with labour in disarray , its the lib dems she needs to look out for , rather than ukip much of the richmond park landscape seems timeless , with its riverside communities and royal herd of deer , but its political map is hard to read with certainty as byelection day of 1 december nears new statesmans stephen bush has written that , contrary to common belief , there is strong evidence that goldsmith has no personal vote worth talking about and that any he did have will have been weakened by his brexit stance and that toxic mayoral campaign as bush observed , richmond park contains many of the types of higher educated londoners likely to have been turned off by both this seems underlined by sadiq khans taking the lions share of second preference votes in the mayoral vote , which made his winning margin overwhelming rather than just very large the decision of the local green party to stand aside in favour of olney ought to help her too and she has made the calculation that going a bit further than her party over the article 50 vote will be another factor in her favour she says shell vote against it regardless of what it says or any promise of a second referendum and is seeking a personal mandate for doing so christian wolmar , an islingtonian running for labour from an hq in sheen lane in mortlake , takes a more flexible stance i think its a disaster that weve chosen to leave the eu , he says my instinct is that i would vote against article 50 as an mp i certainly couldnt vote for some single line bill but if there was more detail , id consider voting for it depending on what it said wolmar , who made a genuinely grassroots bid to become labours mayoral candidate , says hes encouraged by the doorstep response hes been getting in a seat where his party has become accustomed to finishing a distant thirdpeople are so pleased to see a labour candidate , he says theres been a lot of anti tory tactical voting here wolmar declines to define what a good result for him would be , but says he aims to at least establish a good labour base in richmond park for the future he mocks a comment by olney that she would not have been helped had labour too decided not to field a candidate because that would have linked her by association with jeremy corbyn labour voters associate the lib dems were being in coalition with the tories , the bedroom tax and all the rest of it , he says olney is very new to politics , having only joined the lib dems last summer in the cafe she talked observantly about local housing issues , noting the needs of older people and the migration of their sons and daughters to croydon or staines because property prices are so very high , but wolmar claims the lib dems will regret her inexperience , citing an uncomfortable evening standard interview the other large part of the richmond park equation and by far the oddest is what exactly is in it for goldsmith with various prominent tories out supporting him , his campaign looks more like that of the heathrow dissident wing of london and home counties conservatism being indulged by the tory mothership than a truly independent one goldsmith said a year ago that he regrets his promise to bring about a byelection over heathrow earlier this month , he said that he regrets the direction his mayoral campaign took keeping his heathrow pledge might be seen as demonstrating that he is , after all , the man of principle he and his admirers have kept insisting that he is by contrast , it might be seen as his last chance to salvage whats left of that reputation should he lose

a close friend was going through a terrible time this summer as she cried to me on the phone in her lunch break or over coffee at the weekend , i tried to be the best friend i could i told her to focus on the friends and partner who love her , suggested therapy and exercise to alleviate her stress , and gave her advice as to what she might say and do to change her situation ive always prided myself on being a good listener maybe ive got one of those faces partners , friends , colleagues , even strangers at the bus stop seem to want to confide in me this year i started volunteering for a charity that provides fortnightly face to face , confidential listening sessions for people i liked the idea that lay people such as myself could be trained , with professional support , to use our compassion and ears to help a fellow human being in distress on day one , in my first training session , i realised to my horror that i wasnt a very good listener at all all the habits that i thought made me good at it , all that advice i was giving my friend , was just getting in the way each session brought new revelations and useful lessons since putting those lessons into practice with my friends and partner , ive seen what a difference it can make as my trainer pam tells me , i have seen people in severe emotional distress , feeling like the only way is down but they talk and cry , and i just listen verbalising their emotions helps them see things more clearly being listened to makes us feel valued it makes the listener feel valued , too there are several ways to approach a difficult conversation \( the general rule is , say less than the other person \) here are a few how to listen to a friend who is downthe first step , pam says , is being aware of the barriers if your friend is feeling low , even expressing sympathy can get in the way we think its helpful to say , i know exactly what you mean , i went through something similar but thats talking about your own feelings , rather than allowing your friend to tell you what its like for them when a person wants to express their pain , your experiences arent relevant to them a similar , common mistake is to leap to offer advice before being asked giving advice is not listening , and often its not helpful , pam adds it shuts people down if you feel a responsibility to fix your friends problems , relinquish it if your friend is feeling low , even expressing sympathy can get in the waythe hardest habit for me to break was the instinct to turn the conversation round to the positive it took a while for me to understand that if a friend is in a dark place , the most compassionate thing we can do is to climb down into that place and sit with them for a while if a person trusts you enough to talk about their distress , trying to cheer them up is like shutting them up you are dismissing and trivialising their feelings , pam says give them the space to say how bad they feel and stay with it swerving away from it , talking about a silver lining , can signal you dont want to hear it focus on your friend and their words thinking too much about your responses can be detrimental sometimes , my minds whirring and im so busy thinking about what to say that i leap ahead , pam explains so i make a constant effort to calm my mind down and tune into what is being said it is possible , when you know how , to say a lot without saying anything at all just being a calm presence can give someone the trust and confidence to open up to you , she tells me your body language should look engaged , perhaps leaning forward , and be open to making eye contact but also sensitive to people who might find it unnerving adopt a soft , caring voice , but beware , pam warns theres a fine line between sounding warm and gentle , and sounding patronising and pitying dont talk down to anyone , just show genuine interest your most important tool , she says , is silence dont be afraid of silence learn to hold it although it may feel uncomfortable to you , it wont to them theyre working through painful thoughts and feelings , so dont rush them people will start opening up if you dont interrupt how to listen to your partnerthe closer you are to your partner , the harder you have to work to truly listen to them , says susan quilliam , relationship coach and author of the relate guide , stop arguing , start talking \( vermilion , 9 99 \) that security , history and intimacy being able to finish each others sentences , treating your partner as if he or she is a part of yourself can mean our listening gets a little fuzzy theres a kind of mutual dependency and mental enmeshment that means you really have to struggle hard to listen to your partner as if he or she is a stranger quilliam estimates that most couples will genuinely talk and listen to each other for only 20 minutes a week , and that this can have a huge impact other people see your public selves , a loving couple in a functional partnership , but somewhere in your heart , you know theres something wrong you dont feel heard , and neither does your partner there is a way back to find it , quilliam says , you need to re establish the habit that was there when you fell in love with each other , when there was nothing better than listening to your beloved explain who they are she suggests reclaiming 10 minutes every day when you are both alone and can sit on the sofa and listen to each other for five minutes each set an alarm to go off at the end she calls this one way listening , where one partner is given all the focus , so the listener can allow his or her mind to settle without thinking of what to say next this way , when your partner really needs to talk , your listening muscle will be trained in the workplace , its always a question of listening and being seen to be listeninghow to listen at workmilee brambleby , a workplace mediator , describes a common scene in offices around the country fred is unhappy about his treatment by another colleague and asks to discuss it with his manager , who simply tries to placate him fred demands that his colleague be sacked when people who want to be heard instead have their feathers smoothed , they get louder in their frustration , bigger in their assertions , and more extreme in their demands , she says if we dont listen effectively , we miss the opportunity to resolve the issue the biggest thing i want to change about british industry is how we feel about the phrase we need to talk its perceived as negative and threatening , but if were truly listening , it is a positive thing first , you need to give the person plenty of time and space to express their feelings which might mean scheduling a meeting for a later date if you dont have time straight away once the person has started talking , focus on what theyre saying when they come to a natural break , ask clarifying questions to make sure youve understood brambleby explains this signals very clearly what youre saying is important to me in the workplace , its always a question of listening and being seen to be listening formulate your questions in a way that doesnt sound aggressive what do you mean by that \? can sound attacking , while explain to me whats behind that sounds encouraging use your colleagues words to reflect back what theyre saying , even if it means swearing for example , youre telling me carole is a fucking bitch what is making you feel that way \? brambleby explains that this can be particularly effective , because it might be the first time that they have listened to themselves mirroring their own language can shock them into questioning why they have had such an extreme reaction facebook twitter pinterest illustration nishant choksihow to listen to your childthe impulse to explain things away and deny our childrens feelings is very powerful , says adele faber , the author of how to talk so kids will listen and listen so kids will talk \( piccadilly press , 12 99 \) the temptation as a parent , faber explains , is to go straight into comforting mode if our son says , daddy nearly killed me when he took that splinter out , we say , oh , it couldnt have been that bad , but we should say , that sounds as if it really hurt youve got to tune into the feelings behind their words and make an effort to recognise them , she says one particular word that gets in the way of that is but parents often begin with an empathic statement , then add that little poison pill , faber explains the word but tends to diminish or erase what went before , as in , you sound so disappointed about missing julies party , but its only one party instead of butting away the feeling , give it full value she suggests instead prefacing the statement with even though , as in , even though you know its only one party , youre still so disappointed to be missing it that way , you credit your childs intelligence and make your own point without dismissing theirs if there is a regular pressure point when it is impossible for productive listening to take place , for example leaving for school , faber suggests sitting down at a calmer time with your child to ask how things could work better they can come up with ideas , while you write them all down the silly and the sensible ones you can work on the list together and decide which ones you both agree on , then post it on the front door that way , everyone feels listened to , and youve arrived at a solution together the impact will be immediate , she says when a child feels listened to , he or she is ready to listen to you the minute there is acceptance of the childs feelings , their whole body relaxes theres a fine line between sounding warm and gentle , and sounding patronisinghow to listen to someone whos angryi love angry people , brambleby tells me theyre much easier to work with over the last few years , ive realised that people who seem angry and aggressive are probably feeling frightened , frustrated and powerless im only 4ft 9in , and when ive got a big shouty man in front of me , i find it hugely helpful to remember that at the root of his behaviour is fear her advice is to let that person be angry if its in the workplace , you may need to move to a private room , but dont try to restrain them give them time eventually sometimes its seconds , sometimes minutes , but rarely longer they will have said what they need to , to get that raw emotion out it takes courage to do that , because we are frightened by strong emotions but in my experience , it is the only effective way to deal with anger when the tirade is over , you can ask questions to clarify what it is that has angered them if your partner is angry with you , quilliam says , its impossible for you to give good clear listening in that situation before you can listen , you might need time apart , so your partner can calm down , or you may need to have a shouting match and then hug then you can get on with the

downing street has hit back at the institute for fiscal studies after it said workers face the longest period without a real terms increase in wages since the second world war number 10 said these figures were misleading because disposable income figures show that people are getting better off \( see 4 28pm \) in a separate report the resolution foundation said that family incomes would grow for the rest of the decade but by less than after the financial crisis and not for the poorest third , who will see their incomes fall it said we can look at the outlook for family incomes in the coming years , and it paints a grim picture our new income forecast brings together lower earnings growth , higher inflation , and tax benefit changes it shows that overall , the rest of this parliament looks set to be as grim as the last , with incomes growing by an average of 0 2 per cent a year , compared with 0 5 per cent a year between 2010 11 and 2014 15 while top earners were hit the hardest following the financial crisis , the big difference looking forward is that the biggest losers are lower income families , with the entire bottom third of the income distribution set to see incomes fall in the years ahead brexit could be halted if the british people decided the costs of leaving the eu greatly outweighed any benefits , tony blair has said in an interview marking his self proclaimed return to political activity george osborne , the former chancellor , made more than 320 , 400 in a month from giving speeches to us banks , financial organisations and a university , his register of interests shows andrew lansley , the former conservative health secretary , has urged the government to invest more in social care speaking on the world at one , he said he was disappointed that philip hammond did not address this in his autumn statement lansley said the next two years are going to be incredibly difficult and i think the time is now for trying to put some measures in place to try and help health and social care through those next two years jeremy corbyn has called for more money to be spent on hospitals , social care and mental health speaking ahead of labours nhs campaign day on saturday , he said the campaign had three elements theres three elements one hospital provision , under funding of hospitals , waiting times and stp sustainability and transformation plans , which are putting at risk a lot of a e departments all around the country the second element is social care , under funding of social care , the need to improve social care and improve the way in which we treat care workers theyre vital , valuable , very responsible and very well experienced people they should be treated better and paid better third , there is a mental health crisis across the country i feel very passionately about this , thats why i have appointed a shadow minister at cabinet level just for dealing with mental health because i think as a country we have to face up to the crisis were in , fund it properly , but above all change the mood music as well the biggest killer of under 50 year old men is suicide from mental health conditions thats terrible jeremy corbyn visiting the george eliot hospital in nuneaton , warwickshire , today photograph joe giddens panigel farage has reportedly dismissed reports that he plans to emigrate to the us

, the group campaigning to keep britain in the single market , has put out a statement from labours chris leslie saying the ifs analysis shows that the economic warnings about brexit issued during the eu referendum campaign were accurate he said this is clear proof that the brexit vote has made working families worse off the irresponsibility of leave campaigners was breathtaking they should now be admitting that economic warnings made during the campaign were not project fear they were project fact their promises that brexit would make britain better off now appear naive and complacent iain duncan smith , the conservative former work and pensions secretary , told bbc news this afternoon that he did not accept the ifs claim that workers face the longest squeeze on wages for 70 years asked about its analysis , he said well , actually , im surprised because wages are increasing , theyre increasing now , theyre increasing across the board and well above inflation yes , there was a period when they were absolutely static but over the last two , two and a half years , wages hae been increasing and the forecasts all the way have been that wages will continue to increase so i dont recognise this dire prediction of no increase at all since the crash he also said that he did not accept the forecasts from bodies like the ifs and the office for budget responsibility about the impact of brexit on the economy my sense about this is that the uk economy is already confounding the forecasts all the forecasts , from the ifs and from the obr and everybody else , all said that we were going to see a downturn immediately after the brexit vote we havent seen that the is growing faster than they predicted we just saw the debt fall three days ago , when they predicted it would rise so my sense about this is we are into territory where nobody really knows that the future holds duncan smith is right about wages growing now , but he ignores the fact that they fell so far , in real terms , that they have not caught up with where they were before the crash the resolution foundation makes the point today in this chart , in its autumn statement analysis \( pdf \) published

plan has meant long term decline in living standards for working people even as the super rich and the big corporations are given large tax giveaways chancellor philip hammond promised action in the autumn statement for those just about managing instead he has betrayed them by continuing to slash in work benefits , failing to raise the national living wage to the level promised , failing to deliver more funding for our nhs and social care and now hes threatening pensioners with removing the triple lock labour has different priorities and will prepare our economy for brexit instead of cutting taxes for the super rich and giant corporations , we will make sure our nhs is properly funded , support the pensions triple lock , and introduce a real living wage built on an economy that

opening statement \( pdf \) at the ifs autumn statement briefing johnson said by 2021 wages would still be lower than they were in 2008 in real terms and that britain has not had such a dreadful period without earnings growth since the second world war \( see 1 14pm \) he said the expected rise in inflation meant the real value of the national living wage would rise by just over 20 during the course of this parliament , not 25 as expected he said inflation also meant that the real value of working age benefits like jsa jobseekers allowance that are currently frozen in cash terms will fall by 7 7 rather than 6 5 he said philip hammond had effectively adopted ed balls spending plans rather than aiming for budget balance in 2019 20 mr hammond will be happy borrowing 2 of national income , thats about 40 billion , in 2020 21 remember that at the last election the then shadow chancellor , ed balls , said he was aiming to balance the current budget by 2018 19 , i e borrow just to invest keeping to that over the parliament would have allowed borrowing of just over 2 of gdp in 2020 21 to misquote michael heseltine , it wouldnt be far from the truth to say that the new fiscal plans arent osbornes , they are balls he predicted that the government would have to spend more money on health or social care strikingly hammond responded not at all to calls for more money for either the nhs or social care im going to stick my neck out and suggest he wont be able to do that for much longer he criticised the government for continuing to freeze fuel duty every year instead of simply abandoning the proposed annual increases one of the more expensive measures announced was yet another freeze to fuel duty the seventh year in a row this has happened if the policy is never to increase fuel duty again , as seems to be the case , we should just be told rather than being told always that it will rise with inflation next year and then that never happening this is turning into a really big problem both for the treasury and for our approach to the taxation of motoring he said the obrs forecasts were noticeably more upbeat than the bank of englands earlier this month the bank projected growth of 1 4 , 1 5 and 1 6 in 2017 , 2018 and 2019 respectively the obrs projections are for growth of 1 4 , 1 7 and 2 1 thats quite a big difference he said hammonds policy in the autumn statement amounted to jam tomorrow not jam today in the face of deteriorating forecasts mr hammond neither tightened fiscal policy nor followed his predecessors example of sticking with previous spending plans he loosened by an annual 10 billion or so and he loosened in a rather specific way , mostly by increasing planned capital spending given the choice between jam today in the form of more money in peoples pockets and jam tomorrow in the form of potential economic returns from greater investment , he went for jam tomorrow he accused hammond of being disingenuous about the increase in the insurance premium tax , arguing that the 12 rate was hard to justify mr hammond wasnt guilty of too many fiscal infelicities yesterday , but the way in which he announced the increase in ipt was certainly one of them it is half the rate of vat , he said , as if in explanation of the rise well , so it should be in fact it should be lower its only the value of the insurance premiums net of pay outs which one should think of as being vatable that would imply an ipt rate much less than 10 , not more he said the ifs backed the idea of scrapping the autumn statement , although he expressed scepticism about whether this would happen we will also wait and see whether this really is the last autumn statement we have been here before after all chancellor kenneth clarke also moved from a separate autumn statement and spring budget to a single autumn budget that didnt survive a change of occupancy at number 11 paul johnson at the ifs briefing photograph ifs sky news here is the full text \( pdf \) of paul johnsons opening presentation at the ifs briefing workers in britain face the biggest squeeze on their pay for 70 years as a brexit blow to the economy knocks wage growth and stokes inflation , according to an analysis of the uks governments latest tax and spending plans picking over philip hammonds autumn statement , the institute for fiscal studies said real wages in the uk pay adjusted for inflation will still be below their 2008 level in 2021 paul johnson , the thinktanks director said in his presentation \( pdf \) one cannot stress how dreadful that is more than a decade without real earnings growth we have certainly not seen a period remotely like it in the last 70 years the warning follows signs that the pounds sharp fall since the referendum result is hiking the cost of imports to the uk and could soon be passed on to consumers at the same time , experts warn pay growth could stall as companies grapple with politicial and economic uncertainty on wednesday , the governments independent forecasters , the office for budget responsibility , said the economy would slow next year and inflation would rise in a separate analysis of the autumn statement , the thinktank , resolution foundation , said families faced a worse squeeze on their living standards over the next five years than they suffered in the wake of the financial crisis paul johnson , director of the institute for fiscal studies , has just started the ifss briefing on the autumn statement he says wages in real terms will still be below their 2008 levels in 2021 this is dreadful , he says here is the key quote however , the outlook for living standards has deteriorated rather sharply since march the obr is forecasting both lower nominal wage growth as a result of lower productivity , and higher inflation resulting from the exchange rate depreciation overall real average earnings are forecast to rise by less than 5 between now and 2021 that means they will be 3 7 lower in 2021 than was projected in march to put it another way around half of the wage growth projected for the next five years back in march is not now projected to happen on these projections real wages will , remarkably , still be below their 2008 levels in 2021 one cannot stress enough how dreadful that is more than a decade without real earnings growth we have certainly not seen a period remotely like it in the last 70 years i will post a full summary of his statement shortly only a third of voters think the measures announced in the autumn statement will help the economy , an icm poll conducted for the guardian suggests icm carried out its survey online last night and , although respondents were generally positive about the measures in the autumn statement they were asked about , overall they did not seem very convinced that philip hammonds policies would do a lot to help the economy asked if the package of measures announced by hammond would be helpful or unhelpful to the economy , the results were icm also asked about six specific policies in the autumn all received either majority or plurality support , but there were some interesting variations the measure with the highest net support was increasing the national living wage by 30p an hour to 7 50 but the measure with the highest number of people both supporting it , and saying it would make a difference , was increasing the income tax threshold to 11 , 500 in april \( a measure announced by george osborne in march , but reconfirmed by hammond yesterday \) and the measure with the lowest net support was abandoning the 2019 20 budget surplus targets here are the net support figures for the six policies \( percentage saying they are in favour , whether or not they think it will make a difference \) and here are the same policies , but this time listed in order of people saying they support them think the policy is sufficient to make a difference icm unlimited interviewed an online sample of 1 , 317

this year tony blair has given a lengthy interview to the new statesman here are some of the top lines blair says that he wants to help resurrect centre ground politics as the guardian reported on monday , he is setting up a new political organisation next year in his interview he rules out a return to the political frontline himself , but he explains that he wants to help politicians who are challenging extremists what im doing is to spend more time not in the front line of politics , because i have no intention of going back to the front line of politics , to correct another misunderstanding but in trying to create the space for a political debate about where modern western democracies go and where the progressive forces particularly find their place im dismayed by the state of western politics , but also incredibly motivated by it i think in britain today , youve got millions of effectively politically homeless people what im interested in doing is asking what are the types of ideas that we should be taking forward \? how do we provide a service to people who are in the front line of politics , so that we can provide some thinking and some ideas \? the thing thats really tragic about politics today is that the best ideas about politics arent in politics i find the ideas are much more interesting in the technology sector , much more interesting ideas about how you change the world he says that brexit could be reversed it can be stopped if the british people decide that , having seen what it means , the pain gain cost benefit analysis doesnt stack up and that can happen in one of two ways im not saying it will be stopped , by the way , but it could im just saying until you see what it means , how do you know \? explaining the two ways in which brexit could be reversed , he goes on either you get maximum access to the single market in which case youll end up accepting a significant number of the rules on immigration , on payment into the budget , on the european courts jurisdiction people may then say , well , hang on , why are we leaving then \? or alternatively , youll be out of the single market and the economic pain may be very great , because beyond doubt if you do that youll have years , maybe a decade , of economic restructuring the resolution foundation thinktank has published its full verdict on the autumn statement as my colleagues heather stewart and jessica elgot report , it is saying that the squeeze on living standards over the next five years could be even worse than it was during the financial crash here is there story uk living standards squeeze 'will be worse than after global crash' read morethis is how it starts families face a worse squeeze on their living standards over the next five years than they suffered in the wake of the financial crisis , as brexit slows the economy and conservative welfare cuts bite , according to a new report analysis of wednesdays autumn statement by the resolution foundation thinktank suggests average earnings are set to grow only half as rapidly as in the austerity years after the economic crisis at the same time , living standards will be undermined by higher inflation and ongoing welfare cuts while the squeeze of the last parliament affected workers across the income spectrum , the foundation says low paid households are set to be hardest hit over the next five years , because they are particularly affected by planned welfare cuts and here is the full resolution foundation report \( pdf \) john mcdonnell , the shadow chancellor , has also been giving interviews this morning here are the key points he has been making mcdonnell indicated that labour wanted taxes to be fairer , but that it was not looking to increase the overall tax burden wed make sure that instead of giving tax giveaways to the wealthy and corporations , and ignoring the issue of tax avoidance and tax evasion , wed make sure we had a fair taxation system and in that way were not talking about increasing taxes or anything like that , what we are saying is that we use our resources more effectively we will want to abide by the principles that you spend what you earn they have given tax giveways on capital gains tax , on corporation tax , on inheritance tax to the wealthy in our community and also to corporations and what we saw yesterday they were cutting the universal credits that are going to be given to what they call jams , the just about managing , people going into work , looking after their families , doing everything asked of them so theyve got the wrong priorities he defended labours decision to support a tax cut for people paying the higher rate of income tax labour is backing the governments plan to increase the tax threshold for people paying the higher 40p rate of income tax asked about this , he said there are large numbers of people earning above 43 , 000 who are in jobs like train drivers , like senior teachers and others who have been hit and do need protecting if we are going to be doing redistribution we should be hitting those who are over that level for example , our policy is 50p on 150 , 000 , reverting to the original tax system we had some years ago we have to recognise that the reality of those people on middle incomes and the pressures that they are under , particularly with regard to housing costs in certain parts of our country he said labour was committed to keeping the triple lock the law that says pensions will rise every year by 2 5 or in line with earnings or inflation , whichever is higher the tories are committed to keeping this until 2020 but philip hammond , in his autumn statement , hinted that it could be dropped after that because it is too expensive asked if hammond was right to review it , mcdonnell replied no , i would be very disappointed if he did drop the triple lock under the labour government gordon brown wanted to tackle the issues around child poverty and pensioner poverty and that is what he did he lifted people out of poverty at both stages of their lives , both children and older people if we can grow the economy , and we have a fair taxation system , we can afford it \( mcdonnell was right to say the last labour government did a lot to reduce pensioner poverty , but the triple lock was actually a coalition policy , not a labour one \) he said the governments failure to set out its brexit stance was increasing economic uncertaintly we cant do these negotiations without openness and transparency people need to know where is the government going and how is it going to get there at least then you stabilise things and people will be able to settle down into serious negotiations and we will get the best deal until the government gets to that position , we are going to have these uncertainties and this speculation he played down the significance of a picture showing many labour mps looking at their phones in the commons chamber when he was responding to hammond yesterday he said it doesnt look brilliant but thats what they do now and they have to think themselves the new style in parliament at the moment is people are tweeting all the time theyre doing a running commentary on whats going on it doesnt look good , but thats what happens its interesting because everybodys got these new handheld devices all the time , theyre tweeting all the time , but interestingly enough the general response to the points i was making was received quite well within parliament and outside and its interesting ive never seen this before and this is not me boasting if you looked at the mps opposite me and those behind , i held their attention even though theyre tweeting , theyre tweeting about what im saying john rentoul \( johnrentoul \) john mcdonnell responded to as16 and labour mps looked at their phones me for indyvoices \( pic via mailonline \) https t co 30axh5uvsp pic twitter com hm1ec4rxp3november 24 , 2016 here is a full summary of the main points from philip hammonds interviews this morning hammond said the economic future was uncertain because no one knew what the outcome of the brexit talks would be when it was put to him that the government was at fault for telling the office for budget responsibility very little about its brexit plans , he said that the government had said what it wanted the greatest possible access to european markets but the outcome of the brexit negotiations would not just depend on what the government wanted , he went on the fact is , it is not about what we want the outcome to be its going to be a negotiation we are going to sit at the table with the representatives of the european union and nobody , at this stage , can be certain about what the outcome of that negotiation will be that is what creates the uncertainty , whether you are a chancellor of the exchequer trying to forecast the public finances for a couple of years down the line or whether you are a businessman making an investment in a production line he said the government was preparing for a range of possible outcomes from the brexit talks thats a sensible and prudent thing to do , he said he defended the obr , saying the government would be wrong to ignore its forecasts pro brexit tories have criticised the obr , saying its forecasts about the impact of brexit on the economy are wrong hammond said it was important to remember that forecasting was not a precise science but he said the government would be wrong to ignore what it said economic forecasting is not a precise science and the obr itself makes the point in its report that there is a very high degree of uncertainty around the report that they issued yesterday because of the circumstances that they are in when it was put to him that this means he thinks the obr forecasts should be taken with a pinch of salt , as the telegraph claims this morning , he replied i think we should look at what the report is projecting , we should certainly not ignore that , we should look at it as one of the possible range of outcomes that we need to plan for the bbcs ross hawkins has posted this on twitter , pointing out that hammond was right to say the obr has acknowledged a high degree of uncertainty ross hawkins \( rosschawkins \) there is a wide range of uncertainty around the forecasts says hammond this is true pic twitter com ytpc3fcloxnovember 24 , 2016he said the government was preparing for a possible economic slowdown next year to me it makes sense , given the warning signals from the obr report , to keep a little bit of firepower in the locker , to build a little bit of a reserve so that if there is a slowdown next year , weve got enough capacity to support the economy , to protect jobs , to ensure that the economy can get through any headwinds it encounters he rejected claims that debt was out of control when it was put to him that the government had lost control of debt he replied its not out of control , its larger than we would like it to be he rejected claims that the autumn statement contained nothing for jams , the families who are just about managing when this was put to him , he replied i dont think thats true at all we are facing very significant fiscal challenges within the constraints that that imposes , weve tried to focus what firepower we do have on helping those who are ordinary working families who are hard pressed to get by stopping the scheduled rise in fuel duty was an important step in that process reducing the taper in universal credit so that people in work on low wages are able to keep more of their wages recommitting to raising the personal allowance in the income tax system to 12 , 500 by the end of this parliament despite the fiscal challenges will leave everybody in this country better off and of course a rise in the national living wage which will put 500 a year in the pockets of somebody over 25 working full time on the national living wage i think those are important steps forward he rejected claims that the government was now adopting the spending plans labour proposed at the 2015 general election labour would have exempted investment spending from borrowing rules , he said he said his new fiscal rules included investment spending he rejected claims that he ignored the nhs in his statement when this was put to him , he replied it is not true that it was not mentioned if you read the statement , it absolutely was mentioned as i said yesterday in parliament , it may have been my first autumn statement , but im not a complete rookie and i would not have failed to mention the nhs he rejected the ideal of nigel farage playing any role in the governments relations with washington asked about this , he replied if i ever need any advice from nigel farage ive got his number and ill give him a call tell him not to hold his breath philip hammond on sky news photograph sky news
amid the hustle and bustle of freetown , they instantly caught the eye a group of about 100 college students stopped outside the courthouse , formed a line and began to protest public dissent can be a hazardous business in sierra leone , even when expressed in a peaceful manner , and the mood reflected as much while some smiled and held their picket signs high , others were noticeably tense , heads down and eyes darting between the dozens of police that had been weaving in and out of the crowd since the demonstration began they knew they werent supposed to come they hadnt requested police authorisation and , even if they had , it wouldnt have mattered thats why they had to protest volunteers who fought ebola for sierra leone one year on read morewe have a sister , a first year sociology student at our university who has been arrested for sharing a post on social media calling on us to protest against the rising petrol prices , said as kamara , a law student at freetowns fourah bay college he held a sign reading free expression in one hand , and a smaller one with free teresa in the other she was exercising her civil rights , which the democratic process , our own constitution , guarantees her , he continued , passionately were here today to stand in solidarity with teresa and make our voices heard , so we can let the world know the true state of things in our country it is our right to do so theresa mbomaya , 20 , was arrested on 16 november for forwarding a message in a student whatsapp group that , while promoting a forthcoming demonstration , also implied that any vehicle trying to disrupt it could be set on fire she was detained for five days before , in the hour preceding the solidarity demonstration , a volunteer coalition of 32 lawyers successfully negotiated her release there is a culture of fear in sierra leone , because people know that if you protest , youre going to be intimidatedemmanuel saffa abdulai , society for democratic initiativesmbomaya has been charged with incitement and the government has released a statement calling for social media forum moderators to be held criminally responsible for content posted to their pages , regardless of authorship the students say their protest , which was allowed to continue unimpeded , is just the beginning of a larger movement to protect free expression in sierra leone in the past two years , the countrys ruling party has shown a worsening , often violent intolerance for public criticism , and with an 11 year civil war in the rear view mirror , a culture of silence often deters would be protesters from publicly airing their grievances but in the past week , mbomayas case has quickly evolved into a cause clbre that , bolstered by the countrys grim economic conditions , has become the epicentre of a growing social movement calling for unobstructed freedom of expression whichever way the court rules in mbomayas case , civil society and human rights groups expect profound implications for the future of expressive freedom in sierra leone for better or for worse since the height of the ebola outbreak , opposition members , protesters , activists and journalists have been jailed , beaten , teargassed or shot for publishing material or staging demonstrations deemed critical of government policy groups thought to oppose the ruling party are routinely denied applications to conduct their programmes , while pro government groups are permitted to carry out similar business even some who have obtained prior permission for events from the police have been subjected to raids there is a justifiable culture of fear in this country , because people know that if you come out to protest , youre going to be intimidated in one way or another and its unlikely anyone will stand up for you , said emmanuel saffa abdulai , head of the society for democratic initiatives , a civil society group and the main organiser for the renaissance , a group of politically active professionals who recently applied to protest against a 62 hike in fuel prices police denied their request , but that denial sparked what is being called the blackmonday movement , with supporters wearing black every monday to express their discontent for the national state of free expression it also inspired mbomaya to promote a student protest four days later , a move which , although having led to her arrest , has quickly propelled both blackmonday and the renaissance into the national spotlight even demonstrating at malcom x park in philadelphia , they will tell you you have to operate within particular timespresidential spokesman abdulai bayraytaywe want to demystify this process , abdulai said the world is not going to end because the government is annoyed with you for protesting they can lock you up for a few months or shoot you dead , but life goes on they cant do that to everyone abdulai is among a bipartisan group of 32 lawyers who , as their own form of protest , have agreed to represent mbomaya pro bono they say the 1965 public order act \( pdf \) the law that paved the way for the arrests of mbomaya and many others is too vague and contradicts the expressive rights outlined in the countrys 1991 constitution \( pdf \) it also was implemented by the former president , albert margai , who later tried to reorganise sierra leone into a single party dictatorship the public order act says that you should not publish information that is perceived to cause fear in the population , said francis kaifala , who is leading mbomayas defence team at that time sierra leone was moving towards a dictatorship and the government wanted to control everything we were a fledgling democracy then , but its 2016 and weve had many years to develop there are many aspects of that law that we dont believe would hold up against the 1991 constitution because , frankly , they belong to the dark ages presidential spokesman abdulai bayraytay responded that active laws need to be respected as long as they are still in the books , pointing to americas often sweeping anti terror policies by way of example he said demonstration permits are handled exclusively by the police , on a case by case basis , independent of any political influence bayraytay disagreed with the notion that there is any political bias in granting such permits , adding that protesters have responsibilities as well as rights even demonstrating at malcom x park in philadelphia , they will tell you you have to operate within particular times , bayraytay said if you go to the white house , they have a picket line you are not permitted to go beyond those are the laws we should still be able to convey our messages without being confrontational topicsgovernancesierra

racism is a serious problem within the lgbt community and needs to be addressed despite the determination of many minority ethnic lgbt people to do just that , it is not happening how can i be a bigot when i am myself a member of an oppressed minority \?

the evisceration of the independent commission against corruption and its commissioner , megan latham , has been a long time coming new south wales politicians of all stripes have traditionally put their hands on their hearts and declared their support for a squeaky clean public administration three cheers for icac yet in their heart of hearts they have feared and detested the countrys most formidable corruption busting body two liberal premiers fell foul of icac and , during the recent operation spicer investigations into electoral funding , at least 10 liberal mps were banished to the crossbench or into oblivion as a result of their involvement with tainted donors other senior liberal party figures , such as paul nicolaou and nick di girolamo , were also unhappily caught up in operation spicer , but were not found to have acted corruptly icac commissioner megan latham resigns after pressure from baird read more the wounds run deep , especially after barry ofarrell shot his premiership to death by providing an incorrect answer to the commission in a separate but related matter icacs parliamentary oversight committee , dominated by politicians from the right of the spectrum , soon got to work its job was ably assisted by two other factors icacs inspector , the former judge david levine and the commissions attempted investigation into allegations against senior crown prosecutor margaret cunneen , which ended up being stuck down by the high court while she waged a personal war against icac commissioner latham , cunneen was in thick with conservatives in the upper house , such as the reverend fred nile , who also sat on the oversight committee levine , also batting from cunneens end of the pitch , came up with a whole pile of recommendations that would have effectively defenestrated icacs functions as a public investigator cunneen , levine and the parliamentary committee gave rise to an imperfect storm , with the rightwing media bellowing like banshees levine recommended an end to corruption investigations conducted in public , while the former icac commissioner david ipp remarked the whole raison detre of icac is the exposure of corruption the idea of exposing corruption behind closed doors is oxymoronic the inspector also wanted an exoneration protocol so that those who had been found corrupt by icac and who had not been convicted of a criminal offence after a trial could apply to the supreme court to expunge icacs findings it was left to bruce mcclintock sc , who , along with former chief justice murray gleeson , had conducted a review of icac in 2015 , to carefully explain that icac makes corruption findings on the balance of probabilities , while the dpp has the job of prosecuting and if possible securing convictions beyond reasonable doubt much of what icac discovers through its coercive powers cannot be admitted in criminal proceedings , so it can be no surprise that findings of corruption can be made while criminal convictions either dont proceed or dont succeed mcclintock submitted to the parliamentary committee thus , it is inevitable that a proportion of cases where icac finds corrupt conduct will not result in any prosecution , even though its findings were appropriate on the information available to icac that does not mean that the person in question did not engage in corrupt conduct , still less that the person is innocent in the end the government and labor members of the parliamentary committee agreed to airbrush levines two major recommendations secret hearings and exonerations to arrive at a three commissioner icac where all investigations would be conducted in secret , unless the chief commissioner and one other agreed otherwise additional safeguards have been included in the new act that amount to a backdoor version of an exoneration protocol new guidelines for the conduct of public inquiries have to be formulated , along with prior disclosure to anyone under investigation of all the available evidence and time for responses to be formulated icac overhaul passes new south wales parliament despite scathing criticism read more no adverse findings can be made without first giving the affected party a right of response and for that response to be included in the final report people whose conduct attracts critical observations but no formal adverse findings cannot be identified in the responses these measures are a shift towards greater protections for those in the frame and remove much of the rough and tumble in the hunt for the truth it should suit the politicians and the business interests that pull the strings no end premier mike bairds claim that his new legislation is just a reflection of the bipartisan recommendations of the parliamentary committee is disingenuous to a fault importantly the labor members of the committee did not support the requirement that commissioner megan latham lose her job and if she wanted it again she would have to make an application to require the commissioner to put her hand up for her job while she has been investigating members of the governing political party and while findings involving senior liberals are still pending shows the extent to which the fix is in if she had chosen to do so , her appointment would have to be approved by the coalition controlled parliamentary committee how do you think that would work \? the intemperate cross examination of latham by members of the committee on things like the commission issuing a press release announcing the cunneen matter had been referred to the dpp , and her right to refuse to answer questions on operational matters , gives us a clue in fact the committee can veto the appointment of any commissioner ie politicians can blackball anyone who looks like having the constitutional fortitude to be able to put a broom through the augean stables of the state the old icac has been abolished , replaced by a new body with legislative mechanisms that make it much more politically responsive we also got a look at the vengeance that accompanied these changes cunneen was in the presidents upper house gallery on the afternoon the legislation was passed it was reported that she watched as mike gallacher spoke in favour of the bill , while frothing about icac and its commissioner gallacher resigned as police minister and went to the crossbench as a result of evidence that emerged during the investigations into political donations the final spicer report found he had given unreliable evidence and acted with the intention of evading laws relating to the disclosure of political donations and the ban on donations from property developers , but did not make any findings of corruption grinning broadly as the legislation sailed through , the former minister said despite occasional challenges , some days just could not get any better let me say , that is exactly how i feel today it should be noted that the parliamentary committee on icac has not released cunneens phone conversations and text messages intercepted by the australian crime commission with the snippets that have emerged we find cunneen messaging her sons then girlfriend , sophia tilley , to start having chest pains in order to delay a breath test at the scene of a car accident eddie obeid loses multimillion dollar lawsuit against nsw corruption commission read more the prosecutor also hoped that by the time an ambulance arrived a zero blood alcohol reading would be recorded in a conversation with a smash repairer cunneen was intercepted telling him that naughty girl had alcohol thats all right , i can cover that but she had drunk , shes on her p plates but it had been some time ago , which is why i sent her a message to start having chest pains and get the ambulance because it has bought her a few more hours just hoping it goes down to zero cause otherwise there might be complicated insurance issues nile said that cunneen was joking when she made those remarks icac commissioner latham put forward those tapes in an attempt present a full picture , to counter levines critical findings and the over egged response from members of the committee if it had been made public in its entirety , maybe we would not now be at the point where the independence and effectiveness of the corruption fighter is so miserably compromised topicsindependent commission against

somehow donald trump manages to dumb down everything somehow he manages to lower the bar to the point where he can play by a different set of rules and somehow the media and elected officials just shrug their shoulders and walk away by his own admission , the president elect is negotiating business deals at a time when his predecessors were , you know , filling cabinet positions and transitioning to power he met with his indian business partners and the trump organization signed a kolkata deal last week as trump tweeted earlier this week , prior to the election it was well known that i have interests in properties all over the world only the crooked media makes this a big deal ! he explained this in more detail , if not entirely coherently , in his interview with the new york times ive built a very great company and its a big company and its all over the world people are starting to see , when they look at all these different jobs , like in india and other things , number one , a job like that builds great relationships with the people of india , so its all good its all good is indeed trumps approach to mixing his business and political affairs the law is totally on my side , he claimed , meaning , the president cant have a conflict of interest to be clear profiting from the presidency would not be a quaint conflict of interest this is not about whether trump favors one country or president over another , gives a contract to one company or another , or spends more time making money for himself than he does boning up about policy there are laws on the books about us businesses influencing foreign officials with payments or other inducements the law is called the foreign corrupt practices act and its goal is to stamp out bribery by any us citizen bribery is what the law calls favors and payments given to foreign officials in exchange for business deals not a conflict of interest payments and favors going the other way into the pockets of the president are so clearly corrupt that they were forbidden by the founding fathers in the constitution the so called emoluments clause prohibits gifts and titles from foreign powers as follows no person holding any office of profit or trust under them , shall , without the consent of the congress , accept of any present , emolument , office , or title , of any kind whatever , from any king , prince , or foreign state its this clause that leads to exceptional red tape around any and all gifts received by the white house and every other department from a homemade quilt to a rolex watch everything is detailed , declared and surrendered officials can only keep the gifts up to a value of 375 if they repay the us government this process will be hard within the world of international real estate , where foreign powers can grant gifts ranging from planning permits to investments from sovereign wealth funds the list is almost endless now we dont know if donald trump discussed his buenos aires investment with president mauricio macri of argentina , but we do know that his daughter ivanka now running the family business was on the call we dont know if there was any suggestion that president mauricio macri could expect any benefits for himself or his country spokespeople for president macri and president elect trump have denied reports about the mixing of trump business and politics on the call but we do know that the long stalled buenos aires project is now moving forward news that emerged just three days after the call between macri and trump for a president who has refused to release his tax returns , the need for transparency is not exactly clear in any case , the fact that were even having this discussion tells you something profound about the trump presidency before it officially begins trumps promise to his voters was that he was incorruptible because he was so independently wealthy that nobody could touch him he knew how to drain the swamp because he had lived in it for so long , buying off begging politicians for so many years that it made him sick this argument was always a stretch , but clearly many voters bought into his pitch just two weeks since the election , its obvious that trump has no interest in separating his personal wealth from his political agenda the damage caused is not confined to public confidence in the united states government being leader of the free world is not a casual concept that cold war phrase encapsulates the long prized notion that the united states is a beacon of freedom and democracy for the world as his own transition came to an end , president elect kennedy best summed up the notion in his final address in boston in january 1961 i have been guided by the standard john winthrop set before his shipmates on the flagship arbella 331 years ago , as they , too , faced the task of building a new government on a perilous frontier we must always consider , he said , that we shall be as a city upon a hill the eyes of all people are upon us the eyes of the world are on the trump transition right now they see a president elect who lost the popular vote by more than 2 million votes and almost 2 percentage points this is a difficult notion of democracy to explain to a world struggling against authoritarian regimes where votes are routinely ignored and discounted the work of democracy promotion by the national endowment for democracy , established by reagan , is immeasurably harder as a result of the 2016 election the work of spreading corruption free government has become just as hard as a result of trumps business dealings if a sitting president can enrich himself while in office , then why cant a president of a developing country set up his own businesses to do the same \? why should they not do both \? after all , as trump told the times , in theory i could run my business perfectly , and then run the country perfectly corruption the seeking of personal profit by government officials derived from their roles is a plague that condemns the most vulnerable people in the world to poor or non existent public services if the us cant talk credibly about the need to stamp out conflict of interest , the world will struggle to eradicate corruption and improve life for the poorest people on the planet america needs to lead by example and that starts with the president thats not a conflict of interest thats the national interest topicsdonald trumpopinionus politicscommentshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on

a wonderful and wide ranging discussion of an immensely complex and emotionally charged issue some final thoughts fighting corruption , forcing the hand of policy makers and developing community based responses to poverty are vital to elephant survivalhuman elephant conflict cannot be avoided , but we can try to control how humans reacta network of parks and wild lands is needed to allow elephants to roam naturallystamping out demand and the legal market in china is going to be difficult , but the government appears to be serioushope for the future is not lost , but it is probably limited to small pockets of land an entirely self indulgent question , i will admit , but thats my prerogative ! this excellent panel give us measured hope for the future wild60 22 november 2016 2 20pmin many countries i'm afraid it will not possible we often forget central and west africa where elephants are in many areas doomed if we cannot stop the current elephant poaching crisis , your grandchildren will probably be able to see wild elephants only in a handful of african countries , in the eastern and southern africa , tiny islands of elephants surrounded by oceans of people simonhedgeswcs 22 november 2016 2 25pmyes , but unless we all redouble our efforts to combat poaching , build community support for conservation , reduce hec , reduce trafficking \( including through market closures \) , and dramatically reduce demand for ivory , the number of places with significant numbers of wild elephants , functioning as they should , will be very much smaller than now but there is real hope ! kenyadan 22 november 2016 2 30pmi think so karl , because high value tourism areas will be maintained they might be private , however , like ol pejeta and lewa in kenya unfortunately , in getting to them you and your kids will drive through or fly over farms and livestock grazing lands because people have eradicated the wildlife you know what the word in english is for pest animals with no value vermin current policy is in effect making wildlife vermin from the perspective of rural african communities monicawrobel 22 november 2016 2 28pmkarl , i think that with increasing momentum to listen to the elephant specialists talking about the species , \( not just local abundant populations in one or two countries \) , we can get ivory under control and poaching significantly lessened and i strongly believe that if we do n't want simply islands of elephants but connected , migrating herds , we have to plan this now and in the next 5 10 years while we have something to work with this applies in asia too , where the iucn asian elephant specialist group just met last week for all of those people who have or are going to have grandchildren the question is back to you all , are you with us \? we need you to make your desire known to politicians and help us fund the work until the governments and corporations step up their funding and stewardship for elephants and their habitat asian elephants are monica wrobel , whose organisation elephant family focuses on asian elephants paints a frightening picture of the future monicawrobel 22 november 2016 2 19pmin the past 100 years 90 of asian elephant populations have been wiped out without action , this iconic animal could be facing extinction within 3 decades , which is why this species is listed as endangered they now number as few as 40 , 000 across 13 countries in asia , with probably 60 occurring in india habitat loss \( lack of food \) and fragmentation of populations are causing declines , and then the results of that such as train strikes are killing them , as well as hunting \( sometimes for ivory though not all elephants have tusks and females do n't have tusks \) however , retaliatory killing for crop raiding such as by electrocution traps hooked up to the mains wires , or setting out poison bait such as poisoned pineapples are killing what these superb wild giants have been reduced to crop pests , especially in places where people have settled and have no history of living with , or knowing how to live with elephants dan stiles also thinks things are looking bleak kenyadan 22 november 2016 2 16pmhabitat destruction and fragmentation is the obvious answer it 's remarkable how well they 've done in india and sri lanka when you think of the population pressures unfortunately , it looks like poaching for ivory is on the increase in india and carvers are still churning out the ganeshas and saraswatis i 've read how various states are planning corridors , etc heres what can be done says wrobel monicawrobel 22 november 2016 2 23pmin asia though , we have hope by protecting and keeping habitat areas connected and working with both rural communities and experts alike to understand more where elephants need to move and what they need to eat we can lessen the interaction between people and elephants and help people co exist safely we can work with governments and companies to rationally plan where land change will occur but we need to resource that research and those experts so they are ready with the answers ! so there is hope , but we need to act now importantly , as we attempt to get control globally on the battle against ivory and illegal poaching in africa , we are learning tremendous lessons to be applied in africa to protect space and empower people to allow our spectacular , largest land mammal still have room to roam our biggest project at the moment with other ngos is our corridors campaign http elephant family org what we do campaigning 100 corridors on email , wim kerkhoven asks why we cant use funds from tourism to support local communities so they dont turn to poaching theres just not enough to go around , says andrea crosta wild60 22 november 2016 1 57pmthroughout africa there are working examples of involving local communities in the way you suggest , it 's simply a drop in the ocean there are million and millions of poor people and just a fraction of them is actually blessed with tourism and you need just a few poachers and a couple of traffickers or brokers to create havoc there s a huge human toll behind the ivory trade and poor exploited people are a big part of it rahul raman 22 november 2016 2 02pmthats the same situation here , in india even with tourism , the number of poor people who actually benefit from it i e whose lives are uplifted by its effects is a very small number whatever the solution is , it has to be more though out and must benefit the poor community in large the money also fails to reach the communities says simon hedges simonhedgeswcs 22 november 2016 2 03pmsometimes the reason is that entrenched big businesses that are not set up to provide significant benefits to the local people in and around the eco tourism areas corruption is sometimes a problem too governments need to do more to support , facilitate , and otherwise help local initiatives and to require more equitable benefit sharing by the big operations you are correct to say that ecotourism in africa can generate 'big bucks' , see the paper i referenced earlier naidoo r , weaver c l , diggle r w , matongo g , stuart hill g thouless c \( 2015 \) complementary benefits of tourism and hunting to communal conservancies in namibia conserv biol monica wrobel says there is an important role for development aid to play to fill these gaps monicawrobel 22 november 2016 2 04pmi think community needs are greater than the support they are getting , especially in many african countries , but the rural poor in all countries where elephants range are too often left on their own in reality , the places where wildlife still exists are in places where the most dis enfranchised people live they may not even know when there is a government compensation scheme that can help them so i do n't think elephant populations always need to pay for themselves through trophy hunting or tourism income but i think that better access to development aid , or government aid or even an ngo started farming co op and access to markets can boost the morale and empowerment of communities those communities also do not want to be a target for criminal gangs preying on the unemployed to poach strong communities are a very important part of this answer , and support so they can use techniques or understand elephant routes help prevent human elephant interaction dan stiles says this is already underway in kenya kenyadan 22 november 2016 1 37pmthis is a critical question and in kenya right now there is a group doing exactly that , planning protected corridors to be left open to connect protected areas and private conservancies all range states should conduct such exercises , including cross border corridors and simon hedges agrees simonhedgeswcs 22 november 2016 1 53pmindeed ! elephants do need large areas of habitat and even in africa we are now seeing habitat fragmentation and loss become a significant problem for elephant conservation in asia , of course , habitat loss has long been one of the biggest threats to elephants , which are now largely confined to protected areas , many of which are too small for long term viability and have huge hec problems on their borders maintaining connectivity or restoring it if already lost is essential fortunately , as dan notes there are some encouraging examples from countries such as kenya and india but much more needs to be done in many more places for those feeling far away and helpless , here are some concrete actions you can take today monicawrobel 22 november 2016 1 36pmi agree with lobbying governments these should be considered world heritage animals and as global citizens we can help strengthen that argument and get more resources put towards forest and wildlife departments stronger departments aid better resource management , and not only help provide stability locally , but can stand up for protection of habitat for the good of communities and wildlife preventing environmental damage \( loss of forest , pollution , silting of rivers , floods , polluted water courses \) which de stabilises communities later i also endorse that people worldwide support the conservation organisations that can help direct research and aid to experts and communities for bringing about local solutions no , say most panelists although there are some caveats monicawrobel 22 november 2016 1 52pmi think the quote necessity is the mother of invention applies here some of the most innovative community schemes have come about when trophy hunting was not an option , and then other aid schemes and other government departments participated in community well being , not just under resourced wildlife departments dan stiles says it could work for some species but not elephants kenyadan 22 november 2016 1 47pmi'm not convinced that trophy hunting is essential to conserving elephants , at least elephant hunting , maybe other species it 's a complicated question andrea crosta from elephant action league says wild60 22 november 2016 1 43pmtrophy hunting is often the lazy answer of government that do not want to pro actively protect wildlife and provide local communities with real economic development simon hedges agrees its complicated but also perhaps an issue over egged by both advocates and critics , relative to its potential impact simonhedgeswcs 22 november 2016 2 15pmwhile i would personally never shoot an animal for its trophy there have been some successful examples of trophy hunting for some species generating revenues for and encouraging pro conservation attitudes among local people trophy hunting has the potential to provide those benefits in remote , difficult places where there are few other options for wildlife based landuses trophy hunting can therefore help keep significant areas of land under wildlife land that might otherwise not be so used but in some places trophy hunting operations have practised predator control , introduced species , or bred overly developed trophies all of which are bad for biodiversity conservation so , yes , it 's complicated it is also hard to see that trophy hunting is likely to ever play a significant role in elephant conservation the amount of money generated by trophy hunting is also small relative to the funding needs for conservation in africa , and so in some ways the heated debates post cecil are a distraction from the bigger issues see lindsey p a , balme g a , funston p j , henschel p h hunter l t b \( 2016 \) life after cecil channelling global outrage into funding for conservation in africa conservation letters 9 , 296 301 carey ostrer has asked via email how we go about fighting the illegal trade when it is so lucrative \? dan stiles responds kenyadan 22 november 2016 1 25pmon the demand side , where consumers buy , law enforcement in pretty much every country has proven ineffective if high demand prevails if shops are closed down , traders and consumers move to online websites and members only social media demand must be lowered , but this is a long process monica wrobel of elephant family points out monicawrobel 22 november 2016 1 26pmfrom the words of a wildlife enforcement specialist on illegal trade , investigation and enforcement is still woefully inadequate in the countries that matter \( range states and consumer transit countries \) there 's a need to recognise this is a crime problem and the response needs to be police led customs have demonstrated they have capacity , mandate and therefore little will to investigate the hundreds of ivory seizures made to date many techniques still are n't being adopted , such as controlled deliveries , forensic analysis of crime scenes for links to suspects , and lack of proactive responses sources within the trade have indicated that serious offenders are only afraid of imprisonment if actually prosecuted , yet such a deterrent barely exists and simon hedges of wcs adds simonhedgeswcs 22 november 2016 1 30pmdan is correct to stress the challenges inherent in demand reduction and there needs to be a much greater focus on effecting behavioural change not just raising awareness we have seen to little of the former in demand reduction campaigns to date but demand for wildlife products including ivory and rhino horn has been reduced in the past in a number of countries , so we know it can be done elephants are wild animals and so conflict is hard to avoid , according to the panel consultant dan stiles says we can only control how humans respond kenyadan 22 november 2016 1 28pmfor those who suffer the depredations of elephants , the only thing that has been demonstrated to prevent retaliation is if the people gain tangible benefits very few places have mechanisms in place for that now solutions have to involve communities , says wildlife directs trish sewe trishsewe 22 november 2016 1 34pmconflict between humans and wildlife cannot be avoided however solutions have to come from the people living with wildlife innovative ideas of how to live harmoniously ca n't take a top down approach and they have to build economic prosperity , says simon hedges in a comment too long to post so ill link to it here he also suggests further investigating insurance and other ways to manage or understand the impact on humans simonhedgeswcs 22 november 2016 1 42pmin addition to trying to ensure local people derive direct financial benefits from the presence of wildlife such as elephants whenever possible , a key part of mitigating human elephant conflict \( hec \) or human wildlife conflict \( hwc \) more generally is to adopt a sound evidence based approach to testing and promoting effective hec hwc reduction methods there are methods that can help reduce hec \( under some circumstances at least \) out there but they need to be deployed more effectively approaches such as insurance need to be further tested and developed too most panelists , including simon hedges from wcs , agree that the chinese mean it when they say they will phase out their legal ivory trade simonhedgeswcs 22 november 2016 1 15pmyes , i think the chinese government is serious about shutting down the domestic market in ivory in china that commitment was announced at the highest level in a joint communique from president xi and president obama in september 2015 earlier this year the chinese authorities said publicly that they would announce the timetable for implementing the ban , so we can expect to see that announcement soon but rahul raman points out that there has been little movement since they made their announcement a year ago rahul raman 22 november 2016 1 18pmwhile this is true , chinese govt has n't announced a date , even though hong kong has , which is 2020 can we be sure that china is serious about this , even after we now that officials from high office are involved in the trade \? but isabel hilton , of chinadialogue , points out the difficulty in enforcing laws in a country as vast as china isabelh1 22 november 2016 1 49pmre the ending of the domestic legal trade in china , whiles it will undoubtedly help we should also be aware that it is a recurring pattern in china that good laws can be passed but that enforcement failure can lead to unexpected results china often resists legislation for as long as possible , then acts when the diplomatic costs become too high but that is not the same as effective enforcement china is a very big country , beijing 's reach is less effective than many outsiders imagine , and enforcement may not be a priority if you look at the overall movements in demand , the relatively recent surge in demand from vietnam for both ivory and rhino horn i suspect that the bulk of both are being smuggled into china it 's a change of route rather than a drop in demand dan stiles , who works with the iucn elephant specialist group , believes some news might be imminent kenyadan 22 november 2016 1 54pmi 've heard they will announce the plan in december it will involve a phased closing , allowing ivory traders and factories to dispose of their stocks , as hong kong has done before our panel convenes at 1pm \( gmt \) , here is some reading material that could provoke thoughts and questions will jones , founder of wild

but now new questions are arising how do governments go about shutting down the legal ivory market \? fighting an illegal ivory market could be even harder how do we strengthen forces against the black market \? as human populations move into elephant territory , human elephant conflict is a real and growing problem that may even come to dwarf the ivory trade can we avoid these conflicts \?

this bloodbath of an election , a friend emailed me like watching someone get murdered , another said over the phone and this in an email from a veteran of the vietnam war the third vietnam draft dodger is now commander in chief welcome to the full flowering of the era of trump , which began with that now mytho epic glide down the escalator at trump tower , where trump commenced his candidacy with these historic words when mexico sends its people , theyre not sending their best theyre sending people that have lots of problems , and theyre bringing those problems with us theyre bringing drugs theyre bringing crime theyre rapists and some , i assume , are good people if ever a monument is erected to the trump presidency , then surely these words shades of gettysburg ! will be carved into the marble walls , along with blood coming out of her wherever , fifty bucks a steak and i would bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding in true demagogic fashion , trump bypassed the head and spoke directly to the gut , to the biles and bubbling acids of raw emotion he said things that many civil , temperate americans hardly dared to admit we carried in ourselves were hardly aware of just how deeply we resented our own niceness , how angry our interior lives with all this stuff bottled up , years and years of internalized micro aggression from a culture that kept insisting on diversity , inclusiveness , tolerance many discovered just what a drag political correctness was all these years , and to be free of it , freed from this code that was jamming us up \? that was relief akin to a lung puncturing primal scream from the start trumps rallies had the air of the tent revival , that same hot thrum of militant exorcism and ecstasy lets not fool ourselves , a friend wrote i cant stand anything but cold honesty right now this is not a repub winning the election , which would be bad enough this is white supremacy winning calm down , were tempted to say its really not that bad stances are taken , things get said in the heat of a campaign , and we could take heart in the newly gracious , conciliatory trump on display for several days after the election then came the news that steve bannon , the erstwhile chairman of the trump campaign who bears a striking resemblance to otis , the town drunk on the old andy griffith show , was named senior counselor and chief strategist for the incoming trump administration the mainstream press still feels compelled to explain the term alt right , but we know already , we know , we know , we know white nationalism , aka honky purity \( dont dig too deeply into the family dna ! \) , along with thick , glistening lardings of apocalyptic racism , and a style sense that falls somewhere between springtime for hitler and queer eye for the straight guy prior to his gig on the trump campaign , bannon spent four years as chairman of breitbart news , which he proudly declared to be the platform for the alt right as breitbart chairman , bannon presided over such headlines as gabby giffords the gun control movements human shield , birth control makes women unattractive and crazy and , two weeks after a white nationalist murdered nine members of a bible study group at a black church in charleston , south carolina , hoist it high and proud the confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage find myself not sleeping at night , a friend wrote the first president endorsed by the ku klux klan , noted another then there was obama being obama on the day after the election we have to remember that were actually all on one team a mans character is his fate , as heraclitus said , and what a strange , twisted fate indeed that barack obama cerebral , disciplined , cool , ever seeking to reconcile and accommodate \( as an african american pastor in charleston commented , once his presidency is over , obama will no longer have to be the least threatening black man in america \) has had to deal with an opposition that very much regarded him as not on the team there was the birther movement , for starters the closet muslim conspiracy theories the terrorist fist bump founder of isis teenage crack dealer hanging out on the corner all this damage hes done to america is deliberate , said marco rubio during one of the republican debates , which is a laugh if obama wanted to trash the us , all he had to do on taking office in 2009 was sit on his hands and let the hot mess of the bush economy continue its meltdown to oblivion but the issue is bigger than any particular president after his post election all on one team remark , obama continued the point , though , is that we all go forward with a presumption of good faith in our fellow citizens , because that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant and functioning democracy this goes to the heart of the matter the american system of constitutional government is founded on deliberate fragmentation of power , the separation of powers and checks and balances that we all learned in high school civics for government to be effective for government to meet the needs of the people the us constitutional order requires a healthy measure of good faith cooperation among the players this good faith began to fray in the early 1990s as gop leaders in congress , newt gingrich and tom delay chief among them , declared war on all efforts even from those in their own party to govern from a stance of bipartisan cooperation democrats , in gingrichs world of moral absolutes , were the enemy of normal americans gingrich and his allies were fighting no less than a civil war with liberals , and as he declared in a speech to the heritage foundation , this war has to be fought with a scale and a duration and a savagery that is only true of civil wars and so began the constitutional hardball and scorched earth tactics that have characterized the past quarter century of american politics you may recall the gingrich orchestrated government shutdowns of 1995 and 1995 96 over budget disputes , and the 1998 impeachment of bill clinton for lying about a blowjob in more recent times , there was the famous dinner at a washington fine dining steakhouse on the evening of 20 january 2009 the day of obamas inauguration at which gop congressional leaders \( along with gingrich , by then a highly paid k street lobbyist \) vowed to sabotage obamas presidency by opposing every item on the new presidents economic agenda at a time when 700 , 000 jobs a month were disappearing including those items previously supported or even proposed by the gop \( were all rooting for him , obama said of trump when they met recently in the oval office because if he succeeds , america succeeds \) senate republican leader mitch mcconnell later summed up the gop stance when he publicly stated , the single most important thing we want to achieve is for president obama to be a one term president burying obama was the goal , and if bringing him down required shredding the constitutional order , then to hell with the past 220 years of constitutional order the filibuster , once reserved for only the most major policy disputes , became mcconnells go to weapon , routinely deployed even for small bore matters by withholding funding or refusing to consider appointments to government posts , the senate effectively nullified laws that had been duly enacted in accordance with the constitution at a time when the federal courts had a record number of vacancies , scores of judicial seats went unfilled the current eight months and counting vacancy on the supreme court is merely the most high profile example government shutdowns and debt ceiling crises once unthinkable became so endemic that for the first time in its more than 150 year history , standard poors downgraded the credit rating of the us , citing the recent phenomenon of political brinkmanship even then , gop lawmakers have matter of factly continued to use the threat of government default as a bargaining chip , a nuclear option that , if carried out , would have catastrophic effects on the world economy had the founding fathers wanted gridlock , they wouldnt have replaced the articles of confederation with the constitution but gridlocks been great for the republican party , which has mastered a crude but so far effective trick campaign as the anti government party , on a platform decrying government as dysfunctional and ineffective , then once youre in power pull out all the stops to make sure government is dysfunctional and ineffective maybe this is why congress has lower approval ratings than cockroaches , head lice and zombies , and why mitch mcconnell has the perpetually serene look of a man who sleeps well at night those low approval ratings mean his side is winning that all this has happened at the expense of the constitutional order , and of the spirit of comity and good faith so necessary for the functioning of that order , seems not to trouble mcconnell or his colleagues in the least to call these people conservative is a joke they seek to precious little much more accurate to call them the wrecking crew on this grimmest of mornings and , the faces on the subway today , i will never forget the people want change can you blame us \? weve been sucking wind for 35 years while the 1 rides higher and higher , a trend that began with the reagan revolution , a sea change in american politics which the democratic establishment accepted all too readily it is the poorest people in the world who will pay for this , over and over trickle down economics , free trade , government is the problem , kick labor to the curb the whole supply side package became the default center of political debate , and the increasingly corporate dems offered less and less to working and middle class people as the years went by woke up at 3am thinking , ive failed my kids that the clinton campaign wrote off the white working class vote was not only a political failure , it was a moral failure as well , not to mention emblematic of the past several decades of democratic leadership tell her to go hang out with george w bush in hubris hell trumps campaign spoke to our economic fear and anger with a rawness that clintons didnt even try to match in hindsight , its no surprise that she lost the wisconsin and michigan primaries and very nearly the nomination to bernie sanders , a candidate who tapped into the same populist angst that would give trump no fewer than 290 electoral college votes though one wonders whether all those good working folks who voted for trump realized they were endorsing a huge tax cut for the 1 , and a candidate whose election left k street as giddy as a girl asked to the prom by the handsomest boy in school i wish i thought things would seem even slightly less terrifying in a day or month try some escapist literature i find detailed accounts of the first world war and disastrous arctic expeditions very readable at times like this this system we have , this free market system that grinds huge numbers of people into crumbs , it seems so vast and monolithic most of the time , an unstoppable machine steered by distant , mysterious forces trump seemed to offer a rare chance to throw a wrench into the works , and many took it that theres a much bleaker side to his victory racist , misogynist , xenophobic owes much to certain feelings and impulses that have been steadily nurtured over the years by the republican party if you have doubts about that , read up on the history of the gops notorious southern strategy old demons we thought wed pushed to the fringes , it turns out theyve been right here among us all along , biding their time , waiting for their hour to come around again thats the heartache and for many , more than heartache its a clear and present danger for a minute , tribal identity looked not to be everything fond little daydream nothing optimistic comes to mind , stunned beloveds trumps policy agenda , always a moving target on the campaign trail , is looking even more slippery in the days since the election the wall , that sturdiest beam in the trump platform , might be downgraded to a mere fence in certain areas signature features of the formerly horrible obamacare are actually good , and should remain and that massive deportation force \? maybe not so massive after all this sort of backstroking belies whats been obvious all along trump has never had much in the way of policy goals besides serving the greater good of trump ego will be the guiding principle of the trump presidency in this respect hes much more like a monarch than the duly elected public servant of a representative democracy , and , as monarchs do , he will keep his heirs close to the center of power , ivanka , don jr , eric , and that budding cardinal richelieu of a son in law , jared kushner top security clearances and advisory roles are contemplated for the kids , who at the same time will be running the for profit entities of the sprawling trump organization its hard to imagine a more ethically fraught , legally explosive situation for the children , managing a vast consortium of transnational businesses while being privy to the countrys most sensitive secrets , along with easy access to the most powerful man in the world how will it all play out \? badly look to shakespeare for a taste of the awful potential here , to the tragedies and history plays , those coils of ego and empire and wealth \( and sex and sex and sex ! \) that often end with bodies all over the place the best thing trump could do for his children would be to put his assets in a genuine blind trust , and send the kids away far , far away from washington to do their own thing limit visits to holidays and weekends , bounce the grandkids on his knee , not breathe a word about business or affairs of state but thats not how monarchies roll that trump would put his children in such a legally tenuous position gives us a clear idea as if we needed it from a man who used to rely on the infamous bottom feeder roy cohn for legal counsel of his appreciation for the rule of law here again we can expect the monarchical model people rarely grow in humility once they reach the white house to the extent trump attempts to game , spin and mutilate the rule of law , his most immediate potential check will be a congress thats firmly in republican hands , led by the same wrecking crew thats already shown such faint regard for the constitutional order , with a fire breathing rank and file think freedom caucus egging them on to new lows the institutions , structures and traditions of american governance are about to be tested as they havent

the 2016 presidential election took a heavy toll on the vast army of journalists assigned to cover it , grinding down shoe leather , fingertips and nerve endings in equal measure but for one reporter , daniel dale of the toronto star , the race for the white house was singularly burdensome , turning him into a night owl at the end of each long day on the campaign trail , he would take a deep breath and launch into his second job fact checking the lies of donald trump the work would begin late , often at 2am , when all was quiet and he could sink himself undisturbed into a hot bath of outrageous falsehood hed start by watching recordings of the rallies the republican candidate had addressed that day , scouring his words for deceits that ranged from the whopping \( i opposed the iraq invasion the election is rigged \) to the trivial \( the only way to pronounce nevada is nev ahh da , when in fact most people say nev add a \) then the reporter would scuttle through trumps twitter feed , followed by news outlets and search engines in the hope of catching every statement he made and testing them all for accuracy as the election approached , trumps untruths began to multiply , and with them dales nocturnal hours , until he was at it virtually all night after each of the three televised debates between trump and hillary clinton , and in the final frantic days of the campaign , he pulled all nighters before going straight back to his day job towards the end it was crazy , dale says the only thing that made it easier was that trump repeated himself we called him out for lying but he was so unresponsive he just kept saying the same things from 15 september until 8 november , dale recorded a total of 560 false trump statements , an average of about 20 a day as the sleep deprived reporter staggered into election day , he reflected that if his nighttime activities had reached even a small percentage of the american electorate , and helped them understand the fundamental mendacity of a candidate seeking the most powerful job on the planet , then it would have been worth it then came election night i was as shocked as many other journalists , dale says , recalling trumps steady march towards the 270 electoral votes needed to win despite his own extraordinary late night efforts despite the similarly herculean efforts of the new york times , which dedicated 18 journalists to fact checking the tv debates in real time , or of npr , which turned over 30 staffers to a similar endeavor despite the guardians lyin trump column and so much more , some 61 million americans were unfazed enough by the idea of a serial liar in the oval office to vote for him fact checking wasnt the only journalistic tool that was deployed in 2016 with what now appears to be limited effectiveness many observers assumed the washington posts thundering scoop of trumps hot mic remarks in which he boasted about grabbing women by the pussy , together with megyn kellys astonishing opening question at the first tv debate in which she reminded the candidate that he had called women fat pigs and dogs , would hand female voters , and thus the presidency , to clinton they didnt 53 of white women voted for trump , according to exit polls jorge ramos , the lead news anchor at univision , predicted on election day that trump would lose because he had turned his back on the spanish language media didnt happen almost one in three hispanics backed him , to ramoss bafflement accomplices or antagonists how the media handled the trump phenomenon read morenewspaper endorsements , those most portentous of journalistic institutions , also seemed to have little purchase on the outcome of this convention shattering election the nieman lab counted 360 titles that backed clinton , including the dallas morning news which sided with a democratic candidate for the first time since 1940 , and usa today which endorsed the first presidential candidate , period , in its 36 year history by contrast , trump drew a paltry 11 endorsements such overwhelming consensus from the nations press but was anybody listening \? put all these indicators together , and you start to wonder whether donald trumps unlikely victory has sounded the death knell for the influence and authority of what he and his supporters scathingly call the mainstream media did the msm , in particular cable tv which broadcast his every cough and spittle with almost obsessive dedication , help put him in the white house \? conversely , did the press go too far in abandoning its traditional even handedness and unrestrainedly attacking trump , as rightwing pundits are now suggesting \? looking forward , what will be the role of the established media as we head into the chilly waters of a choppy new era \? those are just some of the glaring questions left hanging at the end of an epically weird election season to begin poking some of those issues , the guardian has teamed up with the columbia journalism review \( cjr \) , a leading source of media criticism it has compiled a unique oral history of the 2016 election through the eyes of 40 of the top tv and press editors , reporters and columnists who helped shape and define the public perception of this years race the narrative runs to 11 , 000 words , with the guardian publishing an edited version of it one of the first big questions that cjrs oral history , in tandem with the guardians own exploration of the subject , throws up is the role of blanket tv coverage in the rise , fall and rise again of president elect trump ben smith , editor in chief of buzzfeed , was quick to spot earlier this year that trumps twitter feed acted not only as a powerful megaphone channeling his voice directly to his followers \( he had 13m of them on twitter on election day , as well as 12m on facebook \) , it also served as a news script for the cable channels trump would tweet out his latest offensive or aggressive tweet , often in the early hours of the morning , and tv news editors arriving at their desks would pick it up and turn it into ratings friendly headlines that would then go on to dominate the rest of the 24 hour news cycle facebook twitter pinterest guardian reporters reflect on challenges of covering 2016 us electionwhat typically drives tv is great reporting by newspapers instead , trump used his tweets as an alternative route to great journalism , and that turned out to have been a very big deal , smith told the guardian the tv channels feasted on tweeted trumpisms with an alacrity that many observers found disturbing according to a study by mediaquant , trump benefited from the equivalent of 5 2bn worth of free airtime from earned media , a quantity that the firms analysts said was almost surreal in sheer magnitude in return , cable channels enjoyed a massive ratings spike tv was convulsed by other controversies , notably cnns decision to employ trumps former campaign manager corey lewandowski while he was still receiving severance payments from his old boss , and the embarrassment \( also falling to cnn \) of democratic strategist donna brazile leaking questions from a town hall event in advance to the clinton campaign more red faces erupted at nbc when its access hollywood tape of trumps lewd comments about women was leaked to the washington post after the network appeared to dither over broadcasting it but these difficulties , humiliating at times though they were , pale in comparison with the overarching charge that tv and to a lesser degree the press was indiscriminate for far too long in its handling of trump , engaging with him more like the apprentice reality tv star that he was than the us president that he wanted to become during the primaries , cable news in particular cnn and fox , and to some extent msnbc gave trump unhealthily generous , inflated coverage that helped make him , says margaret sullivan , media columnist of the washington post it takes someone with the on the ground experience of john weaver , chief strategist to trumps rival john kasich during the republican primaries , to spell out the full impact of this media binge on the election he believes it actively distorted the process , and even now , six months after kasich dropped out of the race , you can still hear the fury in weavers voice i hope theres some deep introspection at the networks and cable channels over the billions of dollars of free coverage they gave to donald trump , often without holding him accountable for his bizarre claims he is judged by such a low standard by many of the news media , its troubling to me the sense that the media allowed itself to be taken for a ride by the trump campaign in exchange for stellar ratings came to a crunch on 16 september in washington dc by now enshrined as republican nominee , trump lured the pack of political reporters to a press conference by promising to make a statement an apology , it was assumed about his long held and oft repeated birther lie about president obama having been born outside the us the location for the event happened to be the old post office on pennsylvania avenue that trump had just renovated into a luxury hotel for 26 minutes he subjected the media , and through them the american people , to a succession of unctuous speeches by retired military leaders singing the candidates praises then , when trump finally got round to issuing a 21 word rebuttal of his own false birther theory , he prefaced it with yet another lie that hillary clinton was responsible for having started the toxic rumor in the first place it was vintage trump almost a half hour of free advertising not only for his presidential campaign but also for his new hotel handed to him on a plate by the cable networks in exchange for a 30 second non apology that made false accusations against his opponent nothing new there , then what was new was the response of the assembled media crowd who had been forced to sit through the ordeal , cameras rolling , keyboards rattling , as though they were so many of trumps dutiful playthings it was a political rick roll fumed cnns jake tapper , referring to the rick astley internet meme , while john king on the same channel lamented we got played again jay rosen , who teaches journalism at new york university and whose blog pressthink org has been a widely cited resource on the fraught relationship between trump and the press in 2016 , sees the dc hotel debacle as a seminal moment thats when people in the campaign press corp got disgusted not just with trumps mendacity and manipulation but at themselves for playing along with it that turned the worm it was an important turning point , agrees kyle pope , cjrs editor and publisher its when reporters said , no more , thats it , enough the response from the new york times was decisive and swift as its political editor carolyn ryan related to a recent cjr roundtable of media executives , she immediately approached the papers executive editor i went to dean baquet and i said , can we call this the unwinding of a lie \? he understood the potency of coming out very directly and saying that , and that what trump had done a willful deceit was far more egregious than some of the fabrications and stretching of the truth that we usually see in politics so he was firmly behind us the resulting piece by michael barbaro marked in itself a seminal moment for the times newsroom , which as ryan pointed out is a fairly traditional institution that until recently struggled with the idea of calling a lie a lie yet in this case the editorial decision to do just that abandoning any attachment to the on the one hand this , but on the other hand that school of journalism came quickly and easily we decided in about 40 minutes , ryan said there has been a lot of discussion this election cycle about how trumps insurgent campaign , its asymmetry as rosen has put it , has shaken up many of the time honored rituals and false equivalencies of political journalism adam moss , new york magazines editor in chief , makes clear that his magazine consciously decided to ditch the journalistic habits of a lifetime we dont pretend to objectivity , but we do , as a rule over the years , try to maintain some kind of even handedness we abandoned that because we felt the threat of his candidacy and presidency was too great the counterpoint to that is that several of the contributors to the cjr oral history express regret that , at least at the outset , the coverage of real estate businessman was seriously flawed , as jorge ramos puts it the billionaire was underestimated as a candidate , and as a result treated initially as a bit of a joke laura mcgann , a politics editor for vox , bravely admits feeling guilty that she assigned a deep dive into trump soon after he launched his campaign in june 2015 to a \( very good \) intern , adding i regret not taking him more seriously a year ago than i did but buzzfeeds ben smith makes the point that , important though such post election soul searching is , it should not obscure the fact that there was plenty of hard hitting reporting done even early on the washingon post , new york times , we at buzzfeed , politico , the guardian and many more , gave a thoroughly detailed account of him anyone who was surprised by the person who emerged during the campaign really wasnt paying attention you only have to credit a tiny portion of the highlights of the coverage this cycle to see how impressive much of it was mckay coppins seminal romp with trump all the way back in 2014 susanne craigs heaven sent package in her times mailbox containing the billionaires leaked tax returns david fahrenthold of the posts work on the trump foundation and his groping scoop ari berman of the nations probe into the real rigging of the election guardian columnist lucia graves interviews with women alleging the candidate sexually assaulted them so what happened to all this solid work \? why did it appear to go up in a puff of smoke on election night \? there is a separate and febrile debate over whether or not opinion polls were in part to blame for giving the impression that the white house was in the bag for clinton , but many other theories are circulating one prevalent idea , as hadas gold of politico tells cjr , is that the media did its job but the public just did not care the new york times political reporter jonathan martin offers an opposite conclusion that the coverage did hit home with voters , as reflected in trumps historically bad popularity ratings to which it might be added that hillary clinton is still winning in the popular vote a third line of inquiry that is likely to run and run is whether the media , in its coastal bubble , failed to get to grips with the anger that was brewing right under its nose in the american heartlands a flick of that argument was given in the missive sent by arthur sulzberger and baquet , publisher and executive editor of the new york times , to their readers soon after the election did donald trumps sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among american voters \? answering his own question , baquet told the guardian us that the times did in fact write extensively about anger in america in the run up to the election , but adds that its a good idea as an editor to be humble enough to ask oneself what questions should have been asked during the campaign nobody , including the trump campaign itself , quite understood the forces that would lead to donald trump being elected in what everybody agrees was a surprise a big part of my job now is to explain that in the coming months , to go out in the country , talk to people who feel anxious about the future of the country , dont caricature them , let them speak just let them talk a more disturbing thought is that while many news outlets took great efforts to chronicle the plight of the white working classes in middle america , their dispatches didnt register with millions of voters for the simple reason that those voters werent reading any of us amid the ongoing muscle of drudge , the new transcendence of breitbart , not to mention the proliferation of fake news sites , conservative americans and for that matter liberals are increasingly able to receive information from within their own alternative bubble where their opinions are reinforced without being challenged by the loathed msm one of the more despairing expressions of this theory was given by new york magazines adam moss to cjr the media as it used to be thought of is just not that important any more it doesnt matter that some people were doing good work because were just talking to ourselves and people who already agree with us since trumps victory , another theory has been aired increasingly by right of center pundits such as howard kurtz of fox news that flips the argument that the media did too little too late to expose trump on its head in this iteration , major outlets did too much , were too eager to go after him the editor of the wall street journal , gerard baker , tells cjr that some reporters saw it as their role to stop this man from becoming president , they put themselves in the role of partisans it fell to piers morgan of mail online , as it often does , to put the case most stridently the nyts ludicrously biased anti trump barrage of bile helped him get elected thats ridiculous , ripostes the times dean baquet we didnt cover donald trump any more aggressively than we covered hillary clinton people forget that we broke the story of clintons emails if both sides think you were tough on them , maybe that means you were fair of all the mainstream media bashing that has been unleashed since 8 november , one source of it stands head and shoulders above the rest donald trump himself which is not surprising , given his track record during the campaign reporters deemed to be producing unfavourable copy were punished by trump jorge ramos was ejected from a press conference after the univision anchor dared to ask an awkward question coppins was turned away from trump rallies as comeuppance for his caustic 2014 profile a lengthening list of other media outlets were banned by the campaign individual journalists were targeted for bullying , such as nbc newss katy tur supporters at campaign stops were enabled to turn in anger against camera operators just doing their jobs , screaming cnn sucks ! cnn sucks ! cnn sucks ! since trumps metamorphosis into president elect , the tendency to target the media has only got worse now he routinely gives the press pool the slip , showing contempt for both transparency and tradition back on his android phone , trump is on the failing new york times warpath , displaying a sort of frenzied disdain that hardly bodes well for the relationship between soon to be president and the countrys paper of record ive never seen anything quite like this , says baquet , who as former editor of the los angeles times and washington bureau chief of the times has seen more than most i dont think weve ever had a president elect tweeting about us , thats for sure as 20 january 2017 and the start of his presidency bears down upon us , much of the media will enter the trump era carrying with them a profound sense of trepidation this is a moment of high danger for the press were heading into a dark period for american democracy and american journalism , says jay rosen of nyu jorge ramos tells cjr i think well remember this election as unique and very concerning for the future of the press because if this becomes the norm , we are in serious trouble its not just the lack of access , mocking and bullying that can be expected from president trump theres also the internal danger that the media will normalize his time in office under the cloak of traditional reverence for the presidency contributors to the cjrs account of 2016 point out that a pattern of normalization was established even on the campaign trail , when media outlets appeared to be willing trump on to elevate himself from his startlingly unconventional approach to a proper presidential mode in the memorable description of tommy craggs , slates politics editor , the candidate could have gone up there and danced the hoochie coochie and they would have said , this is a welcome change in tone from donald trump since the election that trend has thickened , some believe john weaver , the former chief strategist for trumps republican rival john kasich , says he is outraged by media references to steve bannon , the breitbart chairman who trump has appointed his senior counselor in the white house , as a controversial figure or an aggressive conservative no , no , thats sugar coating he was the publisher of the news site that he said was home to the alt right , and that is code for racism and sexism and fascism , weaver said so what will be the role of the mainstream media as it embarks , somewhat battered but still standing , into trumps america \? will it be to document the new administration with a detached and objective eye , as traditional newsroom canons dictate , or will it pursue that other burning function of the fourth estate , holding power to account \? we will cover him fairly and aggressively , and we will not let his criticism of us sway us or keep us from doing what we have to do , says dean baquet of the new york times in my mind our mission is clearer than its ever been we have to cover the giant story of this extraordinary white house , which is going to change american politics and policy for years to come , as aggressively ,

he must be disappointed by that typo in the first line of the email that was my first thought when the following landed in my inbox it might sound shocking and threatening , but i didnt feel shocked or threatened this was just another day on the internet , where people disproportionately women , people of color and queer people are harassed , abused , bullied , intimidated and threatened its what writer umair haque describes as a ceaseless flickering hum of low level emotional violence the women abandoned to their online abusers read moreat around the same time someone , i assume the same person , signed me up to a mailbot service , which meant i received thousands of unsolicited email newsletter sign ups within a few hours thankfully gmails spam filters learn quickly , but it took a 20 minutes of flagging messages to clean up my inbox a mild irritation meanwhile on twitter , someone else was sending me pornographic gifs and asking whether penis size really matters for a lady i blocked him , as im sure i will have to block many others in the future in a tedious game of whack a troll i would love to say that this is atypical , but its not in fact , id go as far as to say that this feels entirely pedestrian , just your regular run of the mill rape threats and dreary dick pics for one of my colleagues , normal is dealing with racial slurs or having her profile photo edited to have jew horns for a male colleague , its people telling him to commit suicide or saying they want his kids to die if we complain about these microaggressions , were either overreacting or feeding the trolls but if we dont speak up , were letting them get away with it paralysed by this dilemma , we fall back on swatting the antagonists away like flies and , perhaps as a coping strategy , telling ourselves that its normal most of the time , the flies are few and far between but you only have to look at the relentless campaigns of hate against public figures like ghostbusters actor and comedian leslie jones , olympic diver tom daley or games developer zoe quinn to see what happens when the flies form a swarm it becomes overwhelming , exhausting and incredibly difficult for the individual or the police to make case by case judgements on what constitutes a credible threat if youre in the media you are familiar with how things work online , but for an average person these types of interactions could be terrifying , said whitney phillips , author of this is why we cant have nice things so how did we get here \? and what should we do about it \? many cyberbullies are aggrieved middle aged white men who feel like they werent given the fantasy life they were owedbailey poland , author of hatersdetermined bullies have always found ways to antagonize others , but digital tools have given them new powers fifty years ago if you wanted to wind up a co worker you could write anonymous messages and leave them on his or her desk you could tease that person , but there would be no archive and it couldnt be amplified it could potentially be upsetting but it wouldnt be indexed in google search , said phillips its the ability of google search to index abuse or what she calls ambivalent play that changes the ethical stakes your online history follows you around , meaning those targeted struggle to move on and have a fresh start trolling and cyberbullying have been part of the internet since its inception a side effect of anonymity and unfettered free expression , both critical pillars of the web once restricted to niche forums and chatrooms with their own codes of conduct , ubiquitous social media has brought it into the mainstream there used to be so few people occupying those digital spaces and the people who were were a lot more homogenous than what you see now , said phillips more homogenous means more white , and more male it isnt just teenagers in their parents basements a lot of them are otherwise very well adjusted normal adult men with wives and children and full time jobs , said bailey poland , author of haters many of them fall into the camp of very aggrieved middle aged white men who feel like they werent given the fantasy life they were owed they tend to take it out on people who are happy , successful or present in a way that makes them feel uncomfortable thats not to say that white men dont get harassed online , but that harassment is more frequently directed at members of historically underrepresented populations whose voices have not always been privileged the people who have always had their voices taken seriously tend to be the antagonists , said phillips , arguing that it comes from a sense of disenfranchisement the trump effectits that same sense of disenfranchisement that propelled donald trump to the white house with a campaign that normalized identity based antagonism he says absurdly offensive degrading things about women and people of color and specific groups whether thats mexicans , muslims , whatever he says these terrible things and that normalizes hate speech in mainstream discourse its so normal to open up cnn or any news app and see bigotry , says phillips the tenor of discourse that trump and his associates have been engaging in has emboldened some people to say we are in charge now and we can say whatever we want , adds kate miltner , a phd student at usc annenberg school of communication and journalism trumps locker room comments about sexually harassing women are a reflection of the normalization of violence against women sexual threats and rape threats are a form of domination that has been used against women for all of time it ties into seeing women as not fully human and having their value contingent on whether or not they are worthy of raping , said poland the media , in an effort to draw attention to the bigotry , ends up amplifying it some publications might be trying to troll readers , but some are just calling attention to it but inadvertently or not it ends up incentivizing more problematic behavior , said phillips this opens up the vexing question of whether or not to feed the trolls im wary of that framing as it comes with a victim blaming undercurrent the message is if you dont give them attention you wont get harassed , said phillips poland suggests keeping a record of posts in case a situation escalates and then reporting the perpetrator where possible individuals should make up their minds about whether they respond , mute or ignore , following online safety guides like this one or this one counter memephillips offers an alternative way to handle such trolls by creating a countermeme contribute to an active , explicit pushback against these behaviors as opposed to repeating them , she said its about taking more control of that narrative , so that the antagonist is no longer the center of the universe miltner suggests the rest of the online community can help here showing solidarity is important , asking how you can help is important basically trying to take a stand and say this is not acceptable phillips agrees the same behaviors that can marginalize and denigrate and traumatize can really bring a group together , making them feel good and pro social my paltry effort was to take a screengrab of the email and share it on twitter with a pithy comment mocking the sender it was not an act of fear or a cry for help , but an act of defiance i am not intimidated by you and i am not alone the post triggered messages of support and wonderful jokes from friends and acquaintances that reminded me of all of the lovely people on the internet olivia solon \( oliviasolon \) it 's like sophie 's choice pic twitter com 4aftcrrqjkseptember 30 , 2016if were very generous , we might say that were still in the early stages of internet settlement and that we will all start to become more civilized google , facebook , twitter , snapchat and others might rally to create better tools for tackling the low level abuse and funnelling real threats towards law enforcement its a start , but not a fix the disproportionate harassment of women , people of color and queer people reflects underlying social , culturally embodied issues these are problems that exist offline being brought to attention in new and imaginative ways these problems have nothing to do with the internet , so the idea that we could have an internet solution is erroneous , said phillips we need to deal with and mitigate systemic racism and sexism how do you get rid of rape culture \? the fact that women tell themselves stories to justify the horrible treatment they receive speaks to the depth of the cultural issues that underpin the behavior the free speech myththe us and silicon valley in particular has a very specific libertarian view of free speech , typified by john perry barlows 20 year old declaration of independence of cyberspace , which said we cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat attempts to clamp down on online harassment are frequently described as infringing on free speech , especially in the us its just people expressing their opinions no matter how racist , sexist or unpalatable and so society appeals to the constitutionally enshrined right to protect the words of antagonists its certainly true that censorship is damaging to democracy , but the damage is taking place in the opposite direction when you cede the floor to the most violent , bigoted contributors that tends to marginalize and silence members of the group they are targeting , said phillips that leads to a reduction in the number of voices contributing to discourse , all in the name of free speech a more robust understanding of free speech is about trying to cultivate and protect the greatest amount of speech from the most diverse groups of people its about having more people talking , not fewer people shouting or , as phillips eloquently puts it antagonism silences and that infringes peoples free speech far more significantly than telling some asshole to shut his mouth topicswomentwitteremailinternetcomputingfeaturesshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on

a handy explainer from the southern california earthquake center seismologists label an earthquake as an aftershock using two guidelines first , the earthquake must occur within an aftershock zone , which is usually defined as the region within one fault rupture length of the mainshock rupture surface or the area defined by seismologists based on previous aftershock activity second , it must happen within this zone before the seismicity rate in the area returns to its pre mainshock level an earthquake that meets these two specific criteria is considered an aftershock pointing out that

its been three years since protesters gathered on the streets of kiev to demand an end to a government they believed was no longer fit for purpose the demonstration triggered a chain of events that led to russia annexing crimea and war in eastern ukraine thousands have been killed and 1 5 million people displaced but as russias foreign policy interests shift to syria and the baltics , we have asked young ukrainians how the past three years have been for them , and what they think the future holds when euromaidan started , i knew i had been ready for it all my lifewhen euromaidan started , i knew i had been ready for it all my life finally , a solution to ukraines rotting post totalitarian kleptocracy more than 1 million of us gathered in kievs central square and together we felt strong enough to make ukraine a country where people would choose to live i joined the protests and spent day and night in the headquarters of the resistance , where it felt like the future of ukraine depended on whether our wooden shields would withstand the attacks of the government riot police i translated news into english from the barricades and helped coordinate media efforts occasionally i would go home and sleep i opened my own website , euromaidan press , to tell the story of what was happening i wanted to provide an alternative narrative for the english speaking world , one different from the russian press who branded us the nazi junta and called us dangerous nationalists and radicals but three years on , i am left feeling that ukraine is treated as no more than a diplomatic pawn a country that has always been bullied , by both former soviet occupiers and modern global powers the western media also treats ukraine as an object , the thing that made relations with russia go sour but there are other stories to be told , like our citizens still having their rights oppressed and the daily information war we continue to fight with russia alya shandra , 32 , kiev i refuse to hate the people who want to separate from usi am originally from starobelsk in eastern ukraine my mother is a native russian who doesnt speak ukrainian and has never been to a ukrainian speaking city my father is a traditional ukrainian and has vowed to be first in line to volunteer if an army if the pro russian rebels comes to town my town was russian speaking and i grew up feeling that russia and ukraine were two countries with a common history , fairytales and culture but after the war i am no longer able to understand the situation as clearly there is so much propaganda trying to pit one side against the other , but i refuse to hate the people who want to separate from the rest of the country as im from the luhansk region , i understand its not that they think ukraine is bad , its just that they believed their lives would be better in russia dasha prokaza , 21 , lvivpeople think one day we will be brothers and sisters again we wontthe most frequently misunderstood thing about ukraines relationship with russia is that one day we will be brothers and sisters again my city of odessa witnessed a big tragedy on 2 may 2014 when pro russians attacked a pro ukraine march i was on my way to a football match but i stopped by to see what going on i had a camera and , as i was running between the two camps , bullets , stones and molotov cocktails started to fly on the corner of the main street in odessa , deribasovskaya , someone called me by name and i took a few steps towards him moments later a man was killed on the spot where i had been standing by the end of the day , the death toll had exceeded 40 more than two years have passed and the official investigation cannot determine who was responsible for sparking the violence , or why the authorities did nothing to stop it spreading journalists have tried to make sense of what happened , as have independent experts , but we still dont have official closure history shows us that it is difficult for people recover from conflicts if there have been a large number of victims , especially if those responsible have not been held to account but without this , how can we be friends \?

paul dirac had an eye for beauty in one essay , from may 1963 , the british nobel laureate referred to beauty nine times it makes four appearances in four consecutive sentences in the article he painted a picture of how physicists saw nature but the word beauty never defined a sunset , nor a flower , or nature in any traditional sense dirac was talking quantum theory and gravity the beauty lay in the mathematics what does it mean for maths to be beautiful \? it is not about the appearance of the symbols on the page that , at best , is secondary maths becomes beautiful through the power and elegance of its arguments and formulae through the bridges it builds between previously unconnected worlds when it surprises for those who learn the language , maths has the same capacity for beauty as art , music , a full blanket of stars on the darkest night the slow movement of the mozart clarinet concerto is a really beautiful piece of music , but i dont print off a page of the score and put that on my wall its not about that its about the music and the ideas and the emotional response , says vicky neale , a mathematician at oxford university its the same with a piece of mathematics its not how it looks , its about the underlying thought processes brain scans of mathematicians show that gazing at formulae considered beautiful by the beholder elicits activity in the same emotional region as great art and music the more beautiful the formula , the greater the activity in the medial orbito frontal cortex so far as the brain is concerned , maths has beauty just like art there is common neurophysiological ground , says sir michael atiyah , an honorary professor of mathematics at edinburgh university ask mathematicians about the most beautiful equation and one crops up time and again written in the 18th century by the swiss mathematician , leonhard euler , the relation is short and simple ei 1 0 it is neat and compact even to the naive eye but the beauty comes from a deeper understanding here the five most important mathematical constants are brought together eulers formula marries the world of circles , imaginary numbers and exponentials the beauty of other formulae may be more obvious with e mc2 , albert einstein built a bridge between energy and mass , two concepts that had previously seemed worlds apart maggie aderin pocock , the space scientist , declared it the most beautiful equation and she is in good company why is it so beautiful \? because it comes to life now energy will have mass and mass can be put into energy these four symbols capture a complete world its difficult to imagine a shorter formula with more power , says robbert dijkgraaf , director of the institute for advanced study in princeton , where einstein was one of the first faculty members one of the reasons theres almost an objective beauty in mathematics is that we use the word beautiful also to indicate the raw power in an idea the equations or results in mathematics that are seen to be beautiful are almost like poems the power per variable is something that is part of the experience just seeing a huge part of mathematics or nature being described with just a few symbols gives a great sense of elegance or beauty , dijkgraaf adds a second element is you feel its beauty is reflecting reality its reflecting a sense of order thats out there as part of the laws of nature the power of an equation to connect what seem like completely unrelated realms of mathematics comes up often marcus du sautoy , a maths professor at oxford , has more than a soft spot for riemanns formula published by bernhard riemann in 1859 \( the same year charles darwin stunned the world with on the origin of species \) , the formula reveals how many primes exist below a given number , where primes are whole numbers divisible only by themselves and one , such as 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 and 11 while one side of the equation describes the primes , the other is controlled by zeros this formula turns these these indivisible prime numbers , into something completely different , says du sautoy on the one side , youve got these indivisible prime numbers and then riemann takes you on this journey to somewhere completely unexpected , to these things which we now call the riemann zeros each of these zeros gives rise to a note and its the combination of these notes together which tell us how the primes on the other side are distributed across all numbers more than 2 , 000 years ago , the ancient greek mathematician , euclid , solved a numerical puzzle so beautifully that it still makes neale smile every time it comes to mind when i think about beauty in mathematics , my first thoughts are not about equations for me its much more about an argument , a line of thinking , or a particular proof , she says euclid proved there are infinitely many prime numbers how did he do it \? he began by imagining a universe where the number of primes was not infinite given a big enough blackboard , one could chalk them all up he then asked what happened if all these primes were multiplied together 2 x 3 x 5 and so on , all the way to the end of the list , and the result added to the number 1 this huge new number provides the answer either it is a prime number itself , and so the original list was incomplete , or it is divisible by a smaller prime but divide euclids number by any prime on the list and always there is a 1 left over the number is not divisible by any prime on the list it turns out you reach an absurdity , a contradiction , says neale the original assumption that the number of primes is finite must be wrong the proof for me is really beautiful it takes some thinking to get your head around it , but it doesnt involve learning lots of difficult concepts its surprising that you can prove something so difficult in such an elegant way , neale adds behind beautiful processes lie beautiful mathematics well , some of the time hannah fry , a lecturer in the mathematics of cities at ucl spent years staring at the navier stokes equations theyre a single mathematical sentence that is capable of describing the miraculously beautiful and diverse behaviour of almost all of earths fluids , she says with a grasp of the formulae , we can understand blood flow in the body , make boats glide through the water , and build awesome chocolate enrobers in his 1963 essay , dirac elevated beauty from an aesthetic response to something far more profound a route to the truth it is more important to have beauty in ones equations than to have them fit experiment , he wrote , continuing it seems that if one is working from the point of view of getting beauty in ones equations , and if one has really a sound insight , one is on a sure line of progress shocking at first pass , dirac captured what is now a common sentiment when a beautiful equation seems at odds with nature , the fault may lie not with the maths , but in applying it to the wrong aspect of nature truth and beauty are closely related but not the same , says atiyah you are never sure that you have the truth all you are doing is striving towards better and better truths and the light that guides you is beauty beauty is the torch you hold up and follow in the belief that it will lead you to truth in the end something approaching faith in mathematical beauty has led physicists to draw up two of the most compelling descriptions of reality supersymmetry and string theory in a supersymmetric universe , every known type of particle has a heavier , invisible twin in string theory , reality has 10 dimensions , but six are curled up so tight they are hidden from us the mathematics behind both theories are often described as beautiful , but it is not at all clear if either is true there is a danger here for mathematicians beauty is a fallible guide you can literally be seduced by something that is not correct this is a risk , says dijkgraaf , whose institute motto , truth and beauty features one naked and one dressed woman sometimes i feel that physicists , like odysseus , must tie themselves to the mast of the ship so they are not seduced by the sirens of mathematics it may be that mathematicians and scientists are the only groups that still use the word beautiful without hesitation it is rarely employed by critics of literature , art or music , who perhaps fear it sounds superficial or kitschy im very proud that in mathematics and science the concept of beauty is still there i think its an incredibly important concept in our lives , says dijkgraaf the sense of beauty we experience in maths and science is a multidimensional sense of beauty we dont feel its in any conflict with being deep , or interesting , or powerful , or meaningful for the mathematician its all captured by that one word topicsbrain wavesmarcus du sautoyphysicsshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
for someone who made his career writing about and founding media organisations , rafat ali is surprisingly downbeat about what they can achieve if anything , the trump election has shown that we are ascribing too much value to what media can do , he says a week after donald trumps victory it has its role , it has to continue to do its role , its even more important today but the view that it will somehow change the world and change peoples minds , or give people the right path , its just too much to ask hes not alone in doubting the extent of the established medias influence following an election result which almost no outlet predicted and very few supported but in the post election autopsy , many commentators have said at least some of the blame should be laid at the door of facebook and its fake news filled filter bubbles ali shares their concerns , particularly about the parallel world where people have no connection to reality in which many millions of us citizens appear to live just the fact of what they believe about muslims , that hillary is doing this or obama is doing this its just crazy but he says many of the complaints from those working in tv or newspapers stem from an unrealistic belief in their own impact i think that while obviously this is a huge problem , we are trying to get out of media way more than its capable of giving , he says its not like if the majority of the media goes away , or a big proportion of the media goes away , that suddenly people are going to miss it ali has first hand experience of the impermanence of media from paidcontent his first company , which lasted not much more than a decade he launched the site in 2002 , taking what was then a relatively novel approach by applying lessons from one part of the media , such as the recording industry , to other areas such as newspapers , which were grappling with the disruptive powers of the internet it was acquired in 2008 by guardian media group for an undisclosed sum in the millions of pounds it was run as a standalone business and ali stayed until 2010 before leaving to travel the world for two years in early 2012 , gmg sold paidcontent to another digital media site , gigaom , which later that year shuttered the brand and itself closed in 2015 meanwhile , ali had returned from his trip with a plan to apply paidcontents connecting the dots approach to the world of travel and in the summer of 2012 he launched a business called skift with travel journalist jason clampet while most of those writing about the travel industry were focused on one sector such as airlines or hotels , ali based his plan on the realisation that travellers simply see an end to end process of getting around the world that seemed to leave a gap for a media organisation taking a more holistic approach while writing in a less stuffy , more accessible way than the established trade press in the early days , ali , who operated as skifts chief executive , planned to use the sites reporting as a foundation from which to sell data about travel , starting with the way it was marketed online however , things did not go to plan , and while trying to drum up investment in 2014 , he hit a brick wall i wasnt able to raise the round , he says it was the most humbling six months of my professional career we were three months away from running out of money we were 10 or 12 people at that point we had a famous as in famous in our company moment when we went to iceland for our first off site it was a very seminal moment for us as it was supposed to be a celebration of us closing the round ali and the team tried to work out how to continue growing without any outside investment the answer was to drop plans to sell data and focus on more established ways of making money in skifts case , research , events and \( native \) advertising two and a bit years later , ali says the business is now profitable , with double digit revenue growth heading for upwards of 10m a year within the next 18 months traffic is not huge , around 1 5 million visitors a month , but skifts priority is its list of email subscribers , which stands at more than 265 , 000 the company now employs close to 40 people , mostly at its new york headquarters , and is expanding into europe with hires such as a uk editor based in london though he chose to build his second company around travel , ali did not stop wading into arguments about the travails of established media companies , including the guardian he says most mainstream outlets are operating more like drive by media , where you hope and pray you show up in a feed , but he doesnt pretend to have all the answers i dont have a prescription for any of those people , he says its hard always , even in our business which is doing very well people say oh my god you guys are doing so well and i say yes , then i look back thinking holy shit , if they knew how hard it is to build a media company its always going to be hard and trumps victory is going to make things harder , not just for the media but also the travel industry , which ali says is facing a huge challenges from the insular ideologies that are taking over western politics i think trump has already said a lot of things that will enervate people coming to the us even if he does half the things he said it will have a bad effect on the travel industry his rhetoric stands directly opposite to what the promise of travel stands for the most progressive expression of human curiosity fringe is the new mainstream it is worrying for everyone , especially for europe which sits at the centre of immigration issues is there a link between digital filter bubbles and the new geographical isolationism taking hold of western politics \? ali says theres a direct line from how we have created a monoculture around ourselves , in many ways as a result of digital , that has led to the rise of neo isolationism and a virtual reality which manifests itself in believing in fake news the dispiriting picture ali paints is tempered by a belief in both the power of travel to increase understanding and the more outward looking and tolerant views of younger generations , even if they will take one or two decades to assert themselves the good news is that the world is travelling more , he says its not like saying after the first internet bubble burst , oh the internet is over it turns out that people continued to use the internet the number of people travelling from different parts of the world china , india , south east asia is going to continue to rise demography , which is changing in the us , is essentially the ultimate foil for any kind of isolationism same in uk , same in europe the young , much as us older people like to laugh at millennials , the reality is that they are a ton smarter than we were as kids so thats the hope and what else is there to hope for \? cvage 42education aligarh muslim university , india , computer engineering , graduated in

the autumn statement on wednesday will be the first time in 10 years george osborne will be nowhere in sight for a major fiscal event there will be many who breathe a sigh of relief at that alone but his presence will be heavily felt not least as the budget last march contained a black hole as the decisions he had made for the previous six years started to catch up with him however , it also poses the first major test for the new chancellor , philip hammond i ask him a simple question will you genuinely change course on the economy \? it is a simple yes or no question , but it defines the entire approach he takes to this years autumn statement if the brexit vote taught us anything it is that many people are demanding change the chancellor and the prime minister may want to blame brexit for our current economic plight but , as a recent leaked treasury document shows , the damage to public finances was done before the referendum brexit has simply exposed the fact that the last six years were wasted and that the tory economic policy they supported every step of the way has failed so many in our country the budget in march was a prelude to wednesday , when the tories are set to fail by their own measure breaching their own fiscal targets set out in the 2015 conservative manifesto they said they would cap welfare spending and yet they have breached their own cap while punishing working families they said they would increase business investment with huge corporation tax giveaways , but it is decreasing and companies are sitting on huge cash piles , not investing yet most of all they have failed because they did not equip our economy for the challenges that brexit poses the tories have no answers to meet the task ahead last week , i gave a speech in which i said we now need a positive approach to brexit let me be clear i will continue to oppose a hard tory brexit that is because the tories want to take a trump lite approach with a minuscule increase in infrastructure investment , a pernicious immigration policy , the destruction of workplace rights and environmental protections , alongside a race to the bottom in taxes for the rich and in wages for the rest of us labour will oppose them every step of the way in parliament and insist on full accountability for their negotiating positions as a democrat , i respect the referendum result not to do so would sow even deeper divisions within our society but that does not mean we cannot use the period of the brexit negotiations positively to work with our socialist , social democrat and progressive friends in europe to construct a new relationship based upon solidarity , co operation and democracy labour has long argued that there are aspects of current single market regulations that should be reformed the brexit negotiations provide an opportunity to work with european partners to advance those reforms , such as state aid rules and enforced deregulation and privatisation labour will press the government to take up that opportunity we must move the debate on from the divisions of the referendum and bring people together we must look to the future , not the past the tories have no more a plan for our economy than they do for brexit it is why their handling of the brexit negotiations has descended into a shambles and why theyre now making up deals factory by factory as the foreign secretary said , it looks like a tory brexit will be a titanic success in addition , they still put the rich ahead of the rest of us by making working families pay for the giveaways to a wealthy few for instance , 0 3 of the population are getting a tax cut worth 3 , 000 a year on average , while cuts to universal credit will leave more than two million families on average of 2 , 100 a year worse off austerity was always a political choice , not an economic necessity that is why we need an autumn statement that is on the side of working families and with polices that are equipping our economy for the future the autumn statement must meet labours three tests first , we need a credible fiscal framework , which is crucial not just for the public finances but also to help us to invest in our economy so we can create jobs and growth the government should target a balanced current budget five years ahead and separate capital expenditure from day to day spending to best do this they should replace the fiscal framework with labours fiscal credibility rule we would also set up a national investment bank with a regional banking network it would mean we could invest properly in our country and start to address regional inequality in contrast , the governments commitment to the northern powerhouse has always been a media exercise , just like the now forgotten big society the government is only paying lip service to people in the north of england , but it cant continue to just re announce old schemes , it needs to deliver on them the fact that only one in five projects in the infrastructure pipeline is in construction shows that the government has not been meeting its own promises the hull selby rail electrification plan has been cancelled in the last few weeks and the government is failing to commit seriously to develop hs3 for the north of england labour wants to set up a bank of the north so that we can channel the vital funding and investment that the region needs second , we need actual support for those in work on low and middle incomes , who will struggle as prices rise the chancellor can start by introducing a real living wage he needs to provide honest solutions to the childcare crisis furthermore , he should reverse the giveaways to the wealthy and reverse those cuts , such as universal credit and employment and support allowance , to low and middle earners many people are indeed just about managing , but that is directly due to tory economic policies that have favoured a rich few over the rest of us , and left many in our country behind while a few at the top have soared ahead third , we need secure and properly funded public services with the nhs at breaking point , with a 2 5bn deficit , and social care in crisis , with one million people not receiving the care they need , there can be no more fudges on funding the same applies to local authority funding , which has been cut at nearly every fiscal event under the tories ultimately , the autumn statement needs to be ambitious for britain by signalling a genuine change by philip hammond , not more cuts and half measures austerity should not be delayed , but ended once and for all otherwise it will just provide further proof why only a labour government can ensure no one and no community is left behind topicsautumn statement 2016opinionphilip hammondeconomic

i dont remember exactly how old i was when i first discovered , but i was quite young , maybe 14 or 15 i grew up in louisville , kentucky , and there was a wonderful independent bookstore in town , a place called hawley cooke , where , since i was a bookish kid , i spent pretty much every friday night this store had a section dedicated to lesbian and gay literature , tucked away in a back corner , and each time i went i would spend a few sweaty minutes there before i snatched a title and carried it to another part of the store to sit and read i have mixed feelings about lesbian and gay sections in bookstores now , but it was a wonderful resource for the pre internet kid i was as a student in kentuckys public schools , which means i wasnt getting much of a literary education , i didnt have any idea what names to look for i chose books almost at random , based on their titles , i guess , or their covers , a method that led me to edmund white , yukio mishima , jeanette winterson , baldwin its hard to overstate what those books meant , growing up in the american south , or the solace i took from them and from their vision of queer life as possessed of a measure of human dignity it didnt matter that that dignity was so often the dignity of tragedy it was still a kind of antidote to shame the whole novel is a kind of anatomy of shame , of its roots and the myths that perpetuate it , of the damage it can doshame is one of the central subjects of , published in 1956 and recounting a tormented love affair in paris between the american narrator , david , and giovanni , an italian bartender but thats not stating it strongly enough the whole novel is a kind of anatomy of shame , of its roots and the myths that perpetuate it , of the damage it can do and also of its arbitrariness , since as rebuttal to any claim that shame might be some natural accoutrement of queerness the belief that lies at the heart of davids malaise the novel offers the fact of giovanni , who seems immune to shame , or at least to the shame that plagues david and it is this freedom that makes him available to the joy and love david finally believes men cant share with one another that was the balm of the book when i first read it , the sense it gives that the tragedy it recounts is anything but inevitable , the result not of some ineluctable dynamic of same sex desire but of the limitations of david , a grievously damaged man i read again in college , and once more after that , several years later , when i considered assigning it to my high school students in ann arbor , michigan i read it again recently because i was asked to speak on it , which i had been asked to do because it has often been referenced in discussions of my own novel i knew that i owed the book a great deal , and its a debt im eager to acknowledge but i hadnt realised until this recent rereading , which was also the first time i read the book as a novelist , just how much i had learned from it i had never studied fiction before i wrote my first novel all of my education in craft was of this unconscious kind , an imitation of things i admire in the books i love i remembered , of course , the narrative elements my book shares with james baldwins an american narrator abroad , overcome by feeling that , for all its force , runs hot and cold , desire wrangled with ambivalence but i was struck this time by formal and stylistic strategies i think i must have first encountered in the book i hadnt read henry james when i discovered , and so i suspect this was the first time i had encountered a novelist tracking jamesian microclimates of feeling , something baldwin does throughout the novel to great effect theres a marvellous moment just before david and giovanni meet , when david moves through a crowd of men excited by the presence of the new bartender it was like moving into the field of a magnet or like approaching a small circle of heat but what i admire most in the book is its peculiarly lyrical conception of time the novel is framed by present tense scenes set at the end of the drama , in the night before giovanni is going to be executed this frees baldwin from any of the sometimes clunky strategies of narrative withholding and suspense all of the books major plot points are declared in the first pages we know that david has abandoned giovanni , we know that davids ex fiancee hella has returned to the united states , we know that giovanni has been sentenced to die theres a strange kind of pleasure in disclosing so much of the story up fronttheres a strange kind of pleasure in disclosing so much of the story up front placing the point of telling here gives baldwin access to the entire narrative at every point , allowing him to move freely back and forth across the entire timeline of the action on the first page of the book , david casts forward into the future , imagining the bus ride he will take to paris on the second , he remembers meeting hella immediately after this first scene , the book dives into the deep past of davids childhood this rather extraordinary freedom with time is put to very moving effect at several points in the novel , perhaps most of all when , in giving a sense of davids few happy weeks with giovanni , baldwin both holds time in abeyance and allows us to track its passage he does this by means of a generalised , flyover narration of a typical day morning , noon and night that is interrupted by scenes in which we can hear the pleading of an increasingly agitated and perplexed giovanni i said that the book gave me , as a teenager in kentucky , an antidote to shame but its also true that the book gives rather horrifying voice to davids self loathing disgust at homosexuality theres an extraordinarily painful passage early on , just before david meets giovanni , when he observes a group of effeminate gay men he describes them through a series of animal metaphors , first as parrots , then as peacocks occupying a barnyard finally , in an image that pains me every time i read it , david says of a young man in drag that his utter grotesqueness made me uneasy perhaps in the same way that the sight of monkeys eating their own excrement turns some peoples stomachs they might not mind so much if monkeys did not so grotesquely resemble human beings is one of baldwins only fictional works the other is a very short story in which all of the characters are white he said in interviews that he didnt feel he could tackle at one time the dual agonies of racism and hatred of gay people , but in fact race runs throughout the book , not least in this horrifying image , which is radioactive with the iconography of american racism homosexuality is portrayed in racial terms repeatedly in joey , the childhood friend with whom david spent one passionate night , is described repeatedly as brown and dark giovanni himself is dark and leonine more pointedly , hes imagined in this first scene as standing on an auction block race is an imaginary category , under constant negotiation its worth remembering that in america , not long before , italians and other southern europeans were viewed as non white facebook twitter pinterest garth greenwell whats the good of an american who isnt happy \? photograph murdo macleod for the guardianamerica is among the novels deepest preoccupations , and this too is something that struck me in a new way as i reread baldwins novel after having written my own maybe its true that all books about americans abroad are finally books about america certainly its the deep subject of henry jamess novels , maybe particularly in which was baldwins favourite i think its the profoundest experience of living abroad when one discovers , maybe for the first time , what home means or what home meant , since the meaning seems so much to depend on its loss you dont have a home until you leave it , giovanni tells david , and then , when you have left it , you never can go back for baldwin , american identity is a form of defence , a series of myths meant to insulate one from unbearable realitiesfor baldwin , american identity and in his essays he makes clear that he means white american identity is an elaborate form of defence , a series of myths meant to insulate one from unbearable realities to be american , giovanni says in his first conversation with david , is to believe that with enough time and all that fearful energy and virtue you people have , everything will be settled , solved , put in its place and when i say everything i mean all the serious , dreadful things , like pain and death and love , in which you americans do not believe this first conversation is full of flirtation and play later , giovanni restates this with infinite bitterness you do not know any of the terrible things , he says , and david , finally , agrees with him , once he has himself tasted real bitterness , once he has lost what he calls the peculiar innocence and confidence , which will never come again the books most famous lines about america are given to hella she delivers them in her final scene americans should never come to europe , she says it means they never can be happy again whats the good of an american who isnt happy \? happiness was all we had she doesnt tell us exactly what she means by happiness , but i think for its clearest articulation we should return to that first , flirting scene between giovanni and david what do you believe , david asks him , and giovanni responds i dont believe in this nonsense about time time is just common , its like water for a fish and you know what happens in this water , time \? the big fish eat the little fish thats all the big fish eat the little fish and the ocean doesnt care oh please , i said i dont believe that times not water and were not fish and you can choose not to be eaten and also not to eat not to eat , i added quickly , turning a little red before his delighted and sardonic smile , the little fish , of course to choose ! cried giovanni , turning his face away from me to choose ! he turned to me again ah , you are really an american american happiness is this peculiar innocence , then , the belief that one can choose , and without great sacrifice or cost , to be good , by which i mean to be exempt from necessity , to move through the world without causing harm this is what david loses , and perhaps emphasising this loss is the most important effect of baldwins beginning the novel where he does , at the end , with david lost in a kind of moral nakedness is , finally , a book about an american stripped of the myths of america , most of all the story we love to tell ourselves about the possibility of new beginnings and clean starts that is to say , the impossibility of anything irrevocable ever happening to us but now something has happened to david that can never be made right and from which he cant simply walk away and this is the most important justification for how baldwin uses time in the novel now davids past will always be his present perhaps home is not a place , david thinks , in a haunting line , but simply an irrevocable condition he is thinking of his homosexuality this thought occurs to him as he realises a passing sailor has seen the desire he wasnt fully aware he was feeling but even more than desire , it is grief for giovanni and guilt over his fate that provide david his irrevocable condition , an identity he finally cant pretend to shed his disconsolate and deeply unamerican home garth greenwells novel is published by

one day during his last year at primary school , jon adams drew a picture of a street in portsmouth , the city where he still lives the scene he drew had no people in it , but its representation of everything else suggested a talent beyond his years the headteacher happened to see the picture , and said he wanted to put it up in the schools entrance hall and that was an honour , adams says , particularly for someone who didnt think they were any good , because theyd been told they werent any good , every day adams was asked to write his name on the back , an instruction that threw up a choice he had difficulties with writing , and he knew his class teacher could be cruel if i asked for help , i knew what he would say oh , he cant even spell his own name , what rubbish is that \? so i did it myself the teacher called adams to the front of the class i went up , gave it to him , he held it up in front of the class , and then he tore it up he said , hes spelled his name wrong hell never be anything this happened 45 years ago in recent years , adams has been treated for post traumatic stress disorder , caused at least partly by that episode , and how long it lived on , not just in his memory , but in his understanding of the world and his place in it the story says a lot about the inhumanity that was once rife in the british education system but it also shines light on what its like spending a lot of your life being not just misunderstood , but routinely insulted someone telling you youre no good every day worms its way inside your head , adams says inside , you know youre all right , so theres this conflict going on since april 2013 , adams has known that he has asperger syndrome or , to put it another way , that he is autistic ten minutes online will tell you that adams condition comes down to a so called triad of impairments to do with social interaction , communication and imagination , or what some people call flexibility of thought although the fact that adams is a prolific artist suggests that , in his case , that last criterion might be misplaced since 2013 , many diagnoses of autism have also included a range of sensory issues , among them aversions to certain textures , sounds , smells and tastes , as well as a deep dislike of sudden noise in adams case , these seem to blur into a complex kind of synaesthesia he understands music as something he can touch , and experiences the colour yellow as a profoundly unpleasant taste , like mould adams sometimes talks about his condition in front of an audience , and there is one question that always comes up it goes my sons eight , he sits in his room all day , he does lego , he does complicated drawings , he wont talk to anyone else how do i make him socialise \? well , you dont hes made his world one day , hell show it to you dont let him grow up thinking that the way hes thinking and what hes doing are faulty jon adams was formally diagnosed at the age of 52 , at an nhs clinic run as an offshoot of cambridge universitys autism research centre , after he was referred there by his gp the initial spark had been a meeting with the centres founder and director , simon baron cohen \( the cousin , in case anyone was wondering , of sacha \) , who had spoken with adams at the cheltenham literature festival adams had begun to realise what sat under a lot of his experiences at the time , the biography that accompanied his work as an artist included the words probably autistic from may 2012 until june 2013 , he worked as the research centres artist in residence immediately afterwards , a specialist gave him his formal diagnosis , a process that involved an interview and something akin to a questionnaire i got the letter through , saying i scored 18 out of 18 autistic traits , and i had aspergers , adams says i meet baron cohen in a crowded starbucks near st pauls cathedral in london , where he wryly comments on the mixture of chatter , clattering cups and muzak for a lot of autistic people , this would probably be hell and casts his mind back over the 35 years he has been thinking about and researching autism he started working with six autistic children in a special unit in barnet , north london , in 1982 fifteen years later , he set up the cambridge research centre two years after that , in 1999 , he opened a clinic dedicated to diagnosing autistic adults my son received a diagnosis aged three he had fixations with particular music or places traits i recognise in myselfthere was a growing awareness that autism wasnt just about kids , he tells me i was receiving more and more emails saying , my sons an adult , but hes never fitted in might he have autism \? an adult couldnt go to a child and adolescent clinic , so where were they meant to go \? if they went to a learning disability clinic , and they had an iq above 70 , theyd be turned away so these people were like a lost generation that was a phrase i used a lot the national autistic society estimates that there are currently around 700 , 000 people living with autism in the uk more than one in every 100 of the population some of these people have learning disabilities some are what the medical vocabulary terms non verbal , or unable to speak others are so called high functioning , a sub group that includes those with asperger syndrome , the condition named after the austrian paediatrician who in the 1940s worked with a group of children he famously termed little professors asperger syndrome is distinguished by the fact that people who have it display no language delay as toddlers or small children \( asperger died in 1980 , long before the term asperger syndrome entered popular usage it has since been dropped from the relevant american diagnostic manual , but is still used in the uk \) it is among this latter group that you will find many of the 20 of autistic people currently thought to have been diagnosed as adults no national figures for adult autism diagnoses are available , but anecdotal evidence suggests numbers are rising baron cohen tells me that four years ago , 100 cases in cambridgeshire were referred to his clinic in the first four months of 2016 alone , it received 400 referrals most of the terms used to describe autism dont do justice to the nuanced , complicated traits bound up with it nonetheless , all its variants are covered by the catch all term autism spectrum disorder , or asd people who dispute that autism is any kind of disorder prefer the term autism spectrum condition the word spectrum was first used in this context by the pioneering british researcher lorna wing , who died in 2014 baron cohen explains what she meant at the time , i think , was a spectrum within those who come to clinical attention where its gone since is that this spectrum runs right through society , out into the general population my own interest in autism began when my son james received a diagnosis of asd at the age of three back then , some things seemed strange the social distance between him and his peers his fixations with particular music \( the clash , the beatles \) or places his pointed dislike of some foods or sounds \( i still curse whoever invented the public toilet hand dryer \) his amazing facility with technology now , these things are simply part of the fabric of our shared life i recognise echoes of myself in some of these traits \( the music , the technology \) , and of plenty of other people more than anything , his 10 years have brought me an ever growing understanding of the complexities of human psychology , both among those diagnosed as on the spectrum and so called neurotypical people unfortunately , the everyday world has yet to catch up only 16 of adults diagnosed with autism in the uk are in full time , paid employment in 2014 baron cohens team found that two thirds of the patients in their clinic had either felt suicidal or planned to kill themselves , and that a third had attempted to do so to my mind , this is nothing to do with autism or asperger syndrome , he says these are secondary mental health problems you came into the world with autism , and the way the world reacted , or didnt react , to you has led to a second problem , which is depression and thats preventable a week after talking to baron cohen , i take the train to the lancashire town of wigan , to meet 68 year old peter street , who got his autism diagnosis only 10 months ago he is an impish , funny presence , and says he loves conversation , perhaps a little too much i get this deep urge its a pain , almost , to talk to people when ive described it to the therapist , ive said im like a bucket of water and its full and then all of it comes out , and it empties facebook twitter pinterest peter street i get too much for people , and they get too much for me photograph rosie barnesafter 20 minutes , it becomes clear that street has the most astonishing life story of anyone i have ever interviewed his mother , he says , became pregnant with him when she was raped in his native bolton , the two of them were taken in by a man much older than her , who employed her as his housekeeper , and then married her and adopted street to give the arrangement a veneer of normality he grew up , he says , with no extended family and very few friends i get too much for people , and they get too much for me a lot of the time , i overpower people when i was a kid , when i made a friend , i would go and sit on their doorstep , waiting for them im a really early riser , and i cant cope with being late anywhere i used to go and sit on the doorstep , maybe six , seven in the morning and people obviously didnt like that his daily routine , he says , often revolved around an outside toilet , and his homes back wall , which he would use for solo games of football and marbles and that was wonderful , in some sense it wouldnt have been wonderful for some people , but it was for me he also made endless trips to the cinema , where he acquired a forensic knowledge of greek mythology he mentions steve reeves , the musclebound 1950s actor who played hercules i can take certain things in really odd things , sometimes , he says but i cant take in what most people take in every day at school , he found it almost impossible to tune in to the teachers they were shit with me , he says they knew how to abuse they were good at it they were bullies they used to stand me in the corner , in the wastebasket , and hit me over the head with the board rubber , to knock some sense into me ive always blamed my epilepsy on that he started having grand mal seizures when he was 15 it is now estimated that around a third of autistic people also experience epilepsy , though the relationship between the two is something that neuroscience has yet to fathom street left school unable to read or write he passed through a series of jobs a bakery , a butchers shop some of which came to an end because he found it difficult to process complex instructions , before settling into work as a gardener and gravedigger along the way , he married his wife , sandra , with whom he has three grownup children she doesnt like being with people , he says shes very quiet , very introverted in a way , shes a mirror in 1984 , after breaking his neck while trying to climb into a transit van that was pulling away , street began three years in recovery while he was in hospital , he met a fellow patient who was an english teacher , and started to work with him on his literacy then , through adult education , he discovered a talent for poetry while we talk , he hands me an anthology of his work , published in 2009 , that begins with a poem titled not being me , a perfect glimpse into the autistic experience of not fitting in in the late 1980s , street began to teach poetry in schools and day centres in the early 90s , he became a writer in residence at the bbc in manchester , which led to a series of assignments in 1993 , he went to croatia to write about the war that was then engulfing the balkans people with autism , its often said that they have no emotion or empathy , he says i have too much emotion , too much empathy it broke my heart three experiences preyed on him a meeting with an 18 year old abandoned in a refugee camp an occasion when he gave his water ration to an emaciated woman with a newborn child and the experience of eating a sumptuous meal in the town of lipik , with three or four kids at the window , looking in and i didnt have the balls to get up and go and give them my food by 2014 , his inability to put away these memories had become too much i went to a therapist and she said , i want you to go and see a friend of mine shes a specialist in diagnosing people with autism i thought , ill go along , as you do and she gave me these really strange games they were like a jigsaw puzzle four pieces white they were so simple , i thought i could do them and i couldnt he was handed five plastic figures and toys , and told to make a story with them and i couldnt do that , either i couldnt connect them together into one story she said i was highly intellectual , but on the autism spectrum his response was one of enormous relief i cried it was wonderful wonderful because all my life suddenly made sense and none of it the beatings , the abuse none of it was my fault apart from my family and sandra , id put it in the top five greatest things that have happened in my life absolutely , incredibly wonderful penny andrews got her diagnosis of asperger syndrome \( though she is perfectly comfortable with the term autistic \) when she was 30 back then , she was a regular user of livejournal , the social networking site that was a forerunner of myspace and facebook , and one of her online contacts had begun to write about the process of finding out he was autistic he wrote about it quite openly all the reasons hed gone for diagnosis , what the procedure was like , seeing half a dozen different psychiatrists before he found one who would refer him for diagnosis , she tells me and the more he wrote about it , the more i was like , oh , god , this is me andrews is now 35 she also has mild cerebral palsy , which manifests itself in spasms in her ankles , knees and wrists she is a para athlete whose specialism is the 100m , and has a punishing training schedule she wears a vintage bowie t shirt , has a wood cut picture of the yorkshire town of whitby tattooed on her right arm , and is a prolific and waspish presence on twitter andrews is currently awaiting a decision on the funding of her phd , which is focused on the relationships between academic libraries and data flows , digital labour , academic social networking services and governance in research support at secondary school , boys pretend to fancy you it kills you , because you take it seriouslypenny andrewsshe grew up in nidderdale in the yorkshire dales and now lives in leeds throughout her childhood , andrews says she had a deep sense of everything being wrong , somehow being clever and being a supposedly interesting person , but never able to maintain friendships and always , inexplicably , saying something wrong autism among women and girls is only starting to be properly understood the male to female ratio of autistic people currently stands at around 5 1 , although baron cohen says he and other autism specialists are currently in a transition period in their research the actual figure may eventually turn out to be very different theres a whole new topic researchers are latching on to , about camouflage whether females for whatever reason might be better at hiding their autism , he says , something that is borne out by andrews recollection of her time at school youre not supposed to get on with peoples parents better than them when you go round to their houses i didnt really want to play with people i just looked really aloof i read the diary of anne frank when i was six , and i talked about the holocaust but i would try to copy other people , how they talked and acted id watch tv programmes that other people watched so id have something to talk about neighbours and home and away she laughs i got a tamagotchi when everyone else got them , but i had no interest in it in the end , teenage etiquette and the nastiness that often comes with it proved too much girls are cruel they exclude each other , and pretend to be friends with each other , as a game and i get sarcasm , but i dont get insincerity and then , at secondary school , boys pretend to fancy you , because thats the most ludicrous idea they can think of it kills you because you take it seriously and they invite you to things , and then they dont show up , or theyre round the corner laughing all of that happened facebook twitter pinterest penny andrews i would try to copy other people , how they talked and acted photograph rosie barnesshe has been married to her husband , emil , for 11 years because he loves me the way i am , im completely myself with him how hard does she find it to read other peoples emotions \? it sort of depends if somebodys actually upset , i can probably feel it quicker than other people i can feel it too much but i cant usually tell if people are trying to get out of a conversation if people are trying to leave you have to tell me we need to stop i cant tell whether people like me or not , which is hard plenty of non autistic people have issues with that , i say , myself included but they seem at peace with it even with people ive known for a long time , i wont know whether they like me or not unless weve had an explicit conversation do you actually like me \? which turns people off when it comes to understanding autism , how much does she think the world still needs to change \? quite a lot because i think a lot of people still dont believe it , or think its a really mild thing well , it just makes it a bit harder for her to make friends , makes her a bit more anxious a lot of the time , its stressful painful when the sensory stuff is happening , its like youre being tasered andrews mentions people flicking their train tickets , or jangling their coins , or whistling its not just , thats annoying its , thats unbearable i have said , im really sorry , but can you stop doing that \? but people dont i have one last question self evidently , andrews is what some people call high functioning when she meets autistic people who are , say , non verbal , does she feel they are part of the same community \? yes and i think we have a duty , as people who can speak , to make sure that those people are looked after properly , and theyre not exploited , and they dont have inappropriate people speaking for them , or saying things like , hes got a mental age of three how would they know , if they cant communicate with them \? from what i can observe , they are experiencing the same thing as me when ive seen a non verbal person have a meltdown , it looks like my meltdowns , only more physical it looks she thinks for a minute it looks like an unrestrained version of how i sometimes feel in portsmouth , jon adams talks about what many autistic people call passing like andrews pretend interest in australian soaps and techno pets , its about managing to blend in , even if that means submerging whole chunks of your personality in adams case , passing took its toll and , in his late 30s , he hit an emotional wall not being true to yourself has an effect on you , he says id been married , and that had failed i had a girlfriend at the time , and that was failing i had a bit of a breakdown , and it took me a couple of years to get used to people he started out on a new path as an artist the work he does ranges across disciplines including sculpture and music , and regularly touches on his own story among his most affecting works is a piece called my school pen an old school fountain pen covered in spikes that perfectly evokes his struggles as a child you might have imperfections , but the basics of the way you view the world are right for youjon adamsin 2007 , he was working on a project with a group of teenagers for a charity called the foyer federation the woman in charge said , have you ever considered youre autistic \? he recalls i said , no , whats that \? she gave him a copy of mark haddons novel the curious incident of the dog in the night time , now almost a set text for people interested in the condition and i went away and i read one page and i cried he wells up now you might have faults and imperfections , but the basics of the way you view the world are right for you when everybody tells you , no , youre thinking wrong , you know youre not but if tells you that , you think youre faulty thats the root of the depression and the low self confidence so to read those things on a page was emotional it was i could see that someone understood and i thought , ok , maybe i am autistic it would be another six years before he was formally diagnosed for most adults who receive a diagnosis , the formal recognition might make belated sense of their lives , but it tends to make little difference to their daily existence according to the national autistic society , 70 of adults say they dont get the help they need people might just about recognise the conditions more extreme manifestations , but as penny andrews puts it , theyre probably not aware of the bulk of autistic adults people who are sitting there , coping with a lot of stuff , and the fact that theyre dealing with all this noise and stress and uncertainty that they shouldnt have to joblessness among autistic adults speaks for itself even such mundane things as the ubiquity of piped music , or inadequate signage in public spaces , attest to the same basic issue a society averting its eyes from things that blight hundreds of thousands of lives and might easily be improved we fetishise awareness of autism , but the point needs to be greater understanding and then practical action simon baron cohen cites one big frustration if autism comes down to an often profound difficulty navigating the world , only a tiny number of people currently receive the help they need to do that whether its about how to go shopping , or how to go for a job interview , or how to reply to your girlfriend to me , if we were a civilised society , wed be paying for mentors it doesnt seem unreasonable a government programme called access to work means that adams does get help from a support worker called donna , a calm and empathic woman who accompanies him to our interview donna is copied into all his emails , and in the course of adams work as an artist and a researcher into disability and creativity at portsmouth university , she regularly shadows him for a couple of hours a day among other things , her job is partly to assist him in the kind of reading between the lines that professional and social etiquette demands , but that a lot of autistic people find difficult very often , she explains , she is there to suggest that a particular request or instruction is put in a different way , or to remind people in authority that adams has his own ways of working you might have a three week time span to do a piece of work , adams explains , and if your line manager is checking you each day to find out your progress well , you might not do anything for two weeks you might be mulling it over in your head autism in the workplace an opportunity not a drawback read moreadams talks a lot about systemising , the quintessentially autistic way in which he divines patterns in the world , often immersing himself in them music is a good example he has an app called imini , which he uses to programme sequences of electronic notes into an on screen keyboard , which he can then use if a spurt of anxiety means he needs to readjust he plays me a bit , which i say reminds me of the kind of experimental music that came out of germany in the 1970s thats not a coincidence i got really into tangerine dream in about 1976 the repeating sequences were heaven for me , adams says he also likes the electronic pioneers kraftwerk , which rings loud bells my son is a kraftwerk obsessive , and regularly zeroes in on particular segments of their songs and plays them over and over does that sound familiar \? yes , adams says , and his mind goes back to 1978 i bought mr blue sky by elo there was a track on the other side , and it had a very strange beginning it was called fire on high , and id play it over and over and over again why \? it aligned me it made me feel that the world was right and everything was together it felt like it was part of me its like all the stars lining up he smiles things like that give me the feeling im meant to be here topicsautismhealthfeaturesshare on facebookshare on twittershare via

my boss is bullying me and undermining my confidence but what can i do about it \? my boss doesnt like me im not sure why and have given up trying to figure it out , but its making my working life miserable she undermines me in front of the rest of the team , interrupts with irrelevant asides when im trying to lead meetings , leaves me out of meetings i should be included in , and makes threats that i might lose my job or someone else more junior might lose theirs if i dont do some often irrelevant task i am desperate to leave but feel so undermined by her bullying , favouritism and passive aggressive behaviour that i feel worthless , useless and unemployable she likes to remind me that i am lucky to have a job i have worked here for 15 years but now feel trapped in a vicious circle what should i do \? jeremy saysyou dont know why your boss doesnt like you and id be fairly certain she doesnt either shes a bully , and bullies are irrational , unhappy creatures who derive strange pleasure from humiliating others , particularly in front of an audience some bullies achieve their ascendancy through force of personality your boss does it by abusing her seniority in saying this , im not asking you to understand her , let alone forgive her im saying something more important its the ultimate aim of bullies to intimidate their victims to such an extent that they begin to believe they somehow deserve to be bullied , that they are inferior , worthless beings and thats exactly whats happening to you you say you feel worthless , useless and unemployable , and yet you must know youre none of those things in the 15 years youve worked in this place presumably before the arrival of this monster you will have been a confident , competent , contented person that is , at heart , who you still are so you must fight very hard not to succumb if she senses you have , it will give her still further pleasure and shell even see it as in some way justifying her behaviour i would hope that those in authority will soon recognise the malign influence this person is having and will take steps to remove her but you cant wait for that you need to be deliberately , consciously defiant defy your boss by looking at yourself in the mirror and promising yourself that you wont let her win then with all the old confidence that you can muster , go out there and find yourself another job readers say keep a detailed log of all incidents , and keep all relevant documents , even post it notes my lawyer advised me this when i was in a similar situation it didnt stop me from having to leave , but i got a much better deal because i had proof of everything aranzazu the only solution is to get out sad and unfair , but sometimes life is like that but you can look for other jobs up hill and down dale with no time pressure as an aside , once you start looking you will probably find the stress flows away you will have control of the situation captaingrey i was in this situation with a boss who continually described me as difficult to like , a cold person , impossible to get along with , and i really sympathise in the end , feeling i was on the verge of a nervous breakdown , i simply quit i didnt have anything to go to but felt i had to for the sake of my health i had savings i could live on for six months \( with big lifestyle changes \) , a plan for low paid work if i couldnt find something else , and an alternative plan for retraining in the longer term the day i walked out was one of the happiest of my life the relief was incredible and i felt much better about myself almost immediately in the end i got a job within a month its only in hindsight that i recognise just what a bad mental state id got myself into , and i dread to think of the damage if i had stayed i know it is a risk , and for some is financially impossible , but if there is any way at all you can do it , then get out room32 join a union if you havent already , and wait until you are entitled to representation keep a log , including details of possible witnesses with the help of your union , submit a grievance detailing what you are complaining about and what you would like your employer to do about it intermax my secondment is failing as im being denied the it training i desperately needi have recently been promoted to team leader the second rung of the in house managerial ladder i had been working towards this for a year before i finally got my opportunity its on secondment for two months and will get made permanent if it goes well i explained in my interview that although i have a basic knowledge of the in house computer systems , i dont have the knowledge that the other team leader or the manager has since i have been promoted i have had to text or ring one of them each shift in order for help i explained that i wanted training and needed it to be able to do my job , but have been told its going to be difficult to find the time now things are going wrong and i am unable to fix them there have been occasions where they havent answered the phone and ive been completely stuck , and been reprimanded for it on the next shift if this continues i cant see the secondment being made permanent , from either side , as i dont want to take the job permanently if this is what is to come jeremy saysi suspect youre being just a little too polite and hesitant because you dont want to make a fuss or seem to be looking for excuses when things go wrong , you havent been nearly firm enough in your request for training this could lead to exactly the outcome you fear , with your secondment failing to be made permanent and you , rather than your workplace , being held responsible you might , as you suggest , be relieved but that would be unfair and unnecessary you need to write a cool , considered note to your manager , copied to hr \( if you have such a department \) avoid sounding either plaintive or apologetic stick strictly to the facts say that you are grateful to both your manager and the other team leader for the time they spend helping you deal with in house system issues now that youve been doing the job for some time its become even more apparent that you shouldnt have to rely on such ad hoc help but need formal computer system training can they please arrange a programme for you as soon as possible , because only then will you feel able to fulfil the role with which youve been entrusted this will hopefully prompt the training you need at worst , being on the record when your performance is eventually evaluated , it should ensure youre not unfairly penalised readers say cover your back write a report to your manager requesting a specialised minion on short contract , adding that training would be cheaper and bite the bullet

the troubled national inquiry into child abuse has mounted a fightback after a large survivors group withdrew from participation , condemning it as a stage managed and contrived investigation in a series of television interviews , senior panel member dru sharpling said the inquiry would continue she apologised to hundreds of victims of child abuse in lambeth childrens homes the shirley oaks survivors association who announced they were pulling out of the proceedings on friday because it was failing publicly and tragically but sharpling insisted the investigations would go on without the group she said the lambeth investigation will continue i am very sorry that they have decided to leave i hope that they will come back , but we will continue to do that work there is evidence being forwarded to us now which enables us to undertake this inquiry and i hope that , as time goes by , their confidence in the inquiry improves , as others have it is understood she was referring to the documents being submitted on a weekly basis to the inquiry by lambeth council as a result of its statutory powers to demand information lambeth , she said , was one of 13 investigations the inquiry was carrying out and its importance could not be elevated above any of the other institutions being examined child abuse inquiry facing 'credibility crisis' , labour says read moresharpling suggested the inquiry maintained the confidence of other victims she said there are seven other organisations who we are working with and over 150 individual victims and survivors in relation to our public hearings project , she said people are also coming forward for our other project , the truth project they are giving accounts of child sexual abuse all over the country as we speak weve had universally good feedback from that and it is an important element of the inquiry a spokesman for the prime inister , theresa may , made clear she unreservedly backed the inquiry under its chair , prof alexis jay we are going to be continuing with the inquiry , said sharpling the work is so important the more people come forward particularly to give accounts of child sexual abuse , it gives us the passion that we need to take it forward although it has been a difficult start for this inquiry , we are determined to see it through no matter what sharpling defended jay after labour mp chuka umunna whose constituents were abused in lambeth childrens homes demanded that the former social worker should stand down as chair in favour of a senior judge in rotherham , no organ of government , no institution , had uncovered the scale and the depravity of child sexual abuse that had occurred over many years , sharpling said one woman uncovered that abuse and that was alexis jay i think she is one of the few people who is ideally qualified for the job sharplings public statements came after weeks in which the inquiry has been rocked by a series of departures of leading lawyers , allegations of bullying and racism by its former chair lowell goddard , the announcement that a public hearing into the late greville janner would be postponed and on friday the departure of the shirley oaks survivors from the process umunna , who until now has been supportive of jay as chair , said he had lost confidence in her ability to run the investigation and she should step down in favour of a senior judge there has been an ongoing concern about the fact that she has come from three decades of social work , he said for many of the survivors that is a problem because many of the perpetrators came from that profession now you cant just sweep that under the table and its never been dealt with by the panel properly in an article for the times jay said she was genuinely saddened by the shirley oak survivor groups decision , but the inquirys door would remain open to it raymond stevenson , who set up the shirley oaks survivors association , explained why they had finally decided to withdraw after twice threatening to pull out of proceedings having watched the iicsa unpalatable circus stumble and lurch from crisis to crisis it no longer matters whether we think the inquiry is just another stitch up because it is clearly a botch job that needs a drastic overhaul if it is ever to achieve its initial objectives , he said in a statement stevenson said he was not comfortable putting his members before an inquiry which was failing tragically , failing publicly he said the inquiry needs to sort itself out they need to get rid of alexis jay , who has been parachuted in by the home office , and we need to get someone else he also raised concerns about the presence of so many home office staff on the inquiry 36 of the 183 staff are home office officials he said for any inquiry to be truly independent and engender faith in its integrity , the home office either needs to come clean about its own role in covering up historical child abuse and staff the inquiry with independent employees instead of its secondees or hand over the task of overseeing the inquiry to a less tainted government department despite sharplings confidence that other victims supported the process , phil frampton , who is a core participant in the inquiry as part of the whiteflowers group of victims , said the departure of shirley oaks came amid seething discontent among survivors over the lack of material support for them and the contemptuous way they were being dealt with he called for survivors to be fully funded to attend all meetings with their legal representatives , for guaranteed access to counselling from the first moment preliminary hearings began and a clear timetable of hearings to come the announcement that shirley oaks survivors had formally withdrawn was the latest setback for the public investigation it is on its fourth chair since it was established in 2014 and has had at least three people resign from its legal team topicsuk

students at city university of london , home to one of the countrys most respected journalism schools , have voted to ban the sun , daily mail and express from its campus the universitys student union voted to ban the newspapers at its annual general meeting on thursday night in a motion titled opposing fascism and social divisiveness in the uk media the motion said the titles have published stories that demonise refugees and minorities , have posted islamophobic stories and all actively scapegoat the working classes they so proudly claim to represent it added that freedom of speech should not be used as an excuse to attack the weakest and poorest members of society and that the titles publish stories that are inherently sexist the motion , while largely symbolic , is embarrassing for the university , which runs one of the uks top journalism programmes campaigners claim victory after lego stops daily mail promotions read moreless than 200 of the universitys 19 , 500 student population attended the meeting where the motion was passed to ban the newspapers in their current form the motion added that the ban could be extended to other media organisations with the sun , daily mail and express titles merely used as high profile examples the students union said there was no place for the papers on campus or university properties although it was unclear how the ban would be enforced a number of journalism students are looking to pull out of the union in protest against the decision , which they believe harms the universitys reputation many graduates go on to work at the sun , mail and express titles in some capacity are they going to try and stop students carrying newspapers and will lecturers no longer be able to use or refer to them \? said one student , speaking to the guardian the union has resolved to promote among the student body the active pressuring of the newspapers to cease to fuel fascism , racial tension and hatred in society professor suzanne franks , head of the department of journalism at city university , said that students would continue to be allowed access to the three newspapers students on our journalism courses value being able to access the views of publications and broadcasters across the industry and the department will continue to enable all these opportunities , she said we combine professional skills training with a concern for professional standards and the importance of fair , impartial and ethical reporting is at the heart of our courses yusuf ahmad , president of the city university student union , said that the 182 attendees at the meeting had debated and passed 15 motions a number of motions passed are committing resources of the union and will need the further consideration of the board of trustees , he said , before commenting directly on the motion to ban the three newspapers the union is currently unaware of any outlets on campus selling the mentioned media publications as with all motions , the union will be considering how it implements this index on censorship chief executive , jodie ginsberg , said the union should not be trying to dictate what students could read people should be free to choose what they read rather than banning things , we should be encouraging people to voice their objections to views and opinions they dont like george brock , former head of citys journalism department and current lecturer , said the move was in his personal view foolish , illiberal and meaningless the students in the class i was teaching today were furious and understandably so at gesture politics from a fraction of the student body , he said they understand that the answer to journalism that you may not like is to do the journalism better during the meeting , another motion titled why is my curriculum white \? was passed attacking the university as the primary motor in reproducing this ideology of whiteness the union has resolved to take an active role in decolonising the curriculum and start asking where are our black lecturers the student unions move follows the high profile campaigning group stop funding hate pressuring businesses to drop their commercial relationships with the same three newspapers because they run divisive hate campaigns last week , lego announced it would not run any more promotional giveaways with the daily mail the danish toymaker , which had been giving away free toys with the newspaper , took the decision after the campaigning group took up the cause of british parent bob jones , who had written to it raising concerns over its tie in with the newspaper , which ran articles attacking the three high court judges who made a legal ruling on brexit earlier this month stop funding hate has also targeted companies including waitrose , john lewis and marks spencer , who have refused to withdraw their ads , and the co operative group , which has said it was reviewing its policy the match of the day presenter , gary lineker , has given his backing to the stop funding hate campaign and recently asked walkers crisps to reconsider advertising in the sunover its anti refugee stance lineker had tweeted his anger at newspaper coverage of the handful of child refugees who were brought into britain from calais last month the sunresponded by labelling lineker a jug eared leftie luvvie and calling for the bbc to sack him he tweeted brick by brick with a link to the campaign the sun has previously been boycotted by numerous student unions over its now dropped topless page three images however , debates over free speech on campus have extended well beyond newspapers in january , online publication spiked released its latest free speech rankings for universities , finding that 90 of institutions were carrying out some form of censorship , up from 80 a year earlier concerns have been raised over attempts to no platform speakers with views deemed unacceptable to segments of the student body , as well as attempts to create safe spaces within universities where criticism is discouraged however , students groups have argued that those studying have a right to do so in an environment where they are protected from persecution and abuse a survey in april found that almost two thirds of uk students back the national union of students no platforming policy , which covers speakers from six groups including the bnp and al muhajiroun , but allows individual unions to choose which speakers to bar topicsnational newspaperscity university of londonrefugeesnewspapershigher educationdaily expressnewsshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
it took several months , and a little help from some dancing clowns , for juju on that beat to become a viral meme it started off as the tz anthem challenge , in which kids had to replicate the dance moves performed in a video clip made by 15 year old zay hilfigerrr , set to music that he had co written by the end of this summer , everyone from seven year olds in snapback caps to teenage girls in sumo suits had filmed themselves taking up the challenge and it took atlantic records just five days to turn tz anthem into juju on that beat , a tune that could make both them and the songs creators a whole lot of money the song , which borrows its beat from crime mobs knuck if you buck and whose chorus is a series of playful dance instructions , was written in a few idle moments by hilfigerrr and 17 year old zayion mccall juju on that beat , juju on that beat , its hook demands , using a term the pair made up after taking inspiration from recently coined dance moves like the whip and nae nae now slide , drop hit dem folks , dont stop , aye running man on that beat they uploaded the song to youtube with an accompanying dance video , where it caught the attention of fresh the clowns , a dance troupe from detroit with an impressive social media following once their version of the dance began to gain traction , high school junior hannah talliere followed suit with a video tweet that has since between retweeted more than 260 , 000 times from there , the song and the challenge blew up facebook twitter pinterest thats the short version for young people who engage with viral trends on a daily basis , to explain its trajectory in this way is completely unnecessary for those who do not , the whole thing can sound like another language one that the music industry is scrambling to learn i emailed hilfigerrr and mccall a few questions their answers were about as cheerfully brief as you might expect from a couple of teenagers with far better things to be doing we wrote it for fun ! they reply when i ask if the idea of becoming a viral meme was in their minds when the song came about and what , i ask , was more important in making it go viral , the song or the dance \? both are very important in other words , they are not particularly interested in dissecting the intricacies of viral fame , or overthinking something that they created for their own amusement as far as hilfigerrr and mccall are concerned , it just is the business side the ability to take notice of and commodify a type of music , which now moves faster than ever is down to the record label that snapped them up when the pair were signed by atlantic records , the song was not even available to download within five days of them signing on the dotted line , it was up on itunes it soon reached no 8 on the billboard hot 100 , and it is now slowly climbing the uk charts , entering the top 40 last friday more startling are the online stats the track itself , with no video , uploaded by mccall has had nearly 34m youtube views , while the official video has had nearly 11m but the real proof of its reach lies in the challenge videos the dancing clowns have had more than 21m views a compilation of people dancing has had nearly 17m views a four year old dancing to the track on the ellen show has had 12m views scores more videos have topped the million view mark meanwhile , at the time of writing , juju on that beat has had just short of 48m plays on spotify facebook twitter pinterest juju on that beat is the latest in a string of songs to have become memes in the last few years some , such as finatticzs dont drop that thun thun , went viral several years after the tracks initial release in that instance , the songs sudden surge in popularity was down to a twerking trend on vine the recent demise of which may have lasting repercussions for the way memes spread then there is silentos watch me \( whip nae nae \) the track that inspired the irreverence of juju on that beat like hilfigerrr and mccalls release , it featured catchy lyrics and a distinctive , imitatable dance , and its video has had more than a billion views on youtube the biggest memes such as 2013s harlem shake become inescapable , recreated by sports teams and celebrities if catchy lyrics and copyable dance moves were enough to spawn a meme , record companies would have been able to churn out viral hit after viral hit but it is not that simple if someone or some entity can crack that code and harness the power of memes , says shontavia jackson of drake university , iowa , who has published award winning articles on memetic theory , they could unlock the ability to reach millions of people social media entities may be countering some of this with their new algorithms and methods of disseminating content , but viral information may be impossible to contain rebecca black certainly has no idea why friday , the song and video her mother paid a record label a modest sum to produce in late 2010 , went viral aged 13 at the time , black was thrust into a sea of vitriol and mockery peppered with the occasional show of enthusiasm for what was essentially a harmless earworm in the space of just a few days friday has now had more than 100m views on youtube , and more than 2m dislikes for black , being part of a viral meme was never the intention nor was it an easy wave to ride i was just too young to really process it , she says putting on a brave face and acting as if i was totally ok was the only way i knew how to cope with it i can see now how tough it was with five years distance from it , though , and a new single that holds its own among blacks pop contemporaries , it seems friday was a wave worth riding after all , its unlikely that her moody , electro pop banger the great divide would have had more than 2 3m youtube views in the past two months if it were not for her viral beginnings facebook twitter pinterest it is an intangible formula that makes songs such as friday and juju on that beat catch on if someone sets out with the intention of creating a viral meme , they are often destined to fail social media users can sniff out corporate cynicism from a mile away , so as soon as brands jump on the bandwagon , the general population tends to jump off and move on sometimes , though , as is the case with watch me \( whip nae nae \) , the process is not quite as organic as it seems the success of one of the biggest viral hits of last year was at least partly down to a company named danceon , co founded by madonna the company is the brainchild of amanda taylor , who spotted a gap in the viral meme market for a third party that wasnt the individual artist and wasnt the platform in return for a percentage of an artists revenues , danceon recruits its members to help make a song or dance video go viral and is completely upfront about it its website boasts of how it bridges the gap between dancers , brand partners , technology and the entertainment industry with silentos permission , danceon enlisted 50 of its members to create unofficial dance videos for watch me \( whip nae nae \) , racking up 250m youtube views in a matter of months the songs weekly streams nearly doubled , its sales tripled and silento was signed to capitol records but for danceons shrewd business acumen to amount to anything , the source material had to be right the company threw its support behind silentos single because it knew it was on the brink of becoming viral anyway and for every watch me \( whip nae nae \) danceon has helped launch , countless others have fallen by the wayside after all , if the formula for memes could be bottled , simon cowell would surely have bought a cellar full by now topicship hoppop and rockdancesocial mediayoutubevinefeaturesshare on

in some ways it should not come as a shock , given the horrific stories that have already poured forth from the media , showbusiness and music industries about institutionalised abuse of children in the 1970s , 1980s and early 1990s but we may never become inured to the numbing , dizzying dislocation that has been prompted by andy woodwards startlingly brave , disarmingly matter of fact account of how his childhood was stolen by a convicted paedophile football coach employed by crewe alexandra and several other clubs during the 1980s and 1990s to read woodwards account is to be reminded that this was likely to have been no isolated case and that there are likely to be more perpetrators and others , possibly many others , who were similarly affected it is naive to think that football with its similar cocktail of glamour , ambition , power and opportunity could not also be a breeding ground for those wanting to prey on boys who would do almost anything to make it as a professional andy woodward it was the softer , weaker boys he targeted read moreindividual heartbreaking cases down the years act as a reminder of the particular risks in sport where young charges are entrusted to coaches with huge power over them for long periods of time the risk has been perceived as particularly acute in individual sports such as swimming and athletics but woodward , by waiving his anonymity , reminds us that there may yet be another grim chapter , as yet unexamined , in one of english footballs darkest periods among the many disturbing things about woodwards account is his assertion that barry bennells reputation was common knowledge around a club with a hard won and longstanding reputation within the game for youth development , but no questions were asked visit any of the shiny multimillion pound academies that now proliferate at premier league clubs and which hoover up hundreds of kids every year from the age of five and six , and it is harder to believe that a paedophile could operate in plain sight at that level child protection systems are in place and todays academies are in some ways more like schools in terms of the environment they offer and the professional structures in place the football association , in one of the many important jobs it does beneath the visible tip of the iceberg on to which is crammed the fa cup and the soap opera of the national side , has a child safeguarding unit that oversees a pyramid of paid and voluntary personnel across all affiliated clubs at youth level all involved believe it would be harder for a bennell to operate with such impunity today but that does not mean it could not happen when bennells name first emerged as being linked with child sex offences in a channel 4 dispatches in 1997 , the fa did not even have a proper screening programme for grassroots football a glance at the copious material on the fas website is testament to how much has changed yet that should not lead to any complacency if anything , woodwards decision to tell his story must be an urgent call to arms not only , as he hopes , in giving others similarly affected during that era the courage to come forward but also in forcing football to look in the mirror and assess whether it is equipped to properly face up to what may have gone on in the past and ensure that it cannot happen again in the future that extends to everything from fully backing schemes put in place by the professional footballers association , which runs 24 hour helplines for current and former players , to continuing to support sporting chance the clinic founded by tony adams and peter kay , who died in 2013 , has sadly never been busier in helping former players tackle a range of demons there will be those in football who say it is wrong to turn up too many stones , wrong to cast aspersions too widely they will point to the balance between the horrors unearthed by operation yewtree , on the one hand , and on the other the collapse of operation midland , the question marks over which highlight the dangers of a scattergun approach that sprays suspicion in all directions but if woodwards bravery is not to be in vain , football owes it to all those who might have been affected to provide a mechanism and a framework for them now to come forward and tell their stories , laying the groundwork for any criminal prosecutions that may follow there is another eternal lesson for football in all this woodward also talks about the that exists within the dressing room walls and how hard it can be to break beyond that neil warnock sad and sickened to hear of abuse suffered by andy woodward read morethroughout those years at crewe , so many people used to talk about it other players would say directly to my face i bet he does this to you , we know he does that there was all that dressing room bravado then , outside the club , it was never discussed , he said thats how football worked back then we can talk about it within these walls , but we keep it watertight and it doesnt go any further nobody wanted to break that circle of trust whether that was a product of the times a symptom of the fact that the subject of child abuse could at times be treated with a kind of awkward nonchalance that now seems completely alien or still persists in football today is a subject for debate what is unarguable is that dressing room culture remains a powerful force often positive , sometimes benign , too often toxic on all sorts of issues from sexuality to race , the pressure to fit in and not to rock the boat can be overwhelming none of this should spark a moral panic but given the disparate , patchwork nature of the thousands of sports clubs strung across the country it should act as a reminder , if it was needed , of the responsibility on all of us from governing bodies to coaches , parents to schools to ensure eternal vigilance and that the necessary safeguards are in place woodwards account should also focus attention on an era when too few of those controls were in place and during which we can now see the game failed to look after some of its most vulnerable it must now , surely , make amends in the uk , the samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 in the us , the national suicide prevention hotline is 1 800 273 8255 in australia , the crisis support service lifeline is on 13 11 14

chess has dropped almost completely from the public eye in the four decades since bobby fischer and boris spassky waged their cold war proxy battle in reykjavik this months world chess championship match in new york city will do little to reverse that course despite the organizers best intentions , but early returns suggest the taut showdown between champion magnus carlsen and challenger sergey karjakin may not be as straightforward as initially suspected it marks the first time new york has played host to a world title match since 1995 , when garry kasparov retained his title against viswanathan anand on the 107th floor observatory deck in the south tower of the world trade center for the past week carlsen and karjakin have faced off in a sound proof studio within a sleek purpose built arena on the third floor of the fulton market building , only four blocks east from where the towers once stood a one way mirror allows spectators to watch the players in action , by themselves save for two silent arbiters , lending a terrarium like feel to the spectacle prices range from 75 for general admission to 1 , 200 for vip lounge access , where ticket holders can suck down vodka cocktails and rub elbows with grandmasters , financiers and the odd celebrity woody harrelson , an avid player himself , spent most of the first two days taking challenges from passers by on the outdoor balcony overlooking the east river while carlsen and karjakin faced off inside the best of 12 games match began on friday , with each contestant awarded one point for a win and a half point for a draw so far carlsen and karjakin have drawn all four games theyve played and enter thursdays fifth meeting deadlocked at 2 all whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion , earning the winners share of a roughly 1 1m prize fund inside the brain of the man who would be 'blindfold king' of chess read morecarlsen , who is 25 , was already regarded as the worlds best player even before he saw off anand for the championship in chennai three years ago and is the closest thing to a star in the sport today hes done ads for porsche , modeled for g star raw alongside liv tyler and lily cole and enjoys a massive presence in his native norway , where nrk is broadcasting the games in prime time he is handsome and media trained , perhaps overly so , giving off the air of an unthreatening playboy his peak rating of 2882 is the highest in history , a point frequently cited by those who have called him the greatest player ever karjakin , 26 , earned the right to challenge for the title in march by making it through the candidates tournament in moscow , where he defeated a series of higher ranked opponents , among them brooklyns fabiano caruana he was born in ukraine , where he became an international grandmaster at 12 years old \( a record that still stands \) , but adopted russian citizenship in 2009 he is married with a son , an avowed supporter of vladimir putin and the invasion of crimea , and speaks with a stutter that surfaces more in english than his native tongue he is ranked ninth in the world karjakin is a player in the classical mold known for his resilience carlsen is known for his adaptability , which enables a flair for the unpredictable not commonly seen among top players carlsen has practically no weaknesses , the russian said at last weeks pre match press conference before more than one hundred credentialed media any expectations of the political intrigue and paranoia associated with the sports golden age were not disappointed israel gelfer , the vice president of the world chess federation , spoke on behalf of the governing body only because fide president kirsan ilyumzhinov was barred from entering the country due to his ties to the syrian government and the central bank of syria at one point carlsen fielded a question over the rumors that hed enlisted microsoft for cybersecurity consultation over concerns karjakins team were trying to hack his preparations no fewer than two questions were posed about fischer spassky , never mind that carlsen and karjakin were years away from being born when thematch of the century took place this time around in new york , the chess eventually went off , no doubt to the organizers relief , and it didnt take long for the first surprise carlsen , handling the white pieces , played the seldom used trompowsky attack in fridays first game , a seldom used opening hed later confess was at least partially inspired by the name of americas newly minted president elect the norwegian played fast and it seemed like hed outprepared his rival , but karjakin managed to scratch back to force a mostly forgettable draw after 42 moves karjakin played the far more familiar ruy lopez in saturdays second game , prompting a morphy defense from carlsen that also ended in a draw , this time on the 33rd move after sundays rest day the players reconvened for game 3 , a white knuckler of a contest that saw karjakin recover from a misstep on his 30th move before defending brilliantly as carlsen tried to press his advantage and draw first blood but after seven tense , excruciating hours , karjakin managed to salvage a draw when the champion missed a move in the endgame that would have assured checkmate moments later , they agreed to a draw after 78 moves that left a short turnaround for the following days game , where karjakin recovered yet again to force a 94 move marathon that ended in another draw and kept the match level the resilience that carlsen had praised on the eve of the match has proven the critical talking point as the match enters the middle act sergey has studied the game very well , is very knowledgeable and , most of all , hes extremely resilient in defense hes very , very good in finding resources even in difficult positions , finding positions he can defend for me , its a matter of when i get the chance , ill try to punch him until he finally knocks over it seems inevitable that carlsens blows will find their target , but for now the russian underdog is very much in the fight topicschessus sportsnew yorknewsshare

in his first televised interview as president elect , donald trump gave a glimpse into his plans for large scale deportations he suggested his administration would initially target 2 3 million undocumented immigrants for removal , people who he branded criminals , gang members , drugs dealers but even a cursory analysis of trumps target number of deportations shows that he will have to deport far more than undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes the incoming trump administration will try to implement the harshest immigration regime in presidential history , with his closest advisers making clear they will seek to expedite these deportations and those deported are likely to include a far greater number of those who have lived in the us for years perhaps , experts warn , even those who are in the us on temporary visas or green cards the us already deports vast numbers of undocumented immigrants during the first six years of his tenure , barack obama deported two and a half million people , under the guise of ridding the us of criminals , gang bangers , and people who are hurting the community obamas rhetoric was somewhat misleading a new york times investigation found that two thirds of those deported by the administration by 2013 had only minor criminal convictions or none at all this underlies the impossibility of trumps pledge there simply are not enough people who match his description as serious criminals to deport , and many speculate the targets he wants to reach will mean not only dramatically broadening the scope of deportations to meet targets , but also seriously curtail any oversight within the system its important to point out that obama was actively trying to deport a record number of people , and even he hit two and a half million over two terms , said grace meng , a senior immigration researcher at human rights watchs us program so the idea of 2 to 3 million , whether its immediately , or even within a couple of years , would require a system that really defies our imagination of what a fair system might be in the absence of official data , the migration policy institute estimates about 820 , 000 of the roughly 11 million undocumented migrants living in america are likely to have a criminal conviction , with only 300 , 000 projected to hold a felony conviction since november 2014 , the obama administration has actively targeted this cohort of individuals they have drastically reduced the number of interior deportations those involving apprehensions that occur away from the border and usually involve individuals who have lived in the us for years by activating a priority enforcement program this program sees immigration and customs enforcement ice agents prioritise undocumented arrestees picked up by state or local law enforcement who are found to have serious felonies , gang affiliations or terror suspicions but even under this new policy , ice data obtained under the freedom of information act by researchers at the university of iowa , and reported here for the first time , highlights that a tiny fraction 6 73 of total deportations in 2014 involved individuals convicted of a violent crime , while 43 5 were deported with no recorded criminal history at all to get to 2 to 3 million will mean a dramatic rewriting of who or what is a criminalprofessor karthick ramakrishnan , uc riversideto get to 2 to 3 million deportations will mean a dramatic rewriting of who or what is a criminal , and rewriting that definition in a way that involves acts most americans would not consider to be a crime , said professor karthick ramakrishnan , an immigration researcher at the university of california , riverside and author of framing immigrants it would also mean considering not just undocumented immigrants , but people here who are on temporary visas or green cards that have committed minor crimes like shoplifting or dui trumps advisers have now acknowledged their net will need to widen and have started explaining that the administration will seek to deport not just convicted criminals but also those accused of a crime or gang affiliation as well as those charged with minor immigration violations , such as illegal re entry some have argued that trumps new immigration regime could simply use the tools left over from the so called deportation machines created by both the bush and obama administrations but the sheer scale of trumps project and the perceived desire to act quickly will probably require legislative action through congress to enhance and expand the effectiveness of these devices in august , trump pledged to restore the secure communities program , the precursor to the priority enforcement program , which was utilised by both the bush and obama administration until 2014 the program allowed federal authorities to conduct broader , less targeted sweeps of undocumented arrestees held by local authorities , and allowed ice agents to request that local jails detain suspects past their release date in order to allow more time to transfer them to federal detention facilities in the same speech , trump also pledged to expand 287 \( g \) agreements between ice and local law enforcement , which allow local police officers to carry out certain functions of immigration law enforcement directly ice reportedly credited these partnerships with identifying more than 400 , 000 potentially removable aliens between 2006 and 2015 , according to politifact but local law enforcement officials , most notably the maricopa county sheriffs office in arizona , were routinely criticized for discriminatory policing , and as a result the obama administration substantially rolled back their use in 2012 trumps promise to expand or reinstate both these programs is a strong indication the new administration will significantly intensify interior deportations but these removals have markedly declined since obama entered office , from 237 , 941 in 2009 to 69 , 478 last year , as the outgoing administration particularly in its second term focused on deportations at the border , many of which occur through an expedited removal process that requires no hearing in court this sharpening of the interior deportation machine will leave a number of institutions in the crosshairs for reform , said conservative analysts close to trumps transition team first , the trump administration will probably focus on streamlining civil immigration proceedings in court , said dan stein , president of the federation for american immigration reform \( fair \) the different kinds of changes that would be made in the court system will include dramatically adding to the number of immigration judges , curtailing review opportunities , hopefully making some changes to the board of immigration appeals , and really suggesting to congress that they limit the definition of asylum , said stein , whose organisation is listed as an anti immigrant extremist group by the southern poverty law center there is already a backlog of over half a million cases before the immigration courts , making this task nothing short of monumental , and leaving advocates concerned that due process could simply fly out of the window stein also predicted the trump administration will seek to expand the ice detention network , due to the rising rate of interior apprehensions the network already detains more than 30 , 000 people and relies heavily on privatised , substandard facilities , raising concerns that the standard of care will plummet even further but to proceed with even just these two reforms , the trump administration will probably need significant funding passed through congress for some advocates there is hope that this may at least curtail trumps ability to act with the pace he seems wedded to anything that needs to be done by congress is going to take time and i think there are republican and democratic members in congress who see immigrant rights as being crucial to the wellbeing of this country , and i hope they will resist these efforts , said meng , of human rights watch its already a very

as our carriage accelerated around our town and shot off to join the loop that collects commuters from all the main commuter towns and takes them to london it must be some computer system that efficiently sorts passengers going to the same place into carriages and accelerates them alongside the commuter loop so they can slot seamlessly into an empty carriage space without it slowing down ! \( it never stops ive heard parts of it are detached for maintenance at regular intervals and replaced with spares \) i only bought an economy ticket , my boarding would have been faster had i booked a larger single carriage , but i had no need they are subsidised for the physically impaired i had booked a ticket to london on my smartphone , so when i was close to london , the route on my phone detailed that i was soon to decelerate off the commuter loop to be parked in a tram station however , the next carriage was travelling further afield , and i saw it accelerate onto the main loop that takes passengers around the whole country marvellous ! virtual reality tele work liam mullenthe future of transport is virtually around the corner trains , tubes and taxis will no longer be saturated

commuting takes you from your place of abode to your place of work who says that should be a physical process \? reflections of the future already point towards physical jobs adopting automation only our minds need to present themselves at work how do we tackle the environmental challenges of taking a growing population in a metropolitan area from home , to work and back \? remove the physical

score on candy crush everyone is now a teleworker , clocking into a system of clouds , overcasting like a british summer day a government wide system of fully engulfing virtual reality can be rolled out nationwide , funded by the reduced need for transport and business infrastructure as motion capture , graphical performance and simulation improve a 3d chamber that tracks and projects a human onto an avatar is within reach distance and time will no longer be factors in commuting or daily life perhaps this is the first step to closing the cultural barriers in society and developing true citizens of the world how do we tackle orwellian governments , data mining of citizens , tracking of actions \? subsets of independent cloud systems , for work , friendship groups , government information can be programmatically separated and independently quantum encrypted truly separating business , leisure and government surveillance truly combining locations , time zones and the people of earth in one collective consciousness socialised fleet of self driving electric cars john robertthe economic and ecological rationale for the present use of cars is weak they spend the majority of the time idle , and are typically used by single occupants optimally , cars would be active and full for the maximum amount of time up to that necessary for their maintenance , recharging and cleaning under this model , cars , congestion and pollution would all be significantly reduced this can be realised by a socialised fleet of self driving electric cars within modern cities , comprised of the following elements integrated into existing road transport systems 1 the hailing of cars through apps and appropriately distributed machines 2 a coordinating algorithm with three key inputs extant arrival destination requests , expected arrival destination requests , and car pit stops at given intervals routes based on these data points would maximise average travel time , while guaranteeing that no journeys fell below a set minimum travel time the data on which expected requests can be mapped is effectively self generating , a product of past request meta data 3 a control hub which observes the system in real time to modify the coordinating algorithm in response to emergencies , traffic and aberrational system use , while updating users via social media and apps 4 pits for the regular recharging , cleaning and maintenance of cars , clustered in high use areas an integrated , city wide system means that all cars , arrivals and destinations are optimally reconciled to one another together with an ecologically minded tax regime for personal cars , a self driving system could revolutionise transport habits , while freeing the cityscape from private car use the general trend towards automation will , besides from self driving cars , demand a reconfiguration of work to redress the effects of the decoupling of income and labour a socialised transport system is one facet of the solution one to four person drone taxi bradley thomasany re invention of pre existing transport methods , such as a bus that operates above the road , is not the future to truly reinvent travel you have to look up 1 4 person autonomous drones , stored in racks on top of buildings they would operate with both cloud based and localised safety and navigation systems , such as semi autonomous air traffic control at control towers and localised communication of positioning and radar data between drones , creating a constantly communicating , realtime safety network users would hail them through an app with end to end encryption providing gps location data and payment safely and providing a means of transport that could land in any nearby car parking space people may be apprehensive of such a system at first and its inception will likely incur a high cost of travel to start with however this is like any new technology there will be early adopters , and then over time the cost and concern associated with the technology will dissipate , much like air travel in the 20th century all systems are electronic and can therefore be powered by renewable sources , drones will have a service lifetime and be subject to routine maintenance like any other form of public transport disabled access drones could be hailed in the app much like you can hail an accessible minicab , with a ramp and securing safety system the technology already exists to build man carrying drones , but the infrastructure required to put in place such a system would take development , mainly the traffic control and safety network required to police such a busy airspace i know id commute by drone green driverless car sharing app bernardo cantonea potential design of efficient future transportation system , is the fusion of two existing innovations , car sharing and autonomous vehicles \( avs \) , into a powerful app to augment their benefits ideally , avs would run on electrical engines , reducing co2 emissions and noise pollution they would be optimised to smooth traffic flow so as to reduce congestions , and the vehicle size could be reduced \( depending on the local customer requirements \) to save road space furthermore , avs would allow for the transportation of everyone , including non licenced citizens such as the disabled , young and the elderly the augmented benefits from avs car sharing would include the avoidance of inefficient parking \( as cars would have limited time between bookings \) and daily bus services in areas where demand is either infrequent or insufficient , could be substituted by flexible on demand avs to service communities in secluded areas the new app will provide a booking service using av car sharing , by showing car availability by location and include all travel solutions from other transport or car sharing apps thus , expanding the range of travel options and feasibility furthermore , the app would provide details on the co2 footprint of individual trips and provide a breakdown of each persons overall weekly co2 expenditure for short distance trips , or upon reaching of a weekly co2 expenditure threshold , bike or public transports would be recommended and a booking restriction may apply \( though this would not apply to persons with reduced mobility \) thus aiming to increase environmental awareness in travel decision making a possible threat concerns the risk of a cyber attack however , if the technology would become an integrated part of a national infrastructure system , the likelihood of attack could be greatly minimised , as already demonstrated in power grids and air traffic control which is your favourite idea \? keep up with the latest on guardian students follow us

jrgen klopp has defended wayne rooneys late night socialising and described this generation of footballers as the most professional the game has seen all the legends we love and admire drank like devils and smoked like crazy , the liverpool manager claimed , who once wore a santa claus mask to avoid photographers on a christmas night out nights out aside , wayne rooney is not fit enough for southgates england barney ronay read moreklopp offered support and sympathy for the manchester united captain after he apologised unreservedly to the football association for being photographed at a wedding reception in the early hours of sunday rooney , along with the rest of the england squad , had been given time off by gareth southgate following the world cup qualifying win against scotland on friday night and had also been told he would not start the friendly against spain on tuesday the fa has reminded rooney of his responsibilities as england captain and is reviewing its policy of giving players free time on international duty after allegations of drinking but klopp believes there has been a huge over reaction to photographs of rooney at the wedding reception and it is unreasonable to demand a monastic lifestyle from footballers at all times what i can say is i feel really for the players , klopp said i know were all on the sunny side of life , we earn a lot of money and do the job we love , but at the end maybe it comes as a surprise that we are also human beings too sometimes were invited to weddings , birthdays or whatever and we can play the professional role still no , we dont drink , or if you smoke please stand 20 yards away because i dont want to be a passive smoker that is not how life works this generation is the most professional generation of footballers not only in england , but england has ever had all the guys , all the legends we love and admire drank like devils and smoked like crazy but they were still good players no one does it any more i dont know anyone now we had a christmas party after losing against watford in december last year and i had to fill peoples glasses its about timing when you are in the wrong time at the wrong place and its not good as a professional i have no idea where wayne was but im pretty sure its not really serious it is the not nice part of our life our life sounds like a big catastrophe when things are not perfect but its not like that sometimes it is good to have a situation like this you can fine the player and do something good with the money for the team or the kit man or whoever klopp suffered a similar experience to rooney when manager of mainz in 2006 his team were bottom of the bundesliga at the christmas break and having been persuaded to join his friends on a night out klopp came up with a novel idea to avoid being photographed or so he thought the liverpool manager recounted we had 11 points and we were last in the bundesliga table we had a christmas break and friends of ours wanted to have a party in the city nobody could see it was me because i had a mask on , a santa claus mask i didnt feel too good but i needed a little bit of help and i went out i did it then there comes a point when you are a little bit drunk so i lifted the mask and the next thing there is a picture the next day bild printed the picture and said that is how klopp celebrates being 18th it was not that i celebrated but that was the picture it happens and you go on it is not really big the photographs of rooney appeared at a time when the player is struggling to retain his place for club and country but the liverpool manager insisted the united captain is not the only player to drink on a day off from my point of view i dont know much about it but i am pretty sure it is nothing the german national team were in rome and i saw some pics of them in a restaurant they had no glass in their hand but do you say they didnt drink \? thats how it is we live life under a glass we know it most of the time and we function , but sometimes not in one , two , three weeks no one will remember what happened so why make a big thing of it \? klopps thoughts were echoed by the everton manager , ronald koeman , who has spoken to his captain , phil jagielka , after he was photographed on the night out with rooney but believes the bigger problem is social media i spoke to phil this morning not only about this but about other aspects of football , koeman said he was there and he had a drink , but it was after the match and the behaviour of phil was not bad everyone has to understand how dangerous social media is you have to always be an example to young people as a football professional but that is my opinion in general it happened more 25 years ago than it does now but there was not social media then liverpool visit southampton on saturday seeking to extend their lead at the top of the premier league but could be without adam lallana after he sustained a groin injury in englands draw with spain it will be close , klopp said the liverpool manager also insisted he had no concerns that philippe coutinhos head could be turned by frequent reports in spain linking him with a move to barcelona the in form brazil international , claimed klopp , is content with the direction liverpool are heading and will only improve at anfield he said the club is not a problem , our owners are not a problem it is creating the perspective that noone wants to leave that is all it is about if there is a club that can pay double what we pay then i will bring the player there because who am i to say no , no no , please dont think about the family and the kids and the grandkids and their kids , but i dont know a lot of clubs in the world who are able to do this first of all before we talk about money we have to create an atmosphere in and around the club where noone wants to leave at this moment i am not worried about anything the players like to be here and it is our job to make sure it stays like this my opinion is that he feels really well here we all hope and think that his future is here at liverpool everyone forgets when they talk about phil that is he is still very young he is 24 so he is still young and has a long way to go and a lot of space for improvement and development he is now at an age where the skills , in a mixture with his experience , gives you more consistency with the team mates he has around him it is getting better and better i am sure he has only started and that is all good topicswayne rooneyjrgen kloppnewsshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
patrickas the old saying has it good , cheap , fast pick any two this is particularly true for windows laptops , where dozens of companies are competing mainly on price things are different for apple as the only supplier of macbooks it can do what it likes this includes doing things its users dont like , such as soldering ssd and memory chips to motherboards and dropping magsafe , sd slots and standard usb 3 ports from its latest macbook pros this would be suicidal in the windows market , where buyers can switch suppliers in seconds of course , different users want different things , so the big suppliers lenovo , dell , hp , asus , acer etc have different ranges for different market segments dell , for example , makes three ranges for consumers \( inspiron , xps , alienware \) , three ranges for business users \( latitude , optiplex , precision \) , and the vostro range for the soho \( small office home office \) market it therefore caters to budget price sensitive buyers \( inspiron and latitude \) , prestige quality conscious buyers \( xps , optiplex \) , and performance oriented pro buyers \( alienware games machines , precision workstations \) macbooks dont fit this kind of scheme theyre over engineered consumer laptops with enough performance for most professional purposes not many windows laptop manufacturers can charge pro prices for consumer designs , though microsoft is having a go as a result , you will have to compromise however , you can find windows laptops that are comparable to macbooks in many respects , but cheaper just look for the various prestige consumer ranges such as dells xps , hps spectre and asuss zenbook apple pricesapple has just released new macbook pro laptops there are three versions of the 13in macbook pro with intel core i5 processors and 8gb of memory at 1 , 449 , 1 , 749 and 1 , 949 there are also new 15in macbook pros with core i7 processors and 16gb of memory for 2 , 349 and 2 , 699 all prices include vat but not port adaptors or applecare support you havent given me a budget , but halving apples cheapest new macbook pro prices would suggest a range of 725 to 1 , 200 this is in the same ballpark as the survivors from the old ranges 13in macbook airs at 949 and 1 , 249 , plus the macbook at 1 , 249 which i assume you will also consider laptop optionsthe dell xps 13 and 15 are the most obvious alternatives to macbooks unfortunately , they are at the top of this price range you can still get an old model xps 13 \( 9350 \) for 899 , but that has a core i5 6200u with only 4gb of memory the latest 9360 version has a 2 5ghz core i5 7200u , 8gb of memory and a 128gb ssd for 999 if you go for a 512gb ssd at 1 , 099 , youre only saving 400 on a new 2 0ghz macbook pro the dell xps 15 is better value you get a core i7 6700hq , 8gb of memory , nvidia geforce gtx 960m graphics with 2gb of video memory , and a 256gb ssd for 1 , 249 it has a thunderbolt 3 port , two usb 3 0 ports , hdmi and an sd card slot its also small and light for a machine with a 15in screen it measures 357 x 235mm \( roughly 14 x 9in \) and weighs 1 78kg \( 3 9lbs \) this compares with 349 x 241mm and 1 83kg \( 4 02lbs \) for the new thinner and lighter macbook pro 15 , which costs 1 , 100 more hps spectre x360 range offers similar features to dells xps range , except that all the x360 laptops have touch screens that you can rotate to enable tent \( eg for movie viewing \) or tablet operation the cheapest model is the hp spectre x360 13 4126na this has a 13in screen , a core i5 6200u processor , 8gb of memory and a 256gb ssd for 999 you can upgrade to an hp spectre x360 13 4129na with better screen resolution 2560 x 1440 instead of 1920 x 1080 plus a 2 5ghz core i7 6500u and 512gb ssd for 1 , 199 again , this is not much cheaper than a 2 0ghz macbook pro 13 yet again , the 15in hp spectre x360 15 ap007na is better value for only 100 more , you get a 4k \( 3840 x 2160 \) screen , a core i7 6560u with intel iris graphics 540 , 16gb of memory , and a 512gb ssd in a 1 82kg machine even at 1 , 299 , its still 1 , 050 cheaper than the new macbook pro 15 cheaper and cheaperyou could also look at the lenovo thinkpad t560 , which is a robust , professional 15 6in laptop that starts at 751 19 the main attraction is that you can customise it from a menu with a huge range of options you could get one with a core i5 6200u , 8gb of memory , nvidia geforce 940mx with 2gb , a 256gb ssd and windows 10 home for 901 19 and that includes three years of on site service upgrading the second battery from 47whr to 72whr would add another 12 upgrading the ram to 16gb would add 52 80 upgrading the cpu to a core i7 6600u would add 260 the asus zenbooks may also appeal because of their apple style aluminium unibody construction , though theyre really aimed at macbook and macbook air users the zenbook ux330ua fb025t with a 3200 x 1800 screen , core i5 6200u , 8gb of memory and 256gb ssd is good value at 749 99 pc world has the similar ux310ua for 649 99 , and you can find many other models if you shop around possibly the cheapest just about viable option is the 14in lenovo ideapad 510s , which is a step down from the zenbooks all the various models have 1920 x 1080 pixel screens and 8gb of memory the cheapest on lenovos website has a 2 4ghz core i3 7100u and a 128gb ssd for 509 99 , while the most expensive has a 2 9ghz core i5 6267u and a 256gb ssd for 599 99 however , john lewis has a silver one with a core i7 6567u for 599 99 , so that might be worth a look of course , there are hundreds of cheaper windows laptops , starting at less than 150 it just depends how far you are willing to drop your standards chips cost money , so below a certain point , price reductions may be coming from compromises on the quality of the case , keyboard , trackpad and screen if they break , you just buy another why not a desktop \? you mention that youre open to either a laptop or a desktop if so , you could get more power and better ergonomics by buying a desktop i covered this last week in which desktop pc should i buy for working from home \? if you went for a lenovo thinkcenter m800 , you would have many of the same options as when configuring a thinkpad t560 laptop you would also be able to add your own upgrades immediately or after another five years or whatever if you dont need to replace your laptop in a hurry , you could wait to see whether apple brings out a new version of the mac mini next year the current model was launched in 2010 and hasnt been updated for more than two years its not really expandable the memory is soldered in and not very good value \( 479 to 949 \) , but its small and it runs macos a 21 5in imac \( 1 , 049 to 1 , 449 \) could be an option too have you got another question for jack \? email it to ask jack theguardian comtopicslaptopsask jackwindowscomputingfeaturesshare on facebookshare on twittershare via

a man who uses misogynistic language and has been accused of sexual assault is soon to become the 45th president of the united states of america for feminists desperate to see the countrys first female president , the result was devastating how could someone with such disregard for womens rights become leader \? donald trump boasted about being able to freely grope women because he is famous , and by the end of the race 12 different women had come forward to accuse him of sexual assault he also suggested during his campaign that women should face some form of punishment for having abortions , before backtracking and saying states and congress should take the lead with lawmaking on this matter after the publication of a video in which he describes grabbing women by the pussy , experts and many non experts predicted that hed lost the female vote but this turned out to be incorrect it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their actionslauraaccording to cnn exit polls , 53 of white women voted for trump those without a college degree supported trump over democrat candidate hillary clinton by nearly two to one white women with a college degree only narrowly voted in favour of clinton by six percentage points by contrast , 94 of black women and 68 of latinas voted for clinton some feminists are finding it difficult to comprehend why women werent so offended by trumps misogyny that they voted for clinton en mass we interviewed women across america to find out why they voted for trump and why they describe themselves as feminists heres what they said laura , 27 a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or expected , she thinks and makes her own choicesgovernment worker laura , who lives in the much fought over state of florida , voted for trump she describes herself as socially moderate , financially independent and educated every female i know , either friends or co workers except for one voted for trump i want to show it was not only men or non college educated citizens that voted trump i am an economic conservative who is registered as a non party affiliate i feel that trump has the best economic polices to create jobs and therefore rebuild the economy i truly thought the video of trump was , as its been dubbed , locker room talk having two brothers , boyfriends , and a fiance , i can make an educated guess that all heterosexual men have bragged about their exploits with women to another man at some point i believe in equality between the sexes i have the right and capability to make my own decisions , and live the life i choose for myself because i am a feminist i know and exercised my right not to be put in a box or voting group and to freely think and make my own judgment as to who i thought would be the best candidate for president it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their actions a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or expected , she thinks and makes her own choices i thought the sexual allegations were unsubstantiated and therefore equivalent to rumours and campaign mudslinging if these women had truly been assaulted why wait until one month before the election to come forward to the press not the authorities i thought it incredibly hypocritical to characterise him as a sexual predator when we know for a fact that bill clinton is one , and hillary helped him cover it up through libel and slander of the women who did come forward this didnt change my opinion about him , except for maybe a more sympathetic attitude and feeling that the media was treating him unfairly a persons gender has no bearing whatsoever in their qualifications for a job , including the presidency hillary was not clear as to what her policies as president would be , except to maybe continue with the same failed practices her policies would not have helped our depressed and stagnant economy i believe trumps plans for job creation benefits everyone , including minority groups i also ascribe , and have for a long time , to a more isolationist foreign policy alyssa im not going to vote for somebody because of their gender or race trump voter alyssa , a mother of two boys who is currently not employed , calls herself a feminist on most things , but she is fiercely opposed to voting for someone based on gender alone instead she backed trump , who shares her own beliefs including not raising taxes her home state of ohio a mix of rust belt , big city appalachia , farmland and suburbs more white and less educated than the national mean voted for trump at some things i would be a feminist but it doesnt mean i vote for someone because she has a vagina ive always voted republican and always support the party they pushed a female candidate through to break the glass ceiling of a perceived gender equality biasheatherat the end of the day the video of trump did not affect my support for him what he says and what he does dont matter in those senses because im looking for somebody that has the same beliefs as i do in running a country at the end of the day were all sinners and we all say things like this it isnt uncommon we act like the president of united states should be some holy person we can go through all the us presidents and you will see sexual dysfunctions in all of their personal lives , even hillarys husband had an affair at the end of the day , my husbands sex life does not involve his work life and my sex life does not involve my day to day life these women that came out about trump could have been hoping for media attention , or maybe just simply paid by hillary to make her criminal issues look smaller im not going to vote for somebody because of their gender or race there is nothing other than whether they can run the country or not heather im a throwback , which naturally lends itself to traditional femininity facebook twitter pinterest photograph matt rourke apafter republican nominee ben carson was knocked out of the presidential race , heather brown backed trump brown believes that under trump the us economy will prosper and the average american will be able to succeed in areas where they are currently struggling home ownership , work and finance she says that trump isnt the misogynist hes reported to be i really just felt like they pushed a female candidate through to break the glass ceiling of a perceived gender equality bias politics can be unscrupulous it demands you constantly remember that behind every door lives a pushed agenda you are meant to follow without thinking you have to seek both sides , look at every angle and excise the fragments of truth im an intelligent , fully capable woman i simply prefer the leadership of a strong maleheathervoting is a great privilege that ultimately impacts the trajectory of a nation when i make such important decisions i do not make them so lightly as to base them on race or gender i voted on like mindedness , research , shared philosophy , belief compatibility and frankly hope trump got a lot more airtime than carson , who was polite and played by the rules carson was too quiet for a nation that chases tornadoes and is captivated by blazes trumps failings humanise him and make him relatable theres a lot more riding on this presidency than political correctness im a throwback , which naturally lends itself to traditional femininity ive always been attracted to alpha males but then , after the popularity of 50 shades of grey , im hardly alone dont get me wrong , im an intelligent , fully capable woman i simply prefer the leadership of a strong male lena , 64 id like a female president , but i couldnt vote for hillarylena smith , a white woman from a middle class background who is pro womens rights , voted for trump smith lives in new jersey a state with an above average median income , and a less than average white population of 57 8 she and only one other of her friends admitted to voting for trump smith describes herself as living in a bubble , protected from many of the problems striking average americans she has enough money , a good job and security she voted for change , specifically for those in the midwest like her cousins , who are struggling despite being a republican , id have preferred to vote for bernie sanders over trump it all boiled down to not being able to vote for hillary the election wasnt about who you wanted to in the white house , it was more about who you didnt want in the white house the us will no longer feel like a haven for jews under trump jonathan freedland read morepeople would privately confess to me that they couldnt vote for hillary she felt like a continuation of a politics that wasnt working it was due to lack of trust and a steadfast resistance to more corruption and collusion with big money and foreign governments in washington i would like to see a woman as president , but would like one who is not part of a charitable foundation that has taken large donations from big money around the globe and from foreign governments , many of which do not have americas best interests at heart i see issues for women as well as other minorities as very important however , in this election , national as well global security in terms of terrorism , the economy and jobs for americans were key issues it was easy for me to make up my mind , but i cant say im a trump supporter topicsfeminismthe panelus elections 2016donald trumprepublicansus politicsgendercommentshare on

the time i woke ben up , the room was really beginning to shake he went to the window to look outside and as soon as he crossed the room the full brunt of the earthquake hit and he was thrown across the room the noise from the earthquake was indescribable , it was incredibly loud , at the same time we could also see bright white flashes outside from power lines being ripped apart it lasted 30 seconds but it felt a lot longer we ran down the emergency exit and it felt like something out of a movie ceilings were falling down , cracks were rapidly appearing in the walls and the water pipes had burst so water was pouring down from the ceilings and flooding the corridors the hotel staff were brilliant and we all sat outside waiting for the all clear once outside , the tsunami siren starting ringing a lot of people fled to mount victoria but this caused gridlock on the roads we were given the all clear to go back into the building at 3am , thinking we would be relatively safe on the seventh floor if a tsunami was to hit since then , we have felt eight major aftershocks , all ranging from about 5 7 6 6 the hotel shakes and sways and the cbd in wellington looks like a ghost town we were having dinner when a 6 5 hit at 8 15pm local time seeing the restaurant and the high street outside swaying is something i will never forget we havent been able to leave wellington as our car is trapped in a car park which is waiting to be assessed before we are allowed to gain access the front of the car park has collapsed we were meant to be going over to picton today but the ferries have stopped as the ports have sustained major damage the most amazing thing is that for such a powerful earthquake , the damage caused is very minimal compared to the christchurch earthquake 2011 we woke up expecting devastation everybody has been extremely lucky tsunami safe level markings on roads on hills around wellington photograph ross setford aap
social historians will read the list and weep the top 10 global box office movies in the year the us elected donald trump and self destructed as a superpower five are american superhero films four are animal cartoons one is an impenetrable sci fi comedy that became immensely popular in china but nowhere else faced with a demagogic clown as president and a white supremacist as his right hand man hollywoods moguls will arrive at their offices this week facing a momentous decision american democracy is in peril the universal values on which the movie industry has based itself are being called into question by the ethno nationalism and misogyny of the trump moment so , do they continue to produce a stream of mindless blockbusters starring furry creatures and superheroes or do they put their talent , resources and justifiable fury into movies that tell us how we got here , and how we escape \? do they attempt , above all , to inject humanity and tolerance back into the narratives americans consume with their popcorn \? the only comparable reference point is the early 1940s if you look at the genre of movies produced in the first full year of the second world war while the us was neutral theres a massive backlog of westerns , crime movies and screwball comedies from the 30s and even the few war movies produced have a troubled relationship with the fighting in hitchcocks foreign correspondent , for example finished months after the start of the war the studio can never really decide whether the secret agents that the hero is rounding up are supposed to be german or from a fictional country it was only when the attack on pearl harbor forced the us to fight that hollywood discovered its soul japan attacked on 7 december 1941 eleven months later , warner bros premiered casablanca , in which an embittered american leftist , hunched over a whisky glass , berates the uss complacency if its december 1941 in casablanca , humphrey bogart rages , what time is it in new york \? casablanca dramatised , in a way that its predecessors had only promised , all the moral issues at stake for the us in the war while other early war movies were populated with cheery proletarian cannon fodder , casablanca is filled with all the social misfits of the noir years gamblers , refugees , womanising cops , thieves and a \( thinly disguised \) sex worker only now , for all of them , life had just got serious its all the more of an achievement if you cast your eye over the stage play on which the film was based in everybody comes to ricks , the story is the same , but much of its dialogue sounds like nol coward probably for this reason , it had never been staged but a studio executive must have said lets turn this story into a universal narrative that will stand re watching for ever because it portrays cynical but peaceful people in the depths of a dilemma about when , why and who to fight it would be easy this week for decision makers in narrative industries across the english speaking world the movies , the tv networks and the big theatres to take comfort in the delusions peddled by the us media that trump is just reagan with bad hair that the establishment will tame him that , anyway , it is just four years and then back to normal but the revolt that brought trump to power represents an ideological break with any situation the uss myth makers have known from now on , even in the most inconsequential domestic drama , every characters ethnicity matters if theyre a black male , are they one of the 13 who voted for the ku klux klans man , or against him for any actor building a character in a drama set in the present , the question becomes what does my character think about trump , brexit , the collapse of liberal norms in public life \? the mechanisms available to cope with this situation in the movie industry are pretty sclerotic the reason that five out of the top 10 movies this year are superhero movies is because superheroes sell better than human heroes both the bond and the bourne franchise \( full disclosure ive contributed to the latter \) have attempted social relevance and psychological darkness , but the audience is wary even deadpool a satire on the superhero genre grossed more than any major movie with a fully human protagonist the result of pursuing blockbuster formula is , for the studios , that the development process becomes long , highly commercial and reliant on the intuitions of finance guys you could argue it was ever thus , but that didnt stop warner bros buying the rights to the casablanca stage play in january 1942 and getting the whole thing into theatres by november in the face of all these obstacles , someone , somewhere , needs to start putting the stories of american working class people on the big screen tell them truthfully as michael cimino did in the deer hunter and the myth of the uniformly reactionary white working class explodes the modern deer hunter , like the modern casablanca , might not feature a man as its protagonist , so central are women to work , community and resistance in working america ben urwand , in his book the collaboration , details hollywoods guilty relationship with hitler in the 1930s if so , tinseltown redeemed itself after pearl harbor this time around , if it has been guilty of anything , it is of the liberal complacency that assumed that if you feed the masses with formulaic narratives of redemption and mythic violence , they will ignore rightwing radicalism so , it is time we demand that the storytelling industry addresses the truth a man takes charge of the us on a wave of racial and misogynist hate he screws up the world order so badly it spirals into chaos down these mean streets , as raymond chandler put it , a man or woman must go who is not mean , who is neither tarnished nor afraid not a marmoset , nor a native of the planet krypton , but a human being topicsfilm industryopiniondonald trumpcasablancacommentshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
lets suppose , for a minute , that the trump transition has some organizing principle beyond the chaotic , conflicting impulses of a megalomaniac what do the first two appointments of president elect trump , as well as the first week of his transition to power , tell us about his forthcoming reign \? at first blush , trump seems to have squared two competing desires with reince priebus as his chief of staff , trump is placating and controlling his own party , now ruling both sides of capitol hill the rnc chairman is perfectly plugged into the messy politics of the republican leadership with steve bannon as his chief strategist , trump is placating the pitchfork mob that helped sweep him to power bannons role inside any organization is traditionally the keeper of the ideological flame in case anyone was still confused about trumps ideology , bannon is chairman of breitbart , a sewer of racist and sexist excrement but nothing in trumpistan is that neat in the brief time the great orange leader has presided over the semi public enterprise of his presidential campaign , we know he has a track record of tolerating the kind of internal rivalry that ends up in ritual slaughter his first campaign manager , corey lewandowski , warred openly with his second campaign manager , paul manafort and the same goes for the third and fourth people to fill those roles \( no matter their official titles \) kellyanne conway and steve bannon himself chaos is trumps coin of the realm the only complex situation he seems to manage with some consistency are his tax avoidance schemes the bannon priebus announcement was carefully constructed with bannons appointment ahead of priebus such formalities do not go unnoticed in the corridors of power of the nations capital , where the pecking order is the only game in town of the two , bannon is by far the superior operator , having turned breitbart from a cult into a powerhouse of white nationalism needless to say , this is not a positive development for an immensely diverse nation with a long history of racial violence priebus , for his part , has shown his house of cards talent by staging the coup that ousted his former boss , michael steele priebus seized the job of rnc chair just after steeles rnc swept the board in the 2010 mid term elections but with no experience in the executive or legislative branches of government , priebus is hopelessly out of his depth at best , hes a party hack who will follow the orders of his friends on capitol hill at worst , hell drown as he attempts to manage the west wing , the federal bureaucracy , national security crises , washington politics , the venal media , and a president who has returned to twitter all of which makes him easy pickings for bannon , who is offensive in every sense of the word according to sworn testimony by his ex wife , bannon is so virulently antisemitic that he insisted he didnt want his girls going to school with jews \( bannon denies he ever said it \) not for nothing as the anti defamation league gone public with its opposition to his appointment the coming bannon priebus cage fight is only one side of the struggle for power inside the administration for the real influence lies in the hands of trumps children and son in law already jared kushner , husband to ivanka , has reportedly ousted the head of the transition , the hapless and gormless new jersey governor , chris christie ostensibly christies downfall was because he is embroiled in the scandal known as bridgegate but the proceedings about the closure of the george washington bridge have been rumbling for three years a more likely scenario is that christie could not be trusted with such a powerful transition job because he presided , as us attorney in new jersey , over the prosecution of kushners father blood is so much thicker than water , especially inside trump tower with so many competing fiefdoms , the trump presidency has already sown the seeds of its own chaos can these people successfully navigate their way out of a paper bag , never mind the confirmation process that could doom their own administration \? in case people have forgotten , with full control of congress and at the height of his popularity , the newly elected president obama stumbled repeatedly with nominees whose tax returns were questionable and who seemed too cozy with corporate power perhaps president trump can help his nominees dodge their tax questions by ordering the irs to audit them all as quickly as possible as for his desire to drain the swamp of corporate influence , those promises are now being managed by a small army of lobbyists who control his transition how clueless is team trump \? according to the wall street journal , they had no idea the entire west wing would evacuate on inauguration day next year that they would have to appoint every single member of staff , except for the permanent help tending to the building and grounds as a result , president obama intends to spend more time helping his successor understand the scale of what hes about to take on the first black president is going to help train the 44th white president whose campaign was built on questioning his own citizenship obama started his presidency winning the nobel peace prize , but he ends it deserving some kind of sainthood like all good shakespearean tragedies , the trump presidency is presaging its own collapse at the height of its glory the priebus bannon family disputes will corrode the west wing from within they are the manifestation of a leader who projects certainty but cannot decide if he wants to repeal all of obamacare or keep parts of it if he wants to end abortion rights or force women to travel to get abortions if he wants to bring the country together or end the wave of racist intimidation that is being spray painted across our schools and churches the republican establishment may think they can manage trump through priebus but they are about to discover that this dumpster fire of a campaign just turned into a brushfire of a transition topicstrump administrationopiniondonald trumpsteve bannonreince priebuscommentshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
to understand what novak djokovic is experiencing for the first time since 23 june 2014 the last time he wasnt no1 in the world it helps to stand back from the heat that has been generated around him in london this week the pressure on him now , as he seeks to win his fifth atp world tour finals in a row and reclaim the rankings crown he lost to andy murray in paris 10 days ago , is unlike everything else he normally goes through djokovic knows when he steps on court that he wins eight times out of 10 , whoever he is playing that certainty has been dented kei nishikori beats stan wawrinka in atp world tour finals opener read moreagainst murray he is 34 10 win loss over the course of their near parallel careers they cannot meet for a 35th time until the semi final on saturday at the earliest , and that would provide as rousing a finish to the season as we have seen in a long time murray does not want to be a two week wonder at the head of the rankings against the other three players in his group at this tournament , djokovic is 24 0 after surviving an edgy first set to beat the nothing to lose young austrian dominic thiem on his london debut on sunday afternoon on tuesday night , djokovic looks for victory no25 against the trio ranged against him , this time taking on milos raonic , whose torn right quad forced his retirement in paris but who looked near to his powerful best beating gal monfils in straight sets on sunday night however , djokovics hold over him is total 7 0 , the most recent win coming in two quick sets on the madrid clay in the summer yet it has invariably been in defeat that djokovic has spoken most movingly and with the sharpest insight about himself and his sport after a loss to marin cilic in the last masters 1000 tournament of the year handed murray his ranking supremacy after a reign of 123 weeks when the scot then was prematurely crowned after raonic pulled out of their semi final , he was considerably more measured than when he snapped in victory over thiem he responded with undisguised impatience on sunday when asked if hitting the ball into the crowd at the end of the first set was part of a worrying pattern of behaviour and whether or not he was comfortable with his mindset , which he earlier in the year admitted had been disturbed by events on and off the court it was a reasonable question to ask a player with the highest profile in his sport you guys are unbelievable , djokovic said , before retreating to what probably was the relative comfort of more amenable questions from the serbian media they have been loyal allies and remain defensive about any criticism of their countrys best and most famous athlete , as a cursory glance at social media will reveal yet djokovics parisian take on life and tennis could not have been more candid im aware that im not the only player in the world who wants to win when he gets out on the court , he said in defeat 10 days ago im going to keep playing at this level as long as i feel like thats the right thing for me i have to get to that state of mind where im able to perform as well as i want to , match after match i was not able to find that level for the last couple of months he added a lot of things are coming out , a lot of things , a lot of emotions went through my mind and body in the last two years it took a lot out of me yet it is when djokovic is wounded , physically or spiritually , that he has found the iron will of a champion in the atps under pressure ratings , he leads andy murray 271 1 to 257 5 over the past 52 weeks although his stats will have taken a light hit since he lost to sam querrey in the third round at wimbledon in the subcategories of the rankings , djokovic has converted 42 4 of break points \( murray 45 1 \) , saved 67 9 \( 65 8 \) , won 73 9 of tie breaks \( 70 4 \) and , most pertinently , 87 5 of deciding sets , to murrays 76 2 all of those numbers are impressive for both players , who they lead kei nishikori , juan martn del potro , thiem , raonic , lucas pouille , richard gasquet , viktor troicki and florian mayer in the aggregated rankings none of which will invade djokovics thinking when he steps out against raonic he knows his resilience under the cosh has wilted a little he does not need reminding that the latter part of the season has been his most uncomfortable spell in a long while although he says his troubles began at wimbledon , he won the rogers cup in toronto without dropping a set after that , it got seriously tough del potro put him out of the rio olympics in the first round , inducing a tearful exit stan wawrinka beat him at the end of a bizarre us open , where a walkover and two retirements helped him into the final world no19 roberto bautista agut beat him for the loss of eight games in the quarter finals of the shanghai masters and cilic , who had not beaten him in 14 attempts , completed the misery for him in paris the reality of battle consumes djokovic it delivers him the inner animal that resides in all great champions if he is fit , he should beat raonic , although it might take three sets after that , he has the unique challenge of the unorthodox monfils , who briefly confused him before losing in four crazy sets in the semi finals at flushing meadows if djokovic gets to the weekend , as he should , the likelihood is we will see the player who for two years has been the best in the world topicsnovak djokovicatp world tour finalstennisnewsshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share

in a day where the visitors went the better part of the first session without losing a wicket , that wasnt a bad fightback from the australians as the afternoon wore on during the final session in particular all batsmen were put under enormous pressure by quicks rabada and abbott through a marathon stint between the two , but only one wicket fell , that of warner \( 45 \) and even that came in bizarre circumstances , abbotts delivery ricocheting off his thigh and arm before landing on the stumps khawajas half century came from 91 balls he was routinely beaten outside the off stump as too were warner and then smith but held his nerve before capitalising on some loose deliveries towards the end of play that end came prematurely on the basis of bad light , seven overs lost so well be back again at 10am for another long day at hobart tomorrow a long day where australia will have plenty of work still yet to do knocking off the 120 runs of deficit that still remain , in an innings where adam voges may well be batting for his career in short be sure to tune in , and follow every over with us here at the guardian thanks for your company have a good night thats it stumps the umpires have called it off ill gather my thoughts for a final wrap in just a jiffy i wish i could make a mount wellington reference but truth told , i cant see it through the clouds there are patches of blue sky either side of bellerive , but to get back on now is a tough ask would require a lot of wind in a hurry three of the four umpires gathered in the middle having a chat , so either way well know pretty soon ric finlay \( ricfinlay \) aus have knocked off half the deficit , with the loss of only two wickets two days to go game not over yet november 14 , 2016 36th over australia 121 2 \( khawaja 56 , smith 18 \) ooooh yeah , khawaja cover driving on the up and doing it with style you get four runs when doing that granted , it came the ball after he was beaten outside the off stump oh and now theyre off for bad light let me go outside for a tic and see if i can make a prediction about the likelihood of them returning for what little that is worth stand by 35th over australia 116 2 \( khawaja 51 , smith 18 \) just a single from khawaja in response to a relatively quiet maharaj over just doing a job to give the quicks a rest here , the spinner fourth ump mick martel is out there to take a light reading the australians would relish the chance to get out of there and into the showers a fraction earlier than scheduled 34th over australia 115 2 \( khawaja 50 , smith 18 \) vernon philander is angry okay \?

almost half of adults have not yet made a will , according to research carried out for by co op legal services it found that just 53 had put down in writing what they wanted to happen in the event of their death its not a job anyone relishes , but if you die without leaving a will , you could leave costs and complications for your loved ones to deal with , alongside a great deal of heartache theres a common misconception that only the supremely wealthy need a will , but everyone should have one even if youve not got much to give , says hannah maundrell from website money co uk writing a will doesnt have to cost a fortune and it wont take long whatever your circumstances , its definitely worth doing if not , you risk leaving your grieving family with a whole host of problems funeral costs can see you digging deep , but small directors ease the pain read moreco op legal services found several reasons why people put off writing a will , with 46 saying they have nothing to leave , 15 not wanting to think about death , and 14 simply not having got around to doing it other concerns include the time it might take and the amount it might cost the idea of not wanting to think about death is a big sticking point , with many people still not comfortable discussing it talking about dying wont make it happen , says toby scott from the dying matters coalition it can feel a bit morbid at first , but knowing youve got your plans and affairs in order can be a great relief you can then get on with living the life you have , safe in the knowledge that everything is in place for loved ones what happens if you die without a will \? it can leave surviving loved ones in a real mess , says scott it can cause problems that take a long time to sort out , and can trigger arguments that can split families apart the reality is , if you die without a valid will you will have no say in what happens to your estate in this scenario the law decides the legal term is intestacy under the rules of intestacy your estate will be divided among certain blood relatives in accordance with a strict order of priority , which may not be in line with your wishes while these rules were updated in october 2014 in a bid to offer more protection to close relatives , certain groups have not benefitted hayley north , chartered financial planner at rose north , says if you are not married your partner has no entitlement to anything even if you have children together step children and step grandchildren also do not automatically inherit so a will is particularly important for cohabiting couples , as well as those who have remarried and have complicated family structures also , it doesnt just ensure that the right people benefit immediately after your death it can allow you to make sure that a new partner stays in your home when you die , but that your children will still be in line to inherit it can feel a bit morbid but knowing that your affairs are in order means you can get on living your lifetoby scott , dying matterswith this paperwork in place , you can also make sure more of your estate goes to your loved ones rather than into the chancellors coffers in avoidable inheritance tax in addition , you can use this document to set out who will be your executors the people who will oversee the distribution of your estate you can even use your will to set down your funeral wishes if you have young children , the other critical thing is who will be their legal guardians , says north however , it is vital to have the conversation with friends and family long before this is required when should you write a will \? another reason commonly cited by people for not having made a will is that they are too young to think about it in reality , it is never too early steven cameron , pensions director at aegon , says none of us knows what the future holds , so the earlier people start inheritance planning , the better protected their loved ones will be a will can be revised later if necessary , or written to take into account certain changes you expect for example , if you are living with a partner but think you may get married you can have wills written in contemplation of marriage inserting this means a will is still valid after you marry 10 of the strangest wills of all time read moreshould you do it yourself \?

wednesday 2 november its another big week for me and my cancer \( arent they all \? \) , but its wednesday so its day , and things are really hotting up before the us election weve got a good show ive managed to persuade piers morgan as one of the few british journalists who actually knows donald trump to speak to us from his car while hes filming in florida for itv and hes really interesting about what the media have and , critically , havent understood about the donald piers is also one of the people from the worlds of journalism and broadcasting many of whom if im honest i really cant claim to know especially well whove come forward to make my life easier \( whether they know this or not \) by offering good wishes and positive thoughts and if my experience is anything to go by , if you know anyone with a cancer diagnosis dont hesitate just drop them a line to let them know youre thinking of them genuinely appreciated all ! the show went well , i think , but im still suffering from occasionally quite acute fatigue i blame the radiotherapy , as i didnt get anything like this in the course of seven cycles of heavy duty chemo also since the radiotherapy , im really only able to sleep on my back \( earplugs , earplugs , my kingdom for a pair of earplugs , can i hear despairing partners muttering \? \) the doctors reckon this might be because of the impact of the radiotherapy on my diaphragm , which mightve been clipped by the high energy x ray beams anyhow , alls well with the back sleeping malarkey except that at around five on thursday morning i get the first signs of an unmistakable and potentially very painful condition kidney stones ! i was first diagnosed with them more than 25 years ago and every now and again since a new one would get stuck in my kidney and kick off a bout of renal colic the name given to the excruciating pain that can come with them this time a couple of painkillers see it off but stand by , if you can face it , for what happened a few days laterthursday 3 novembermy first day on the new treatment paclitaxel and ramucirumab \( the one im having to pay for \) and my first visit to what one of the nurses laughingly described as business class , otherwise known as the ppmdu \( private patients medical day unit \) so at 9am there i am being shown into the unit , discreetly hidden from the regular nhs day unit ill be visiting later for my paclitaxel infusion and guess what \? it looked very similar to its nhs equivalent and while were on the subject of business class , the seats were actually identical ! staff were great , of course , and i got my first dose of the very expensive \( 12 , 000 plus per cycle \) ramucirumab , which the nhs currently wont finance the treatment was first class and , as ive previously indicated , ive no problem with the principle that i should pay for it , as the nhs should be protected from additional unfunded treatment costs i choose to avail myself of but i still struggle with the royal marsden taking a 20 markup simply to supply an already very expensive drug which , by the way , is already standard treatment as part of second line chemotherapy for my cancer in the us and charging a private patients day rate as a whole day for a treatment that takes just over an hour ive taken to calling it my very own cash for treatment scandal i hope theyre putting the money to good use , which is perhaps something worth looking into anyhow , having received my ramucirumab , i was escorted back downstairs to rejoin the rest of the human race in the nhs mdu and do you know , aside from having identical seats to upstairs , i think there might actually be more space down here \? but time to get reacquainted with the cold cap this , as its name suggests , is a rubber cap attached to a refrigeration system that rapidly cools the wearers head , thus reducing the risk of hair loss that some chemotherapy drugs otherwise more or less guarantee it doesnt work for everyone , but it really worked for me over seven cycles of chemo and to be honest , a few quizzical looks from other patients more used to seeing women using it and the endurance test that is the first 20 minutes of wearing it as it literally freezes your scalp \( think ice cream brain freeze and multiply by 10 \) was a very small price to pay of course id forgotten how hard it would be and very nearly took it off but in the end the name of the new machines they now have at the marsden , paxmans true ! and a well timed traquiliser from the staff got me though it and , so far , i still have hair on my head saturday 5 novembertoday would turn out to be one of the most difficult since i was diagnosed back in march and none of it to do with my cancer or its metastases directly for a start , i have been suffering with constipation \( thousands of cancer patients do \) which , once it gets to 5 or 6 days as it has for me can become almost painfully uncomfortable then there was the discomfort under my right ribs put down to my liver playing up or , more likely , another hangover from the radiotherapy and to cap it all was the recurring renal colic from my age old kidney stones and their appalling sense of timing and heres the twist the painkillers co codamol , a mixture of paracetamol and codeine tend to work less effectively over time but , critically , make you more constipated ! to cut a long story short , saturday was a bit of a perfect storm in increasing discomfort and waiting until enough time had elapsed to allow me to take more painkillers which a \) no longer quite do the job and b \) make the you know what worse as a result , i cant leave the house and have no desire to eat or drink and its the latter thats set to provide the biggest twist of all tuesday 8 novemberdue at marsden for pre chemo blood tests preparatory to the next dose of new chemo due thursday by now , after such a dreadful weekend , i can add extreme fatigue to my list of ailments shower , dress and have to sit down , slightly breathless , for a rest blood tests show sharply declining level of platelets , which means no chemo for me unless they recover doctor also spots that my blood pressure is pretty low and i get light headed when standing up and so prescribes intravenous fluids to help wednesday 9 novemberup at six , looking forward to radio 4 today unfortunately , same thing happens extreme fatigue and dizzy when i stand up decide might not be possible the bbc , by the way , have been nothing but support itself over the course of my cancer travails return to hospital for more iv fluids i think these are probably the longer term consequences of the radiotherapy taking my appetite for food , and critically , drink away , and my simply not drinking enough for far too longthursday 10 novemberback to marsden to see whether platelet levels have improved sufficiently for treatment to proceed not only have they gone down further something my consultant dr starling and her team are unsure of the cause of but my blood pressures up and down like a yo yo as a result , i was admitted as an in patient to the marsden to try to get these things sorted out and see what might be done with my kidney stones , which are still giving me gyp ! and three days later , as i write intravenous fluids and antibiotics and a host of new medications later thats where i still am ps the ward staff are great and the foods not bad at all topicscancermy cancer diaryhealthnhsradio 4bbcradio industryfeaturesshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
saturday night live began its first post election episode on a sombre note kate mckinnon , dressed as hillary clinton , singing several verses of leonard cohens hallelujah \( not just the ones that make the sanitised radio play versions \) and playing piano im not giving up and neither should you , she said at the end but then , it was time for dave chappelles return to television , with a standing ovation from the crowd for those people who remember chappelle mostly from first or reruns of comedy centrals the chappelle show and not his transcendent , ahead of its time standup comedy you missed out , go watch killing them softly and then come back to this recap chappelle couldve just stood up on that stage and bullshat his way through a staff written monologue and you wouldve laughed but he didnt it was vintage , and it was real , and here are the words that he said i didnt know that donald trump was going to win the election i did suspect it seemed like hillary was doing well at the polls , and yet , i know the whites you guys arent as full of surprises as you used to be and i think i speak for all of black america when i say that we are all praying for omarosa i dont even know what shes doing in the news i havent see white people this mad since the oj verdict im not saying im enjoying it , im just saying ive never seen this before chappelle explained i watched a white riot in portland , oregon , on television the other night people said they did 1m worth of damages , every black person was watching that like , amateurs im staying out of it , he vowed im going to take a knee like the san franciso 49ers quarterback kaepernick , let the whites figure this out amongst themselves weve been here before i dont think its even the most important thing were dealing with dont forget all the things that are going on shootings , he said , then riffing on how the pulse nightclub shooter was rumoured to have a grindr account you cant even go to the goddamn zoo without seeing a shooting out there , he added they shot a gorilla in my local zoo and the cincinnati police said that shooting that gorilla was the toughest decision this department ever had to make i said , you about to see a lot of n s in gorilla costumes in cincinnati why do we have to say that black lives matter , he asked rhetorically now , i admit thats not the best slogan , but mcdonalds already took , you deserve a break today i get its kind of catching , because everyone else is biting it , he said even the police bite it blue lives matter what , was he born a police \? that is not a blue life , thats a blue suit you dont like it , take that suit off , find a new job cause im gonna tell you right now , if i could quit being black today id be out of the game returning to trump , chappelle had a confession to make i feel bad saying it , im staying in a trump hotel right now , he revealed i dont know if hell make a good president , but he makes a swell hotel suite im telling you that housekeeper comes in the morning , cleans my room and im like , hey , housekeeper grab a big handful of pussy say , you know , boss said it was ok he also admitted that , unlike some of his other wealthy black contemporaries , hes not leaving but is going to stay to take advantage of the tax breaks first time i got some money , it didnt work out like that , he said most unlikely thing happened ever , the first black president came out of nowhere like , come on everybody , lets start thinking about everyone else aw , no , n i just got this money ! i didnt think you was possible as a topic , though , trump remained irresistible trump went to go see obama last week , you see that \? did you see trumps face when he came out of that meeting \? he asked the audience trump got sonned he looked shook he looked like he got shook but even chappelle couldnt resist an appeal to the emotion of the week , at the end of his monologue did you need a skit \? fine the first skit was a too real look at a brooklyn results watching party at which chappelle played the only black guy in the room the white guests started off quite optimistic as the polls closed , while chappelles character was increasingly cynical for the white guests , who continue drinking and popping xanax to get through , the results play against their beliefs in america while affirming chappelles cynicism at 10pm , when in real life it was clear that clintons path to a win was incredibly narrow , chris rock appeared i dont get you ladies , he said the country is 55 women if the country was 55 black , wed have a tonne of black presidents flava flav would be president cecily strongs character , said oh my god , america is racist chapelles reaction oh my god i think my great grandfather told me something like that but he was like a slave or something , i dont know aidy bryants character echoed strongs , saying i cant believe it , why arent people turning out for hillary the way they did for barack obama \? chris rock had a response maybe because youre replacing a charismatic 40 year old black guy with a 70 year old white woman thats like the knicks replacing patrick ewing with neil patrick harris at the end , as one of the actors declared the election the most shameful thing americas ever done , rock and chappelle laughed and laughed for the second skit , chappelle , in a call back to the trope of his comedy central show in which he stood on stage and introduced his sketches , stood on stage and introduced a sketch featuring many of the characters from his show as part of a homage to the walking dead crack head tyrone biggums , playa hater silky johnson \( with an assist from donnell rawlings \) lil jon , who was pleased to see chappelle doing him again , and the black white supremacist \( clad , for course , in a make america great again hat \) then , it was time for an amazing performance by a tribe called quest , which ended with then standing in front of a large portrait of phife dawg , a member of the group who died earlier this year on weekend update , which came next , michael che admitted i didnt want trump to win , but as a comedian , its a little encouraging the jokes generally hit the mark \( like josts a 70 year old holding a new career is not how a presidents supposed to work its the plot of the intern , a plot which rolling stone called pure fantasy and ches donald trump made white guys feel special again \) , except for a totally random dig at fellow castmate leslie jones and her supposed interest in dating white men , which should be a reason she never agrees to play to that stereotype again the best joke of the night was probably josts despite donald trumps campaign promise to drain the swamp , many of the people in line for his administration are long time washington insiders and lobbyists because even if you drain the swamp , its still full of newts , at which point a picture of trump ally and former house speaker newt gingrich appeared , a sleepy little turtle \( trump opponent turned surrogate ben carson \) a hissing possum \( former new york city mayor rudy giuliani \) and a pile of wet garbage \( new jersey governor and trump sycophant , recently demoted from the trump transition team , chris christie \) then kate mckinnon made an appearance as us supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg im never gonna step down now , she revealed , pouring emergen c in her mouth im eating an apple a day to keep ben carson away and , by apple , i mean pure human growth hormones she said and if that doesnt work , ive hidden horcruxes in all the tablets in the dc metro area is that ghoul giuliani really going to be our attorney general \? she asked though , if i really want to live forever , maybe i should just let him bite me bite me giuliani ! you just got ginsburged on mike pence , though , mckinnon hit her stride to me , he kind of looks like the neighbour who kisses kevin spacey in american beauty , she said hey , mike pence , sorry you looked at magnum pi once and got a quarter chub and youve been haunted by it ever since usually after weekend update comes the less explicable sketches though , with chappelle involved , they were way better than usual first was something that seemed like a typical post wu sketch jheris place , where all the employees use jheri curl but instead of trying to make it work , the sketch turned into a meta statement on how sketches go wrong , with a post game style press conferencethen , the first pre taped segment , kids talk politics , which featured kids saying cutely funny stuff about trump , until the last girl , who was african american , went off he unleashed racism and xenophobia , she said to cast member vanessa bayer we now return to the dark ages of white presidents also , my dad said that donald trump will stop and frisk my cat , she said innocently we have a black cat his names pussy surprise ! shes dave chappelles daughter sounds like someones dropping some truth after that , we arrive at donnellys , a dive bar in which kenan thompson is calling last call chappelle and mckinnon play the kind of unreconstructed drunks you used to be able to find at dive bars in new york before dive bar became a trendy way to describe a place and not a description of the kind of bar in which youd find maintenance alcoholics , heads down , sleeping standing up give me one more of those scotch and peptos said chapelles character ive got a case of the squirts , but i still want to drink they make out in various disgusting obvious ways , and thompson has trouble holding in the giggles then the sketch ends with the bartender killing both customers a tribe called quest returned for the second song , which was great and , for the end , busta rhymes joined them post tribe , there was a pre taped with lesie jones about the difficulties of dating , setting up a mockumentary about her supposed romance with fellow castmate kyle mooney who , its revealed is a virgin \( hes 32 in real life \) it ends with chappelle goddamn , did you all fuck in my dressing room \? in the final sketch , chappelle has his boys over to watch the football game in his basement , only to reveal that he lives with his mom , played by jones the twist shes still breast feeding her 43 year old son he does a shot of fresh breast milk , she brings milk and cookies for his friends to their barely disguised disgust , he feeds and he comes out with a face covered in milk , to the disgust of the characters \( and the barely suppressed laughter of the actors \) then the characters sister comes down , they feed together , jones squirts milk on everyone and its all anyone can do not to laugh its probably the weirdest and yet most hilarious end of night sketch in a long time but , thats what happens when you have chappelle on this article was amended on 30 november 2016 an earlier version said that a tribe called quest were standing in front of a poster of mike brown , the unarmed teenager shot by police officers in ferguson , missouri in 2014 this has been corrected to say the poster was of phife dawg , a member of the group who died earlier this year topicssaturday night livesaturday night live recapus televisionepisode recapstelevisionnewsshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
picture the scene a us air force f 16 falcon has come down over syria the pilot is being held by islamic state which threatens to behead him video shows the pilot being tortured in a cage , while the terrorists taunt new us president , donald trump the pilots family plead for the white house to save him the drama is dominating the 24 hour tv news networks its a media storm what will trump do \? answer nobody has a clue trump lacks military experience he has never served in the armed forces nor does he have any background in diplomacy what trump does have , by all accounts , is a short fuse a tendency to shoot first and ask questions later his predecessors would have played for time , appealed to local allies , or pursued deniable , back door talks while examining options for a rescue but president trump is different unused to the awesome responsibility of the oval office , under fierce pressure to act , enraged by isiss personal jibes , infuriated by accusations of dithering , and determined not to show weakness , it is easy to imagine trump making a wrong , hasty and disastrous call with a few hot headed words , translated into situation room orders , trump could not only lose the pilot , he could plunge the us inextricably into the quagmire of another middle east war there are grave doubts about trump 's inexperience , volatile temperament and macho instinctsgrave doubts about trumps inexperience , volatile temperament and macho instincts also apply in other global hotspots where a us presidents actions , or inaction , are always critical and sometimes lethal here are five dangerous flashpoint issues that could suddenly and unpredictably test the novice presidents judgment , cool and common sense in the first 100 days of his tenure syria and iraqthe isis hostage scenario is not wholly imaginary in january last year , a royal jordanian air force pilot , muath al kasasbeh , was captured and burned to death in a cage by the jihadis after negotiations for his release failed similar repeat incidents involving us , european and arab members of the anti isis coalition , and local forces , are becoming more likely as the endgame in the fight against the isis caliphate approaches the battle is being fought out on two main fronts one is the siege of mosul , northern iraqs principal city trump has criticised the conduct of the campaign , which involves the mainly shia iraqi army , kurdish and sunni arab militias backed by 300 us special forces commandos but he has not offered an alternative strategy much the same holds true of the attempt to seize the isis headquarters in raqqa , in northern syria trump says that defeating terrorism is a top priority and he will bomb the shit out of isis but nobody , including him , appears to know what this means in practice if the battle goes badly , will he escalate \? will he carpet bomb cities where millions of civilians live \? is he prepared to deploy us ground forces \? what will he do if , as seems possible , both sieges become bogged down , or isis begins mass , daily executions of civilians \? trump is also silent about turkeys significant military intervention in syria and iraq and its parallel fight with the kurds president recep tayyip erdoan wants two things from trump an end to us support for the kurdish peshmerga and the extradition of fethullah glen , a cleric exiled in the us who he blames for last summers failed coup with isis on the back foot and the iraqi and syrian governments weakened , the turkey kurd feud could explode at any time as the protagonists try to redraw national boundaries and compete for territory and resources russia and eastern europetrump has raised expectations that he can repair the us rupture with russia but a reset will come with a price in the first instance , vladimir putin , russias authoritarian president , will want a relaxation or scrapping of punitive sanctions imposed after russia annexed crimea in 2014 to dismay in europe , trump has suggested he may agree putin also seems likely to get his way in syria , where russian forces have pushed his client , bashar al assad , to the brink of victory in aleppo and elsewhere trump has made no serious objection to russian actions in syria , even though the un says they may constitute war crimes he seems content to have assad remain in power , or even to treat him as an anti isis ally however , the regimes renewed use of chemical weapons , for example , new russian atrocities , or a suddenly escalating humanitarian and refugee catastrophe could all trigger a new crisis that blows up in trumps face , forcing him to move against putin the idea of no fly zones and civilian safe havens still has backers if trump goes down this route , he could end up directly confronting russias military the european allies cannot do much about trumps syria insouciance but they will strongly oppose him if he tries to run down the nato alliance , as he has suggested russian pressure on natos easternmost members in the baltic republics , poland and bulgaria in terms of political meddling , disinformation , cyber attacks , missile deployments and military exercises is reaching new heights influence peddling and destabilisation operations are increasingly reported in moldova , montenegro and elsewhere in the balkans eastern ukraine remains a ticking timebomb any of these flashpoints could ignite at any time in trumps first 100 days european governments want to present a strong , united front but trump seems more interested in buying russia off by acquiescing in putins reclamation of former cold war spheres of influence trumps disdain for the eu he loudly applauded britains vote to leave and critical european reaction to his election , notably in germany and france , point to a possible us europe schism down the road if it happens , trump will have helped putin achieve a long cherished russian strategic objective , shattering 70 years of euro atlanticism chinabeijing shows no sign of backing away from its expansionist policies in the south china and east china seas it is busily transforming reefs and tiny islands into military bases , which will ultimately give it control of sea lanes through which much of the worlds maritime trade passes china continues to ignore the rival territorial claims of neighbouring countries , including japan , whose commerce is directly threatened to counter china , the us and japan have stepped up naval and air patrols in the disputed areas they have also pursued closer military cooperation with vietnam and other regional states such as australia a recent un court ruling in the hague on a complaint brought by the philippines rejected chinas claims as illegal but beijing rejected the decision , and has since sought to woo the philippines anti american president , rodrigo duterte it is more than likely , on present trends , that the us and chinese militaries will , sooner or later , come into direct confrontation , either by air or at sea until now a clash has been avoided , partly because neither side knows where it would lead nationalist feeling in china is periodically whipped up by the communist party if trump blunders into this delicate situation , or deliberately tries to push the chinese back , the fallout could be dangerous in terms of tripwires , taiwan is , as always , a trap for an unwary american leader taiwan elected a new president earlier this year whom the chinese suspect of pursuing an independence agenda it has since increased pressure on taipei , including suspending talks taiwan has been a frozen conflict for so long that it is hard to imagine it suddenly going live but xi jinping , chinas hard headed president , is clear that he will not wait indefinitely for reunification like trump , he is used to getting what he wants north korea and iranthe issue of nuclear proliferation links these two countries iran has always denied possessing or trying to acquire or build nuclear weapons in the past last years landmark pact between washington , its european partners and tehran produced pledges that iran would not seek to make a bomb in the future , or at least for the next 10 years but trump is on record as saying the deal is a bad one and should be scrapped this stance plays into the hands of hardline clerics in tehran who have consistently opposed president hassan rouhanis policy of nuclear concessions in return for un sanctions relief israels right wing government , led by benjamin netanyahu , trumps new best friend \( see below \) , also wants the deal scrapped if trump reneges , rouhani will be undermined , as will be global counter proliferation efforts north koreas dictator , kim jong un , not only already has nuclear weapons , but is accelerating and expanding the countrys weapons building programmes , much to the alarm of japan , south korea and the west in the past , trump suggested he might meet kim the offer was laughed off in pyongyang a parlay between kim and trump might set some kind of record for clashing egos but it would be unlikely to achieve much trumps other suggestion , that japan and south korea acquire nuclear weapons to deter north korea , was one of his more irresponsible and insensitive , given japans unique experience in 1945 north korea will be watching the trump administration closely if it senses trump is distracted , or disinterested in asian security issues \( which has certainly appeared to be the case until now \) , kim could try something provocative or risky , if only to test us reactions given that he is three parts unhinged , that is a scary prospect israel and palestine facebook twitter pinterest donald trump with israels benjamin netanyahu in new york photograph reuterstrump has taken a staunchly pro israel line since running for president and has promised to be the countrys closest friend what this may mean in practice is the subject of speculation but trump advisers have told israeli media that one of his first acts will be to order the removal of the us embassy in tel aviv to jerusalem such a decision , resisted by past democrat and republican presidents alike , is of enormous symbolic importance since it would represent de facto recognition of israels claim to all of jerusalem as its indivisible capital it would negate , in one sweeping gesture , the palestinians claim to east jerusalem as the capital of a future independent palestinian state benjamin netanyahu , israels prime minister , has been careful to keep on the right side of trump , having fallen out with barack obama over us peacemaking efforts and a range of other issues netanyahus obsequiousness may be paying off as far as is known , he is the first foreign leader to be invited to the trump white house some of his more hardline cabinet ministers are meanwhile predicting the end of any american efforts to implement a two state solution the palestinian leadership has politely congratulated trump on his success but if he makes the jerusalem switch , anger in the occupied territories and gaza will be intense , and could quickly turn violent another intifada is the very last thing the middle east needs but as the world now knows , uprisings are a trump speciality topicstrump administrationthe observerus foreign policydonald

for 70 years , the us and britain have underwritten the open global trading system , partly because of a stubborn and correct belief in the merits of free trade , partly out of self interest as beneficiaries of globalisation and partly because , strategically , it spreads democracy , peace and capitalism they have spearheaded successive rounds of tariff cuts and multilateral trade deals and stood by , first , the general agreement on tariffs and trade \( gatt \) and its successor , the world trade organisation , to keep the system honest they have cut regional trade bargains , promoted the european single market and , above all , kept their markets open despite other countries , notably china , gaming the system for their own narrow advantage the consensus in both countries was that the wider gains transcended any localised pain no longer the americans voting for the anti trade , america first trump have consigned all that to history and the unintended consequence of brexit will mean the same for britain the system that underpinned our collective prosperity is about to be trashed it brought national and international benefits , including an avalanche of inward direct investment into both countries , powerful international financial and business service sectors , rising global living standards and the economic and democratic transformation of asia but both countries manufacturing sectors have taken disproportionately heavy hits drive round the ailing industrial towns of south yorkshire or ohio and compare the economic and social landscape with that of dsseldorf , munich , shanghai or shenzhen decade of consistent manufacturing trade deficits have exacted a cruel toll this year , working class voters across america and britains rotting industrial heartlands delivered their verdict no more plants moving abroad no more closures because of cheap imports no more sales of great companies to foreigners no more stagnating blue collar wages no more immigration it may be that there are jobs and great prospects aplenty in the burgeoning tech and service sectors in the big cities driven by global trade , but they dont care they are hurting and nobody has taken decisive action to help them the votes for trump and brexit mark the end of an era and a new dark age of closure , protectionism and nationalism leading tory brexiters will insist that this is a travesty of their position they want britain to access more global trade and not be imprisoned , they crazily claim , by the confines of the slow growing european union and its bureaucratic inability to cut aggressive trade deals with the rest of the world they live in a dreamland if they feel that the rest of the world is more committed to free trade than europe , while eu membership did not hold back germany from being among the worlds major exporters in any case , apart from the promised closure of borders to immigrants , that is not what their voters want , as nigel farage always better understood than any of his tory allies he cordially despises working class voters in south yorkshire and the west midlands want the same as their counterparts in pennsylvania , michigan and wisconsin after all , it was those three states , with their tiny 100 , 000 vote margin , which gave trump the electoral college votes for victory he might be a billionaire , but he is , or at least styles himself , a blue collar billionaire blue collar \( post \) industrial workers dont benefit from free trade and immigration , as he has consistently said for 18 months , in the teeth of opposition from the republican mainstream who remain free traders his movement , as he called it , wants to stop both trade , exchange and intermingling are the lifeblood of humanitybuild that wall along the us mexican border was one of the most insistent chants at his rallies , along with the forced deportation of 11 million illegal immigrants but more importantly for the international trading system , trump wants to withdraw from the north american free trade agreement \( nafta \) between the us , canada and mexico , which he casually dismisses as the worst trade deal in history he also wants an immediate halt in negotiations for both the transatlantic and trans pacific trade agreements and unilaterally he wants to impose swingeing 45 tariffs , against the rules of the world trade organisation \( wto \) from which he is prepared to walk away , on chinese imports , which account for half of the uss trade deficit thirty five per cent tariffs are promised on mexican imports the remaining 20 free trade agreements the us has signed are to be reviewed or abrogated cumulatively , the impact would be devastating , killing multilateralism by exposing the already enfeebled wto as helpless , inciting chinese and mexican trade retaliation and destabilising the entire global system of trade and finance optimists say that trump the president will be much more cautious and realist than trump the campaigner his talk on trade should be seen as threats to produce more fairly balanced agreements , not a tearing up of the world system maybe but there cannot be a complete divorce between campaign rhetoric and policy he believes what he says and nobody in his close coterie is going to urge caution not dan dimicco , his senior trade adviser , who has promised a potential withdrawal , in the first six months of the trump presidency , from every major us trade deal if it cannot be shown actively to benefit the us the era of trade deficits is over , he says it will be lets talk , but otherwise we put tariffs on another intimate , walid phares , has said trump will go back to ground zero on every trade deal , such as the one with south korea that the president elect described as job destroying and wants to revoke trump has already given a commitment that on day one he will declare china a currency manipulator as a precursor to introducing up to 45 tariffs on chinese imports these positions are not posturing they represent a deeply held view that the us does not need trade except on terms that put america first the idea that successive american administrations have negotiated deals loaded in the us interest is impossible to concede because how else would he explain the rust belt \? equally , there can be no concession that blue collar jobs are disappearing with or without trade because of robotisation and automation the america of the 1940s and 50s has disappeared for ever and destroying the international trading system is not going to bring it back none of that cuts any ice with a demagogic populist trump has promises to keep to a movement that expects no less the last time a republican president and his party controlled both the house of representatives and senate with the same convictions on america first trade was 1928 there were warnings that introducing the smoot hawley tariffs on american imports in 1930 would trigger a slump , but america first republicans could not help themselves and the democrats were too weak to stop them the peterson institute for international economics in washington predicts that if trump raises tariffs on china and mexico , and they retaliate , then us growth will stop in its tracks for at least two years the prospects could be even worse if trump goes further already world trade growth over the last year has been the slowest for the last 15 even introducing the mildest of trumps measures must presage a further deceleration and if he goes as far as he promises walking away from the world trade organisation , withdrawing from multiple trade agreements and freely imposing tariffs then the prospect of a 1930s style implosion is all too real in this context , the foreign secretary , boris johnson , babbling alongside other brexiters about the opportunities for trade deals with the us is surreal to exit the eu , the one continent pledged to open trade , in order to plunge into a world trade system threatened by collapse is the height of folly if british voters had known trump was going to be president in june and known of his attitude to trade remain would have won comfortably parliament may find it has a duty to veto the application to exercise article 50 before the end of march the referendum was only ever advisory and trumps attitude to trade changes everything one of the many tragedies of the rise of neoliberalism is that the promotion of international trade has been able to be portrayed by some on the left as part of the same portfolio of policies as austerity , privatisation and assaulting trade unions wrong trade is the essential ingredient of growth and prosperity the rise of egypt , greece and rome was because the mediterranean promoted seaborne trade the rise of maritime europe after the middle ages was because of atlantic trade china has grown so explosively since 1978 because of its opening to trade autarchy , protection and closure to immigration have always meant economic stagnation and , lacking the stimulus of other cultures and ideas , a parallel freezing of innovation and cultural vitality trade , exchange and intermingling are the lifeblood of humanity of course trade brings losers , and the rise of contemporary conservatism , with its ferocious enmity to state action to support the incomes , skills and life chances of working class men and women , in a period of great economic change , laid the foundations of huge anger it has been two rightwing demagogues trump and his british echo , farage who have been the first beneficiaries but as this drama plays out in recession , nationalism and perhaps even forms of inter state conflict , there will be a rediscovery of ancient verities trade and exchange are the foundations of our civilisation and , whatever trump and his movement think , the more , the better topicsus politicsopiniondonald trumpus economycommentshare on facebookshare on

that doesnt leave us with a whole lot to say , except that australia will resume bowling tomorrow in the same difficult position that they would have started in today that is , 86 runs behind , needing another five south african wickets before knowing the scope of the task ahead best case , they can run through south africa and face a recoverable deficit of around 100 , then bat well enough to set a decent target worst case , quinton de kock and temba bavuma will push the lead out to 200 or more , and australia will be knocked over once again for an innings defeat these are very difficult times for a team that seems to be unprepared to play test cricket in any kind of difficult batting conditions ill leave you with adam collins piece from after play finished yesterday , which may be the only guardian article to lead off with referencing the early 90s sketch show , full frontal geoff out , well see you tomorrow on the obo in the meantime , heres an excuse for a report of the days proceedings rain washes out day two of second test between australia and south africa read more the umpires have made the call , with the field sodden and the forecast grim play is abandoned for the day , and will start half an hour earlier for each of the next three days so that means a 10am start local time , australian eastern daylight savings variety , on monday , tuesday and wednesday i also have to credit mitchell starc with actually making a decent joke in another radio interview conducted in the rain its a lovely day , if youre a duck , i guess some interesting points in that sutherland chat hes a pretty straight shooter compared to many administrators whately wants to know if the scheduling and preparation was awry , with very little first class cricket before the tests the south africans have had the same preparation that weve had , counters sutherland if you draw that comparison , the team that were playing against hasnt had any different preparation so the difference is in the fundamental quality of the teams on the field when asked if they had considered replacing rod marsh as chairman of selectors immediately after he announced he would retire next year , sutherland says no , but is measured in his language to avoid hollowly saying that the selectors have been doing a great job the pair also discuss whether steve smith needs more support as a young captain , whether test cricket has enough support itself in balance with commerce , whether this is a crisis point that will bring drastic change or whether ca will try to hold things steady , whether tasmania will keep getting test cricket the television is now screening australias 1999 world cup win over south africa brings to mind the comment yesterday from crickets most comprehensive online video archivist rob moody \( robelinda2 \) my youtube channel is turning out to be quite the archive of a golden era of cricket before it turned to complete and utter shit november 12 , 2016 plenty of questions on exactly that subject of australian disarray today gerard whateley had cricket australia boss james sutherland answering some tricky ones on abc radio earlier today cricket is a funny game not funny ha ha , certainly not over the last week anyway , is sutherlands sad sounding intro you can hear the full audio here still raining at bellerive , obviously jim maxwells usual description of bowlers coming from the antarctic end is especially apposite in todays meteorological circumstances for those of us shivering in hobart the australians may well be enjoying a break from being humiliated on the field heres a great little note from reader ian forth on the current situation not sure if this helps but the ecb were in a similar situation to australian cricket in 2001 their solutions were wide ranging 20 20 , central contracts , community engagement being the headlines \( i did the qualitative research on their behalf \) for a fusty crew the first class forum did vote for change what they couldnt fix was a lack of national success and hero personalities coincidentally or otherwise , however , the team improved and the likes of flintoff and pietersen provided fun role models for the kids five years later everything looked different that ties together all of the south african petersons petersens pietersens in the current discourse , given that kevin with the latter spelling is commentating this series on tv , and alviro with the middle spelling has just been charged with match fixing by the south african cricket authorities former south africa batsman alviro petersen charged over match fixing read more seeing some highlights from the waca ashes test back in late 2013 , and one of the all time great cricket records namely , george bailey , who played five test matches in his career , but shares the record for the most runs in a single over shares it with brian lara not bad i like baileys 28 more than laras anyway , because bailey took them off the pace of james anderson where lara was facing the less accomplished spin of robin peterson but , you tell me back to the present day , a guy who was run out for 1 in that botched run chase is banging a favourite drum on tv in all sport there are too many coaches , is the sage position of shane keith warne theres too much information from too many people it gets confusing he must have loved high school the beloved tasmanian good boy george bailey is more conciliatory toward the mentor class its great , you get different information about how to do things a good coach is a good coach , if youve got lots of them around you thats great but a good player should be able to coach themselves wicket ! mcgrath c b de villiers \( australia all out 111 \) calamity for australia ! the young rangy paceman gets off the mark with a glided single , but once back on strike he chips a defensive shot back to the bowler utterly hopeless , hell never make a test fifty australia falls six runs short of what should have been a routine chase , in a game that will surely be replayed for years to come as for fanie , who took 6 43 , weve seen the best player named de villiers who will ever turn out for south africa wicket ! martyn c hudson b donald 6oh no ! martyn may have undone his team here he sees the wide ball , plays a big cover drive but he cant keep it down hudson reels it in at cover , set well back catches it on his chest glenn mcgrath walks out at no11 in his third test surely selectors wont blame this disarray on martyn , though seven runs to win , two wickets in hand nearly caught ! mcdermott just clears cover for a biffed two runs martyn is then dropped at mid off unknown over australia 105 8 \( martyn 6 , mcdermott 24 \) great stuff from craig mcdermott , bashing several boundaries in the last few minutes as australia narrows the gap to 12 runs required should be fine now with young gun damien martyn still at the crease hello champs and champettes geoff lemon back with you after what feels like a long time off the obo lovely to be here unfortunately though , i bear bad news for australian fans fanie de villiers is running through australia at the sydney cricket

symcox and ray illingworth bugger of a day to be doing the obo , chris correctly begins really enjoyed yesterdays pitch , had something for pace and spin , a rarity in test cricket made every over interesting to watch the question i have is , is their any light at the end of the tunnel for australia \? there appears to be no obvious replacements in either bat or ball \? does australia go for youth \( like an afl team rebuilding \) or can that ruin a promising career by bringing talented but unproven players into the game too early \? this might take a while as per normans question below , i think context is everything what are australia trying to achieve \? presumably a glib number one ranking in all formats can be trotted out , but is that alone enough \? i would be setting targets around winning in india and england , and my team building approach would be with those goals in mind therefore , id be concerned less with raw numbers and more interested in technique and character we know \( usually \) that australian batsman can plunder runs in home conditions , but who are the ones that can do it when the situation is at its most unfavourable \? whether this is shuffling the pack a little , or wholesale change , depends on whos available i wouldnt be afraid of making a raft of changes if the talent is available names that spring immediately to mind include handscomb , head , bancroft and maxwell , but there will be more the challenge then is to communicate to the public that this is a project , and one that needs time this will be a hard sell for a cricket community that knows only winning and now seems disengaged beyond the brief summer months but , this is an opportunity to resolve another of the long lamented issues in the game , the lack of characters if these young colts are sold to us smartly , well want to back them in and give them the benefit of the doubt , especially if they reveal the type of characteristics were looking for using the afl analogy , look at how much goodwill the western bulldogs carried into this seasons premiership it might fail , but this near permanent state of transition the teams been in since about 2005 doesnt seem to be working oh , and keep the bowlers fit an attack of starc , hazlewood , cummins and pattinson has the potential to be a decade long attack of fearsome quality whatever the conditions

in twilight once that nettle has been grasped , more radical ideas like four day tests can be countenanced i think day night tests are a no brainer it means the game will be accessible to spectators at venues and on tv at times when theyre best able to turn up and tune in i sympathise with players in the transitional period while theyre effectively guinea pigs for ball lacquer , floodlights and

did hillary clinton lose the election because she is a woman \? the answer is no , but the reasons behind that no are complicated its certainly impossible to dismiss the presence of extreme sexism in the campaign the media narrative of a battle between a hard working , highly qualified woman and a pussy grabbing man donald trump demonstrated over and over again that he loathes powerful women who do not bend to his will , and so did many of his supporters much of his criticism of clinton often through taunting and bullying had strong sexist undertones and yet , misogyny was not the reason that clinton was defeated she lost because lower and middle class white people wanted dramatic change , and these voters felt that , in spite of her gender , she offered them more of the same during the election , much was made of the extra pressure that clinton was under to conform to expectations of appearance and behaviour she received extreme attention to the way that she was dressed and groomed , especially in contrast with the dishevelled and orange presentation of her opponent suspicion was cast on the meaning of her controlled delivery suggestions were made that she lacked passion , as if passion could only be demonstrated through red faced screaming at baying crowds though her passion was evident , as was her intellect , it is true that clinton sometimes seemed a bit anodyne not because she is anodyne , but because the nature of the campaign limited her means and forms of expression a woman politician whose appearance and delivery matched those of donald trump would be unlikely to be elected to city council a woman who made the error of referring to people supporting her opponent as deplorables people who screamed for walls to be built on borders and for people to be lynched was excoriated , while her male opponent suggested that they come after her with guns none of this was fair in a country that holds fast to values of freedom , everyone should have an equal opportunity to speak their mind and , indeed , wear bright orange foundation , if that is a look they want to go for but this is not the reason that clinton lost like many leftwing women , i went to my polling place on tuesday wearing a trouser suit and a nasty woman t shirt the hours long queue was packed out with mothers who had brought their small daughters to watch them vote for the first woman president the scene was almost enough to make it seem that the election was about seeking a long delayed victory for feminism but this was a side effect it was a media friendly narrative harnessed by clintons campaign strategists to enhance her brand , rather than what the election was really about if the head of state can treat women like objects , why should any other american man feel he should behave differently \? clinton won the popular vote , probably by more than a million she was , we need to remember , the candidate of choice for most voters that is why it is essential to look more deeply into the numbers the reason that clinton lost the electoral college , and in turn the election , was that she failed to appeal to enough white women , especially in decisive states my moderate excitement in clintons candidacy was not shared by a majority of women who look like me or clinton herself trump won the votes of 53 of white women they were voters whom clintons campaign team likely believed were an easy win because of her calls for pay equality , leave for new mothers , and investment in young children and for her oft stated belief that womens rights are human rights but clintons campaign missed the mark with them those women who voted against clinton did not do so because they are sexist , or because they dont believe in womens ability to lead and achieve they are themselves leaders and achievers instead , they voted against her because they believe that her party has given them , their families , and their communities short shrift in trump , however , they have a future president who threatens to withdraw their rights , who claims to aim to roll back roe v wade , to take a womans right to choose out of the constitution , and to institute some kind of punishment for women who terminate pregnancies trumps promise to repeal the affordable care act on his first day in office means that unwanted pregnancies will become harder to prevent , with coverage withdrawn for women to get contraception provided free or at low cost in addition to policy , it is impossible to overlook the impact that this most misogynist president will have on american social norms donald trump has boasted about committing sexual assault and has a dozen women with evidence that his boasts were more than just locker room talk he has called women pigs and dogs , said that putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing and agreed that his daughter , ivanka , was a piece of ass he has described a woman who was breastfeeding as disgusting even if many women voters didnt care that trump disparaged clintons appearance , her stamina , her presidential look , her ability to satisfy her husband , they might be affected by their country being led by a man who behaves as trump does if the head of state can treat women like objects , why should any other american man feel he should behave differently \? i know that we still have not shattered that highest glass ceiling , clinton said in her painful concession speech on wednesday morning but some day someone will hopefully sooner than we might think right now how soon will that be \? progressives must be diligent to ensure that the enduring narrative of clintons failure does not centre on her gender only then will the democratic party be able to accomplish the drastic reform it needs to build a legitimate strategy to take back the white house in 2020 blaming sexism is not just a too easy excuse it will mean that women are not given the chance to run in the future because they are women that would be a travesty america simply cant go another 240 years without a woman president topicswomenthe observerhillary clintondonald trumpus elections 2016us politicscommentshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
it is no use pretending donald trumps presidential election victory is a disaster for the united states and the world it is , at least in part , a victory for prejudice and fear , for ignorance and spite it represents the triumph of economic nationalism and introspection over internationalism and the global good it is a victory built on fabrications because of this , trumpism will ultimately fail , confounded by its contradictions and its immorality it will be defeated but correcting this deformation will not be easy it will take time and the damage will be considerable many explanations have been offered for hillary clintons defeat last week all have an element of truth for some , she was an uncharismatic figure the democratic base was uninspired and many stayed at home doubts surrounded her past conduct , not least in respect of the clinton foundation in many minds , she represented a discredited political establishment there was about her candidacy an off putting sense of entitlement there was her husbands inescapable , ambiguous legacy and clinton was a woman , reaching up to a place of power no woman has ever gone a mostly unspoken misogyny undoubtedly played a part in her downfall more broadly , the complacency of the democratic party and americas liberal left , too comfortable after eight safe years of barack obama , did clinton a great disservice the party and its elected representatives badly misread the mood of the nation so , too , for the most part , did independent pollsters and the us media they initially dismissed trump as a clown and then proceeded , with honourable exceptions , to give him too easy a ride all these factors contributed to clintons demise but they are not the whole story trump won because he successfully tapped the alienation and disillusionment of white voters , men and women who comprise 69 of the electorate and turned out for him in large numbers as polling breakdowns show , the determining factors were not education or gender , not age , religion or geography , not trumps sexual predations or clintons fbi entanglements they were race and colour , linked to economic distress trump exploited a feeling among whites from all backgrounds , urban , suburban and rural , that obamas multicultural , multiracial , tolerant , inclusive and open , outward looking america was not working for them there were significant numbers of people who felt their grievances were no longer being listened to by a centrist party that had loosed itself from its blue collar moorings as thomas frank said in these pages last week the democrats went from being the party of decatur \( a down at heel town in illinois \) to the party of marthas vineyard \( home of the coastal elites \) and they did so at roughly the same time that the republicans were sharpening their deadly image of the liberal elite part of the constituency that switched to trump was railing against a sense of being overlooked during eight years of president obama race unquestionably played a part when trump shrieked his slogan make america great again , what he was really saying was make america white again when he spoke about curbing immigration and building a mexican wall , when he demonised muslims , minorities and people from foreign countries he does not know or trust , when he vowed to scrap international trade deals that he claims are destroying jobs in the midwest , when he railed against selfish allies who do not pay their way , the subliminal message was always the same fear of the foreigner in americas midst trump conjured the illusion of a return to a simpler , homogenous , monocultural society of secure employment , safe neighbourhoods and agreed values no wonder african americans , latinos and other dark skinned minorities are frightened no wonder us relations around the globe are in turmoil and rightwing european populists and hard brexiters are celebrating no wonder observers speak of the end of the west and the demise of liberal democracy trumpism has stormed the shining city on a hill , betrayed the founding fathers who stood tall for human dignity and universal rights and now presages an isolationist america made in trumps image a beacon of discrimination and malice there are the peculiarities of the american electoral system to consider , too hillary clinton won a majority of the popular vote but was handsomely beaten in the race for electoral college votes and too little attention was paid to the effect of a decision by the supreme court in 2013 when it struck down a key part of the voting rights act of 1965 by a five to four vote what this did was allow nine states with long records of voting discrimination , such as georgia , louisiana , mississippi , south carolina , to no longer seek federal approval to change their laws the effect was seen last week as the explained consider what has been happening in north carolina , a battleground state with a history of racial discrimination in voting republican lawmakers and officials have gone to remarkable lengths to drive down turnout among black voters , who disproportionately favour democrats there were numerous other examples across the country , including stringent voter id rules that the federal government had stated earlier this year had a disproportionate effect on minorities for the so called leader of the free world to allow legalised voter suppression is beyond irony what supporters and opponents alike are about to discover is that trumps appeal , like the blue collar billionaire himself , is two faced much of what he promised on the campaign trail will not be delivered or will be so watered down as to make no difference trump says he will cut taxes , raise public spending and slash the federal deficit thats impossible all at once trump says he will renegotiate or scrap nafta and other free trade treaties but his conceit that this will help uncompetitive carmakers in detroit or steel makers in ohio is implausible he says he will slap swingeing tariffs on chinese imports , but he knows the geopolitical and commercial realities mean he will not he says he will make america strong and honour its friends , then kowtows to vladimir putin , the wests most formidable strategic challenger , and undermines nato he says he will be israels best friend but his campaign was not above antisemitic signalling if trump voters really believe the mexican border wall plan , they need a reality check the power of us presidents to act unilaterally in this , or any other domestic matter , is extremely circumscribed trump would face endless legal challenges and he would need agreement and funding from congress the prospect that much of what trump has promised or threatened will not happen is welcome perhaps the responsibilities of office will temper his worst instincts , producing a trump lite crucially , the incoherence and contradictory nature of his economic ideas for boosting growth and jobs and revitalising moribund industrial areas suggest his grassroots supporters are destined for disappointment economic performance is what will ultimately define the trump presidency trumpism has plenty of other horrors in store , while trumps volatile personality and inexperience add extreme unpredictability , at home and abroad , to a host of other worries trump now has the opportunity to stack the supreme court with conservative reactionaries like himself that will pose a direct threat to abortion rights , despite his earlier support for roe v wade in his latest comments , trump appeared to soften his hostility to obamas healthcare reforms his pledge to abolish them outright was a central plank of his campaign what he will eventually do remains unclear even as he postures as the champion of ordinary working americans , trump intends to cut corporate taxes and ease bank regulation who knows how he will react if a nuclear armed north korea challenges his will \? hypocrisy , narcissism and fabrications are the watchwords as trump readies himself for power he must and will be challenged topicsdonald trumpopinionus elections 2016us politicshillary

since trump won , as is to be expected after a shock election result , the blame stick has been hurled far and wide , hitting everyone from white women to black women to poor people to white men to hispanics to the musical hamilton and the polling guys like nate silver silver especially is targeted because his model predicted clinton had a 71 chance of victory other models in the new york times and huffington post had clintons chance much stronger it has led to fights and debates over who was right or more precisely , least wrong oddly this argument over the models had begun before the election day with silver and huffington posts ryan griff having it out over the relative worth of their models there was a lot of back and forth , and a lot of people tweeting about it seriously , who gives a damn \? im not blaming silver or any poll aggregators for the result that would be silly but as they now occupy a major part of the media , we should be honest poll aggregation has become everything it hated and is actually worse for coverage of elections and politics that what it replaced do n't blame the media trumpland is a place where truth does n't matter katharine murphy read morepoll aggregators in the us and in australia sprung up on blogs in the mid 2000s as a response to the then stupid reporting of polls chief political writers would report on two percentage point shifts in newspoll as massive news one week and a fortnight later a shift back of two percentage points as separate massive news all the shifts were explained due to things the journalists to be true because they more than we did about what really was going on the poll aggregators instead realised that individual polls were erratic , and that most of the commentary was about statistical noise rather than actual shifts in voters preferences they instead bundled \( or aggregated \) all the polls to come out with a less noisy number and at the time i thought their analysis a welcome addition that changed the coverage for the better journalists became more statistically aware and now always mention margins of error and talk of the trend but the overarching problem of the poll reportage was not that it was inaccurate but that it occurred at all reporting of polls automatically converts the coverage into a horse race that coverage is a massive media failure and poll aggregators greatly increase the failure now i love data , and i dont pretend that what i do is somehow beyond criticism as katharine murphy has written , the election result should have all in the media realising their work is making little or no difference but polls are not economic or social data they dont record how many sales or prices or even estimate employment they record the feelings of people about what they might do in a week , month , years time but they do convey a sense of fact they are quantitative , and thus they tempt you into thinking they are more true than a qualitative report numbers dont lie ! and so you get seduced i was guilty of it even throughout this year while i was writing against them and arguing with friends about how pointless the polls coverage was , i would check the 538 website to see what the percentages were its tough to resist and the problem is this love of data has made the horse race coverage seem legitimate hard news \( numbers are facts ! \) , and as a result , the performance of polling has come to define the performance of election coverage this is not merely a us phenomenon we saw it here in australia after the election when media outlets tried to explain why they got it wrong but polling coverage is not hard news , it is entertainment disguised as hard news many polling aggregators like silver originally used their statistical knowledge to analyse sport and such data crunching is perfect for sport sport statistics involve things that have actually occurred runs scored , tackles , or turnovers conceded rather than opinions \( no one analyses how many runs a team says it will make in a months time \) it allows sports supporters to play the role of coach , because in effect such data analysis gives a reader greater understanding of the coachs policies but political polls dont do that rather than coaches , they transform us into campaign managers , but managers insidiously removed from reality we look at polling maps and data and think , oh the poll numbers are weak in pennsylvania and wisconsin , but looking good for hispanics aged under 30 but what the hell does that mean \? what does a weak poll in wisconsin tell us \? does it mean a better health policy needed \? immigration reform \? a different candidate \? its great for conversations over a beer , but awful for covering an election political polling coverage is actually a step removed in a way that analysis of sporting statistics is not we see this in the analysis suggesting clinton ignored wisconsin she didnt hold one rally there and those loudly decrying that she only started going to michigan in the last couple weeks immediately we go into a campaign manager mindset it traps us into thinking about the ground game , the advertising buys , the rally numbers and locations of the candidate on various days as though that actually matters to the voters , and as if reading about such things actually helps voters make a decision we think like a campaign manager but one with no interest in policies or voters other than as numbers on a map it was bad enough when you had the chief political writer interpreting the polling data like moses come down from the mount , but it is even worse when you have whole teams devoted to the polls for the numbers and hype about the models are all geared towards convincing us \( with appropriate caveats to save themselves afterwards \) that their numbers are more factual and the analysis behind it more trustworthy than that done by the old rube churning out copy about the latest 2 point movement in newspoll look at the graphs , look at the arrows on the dial ! thats not opinion its data at work ! yes , the election polls were wrong here 's why mona chalabi read morewe fall victim to it it is almost impossible to resist we want to believe that the data will save us and well even ignore that the data is just a lot of feelings if that helps us to believe like investors in crappy mortgage backed security derivatives that banks convinced people were trustworthy because the risk was in effect aggregated , we forgot that polls aggregation does not make the polls any more factual , and certainly no more important and in the end , it is not accuracy but importance that truly matters the problem is not whether silvers or anyone elses polling model was wrong , the problem is that we think it is important whether or not they were topicsus elections 2016grogonomicsus politicsnate silveraustralian politicsaustralian mediacommentshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
when respectable commentators tell us the crisis will blow over , they are usually right most of the time , the shock passes and the status quo reasserts itself most of the time , men of the world can lie back in their comfortable chairs and guffaw at the chicken lickens who thought the sky was falling down but most of the time is not all of the time and it most certainly is not our time in the revolutionary years of 1914 , 1917 , 1929 , 1933 , 1939 , 1979 , 1989 and 2008 , those who said we would soon be back to normal were historys fools this year is a revolutionary year for the radical right it is at once predictable and extraordinary that authoritative voices are telling us to keep calm and carry on despite all appearances to the contrary , donald trump is just a traditional conservative , they say as they prettify venality and sanitise hatred great opportunities lie ahead , splutters boris johnson , trumps british twin the constitution will bind him and the media will check him , others insist , as they show they have no idea of how weak serious journalism has become like playing russian roulette , those trying to minimise the shock of the revolution in american politics may be lucky trump may not have meant what he said in the campaign and will settle down to a presidency of indolent corruption they cannot possibly know the revolver wont explode , however , and are being dishonest when they pretend they can the rest of us should ignore them and concentrate on what we know for sure we know that a man who talks as if he was born to lie , who carries grudges like a gangster , whose sexual rapacity propels him to demean and assault women , who admires the putin kleptocracy and who wants to impose bans on adherents of a global religion is now the president of a great power we also know that , faced with an election they had to win , americas liberals were too unpopular to stop him will donald trump destroy america \? read moreif we were just talking about the united states , we could concentrate on the shocking irresponsibility of the democratic party in running an establishment candidate in a country that was sick of the status quo it is bizarre to see people who condemn cultural appropriation engage in political appropriation but maybe us leftists are right to think that a portion of trump supporters were secretly on their side and a more radical democrat would have won them over unfortunately , this is not just an argument about the wretched clinton campaign not only in america , but across the democratic world , liberals and leftists are becoming used to waking up in the early hours and learning that they have lost again they did not expect the conservatives to win the british general election or the british to vote to leave the eu they didnt see trump coming they wont see le pen coming poland may be the future in a country that had a centre left government within recent memory , not one member of the polish parliament now calls himself or herself a social democrat or socialist debate is between the internationalist right in opposition and the authoritarian nationalists in power theirs may be our future too to suffer such calamitous defeats and not feel the need to change is to behave as irresponsibly as the us democratic party it is a myth that trump and brexit won because of overwhelming working class support nevertheless , they could win only because a large chunk of the white working class moved rightwards debates about how to lure them back ought to reveal the difference between arguing with and arguing against your fellow citizens , which most middle class leftists have not even begun to think about you can only argue against committed supporters of trump if they believe all mexicans are rapists and muslims terrorists , you cannot compromise without betraying your principles fair enough but before you become self righteous you must accept that the dominant faction on the western left uses language just as suggestive of collective punishment when they talk about their own white working class imagine how it must feel for a worker in bruce springsteens youngstown to hear college educated liberals condemn white privilege when he has a shit job and a miserable life or google the number of times straight white males are denounced by public school educated women in the liberal media and think how that sounds to an ex miner coughing his guts up in a yorkshire council flat emotionally , as well as rationally , they sense the left , or at least the left they see and hear , is no longer their friend they are men and women who could be argued with , if the middle classes were willing to treat them decently you might change their minds you might even find that they could change yours instead of hearing an argument , they see liberals who call the police to suppress not only genuine hate speech that incites violence but any uncouth or inappropriate transgression its not enough to moan about the new right resist it nick cohen read morefor too many in the poor neighbourhoods of the west , middle class liberals have become like their bosses at work they tell you what you can and cant think they warn that you must accept their superiority and you will be in no end of trouble if you do not in spain , his great 1937 poem on political activism , wh auden concluded with these grim lines we are left alone with our day , and the time is short , and history to the defeated may say alas but cannot help or pardon george orwell made an uncharacteristically incoherent attack auden had said earlier in the poem that soldiers fighting in the spanish civil war must engage in necessary murder and this proved he was a dilettante warmonger although necessary murders are what soldiers commit , auden came to agree and disowned his poem for suggesting the ends justify the means for all that , audens words hold true there are times when your opponents must be defeated , whatever the cost defeating them today involves nothing so violent as necessary murders thinking about class , not instead of but along with gender and race , would be a step forward realising that every time you ban an opponent you prove you cannot win an argument would be another i do not doubt history will look back on 2016 and say alas but it will not pardon defeated liberals who never learned that to win they had to change topicsdonald trumpopinioncommentshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
for 240 years , america has toyed with the idea of a woman becoming president this year , for an all too brief moment , it looked as if the idea might become a reality but the dream of a female president has remained just that , a disingenuous myth america occasionally serves up in fictions , but never permits to spill into its facts instead of witnessing the landmark moment of a woman moving into the oval office , we can now see the all too real misogyny that became a feature of the 2016 presidential campaign bedding down in the corridors of power when donald trump called hillary clinton a nasty woman in the final debate , only a few days after a series of recordings revealed him admitting to a series of sexual aggressions and assaults , many people thought it was the end of his bid for the presidency instead , social media during election night revealed trump supporters male and female voicing the diehard view that a woman is simply not capable of being president , too weak to stand up to foreign leaders and the military the sucker punch for those of us who believe that this particular woman was spectacularly more ready for the white house than her grossly underqualified and abusive opponent is that as has historically been the case once again , a female candidate did not carry even the female vote a staggering 53 of white women voted against clinton and for the man whose statements and attitudes brought misogyny , kicking and screaming , into the light facebook twitter pinterest hillary clintons concession speech in fullwhen clinton conceded the presidency , she tried to offer hope to the women , especially the young women , of america i know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling , but i know someday someone will , and hopefully sooner than we might think right now of course , we may not think that right now , because right now the media is focusing its attention on white male economic and racial disempowerment it is not interested in the disempowerment of women , but that is also the story of this election , which was fought over a series of fictions , myths and outright lies for two solid years , the media engaged in spreading half truths and misinformation about the first serious female candidate for president for a few days after we learned that trump likes to grab women by the pussy , the mainstream media began admitting how many of the derogatory stories swirling around clinton were misogynistic , how many were literally trumped up fictions but then the fbi intervened , and the story reverted to its misogynistic mean , relentlessly informing the american electorate that clinton is duplicitous , dishonest , untrustworthy it was character assassination , and it worked anyone who still believes these claims are factual and on the evidence , some 59 million people do should consider how closely they resemble the stories that have always been told about female politicians , both real and fictional to do so is to realise that it is time to stop suggesting , as some commentators are doing , that clinton failed us the truth is , we failed her to understand a culture , you must know its stories taking a hard look at some of the tales weve told about the idea of a female president can teach us a great deal about this election , as well as those to come the women who have become american presidents in the history of fiction are not quite as vanishingly scarce as they are in reality , but theyre not exactly numerous and , until very recently , the fictions were as presumptively white as the candidates just 14 women have mounted a serious bid for us president , three of whom made it to a major partys national convention , although only one secured that nomination five became third party candidates , and two became major party running mates , both of whom lost we have had three female secretaries of state , one female speaker of the house but no woman has ever been elected to the executive branch of the american government the idea of a woman in the white house has always prompted the same responses it is either a joke , a disaster or a cheat clinton was endlessly called crooked hillary to shouts of lock her up , although her crimes always varied had she murdered vince foster , or ron brown \? had she covered up wrongdoing in the deaths of americans at benghazi , stolen millions , or was she , in fact , beelzebub \? it didnt matter what mattered was the idea of illegitimacy most stories imagine a female president who lies , cheats , murders or sleeps her way into office , or inherits the roleour fictions about women becoming president have always worked to invalidate the very idea take , for example , the novel co authored by a former speaker of the house and avowed enemy of \( both \) clintons , newt gingrich , which tells of a woman who becomes americas first woman president and chooses politics over national interest , resulting in a benghazi style attack its title \? now gingrich has been tipped for a cabinet appointment , because propaganda works in neither history nor fiction are there more than a handful of stories that imagine a female president who could ascend to the highest office in the land honestly , through merit and hard work instead she either lies , cheats , murders or sleeps her way into office or she inherits the role , passively , from a man fictional depictions of a female presidential candidate on the actual campaign trail are even rarer this may correlate with the fact that , as clinton herself noted , she was always more popular in office than while running when female presidents are imagined , they are in office thanks to a fait accompli of some kind , which is also delegitimising power was handed to her , or she inveigled her way into it either way , its crooked just like hillary serious fiction is a club into which women presidents arent admitted they are segregated by genre , cropping up primarily in satire or science fiction female presidents are a joke , or exist in an alternate reality women are disproportionately more likely to become president in disaster movies and post apocalyptic scenarios , because only when large segments of the human race are eradicated do we imagine women in charge in early science fiction tales , the apocalypse often took the form of the nullification of men , as womens real political gains sent masculinity into an imaginary crisis from which it has not recovered from the first , any writing that considered the possibility of a woman president focused not on what it would mean to women , but on what it would mean to men even when written by a woman what seems to be the earliest fictional depiction of a female presidential candidate was a burlesque provoked by victoria woodhull , the first woman who ran in 1871 , harriet beecher stowe published , narrated by a man who thinks he supports womens rights until he meets audacia dangyereyes , who wants to be president her name \( damn your eyes \) says it all she is dangerous , aggressive and ludicrous , a crack brained unwomanly creature , an amphibious animal , loud and vulgar by no coincidence , she is also accused of swindling and fraud she singlehandedly undermined , we are told , the whole woman movement for the main argument for proposing it , was to introduce into politics that superior delicacy and purity , which women manifest in family life it was her fault if feminism didnt take hold , because she was doing such a bad job at representing it that should sound familiar , because it is a very persistent trope america pretends it is perfectly comfortable with the ideal of a female president , only to discover that it is disappointed or horrified by every human woman it encounters words like tarnished enter the story when idealised women fail to materialise that idealised women should cleanse american politics with their purity was the view taken by stowes sister , isabella beecher hooker , who made the news in 1888 by predicting america would soon see a woman president , because the men would vote for her out of pure gallantry and chivalry thats not quite how it played out american women wouldnt even get the vote until 1920 , when the 19th amendment was ratified newspapers instantly produced satirical visions of women marching into the white house one imagined the inauguration of the first woman president it will be a womans parade at this waterloo of pants place aux femmes ! one can only imagine what the author would have made of clintons pantsuits facebook twitter pinterest margaret chase smith , the first woman elected to the senate who had not inherited the seat from a man photograph bettmann archivefour years later , the first fictional female president seems to have arrived , in a 1924 silent film called based loosely on mary shelleys 1826 novel , it takes place between 1924 and 1950 , as america is hit by a plague of masculitis , which leaves adult men sterile by 1950 , a woman has become presidentress \( her enemy , prophetically , leads the tea house gang \) in a world dominated altogether by women , the presidentress needs to find the last man on earth to continue the human race the anxieties about women taking power from men are transparent this manless world prompted newspaper headlines such as he man type of girls rule in film of future as american culture began worrying less about womens purity and more about their growing political and economic power , fictions responded by imagining idealised female presidents in terms of passivity and pacifism in 1931 , a play called featured a widow named constance goodwin who became president six years later , the play was turned into a novel set in the near future of 1943 , and seems to have been the first portrayal of an actual female president serving in a realistic , contemporary setting it was also the first of a long line of stories to imagine a woman who inherited the white house only when a male president dropped dead , and who leaves presidential duties because she has more important things to do namely , be a grandmother as women made historic gains , stories began dealing with how 'mrs president' could balance leadership with motherhoodin 1932 , a book by charles eliot blanchard called imagined american history as told in 2162 , a story focusing on the tremendous struggle of 1962 , in which a woman was elected president and ushered in a new era of altruism this may sound encouraging , but jane b stanton , an imaginary descendant of the feminist elizabeth cady stanton , was a eugenicist , instituting a passive aggressive totalitarianism that relies on sterilisation to create a perfect and profoundly racist society as real american women continued making historic gains , the question of male power and prerogatives became paramount stories began dealing explicitly with how a putative female president \( mrs president \) could possibly balance leading the free world with motherhood \( a female candidate who didnt have a family was unimaginable single or gay women were not permitted into national fantasies \) in 1948 margaret chase smith became the first woman elected to the senate who had not inherited the seat from a man a year later a musical called appeared on broadway it was originally titled , and its producer reportedly checked with a lawyer on the constitutionality of a ladys being elected to the white house because how could a woman president be legitimate \? set in 1953 , four years into the future , it is a comedy about the first husband , who enjoys leering at the pretty girls he encounters and occasions jokes about gender role reversals that even reviewers in 1949 found unfunny a less silly depiction came in the 1952 novel conflating dark horse and nightmare another contemporary story , damsey wilsons novel tells of the presidency of miriam hall bradley again there is a great deal of anxiety about the dubious title of first husband mr bradley complains that his wife is goofy on feminism , and much of the plot concerns whether he will leave her for a woman who isnt busy leading the free world \( 1953 \) is frequently credited \( incorrectly \) as the first film to depict a female president , but it may be the first science fiction tale in which the female president is a minor character , both taking for granted and marginalising the idea when margaret chase smith made an unsuccessful 1964 bid for the republican nomination , the journalist russell baker wrote washingtons political chinstrokers give senator margaret chase smith little chance to become president this year and in any case , since mrs smith is a widow , the first gentleman problem would not arise a film made that same year , focused entirely on the first gentleman problem its strapline was when a woman becomes president of the us , what happens to her poor husband when he becomes the first lady \? the film opens with leslie harrison mccloud \( polly bergen \) being sworn in , while the camera captures her husbands peevish expression the eventual happy ending is his , not hers mrs mccloud gets pregnant and resigns , as his virility triumphs gradually , however , women like clinton , geraldine ferraro and sarah palin began to inch nearer in 1972 , congresswoman shirley chisholm became the first african american woman to run for president as these real women got closer to the white house , our fictions accelerated correspondingly science fiction , in particular , always interested in finding imaginary ways to test cultural and political waters , began portraying an increasing number of female presidents \( many of whom were also non white \) there was president juanita alvarez in \( 2005 \) by arthur c clarke and stephen baxter , and president helen lasker in carl sagans \( 1985 \) female presidents in apocalyptic disaster movies tend not to survive the story president janice castleman in ka applegates \( 2001 \) is wiped out along with everyone else on earth robert j sawyers \( 2013 \) features a female president whose brain survives her assassination and is uploaded into an artificial body , which sounds like the kinds of things hillary clinton was accused of \( her charges included using body doubles \) facebook twitter pinterest her best hope was to be disliked and crooked , but at least shed be president julia louis dreyfus in photograph hboin fact , fictional women presidents were unlikely to last much longer in the field than their historical counterparts patty duke played president julia mansfield in the television satire \( 1985 \) , which lasted all of seven episodes her plotlines still involved contending with a philandering husband and problem children by 2008 , geena davis was the vice president who succeeded a president who died of an aneurysm in it too focused on the efforts of the president to balance her personal and professional life , running to all of 18 episodes , with alfre woodard as the first female black president , lasted 13 episodes the series recently managed a white woman president after an african american man for two whole seasons , until she resigned over the ethical compromises shed made similarly , selina meyer became president for two seasons of when the president resigned , before being replaced by another woman president selinas incompetence is a large focus of the comedy , although the show also directs much satirical firepower at lingering misogynistic tropes in the last season , selina tells her daughter about the moment of her political awakening , when her father said to her , you know , a lot of people dont like nixon , but by god , they respect him and thats you , peanut it sounded prophetic to many of us her best hope was to be disliked and crooked , but at least shed be president it didnt turn out that way republicans so successfully attacked clintons legitimacy , and that of the establishment she supposedly represented despite being the first female major party candidate in the 240 year history of the united states of america , that they invalidated her bid a woman whod withstood decades of misogynistic abuse could not conquer an unashamed misogynist the nasty woman who devoted her life to public service could not overcome the rich bully who decided to pick up politics on a whim along with the validity of clintons actual campaign went , many fear , the very idea of a female

observers cite voter anger at an entitled political establishment and an ever wealthier and privileged elite gridlock and dysfunction in washington international tensions and economic dislocation and distress to explain his victories in the primaries and now in the general election theyre not wrong over the course of the campaign , trump threw fuel on all these hotspots still more critical to his success , he nailed the white male support that would put him over the top in electoral votes on by his continual attacks on the legitimacy of the nations first african american president , his targeting and denunciation of undocumented immigrants and muslims , and his overtly sexist remarks about women but after writing a book about donald trump , his father , and his grandfather , i think other factors played a pivotal role for starters , theres a trump family culture of ruthlessly pressing any advantage , stretching the truth , and pushing the legal and ethical envelope to the max trumps german immigrant grandfather , who operated restaurants in gold rush era seattle and the yukon , amassed a nest egg by offering miners alcohol , food and proximity to women his father greatly increased the family fortune by exploiting loopholes in new deal government subsidies he tapped to construct middle income housing in brooklyn and queens and trump used a billion dollar loss of borrowed money and four corporate bankruptcies to build a global brand and avoid paying personal income taxes for nearly two decades that family culture also includes an adherence to the success oriented theology of dr norman vincent peale , author of the 1952 bestseller peale was the pastor of marble collegiate church , where trumps parents attended services , where trump and his sisters married , and where funeral services for their parents took place in his book , peale emphasises the supreme importance of self confidence , a notion that trump has not merely embraced but weaponised with a winning at all costs , scorched earth approach that has more than fulfilled his own fathers fierce injunction to be a killer in every pursuit among many results are a remarkable litigation history according to , as of mid 2016 , trump had been involved in more than 3 , 500 lawsuits , including dozens that are still active and a political campaign characterised by an unprecedented level of venom and vitriol but trump has also contributed his own special flourishes linguists found trump was second only to hillary clinton in terms of how feminine he soundedfor example , his much ridiculed hair for years it has been a highly effective trademark , a humanising bit of vanity that made him the peoples billionaire , rather than a remote tycoon , and on the campaign trail , his coiffure made him the perpetual centre of attention as with the traditional circus clowns big red nose , trumps bouffant blond combover cued audiences that at any moment he might do something entertaining , and that it was permissible to laugh , even cheer , if some sort of antisocial activity occurred for a clown , this includes antics like hitting people with a baseball bat or dumping water on their heads for trump , it was likely to be a vicious taunt , a preposterous exaggeration , even a suggestion to rough up protesters , behaviour that would ordinarily be considered unacceptable but was now tolerated , even celebrated , because it could be explained away as only a performance , a joke , or one of trumps favourite phrases truthful hyperbole ultimately , however , trumps success may have hinged on his voice i am your voice , he declared in his acceptance speech at the republican national convention in july and there is more to that claim than might have been apparent at that moment let me lay it out curiously , despite his obsession with showing that he is the most powerful person on earth , his speech doesnt have the archetypal tough guy edge in part , this is because , as the reported during the primaries , linguists found he was the second only to hillary clinton in terms of how feminine he sounded moreover , when measured by non verbal cues like gestures , facial expressiveness , and statements posed as questions , he came in as the most feminine of the entire field but , perhaps even more importantly , it is also because of the way he sounds although hes shown hes more than capable of shouting in classic rabble rousing style , more often than not what comes out when he opens his mouth is not traditional alpha male talk in contrast to both the hyper belligerence of jean claude van damme and the chilling rasp of clint eastwood , trumps speech tends to be in the middle range , even slightly high pitched not effeminate but , despite his guarantee in one debate as to the adequacy of his genital endowment , not testosterone laden either this low key verbal tone might seem unimportant at most , a meaningless distinction overshadowed by his relentless aggression and braggadocio in other words , not a big deal but its effect is a big deal instead of insistently bellowing or pounding his chest like an arnold schwarzenegger , hes tapping into a different stereotype the counter intuitive strongman who tosses off some of his most devastating comments with a malevolent sneer think marlon brando or robert de niro , who make their point not by shouting theyre going to blow your head off but by hissing that youd better cooperate if you want to see another sunrise moreover , trumps speech is hardly bristling with complexity rather , his vocabulary is extremely simple , almost to the point of being childish , and his use of incomplete thoughts and sentence fragments has an unmediated , stream of consciousness feel it is this combination the hint of menace beneath the surface added to what appears to be an unpolished immediacy that millions of listeners take as evidence of trumps authenticity and spontaneity indeed , the way he talks reminds them of the voice inside their own heads a rich and sometimes dark stew of conversational snippets and memory scraps , random phrases and half thoughts and , by extension , it somehow seems as if theyre hearing the voice inside his head to many , the way trump talks has been evidence of his lack of seriousness , of focus , of discipline , especially compared to hillary clintons thorough , detail oriented explanations of her programmes but to his supporters , it is proof positive that he is the real deal not focus grouped , not mediated , not hiding behind a mask of calculation and manipulation for fear of censure , they keep their own interior voice , mostly banal but sometimes ugly , in check , but they admire and , in some cases , envy trump for openly expressing a deepest self that seems to mirror what they think and feel but dont dare reveal to the world further , with almost uncanny timing , donald trump launched his presidential candidacy at a moment when technology provided him with the perfect megaphone for his verbal style , in the form of twitter its 140 character limit reinforces the sense of urgency and genuineness , the impression of seeing directly inside his head and glimpsing unfiltered , unvarnished sentiments and emotions even more than the substance of his words , it is the apparent immediacy , even intimacy , of this inner voice that makes his denunciations of political correctness strike such a powerful chord in fact , there is nothing authentic or spontaneous about what donald trump says everything is considered , strategic , and , as even a casual look at his rallies on youtube reveals , repeated continually nonetheless , this impression of having a direct line to what hes actually thinking is proof to his supporters of his underlying honesty and as such , a vital clue to understanding how it is that this man , the most artificial of creatures in every possible respect , from the blow dried effusion on the top of his head to the gilt coating that covers every available surface in his 53 room penthouse on fifth avenue , has come to represent telling it like it is to enough voters that he is now the president elect of the united states the trumps three generations of builders and a presidential candidatetopicsdonald trumpthe observerus elections 2016us politicscommentshare on facebookshare on

world leaders have begun congratulating donald trump on his election win as people around the world anxiously wait to see how their country will engage with the new us president the order in which trump spoke to leaders around the world has sparked speculation as to how he will shape his foreign policy in the 24 hours after his victory speech , trump spoke to egypt , ireland , mexico , israel , turkey , india , japan , australia and south korea the uks theresa may was 11th on the list more anti trump action planned after second night of protests across us read moreegypts president , abdel fatah al sisi , was the first to have a conversation on how to foster closer diplomatic ties with the us australias prime minister , malcolm turnbull , discussed trade , regional security and how to defeat isis a key promise in trumps election campaign but although the german chancellor , angela merkel , and the french president , franois hollande , offered support , they labelled his leadership a period of uncertainty we asked people around the world to tell us what the situation looks like from where they live , how their governments are responding to trumps victory and how they think his leadership will affect their lives egyptegypt and the us will probably grow closer but as citizens we will suffer from trumps endorsement of our president sara , 30 , engineerwe live in a police state where students , activists and journalists disappear or are jailed the obama administration had been putting pressure on our government to improve human rights and freedom of speech , but i doubt donald trumps administration will do the same this is evident from our current presidents eagerness to connect with trump i hope he hires a team that understands the complexities of the middle east it is evident he does n't have a cluesara , egyptboth hillary clinton and trump are heavily disliked in the middle east by muslims and arabs while trump is openly hostile to muslims and clueless about the region , hillarys policy as secretary of state has been very deliberate and damaging to the region despite her partys more tolerant and inclusive tone having gone through a very similar election scenario in egypt in 2012 where both candidates were hated , i was not very surprised by the outcome the democratic party underestimated trumps popularity and the dislike for hillary i feel a lot of votes went to trump out of spite for hillary , perhaps if a different candidate had gone against trump the outcome would have been different just like what happened in egypt , it looks like the american population is now sharply split in half , with each side demonising the other i think thats the most dangerous thing that can happen to a country having racist , intolerant people in power might make it easier to challenge them as they are now out in the open , but healing the rifts in society is much harder i simply hope trump will become a president for all us citizens , as is his duty , and reign in the hateful extremist tendencies displayed by white americans i hope he hires a competent team that understands the complexities of the situation in the middle east and worldwide , as it is evident that he does not have a clue chinapotential trade conflicts but he will use his business wisdom to deal with it boyang , 28 , beijingi feel great about the result its a tremendous win for the masses for those who were constantly ignored by political elites in washington i like trump a lot because he knew the real problems of the country rather than just chanting politically correct slogans the us is divided now , probably more divided than when i worked there for three years that happens when you are obsessed with gay rights and minority rights but forget to promote the most basic right of living a better life for the majority he will be a great president if he improve some of his rhetoricboyang , chinathe pivot to asia plot and the tpp are now dead trump is likely to be a more pragmatic figure than obama , so sino us relations will improve theres going to be some trade conflicts if trump lives up to his word about china , but i believe he will use his business wisdom to deal with it china will have an easier situation and a stronger influence in the region a win win cooperation between these two countries could benefit humankind i wish that trump could be more presidential he will be a great president if he improves some of his rhetoric i hope that he can get along with china indiawe have a lot of supporters for trump mostly from far right parties mithun , keralato say the result was shocking would be an understatement victory of an alt right fanatic like trump , in a country known around the world for its liberal virtues and principles , is something that adds to the swerve of the world to the right he adds on to the list of rightwing politicians such as recep tayyip erdoan in turkey , vladimir putin in russia and of course , narendra modi in india maybe we are witnessing the gradual transition of the world into a global conflict in india , we have a lot of supporters for trump mostly from far right parties its another moment of jubilation for them maybe the consequences for foreign policy will be beneficial as trump has publicly shown his admiration for modi and his way of governance but his temperamental nature makes trump truly unpredictable , so we will have to wait and see as long as he doesnt turn rhetoric into reform , i think the world will be safemithun , indiain southern india where im from , most of the people have a similar opinion to me but in the northern areas of india the stomping ground of the ruling rightwing opinions may differ the philosophy of gandhi of a mutual peaceful coexistence , which was even enshrined in our foreign policy until an ideological regime change , is something i firmly believe in , and the rise of a person like trump is a question mark on existence itself the hidden silent majority that is supposed to have created this ruckus may not be as silent as they are portrayed to be as in every other country , some are always bound to feel victimised during the rule of a government they despise , which could be for racial , religious , cultural or economical reasons its beyond doubt this result was the result of what they call whitelash some sort of racial hate storm against the former governments policy on immigration , terrorism and the domestic economy the election helped me to see what the us truly is under the pop culture disguise they have a huge rising tide of rightwing fanatics and a population desperate enough to find hope in them maybe his campaign of rhetoric and hate was a charade to reign in their support as long as he limits himself to rhetoric and doesnt dare turn rhetoric into reform , i think the world will be safe argentinaone of the few things politicians agreed on was to openly reject donald trump james , 21donald trump has been hostile to our countries , so i am not optimistic about having a fluid relationship with the us his proposals against latinos make it really difficult to support him brexit and trump mark a whitelash politicians must not pander to it polly toynbee read moreour government made it clear that it supported hillary clinton i am really worried about the impact this will have on our future argentinas society is fragmented politically , as there is a strong division between the actual and former government but one of the few things politicians agreed on was to openly reject trumps speech the us now has a president who is racist , xenophobic , sexist , misogynist , who openly supports guantnamo and illegal torture , who hates minorities , who thinks climate change was invented by china to make us industries less competitive seriously , what can go wrong \? argentina has been always a very progressive nation we have many problems , but one of our main characteristics is that we are open to different religions or race discrimination exists , like everywhere , but here we dont face integration problems , or at least not like in other parts of the world americans voted for him because he said the things that many of them think trump is a clear representation of the average americans thoughts , and that was decisive , like a kind of dangerous homer simpson it also shows how unhappy they are with the political establishment these types of leaders that are spreading around the world are setting in a new era , with policies that i think compromise worldwide security they are on the rise because of societys need for an answer to problems , but the only thing they achieve is to deepen and create a more segregated and unfair humanity mexicowe have been humiliated in front of the world flor aguilera , mexico citythe power trump has over us over our economy , our geography , our perception of our freedom of movement , over the way the world will see us is terrifying , and he is not even the president yet the future deportations of many mexicans who live and work in the us who send money home , and who contribute tremendously in that way to our economy , will probably send us into an even deeper recession we have been humiliated in front of the world today we woke up to find the exchange rate at 20 50 pesos \( 78p \) for the dollar we went from 18 70 per dollar on election day to 20 20 on thursday and 20 50 on friday its expected to reach 30 by the end of the year we are more than willing to welcome in any american who wishes to make mexico their home for the next four years bring your families , come live here , bring your dollars , help us out we are a friendly , welcoming country with amazing weather , fantastic food , great cities with interesting museums and landmarks and restaurants and cafes we hope they will seriously consider it that goes for british people who want to escape the post brexit uk in our collective imagination , us democracy was something to aspire to this is something that has changed the spell has been broken in many ways we are disappointed in mexico , even the least educated among us believe this man to be a baffoon , his ideas to be uninspired and poorly expressed , that his misogyny is worse than any machismo we have ever seen we made fun of him we are surprised by how much and how many americans love him , adore him we are now wondering where to turn to for inspiration and what way of life and ideology should now inspire us we ask ourselves is this america \? brazilthe us generally does the same thing no matter whos in charge alcysio , 27 , rio de janeiro the result might have been surprising , but its hardly going to change anything in south america our government is already pandering to trump as they would to hillary being subservient and uncritical is all the temer administration will do , even if the us government starts to deport brazilians i hope they freeze out the non elected brazilian government and treat it with the insignificance it deserves of course you worry that such an election might make rightwing extremists feel entitled to commit hate crimes but , on the other hand , the us generally does the same thing no matter whos in charge republicans voted as usual , it was the others who didnt bother voting as they feel desinfranchised by the politics that won it it is something we know quite well in brazil , too this is not someone whos fit for office this is someone who needs helpstorm , canadacanadai could see the relations being much less friendly than they have been lately storm , 25 , quebec its really hard to know at this point in time how trumps presidency will affect canada i think it will have a big impact on our economy because the us is our main economic partner this is where we export the majority of our goods and trump wants to get rid of nafta our prime minister justin trudeau said he would work with trump , but the truth is they have very conflicting views on almost everything , so i could see the relations being much less friendly than they have been lately with trump as president , people all over the globe are in danger i am scared and i am sad im sad to see so many people showing intolerance , showing hate towards their neighbours every canadian ive talked to or who has posted on social media seems to think the same thing trump , brexit and the age of popular revolt 2016 in long reads read morethe man is xenophobic , misogynist , devoid of common sense or a sense of reality he thinks hes better than everyone , jokes about assaulting women , which we know he has he thinks hes too smart to file his taxes this is not someone whos fit for office this is someone who needs help germanythe biggest concern for germany and all european nations is how trump will behave towards putin rudolf , 39 if putin senses weakness or pliability , he will take full advantage and seek to further destabilise nato and the eu he will finance populist movements across the eu as well as launching military operations where advantageous to russian interests in that case , the eu might need to look to china as its only powerful ally in favour of global stability a really sad situation another big concern is that the us will tear up its climate change commitments and its rapprochement with iran both would be highly disadvantageous to german and european interests in working towards global conflict reduction the overwhelming majority of germans are worried about the trump presidency americans have pinned their hopes on a strongman actor who isnt a politician to fix the precise same neoliberal system that produced him in the first place that is why both merkel and the foreign minister , frank walter steinmeier , have been lukewarm in their reactions to say the least i am saddened but not surprised after brexit showed that neoliberal complacency has created a significant percentage of protest voters who wish to destroy the current economic order even without a coherent alternative the us is now deeply divided into two camps the trump camp that is predominantly white , and the other that has a high percentage of ethnic minorities that racial divide is deeply worrying portugalthe mood here is one of shock and fear for the future williami know that nationalist parties all across europe cant believe their luck the middle ground has shifted to the right i hope that moderate leaders take heed and produce a narrative , backed by policies , that is inspiring the election , much like the brexit result , shows how vulnerable democracies are to simple populist arguments when the circumstances are right in both the us and the uk , the vote was decided by a tranche of voters whose lives have more despair than hope for the future i am bitterly disappointed with both results , but the leaders on the losing side did not articulate any policies that would give the voters hope for change they badly misread the mood of the left behinds the election , much like the brexit result , shows how vulnerable democracies are to simple populist argumentswilliam , portugalfrance and spainin spain theyre cracking very dark jokes about the end of the world beatrizin france , it is only going to encourage supporters of marine le pen in the upcoming elections in europe , it is going to make the relationship with the us , uk and russia that much more tense my french friends are trying to keep business as usual and not discuss it in spain , theyre cracking very dark jokes about the end of the world but then again , the memory in spain is longer interestingly enough , regardless of their political convictions , all my acquaintances are horrified that the us has chosen such an inexperienced person and failed businessman because his endeavours have not been stable or profitable for anyone but himself his language and his lack of control are unacceptable i hope he does not influence other world leaders to become more like him or putin excessive , dominant and ultimately ineffective heads of repressive countries i hope that he does not commit nepotism while in the office , but rather use best business practices although that is very , very unlikely im preparing for the worst , because really , all the historical and economic signs point to a very , very dark time topicsus elections 2016donald

the question of what constitutes an independent artist in 2016 is a slightly vexed one is it still someone signed to an independent label , or have advances in technology changed the traditional definition \? what is an independent label anyway \? does a small label financially supported by a major , but left free to make its own a r decisions count , or are they just lapdogs of the evil music industry \? in a world where jme can make the charts , apparently without any of the traditional blandishments of the music industry no label , no manager , no publisher , no pr , as his twitter

another source youtube or a streaming service , or sponsorship from a drink or clothing company does that compromise your claim to independence \? you could argue about it for hours , but perhaps its best to say that , in 2016 , independence is something less to do with your financial arrangements or means of distribution than with a certain spirit the artists in the list below veer about wildly in terms of commerciality its not too much of a stretch to imagine abra or lil yachty in the top 40 , a little harder to picture the same thing happening to anenons improvisation based blend of electronica and jazz , or indeed , cabbages recent ep uber capitalist death trade spotify linkbut the one thing they have in common is that they dont sound like people who have been told what to do by other people who think they know what makes music successful in that sense , they are at odds with the kind of artists you tend to find in the bbc sound of polls or the brit critics choice shortlist the big hitters that major labels have decided are going to make them a lot of cash a lot of that music sounds like the result of extensive market research , with literally inevitable results it plays it safe , closely resembling stuff people are already buying so this years hotly tipped alt rock band sounds remarkably like last years most successful alt rock band this years big new singer songwriters sound remarkably like last years big singer songwriters , influence of wafty electronica and all this years pretender to the mainstream pop throne seems to have used exactly the same songwriters , producers and auto tune settings as the star they are trying to knock off their perch you cant blame big record labels for playing it safe these are tough times for the music business but caution leads to ossification if you are looking for a reason why huge swathes of the charts sound remarkably homogenous as if you could swap the names of the artists responsible around and no one would really notice then there it is perhaps the commercial success of skeptas chart topping , mercury winning konichiwa an album that self evidently hasnt been focus grouped into existence might cause a rethink of this approach perhaps not either way , in the meantime , here are 50 new artists , independent in the sense that they are acting on impulse and instinct doing what they want , rather than what they are told alexis petridisabra interactivephotograph david levene for the guardian hair makeup maria asadi using mac cosmeticsin one long , breathless rush , abra is telling me the story of the teenage rock band she was once a part of it was with my ex and all his roommates and it was , she recalls when we would fight it was always , like , band practice is off ! band practice is on ! but our shows were really good , super intense and passionate , and i had this really good chemistry with the guitarist who my boyfriend and so she clocks my surprise and laughs i know , right \? we didnt play many shows ! speaking to abra is an almost completely different experience to listening to her music on record she can be raw and unflinching , putting her emotions on the frontline over a skeleton of minimalist electro r b it is music that chimes with her mysterious online persona , in which she styles herself as the darkwave duchess and refuses to reveal her real name or age yet here she is now , giggling away through stories of acid trips and teenage distress , with precious little guard up getting a grip on just who abra is can be tricky because it seems to have taken her some time to work it out too growing up as the daughter of church missionaries , she spent formative years in south london , new york and atlanta , living a displaced life in which music , art and books were the only constant her strict religious upbringing meant that listening options were reduced to christian music in church , she would often cry at the stacked harmonies or old folk songs , which inevitably left her feeling like something of an outsider among her peers i couldnt bring up scarborough fair to someone in my third grade class , she laughs they werent listening to that ! yet she accepts now that these unique influences shaped her sound today , which absorbs old and modern influences , from gospel to avant r b via chicago house , britney spears and smooth 80s pop just listen to the stunning crybaby , or indeed any song from this years mini album princess , and you will likely be floored by the mix of 808 rhythms , chiming synths and soulful topline melodies it is music full of nods to the past that nevertheless sounds thoroughly modern there are two musical events that seem to have greatly shaped abras career the first was while suffering depression as a teenager , when she would sit on her bed crying and listening to the radio one day , the station 94 9 was playing christmas songs and i said to myself i know this sounds cheesy but i said if theres anything out there that believes im worth a damn , i just need a sign ! and then this record came on i just connected with it so much , it was beautiful and i wanted to be able to make something that beautiful that record was peter , paul and marys a soalin , and it prompted abra to pick up a guitar and spend weeks learning it soon she had mastered all kinds of songs , and her aptitude for cover versions from radioheads all i need to waka flocka flames no hands bore fruit when the youtube videos she posted under the name hurricane gabrielle began going viral she progressed to writing her own material but wasnt convinced she was on the right track until a hallucinogenic experience finally showed her the light i accidentally triple dosed on acid , she says , somewhat casually later that night , i had time to listen to my music and reflect i realised that id been hiding myself away and that the only part of me i showed to people was the sad side this music that was supposed to show me that i was worth a damn wasnt even making feel better she resolved to stop writing what she dismissively calls sad girl shit and work on showcasing her steelier , more independent side hooking up with atlantas misfit enclave awful records only encouraged her further home to outsider hip hop artists such as father , slug christ and archibald slim , and with ties to drake and makonnen , the diy collective persuaded her to stop working with her then producer and follow her own path they gave me the confidence because theyre fiercely independent , she says slug christ makes his own beats , produces , mixes , masters does it all , and thats the first time id seen any of that i loved being around them and i got into a lot of trouble with them , too what kind of trouble \? oh , all kinds things blew up really fast and there was this sense of invincibility in the air around everyone , this feeling that we could do everything , so we everything , you know \? messing with drugs and living a fast life it got kind of reckless for a little bit , but i feel weve all reached equilibrium now we dont go back there , but we can look back with a lot of stories to tell to this day , abras set up remains pretty diy princess was recorded , as was her previous albums rose and blq velvet , on a laptop in her bedroom closet just her , a 40 usb mic , a midi keyboard and logic yet the results are anything but dashed off abra says she spent weeks agonising over crybaby , trying to work out what was too much , and what wasnt enough in general , though , she sticks to a simple rule build it from the ground up and when i feel like i get goosebumps from hearing it , im done with so many different emotions , genres and personalities thrown into her music , it has been a source of frustration to abra in the past to see her music labelled simply as r b , something she says only happens because she is a black female singer these days , though , she is more relaxed about it , partly because she has accepted just how important an influence r b has been to her \( i respect so many people in r b and wouldnt be where i am without it \) and partly because she is finally at peace with who she is as an artist , and where she is going at the end of the day , youre the ones putting the labels on , she laughs im the one making the content , so im doing ok tim jonzewatch on

good , though i met some great people there after another brief stint as a barista when she relocated to london at the end of 2015 , the 19 year old is now concentrating on music full time , as one of the countrys most talked about unsigned acts having studied classical singing , piano and oboe eventually giving up the latter after she forgot to breathe during a lesson and passed out smith wrote songs in her bedroom before putting some online and bagging a management deal at 16 however , it was this year that things really blew up , when she melded dizzee rascals sirens with a haunting 80s piano sample and her own stirring , timely lyricism to tell the story of a youngster caught up with the police i literally just wrote blue lights sitting on my bed i didnt think it would be that big , she says since then , smith has shown the versatility of her simultaneously fragile and powerful vocals with tracks including a drumnbass reggae collaboration with cadenza and dre island , and a henry purcell inspired r b track with irish rapper maverick sabre , with a debut four track ep to follow imminently although she has had a typical gen z trajectory , she is an old soul who seems largely unconcerned with fame she is not too into social media , watches little tv bar documentaries and chart pop largely passes her by \( she collapses in giggles when she accidentally attributes a jay sean

detroit based digital artist molly sodas latest book project was borne of instagram , but not in the way you might think when the multimedia artist noticed her photos being removed from instagram for violating the community guidelines , she teamed up with co curator and artist arvida bystrm and put out an open call for submissions of photos banned by the network the resulting project , the book pics or it didnt happen , is due out early next year their subversive project is interesting for its range of imagery banned images include everything from nipples and pubic hair to a woman wearing a hijab and holding an iphone despite building a name for herself in the art world largely through networks like tumblr and instagram , soda says that she regularly thinks about the fact that those platforms dont have her career interests in mind when designing their networks policies i dont feel like instagram as an app necessarily owes me anything , soda explains im willingly using these social media platforms but the internet has set itself up in this guided and streamlined way where everyone follows these rules in order to facilitate whatever it is theyre trying to promote meanwhile , these platforms are huge corporate entities with an entirely different set of interests i dont think many creators realise the reality of what theyre dealing with , including myself indeed , as the internet economy is maturing , this nascent tension between big internet platforms like instagram , youtube , twitter , and facebook and the creators that provide them with content comes into focus platforms need users to create content which elicits the kind of engagement that is attractive to advertisers users need the platforms to reach wide audiences and potential revenue streams , but they want it without fear of censorship however , since few brands want to be sandwiched between racism and pornography , its up to platforms to figure out how to find the sweet spot of policing their networks without prompting frustrated creators to move on to their competitors laura chernikoff is the executive director of the internet creators guild , which was formed earlier this year to represent the interests of creators to big internet companies she says that one of the primary ways this tension manifests is through opaque user guidelines , or the lists of rules which outline what content is liable to be removed or demonetised in response to criticism around content removal , last month facebook publicly admitted that observing global standards for our community is complex and announced that they would be allowing more items that people find newsworthy , significant , or important to the public interest even if they might otherwise violate our standards in september , youtube weathered a backlash from many high profile creators when it tweaked its notification process for content that is deemed advertiser unfriendly , spawning the hashtag youtubepartyover chernikoff explains how the controversy perfectly displayed both sides of the debate the guidelines themselves are very broad and are being enforced by an algorithm without a lot of clear information about what youtube is looking for , people think it has to do with tags , metadata , and titles , but its not known exactly how it works , chernikoff explains however , its easy to understand why the guidelines have to be broad it is youtubes platform and they need to make it a safe space for brands which is a huge part of whats going on here chernikoff notes that compared to other more impenetrable social networks like facebook , youtube has been reaching out to creators and nurturing them though sources say it would be unlikely for youtube \( or any large internet company \) to outline their exact criteria for content removal and or demonetisation because then itd be easier to thwart a spokesperson for youtube contacted by the guardian pointed to an example of that a recent announcement that every creator who has joined the partner programme can get answers via email from a real person at youtube within one business day using snapchat to give a voice to sexual abuse survivors read morewhile our policy of de monetising videos due to advertiser friendly concerns hasnt changed , weve recently improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators , the spokesperson went on to say creators are the lifeblood of youtube and were totally committed to ensuring their growth and success so , whats a creator who wants to make a living on the internet , without fear of their business model being pulled out from underneath them , to do \? chernikoff says across networks , many creators are realising the need to diversify their portfolio and not limit their business model to one thats entirely dependent on a single social network , be it an ad revenue share model such as youtube or a more indirect , brand building route such as instagram indeed , prominent youtubers such as philip defranco have spoken publicly about intentionally tapping other revenue streams , which can include merchandise , direct crowdfunding , brand deals , and other partnerships , to financially underpin their channels frankie greek is a snapchat journalist who frequently speaks about these trends and helps brands make sense of them as a consultant she said much of creators discontent stems from how much the internet has changed in a short amount of time there was a time when the internet was in a way this counter culture , underground thing frankie greekpeople are super resistant to change and there was a time when the internet was in a way this counter culture , underground thing , greek said now , a network like youtube has grown into an enormous community and business model as much as people might think otherwise , youtube is mainstream media now for her part , greek says that watching the evolution of making a living online has influenced her career strategy in addition to her large snapchat following , greek has a professional background in tv and radio production and skills ranging from video editing to hosting live streams and event coverage in a sense , she serves as a kind of poster child for this online diversification strategy im kind of glad that this is the wave of content creators that im on ive been a part of this world for so long as a viewer and you get to see people build these empires , greek says snapchat has been so helpful as shortcut , but im also using my skills in a lot of other ways the best advice i can give to other content creators is to diversify your revenue streams and get out on as many platforms as you can until you find the right formula for you topicsmedia tech networkpublishing and platformssocial mediamarketing prdigital mediatumblrsnapchatsponsored featuresshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
an estimated 150 , 000 of americas 1 4 million armed forces personnel are stationed abroad there are an estimated 35 , 000 us service personnel dotted about the middle east , but the us does not release precise information on all their locations global mapafghanistanafghanistan barely featured in the election campaign , but when donald trump takes office he will not be able to ignore what is now americas longest war thousands of us troops are still stationed there , the security situation is deteriorating as the taliban threaten cities and consolidate control of rural areas , and isis has joined the war although american forces are not officially in a combat role , 11 have died there this year , making it a deadlier theatre of operations for the us military than iraq or syria the taliban responded to the us election result by calling on trump to withdraw americas troops , but advisers will warn him that without the backing of foreign airpower and other military expertise the country is likely to fall to the taliban his strong stance on fighting isis and islamic terrorism means he is unlikely to hand control of a country where thousands of american troops died to a scarcely less hardline group he has also expressed concerns about nuclear weapons in neighbouring pakistan trump has repeatedly called for us allies to pay more towards their own security , but there is almost no cash to be had in afghanistan , which is already largely dependent on foreign aid for its budget and is one of the poorest nations in the world he is likely to be stuck then with the multibillion dollar bill for the us presence and support of afghan troops emma graham harrisonbaltic statesthe baltic states are nervous about whether a trump administration would defend them in the event of a russian attack in july , trump told the new york times he would not necessarily come to the aid of lithuania , latvia and estonia unless they had first stumped up enough cash into nato coffers nato has recently been ramping up its military exercises in the baltics in response to what it sees as a growing kremlin threat in december the 173rd us airborne unit is due to train with latvian troops at a former soviet military base but it is unclear if such us led exercises will continue there is also uncertainty as to what will be trumps russia policy the fear is that trump will effectively concede eastern europe to moscow as a sphere of influence this would give vladimir putin , russias president , a free hand to create havoc in the baltics , raising the spectre of cyber attacks , subversion of democratic elections and even covert russian invasion , similar to the events of 2014 in east ukraine and crimea luke hardingcanadathe possible impact of a trump presidency on trade is the main worry of canadas goods and services , 72 exports go to the us , representing 23 of the countrys gdp and 2 5m jobs trumps promise to renegotiate nafta \( north american free trade agreement \) , which he called the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere , has alarmed ottawa but analysts point out that much of the two countries trade is also governed by world trade organisation rules , and the us ambassador to canada has said canada would be willing to look again at the agreement , in a gesture of goodwill towards the new administration canadians are also worried by trumps views on climate change \( he termed it a chinese hoax \) and the consequences , not just for the un paris agreement but bilateral pacts such as the deal struck by barack obama and the canadian prime minister , justin trudeau , to limit methane emissions from the oil and gas industry trump could prove positive for the canadian oil industry , suffering like many from low prices transcanadas planned keystone xl pipeline , carrying oil from alberta to a us terminal in nebraska , was rejected by the obama administration after six years of review trump has said he would approve the project , which would give canadian oil companies easier and so more profitable access to international markets , if it were resubmitted as long as the us benefited from its construction and got a share of the profits jon henleyfrancetheir world collapses ours is being built , tweeted florian philippot , a front national vice president , and marine le pens righthand man , as trump headed for victory trumps win certainly makes a president le pen more plausible more than 40 polls in the last two years have consistently shown her finishing second , or winning the first round of frances presidential elections , on 23 april 2017 after that , conventional wisdom says le pen will be heavily defeated in the run off stage by her rival , at present likely to be the veteran centre right former prime minister alain jupp , who is seen as a safe pair of hands after two hugely unpopular presidents some le pen policies particularly that of taking france out of the euro simply scare too many voters , and current polling says le pen would lose to jupp , backed by an anti fn front rpublicain , 34 64 after brexit and trump , we know polls can be wrong for them to be wrong by 30 percentage points would be extraordinary but the same factors that drove trumps victory are clearly in play in france le pen as the countrys president cannot be completely ruled out , especially if jupp does not make it to the second round jon henleyiranall eyes are on how trumps presidency will play out vis vis last years landmark nuclear deal , which was widely praised as a triumph of diplomacy that averted the risk of another war in the middle east despite his speech in march to the pro israel lobby aipac \( american israel public affairs committee \) , during which he said his first priority was to dismantle the disastrous deal with iran , it is still unclear what path trump will follow in office he has contradicted himself on the deal , previously conceding that it would be hard to rip it up without european support trumps lack of credibility among traditional european allies of the us led some to think that his victory would be unlikely to cause much trouble for tehran iranian leaders insist that the nuclear accord is an international treaty whose fate also rests in the hands of europe , as well as russia and china but iran knows that while trump may not be able to tear up the deal , he can certainly stifle irans access to the global market trumps cosiness with israel makes iran fearful of war but his positive relationship with vladimir putin is a source of optimism saeed kamali dehghaniraq and syriatrump has committed to defeating islamic state , and has said that one of his priorities on taking office would be to convene top generals to discuss new operations against the jihadi group this commitment , and his openness to forging an alliance with russia , meant his victory was met with despair among the syrian opposition and with delight in damascus russian jets and other military support have been crucial in turning the tide of the civil war in favour of the assad regime trump has also suggested he would not commit to limiting ground forces in iraq or syria he may face an immediate test on this front if the slow battle for mosul , the groups last major stronghold in iraq , is still dragging on when he takes office trump has condemned the offensive as a total disaster , saying troops were bogged down , though he has not made any clear suggestions for an alternative campaign baghdad is expected to fiercely resist any move by trump to make good on his pledge to take the oil from iraq to compensate for us spending in the country following the 2003 invasion oil is the main source of income for the iraqi government , and legal and oil experts say plundering its reserves by force would be illegal under international law emma graham harrisonisrael and the occupied palestinian territoriesa trump presidency does not bode well for the moribund middle east peace process , which broke down in 2014 since then there has been conflict in gaza , followed by a wave of violence between palestinians and israelis , which began last october and only subsided in the spring trumps policy prescriptions as enunciated by the candidate and his advisers would further exacerbate tensions most controversially , trump has promised to reverse decades of us policy by recognising jerusalem as israels capital and moving the american embassy there his aides also suggest that contrary to years of us policy which has long regarded israeli settlement building as an obstacle to peace trump would have no such objections such policies , if actively pursued when trump gets into office in january , would coincide with the 50th anniversary of the occupation at a time when palestinian faith in the peace process is at an all time low trumps proposal to tear up the iran nuclear deal , despite warnings from tehran , also risks renewing tensions between iran and israel peter beaumontjapan and south koreatrump has caused consternation and alarm in tokyo with suggestions that he is willing to make dramatic changes to the security glue that has held the us and japan together for more than 60 years amid rising concern over chinese military activity in the south china sea and north koreas apparently unstoppable acquisition of a viable nuclear deterrent , a clinton victory would have given japan the assurance it needed that bilateral security ties would remain untouched trump has hinted that his america first mantra could mean the withdrawal of 47 , 000 us troops from japan and another 28 , 500 ranged along the southern side of the heavily armed border that separates south and north korea the prospect of trump weakening or even scrapping that guarantee would cause alarm in tokyo , particularly after securing vows from washington that the us would come to japans aid if china attempted to retake the disputed senkaku islands by force the east china sea islands , known as the diaoyu in china , are administered by tokyo but claimed by beijing perhaps most alarming is trumps suggestion that japan and south korea should end their dependence on the us nuclear umbrella and develop their own nuclear deterrents that , many analysts agree , could spark an asia pacific arms race that would further destabilise an already tense region justin mccurrymexicothe mexican peso plunged 13 as trump headed to victory and americas southern neighbours were confronted with the prospect of a us president who had promised to rip up trade treaties , expel 5 million undocumented immigrants \( many of them , according to him , rapists and criminals \) , and build a 2 , 000 mile border wall which if any of those pledges trump would actually make good in office is anyones guess but many in mexico expect at the very least the economy to suffer , particularly if he tears up nafta as he has threatened to do about 80 of mexican exports go to the us and the governor of the mexican central bank , agustn carstens , warned before the election that a trump victory would be a hurricane for the countrys economy trump is loathed by many ordinary mexicans the countrys president , enrique pea nieto , drew heavy fire for not pushing back against him at a joint pre election press conference the foreign minister claudia ruiz massieu has since said mexico has no intention of paying for a border wall the government is working on a contingency plan to counter the worst potential effects of a trump presidency one of which , if the mexican economy does nosedive , would almost certainly be to reverse the flow of migrants returning to mexico from the us in recent years because of better job prospects at home jon henleyukrainemany ukrainians feel they were let down in the level of support they received from the west for fighting russia backed separatists in the east of the country , but a trump presidency brings a whole new level of fear what really terrifies kiev is the fact that trump has hinted he could be amenable to the sort of great power politics that putin enjoys man to man summitry where geopolitical deals are struck given the importance of ukraine to putins plans , he would be likely to demand the country be recognised as one where russia has special interests in putins dream world and kievs nightmare , the recognition of annexed crimea as part of russia could even be up for discussion a somewhat nervous statement was issued by the ukrainian president petro poroshenko , congratulating trump and noting he had been assured by the us ambassador that the incoming trump administration would remain a reliable partner in the struggle for democracy in reality nobody , including the us ambassador , knows what trumps position on russia and ukraine will be as on so many policy positions trump has made contradictory statements , at times suggesting more should have

as emily colvin , a transgender woman living in the heart of missouri , watched the election results pour in on tuesday night , her mind began to race with fear it was time for her to find a self defense class , she thought and maybe to purchase a gun with the united states emerging from one of the most bitterly divisive presidential races in its history , throngs of americans find themselves deeply distrustful , and even fearful of the winner , donald trump but few groups have expressed dismay and fear as uniformly as the nations trans people , who already report discrimination , harassment and violence at rates starkly higher than the general population on wednesday , those who spoke to the guardian saw trumps election as destined to hobble their movement after years in which their acceptance grew by leaps and bounds and they said they feared an immediate cultural reckoning ive got the safety net of being white so why am i so worried about trump \? emma brockes read morecate brenner , a trans woman on long island , said she was absolutely terrified for trans people and their movement by wednesday morning , it seemed as though every trans person she knew had gone into mourning a friend of hers in california posted on social media about going back into the closet it might be safer passing as a straight , cisgender person , said this person , who spoke to the guardian on condition of anonymity im scared , they continued ive been out and proud for most of my life , with supportive people around me ive never had to deal with this kind of fear before their fiance is also frightened to live openly as a transgender person were both scared to continue we didnt know before how we wanted to define ourselves , if we even wanted to now , were scared to even have the conversation we are all traumatized , said colvin in her online network of trans friends , the general reaction that im seeing is , oh my god how are we going to protect ourselves \? trumps administration is expected to usher in a sea change after several years in which transgender rights activists notched critical victories in the culture and government between 2008 and 2016 , the number of americans saying they knew a trans person grew from one in 10 to one in three the obama administration , in its final years , took the controversial and unequivocal position that federal anti discrimination laws applied to the rights of trans people there were far reaching consequences for schools , which were required to allow trans students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms aligned with their gender identities , and for entire industries , such as health insurers those gains , made amid a hail of controversy , now seem at risk trump seldom mentioned trans issues on the campaign trail but his running mate , indiana governor mike pence , first emerged on the national stage after signing an expansive anti lgbt measure into law and the republican party at large has made its near total opposition to trans rights clear on wednesday morning , pence seemed to confirm that the trump administration would not place penalties on schools that fail to accommodate trans students , as obama did washington has no business intruding on the operation of our local schools , pence said , in an interview he gave to the arch conservative radio host james dobson republicans are also poised to repeal the affordable care act , and with it , an anti bias measure that prevented many health insurance plans from discriminating against trans policy holders on wednesday , mara keisling , the director of the national center for transgender equality , rejected the notion that trumps victory represented a terminal setback for the movement trans people have spent decades educating their classmates and their families and their co workers and the people they worship with about who they are , keisling said the government can maybe take back some of the policy advancements weve had but they cant take away the dignity weve created for ourselves , the freedom weve created for ourselves still , keisling conceded , this slows us down , this hurts a lot on wednesday morning , her group heard from trans people across the country who were scared and angry this has got to be terrifying for many trans people were going to have to be strong in the face of some really terrible stuff colvin is worried about her access to hormone therapy in a world without the affordable care act , known as obamacare a student who was at one time homeless and suicidal , she credits her healthcare , which includes psychiatric therapy , with her survival im worried about our ability to change our names , she continued im worried about laws that protected trans kids gianni , 18 , a trans man who wished to be identified only by his first name , found himself wondering what would happen if he lost his healthcare coverage , or his insurer stopped covering his hormone therapy he doesnt believe theres any way he could afford his transition treatments out of pocket he was worried for his safety , too im mixed race , and im transgender , and i feel like im in a big hole right now , and im scared , gianni said as tuesday night gave way to wednesday morning , trans lifeline , a national hotline for transgender people in crisis , saw its normal call volume triple trans folks are frightened that they wont be able to work , or access healthcare , or get travel documents updated , said greta martela , the hotlines director and founder colvin witnessed a trans friend post about having suicidal thoughts on facebook the comments section pulsed with supportive messages and her friend sought help from his home in sacramento , mark williams tweeted that he was fearful as the father of a transgender child a bully and a bigot is at the helm , with a man who doesnt believe in lgbtq rights as his second in command , williams told the guardian im worried that the people who voted them into office will take the fact that they won as an affirmation that they can now discriminate and bully whoever they dont like trans children like his could face a new crossroads in the coming year the supreme court in october agreed to hear its first case on whether federal anti bias law covers transgender individuals the suit has been brought by a trans virginia teenager whose school district has prohibited his use of the boys bathroom trump and republican senators could fill the supreme court vacancy left by the late antonin scalia before oral arguments begin keisling , though , said she remained hopeful that many schools would continue to accommodate trans students the way she saw it was this for a short period of time , the government told schools how to treat transgender students , and hundreds of schools across the country complied theres a lot of reaching out to do i pray trumps arms are long enough jesse jackson read moreand in a potential victory for trans rights advocates , on wednesday , it seemed possible that north carolinas governor , pat mccrory , a republican , would lose re election in a state that had otherwise voted to remain red mccrory entered the national consciousness for his efforts to overturn broad discrimination protections for trans and other people its important to understand that the trans movement has moved faster than i think any movement in american history , said keisling she recalled an encounter of 15 years ago , when she was lobbying the president of the pennsylvania senate to include trans people in a new bill he refused he said , mara , look at the bright side five years ago , i wouldnt have let you into my office thats not the way it is now , and thats not the way its ever going to be again and brenner , the trans woman from long island , felt herself emboldened by tuesdays election as her friend was weighing whether to go back into the closet , brenner had already decided to make her trans identity more public ive always been semi quiet about it , brenner said but last night was the wake up call that that was not an option the lines have been drawn and i dont want to be on the

britains national newspapers registered their profound shock at donald trumps victory over hillary clinton with pages and pages of coverage the daily telegraphs front page called it the election that shook the world , while the daily mirror showed the statue of liberty clasping her face and a headline asking what have they done \? in lengthy editorials , leader writers sought to make sense of what the times referred to as the most dramatic insurgency in american political history politics will never be the same , said the times it was a political earthquake that the american political class could not bring itself to imagine the guardian also called it a global political earthquake , contending that president trump is the shock heard round the world the financial times believes it marks a thunderous repudiation of the status quo , while the daily telegraph sees the vote as the shattering of the liberal consensus by antipolitics every paper has views on why it happened , of course , and there is a considerable , and somewhat surprising , measure of agreement across the political spectrum the times points out that trumps base , white working class men , was bolstered by white women with college degrees , plus nearly one third of asian and hispanic voters for all of them , trump was the change candidate and that change is scary , with the threat to impose stiff tariffs on chinese and mexican imports even so , the times thinks britain may do well , because trump has far more affinity with and affection for these islands than mr obama trumps victory was , said the daily telegraph , americas brexit moment his campaign was based on being the outsider who would give the political establishment a bloody nose trump is not a rightwinger in economic terms and , on social policy , he has mostly adopted liberal positions nor is he a leftwinger , because he believes in low taxes and has been strident in his comments about immigration but his protectionism is problematic it would help no one , said the telegraph , least of all those americans who want mr trump to improve their lives it continued from britains point of view , upholding the special relationship is more important than ever in the wake of the brexit vote none the less , if president elect trump is to be true to the spirit of brexit that he has invoked , then he must lead an america that reaches out to the rest of the world and does not retreat into an isolationist shell the daily mail reads trumps win as a revolt against a complacent liberal elite that includes , but is not confined to , media pundits , the bbc , bienpensant politicians and the massed ranks of luvvies it was an unmistakable warning to the wests we know best political class , who have nothing but contempt for the ordinary people whose interests they profess to hold dear the paper continued they simply fail to understand voters rejection of all the isms beloved of the left \( multiculturalism , militant feminism , internationalism and social liberalism \) or trumps appeal to the most enduring ism of them all old fashioned patriotism and that left had displayed the same stunned reaction to brexit why \? because voters were fed up with having their concerns about mass immigration ignored , and were sick to death of a political class bailing out super rich bankers while family budgets were relentlessly squeezed for the mail , the result is a warning to all liberal elites , including the french , germans and those who seek to frustrate brexit , of the penalty for ignoring the electorate the sun urges people to calm down , arguing that trumps crazier ideas should be reined in by experienced republican party advisers anyway , it thinks he has some solid economic policies and could forge a new era of dialogue with vladimir putin , whom he admires ah yes , and he is also a fan of brexit like the mail , it sees an equivalency between the vote for trump and the vote to leave the eu , contending that smug lefties should condemn less and seek to understand more do they not grasp that , for years , voters with falling wages were ignored by politicians in washington or westminster \? the daily express , which views every current event through its obsessive loathing for the eu , is relieved that trump backs brexit the express registers its delight that nigel farage has cosied up to trump and believes it is a great relief to have a friend in the white house who respects the special relationship and is ready to put britain at the front of the queue the daily mirror , as its brilliant front page indicates , is downcast at trumps victory a tragedy not just for america but the rest of the world it says the keys to the globes most powerful democracy have been handed to a man who is a serial liar , sexual predator and overt racist anyone who cares about the wellbeing of the united states , where inequality is rife and racial tensions run high , should be alarmed those who care about global security , the international economy , climate change and human rights should despair the mirror finds trumps domestic agenda , such as his plans to dismantle obamacare , expel muslims and build a wall on the mexican border , distasteful it also believes he poses a risk to world security , the global economy and nato but the mirror believes it necessary to understand why he won he spoke to those left behind by globalisation , stuck in low paid and insecure jobs and fearful for their families future the independent believes trumps election is part of a revolution sweeping through the developed world , but argues that although the brexit trump phenomenon is powerful and new , it does not mean that centrist liberal politics is dead however , if centrist liberalism is to survive it must learn some deep lessons and renew itself the wrong response to defeat is to blame the american voters for their stupidity or prejudice , just as the wrong response to the brexit vote was to deride leavers a successful and confident liberalism has to understand why the voters behaved the way they did the guardian is concerned that trumps presidency could herald americas most stunning reversal of political and economic orthodoxy since the new deal in the 1930s , but with the opposite intention and effect it signals a seismic rupture in the american dominated global liberal economic and political order that had seemed to command the 21st century after communism collapsed and chinas economy soared the paper sees echoes in his victory of the increasingly alarming general rightward shift in the politics of other postindustrial western democracies , to which progressives have again produced inadequate responses in company with rightwing papers , it recognises the parallel with britains brexit vote and , as with brexit a period of careful evidence gathering and reflection is in order in pointing out that americans had chosen a political neophyte with a simple slogan , make america great again , the financial times argued that it had revealed profound fautlines in american society exposed by the global financial crisis trumps campaign had appealed to nativism , isolationism and protectionism his sweeping rhetoric and compulsive tweeting had resonated among millions of americans who have felt marginalised by globalisation but the paper maintains that the free movement of capital , goods , and labour is one of the great achievements of the postwar era globalisation has lifted millions out of poverty , especially in asia if trump carries out his threat to start tariff wars with global partners , the world will be poorer as a whole and the consequent effects on inequality are unlikely to be the ones that mr trumps working class supporters expect so there is a great deal of agreement about why trump won , but precious little advice on how to cure the problems that gave rise to his victory topicsmediagreensladenational newspapersus elections 2016newspapershillary clintonbarack obamablogpostsshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content

ufc welterweight champion tyron woodley is an african american athlete in the modern age of sports activism he does not take this responsibility lightly he grew up in ferguson , missouri , and that fact alone gives him a voice on racial matters for it was his town , his neighborhood , his very street where michael brown was shot and his body lay for hours baking in the summer sun as a young black man in ferguson he was racially profiled , pulled over needlessly by police and once thrown in a paddy wagon with a group of friends because he says we looked like we were up to something he wrestled at the university of missouri where last 8 november the football team went on strike in support of a black students and forced the schools president to resign he is proud of what the football players did at his alma mater , but more importantly , he sees the power their protest gives men like himself african americans with fame , money and success to speak about topics like inequality he believes they need to use it regardless of consequences in september he listened to donald trump rambling on about ferguson as if it was some flaming ghetto and not the racially mixed suburban st louis town he knows this angered him and so he said he got to keep ferguson out of his mouth so i can keep my fist out of his mouth his comments were dutifully reported by tmz who ran a picture of him with a clenched fist and a headline that said he threatens trump his words made headlines and a few days later , a crowd of mostly white fans booed him in madison square gardens theater during a press conference for saturdays ufc 205 jon jones stripped of ufc title after one year doping ban upheld read morewoodley seemed startled by the reaction was he being booed for saying he might put is fist through trumps teeth \? or because hes a diligent wrestler and therefore less exciting than his kickboxing opponent stephen wonderboy thompson \? or because he takes months off between fights , drawing criticism that he didnt deserve the ufc 201 fight against robbie lawler that got him the title \? it leads some , like fellow welterweight contender belal muhammad to say i dont know why the hate woodley cant help but wonder if it is something else something deeper something that still holds back black fighters in a sport that should be colorblind i think that this is my personal opinion but sometimes african american athletes are considered overly cocky , he says i have some \( things to say \) that are blatantly true about african american athletes in our sport and if i mention those thing then all of a sudden im whining , im playing the victim , im race baiting or its somebody else but i dont think it matters , he continues because at the end of the day , im the champion of the world im a successful individual and maneuvering in a culture where there are some racists i still find a way to get to the top , whether i go around or weave through the wonderboy fight is the biggest of woodleys career billed as the co main event of ufc 205 just below conor mcgregor v eddie alvarez and it has his name glowing on the garden marquee hes exactly the kind of fighter the ufc should want to promote a christian family man with four children , a burgeoning acting career and a series of broadcasting jobs and yet he cant shake a feeling that as important as hes become he isnt as free as the lighter faces surrounding him on the cards promotional poster at the ufc 205 press conference woodley watched mcgregor eviscerate the rest of the card with torrents of profane insults screamed into the roar of an adoring crowd that sees such bombast as part of mcgregors irish charm mcgregors act amused woodley even as he rolled his eyes through some of the rants mcgregor is a good businessman and he respects that he has a saying more drama , more commas so if mcgregor wants to heap clever putdowns while the money falls all around them , by all means let him holler but woodley knows he cant be mcgregor , throwing bottles and spewing swear words doing so would only make him the angry black man and the boos would only come louder then name me one african american mixed martial artist whos been able to get away with the amount of talk conor has , he says name me one you cant rampage jackson came to the ufc with a brain he came to the ufc with a huge following from being in asia with pride he was a personality before he came to the ufc you dont see them putting marketing money behind him to blow him up have you seen jon jones taken in any \( marketing \) direction \? have you seen any african american athlete that appeals to the urban market actually bring that market to the mma \? for years woodley never made ferguson a part of his identity he figured nobody had heard of his hometown and he found it easier just to say he was fighting out of st louis but then darren wilson shot michael brown and a neighborhood erupted there were riots and looters and buildings on fire in some ways he was conflicted he knew what it was like to be a young black man in ferguson the way the police come down hard sometimes , where the greatest crime an african american kid might have was the color of his skin those things are true , they are happening and ferguson is notorious for it , he says and yet it was also the place where he was raised , the community he loved he knew every bit of that town , having lived in some of the poorest sections as well as the best it hurt him to sit it burn he knew exactly the rage that many of the protesters brought to the streets , but he also knew that many of those running before the cameras , throwing rocks at windows werent from ferguson or even st louis the damage they did was more than just physical it left an emotional scar suddenly little ferguson was a national flashpoint and the tv commentators were getting the town wrong they portrayed it as the inner city , a predominately african american ghetto where crime lingered on every corner that was not his ferguson his ferguson a mixture of white and black spread through blocks of subdivisions a place where people had to accept each others differences and where also those backgrounds collided you go to ferguson and you look at january wabash park and other areas \( theyre \) extremely nice and its not a war zone , woodley says they way its portrayed is why i have an issue thats not ferguson i think more so \( it is \) the way way the community and law enforcement have been at odds for years they respect hasnt been there for the law enforcement and definitely there is profiling on the citizens after the riots he added ferguson to his biography not to capitalize on the unrest but to show people that the town where he grew up was not an awful place he wanted the world to know that good things and good people came from a community whose very name sparks the tinders of ugly debate he is sensitive about the impressions everyone gets of a place most have never seen i wanted to show that hey , ferguson is a place where a lot of successful people have been born and raised and built so i wanted to show ferguson in a positive way , he says not long after browns death and before the riots , woodley contacted the ufc hoping to use the organizations enormous platform to talk about ferguson , browns death and police relations in general there needed to be a productive dialogue , he thought , and he wanted to start it he remembers sitting in an airport , explaining his idea to someone who handles social media for the ufc thats my street , i grew up on that street ! , he implored , expecting the ufc to leap at a chance to promote a top fighter with direct ties to ferguson they did nothing , he says the same thing happened a year later when the missouri players went on strike , he says its crazy , he says , then pauses let me stop myself , he says , i was about to go off he shakes his head for a moment he says nothing i just thought those were good opportunities to make a positive stance , he continues , then his voice trails off in some ways , the missouri protest surprised woodley african american students at the school have long complained of feeling isolated but he was an athlete in a wrestling bubble and that kept him from the experiencing things that happened to other black students he had to call his brother in law , a doctor , who went to school there he told me some stories that i didnt want to hear , woodley says a few weeks ago , he went back to speak to the wrestling team and was surprised to see that even though he was the schools first all big 12 wrestler and their first top five recruit , his picture was not on the wall with other distinguished wrestlers in the schools history all of a sudden \( the coaches said \) oooh , we got to get a picture of you on this wall , woodley says it was kind of he paused again for moment and sighed but it is what it is and its about the athletes and thats why im there but it was really weird that people couldnt wrap their minds around the idea that these things can happen he drove around the campus that day looking at all the giant new fraternity and sorority houses and couldnt help that each mansion was only for predominantly white fraternities and sororities how many black homes are there \? he wondered where were all the big homes from the african american students \? he glanced around and realized that even after what happened last fall and the racial awakening of his old college , missouri still had a long way to go sitting in an empty radio studio in late september , a few days after the trump comments , about to promote the second biggest fight in the ufcs biggest card ever , woodley is probably at the apex of his career never will he have a larger voice in sports never may minority athletes have a more powerful voice than they do today as a child of ferguson he has the platform , he can be a kind of modern day ali boos be damned if donald trump is going to fire off a shot at ferguson well by god hes going to talk about putting his fist through the mans teeth thats not a right , its a responsibility he needs to talk about \( race \) , michael johnson , another african american ufc fighter will later say , unaware of woodleys words about trump hes a champion and his voice needs to be heard its very important to speak up with the things that are happening in the studio woodley laughs i dont read social media is \( the trump comment \) getting buzz \? he asks , the idea trump could actually be president probably the farthest thing from his mind yes , he is told , his line about putting a fist in trumps mouth made plenty of headlines he chuckles well hopefully it made it to him , he says no need to hold back now topicsufcsportblogmmaus sportsfergusonfeaturesshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
in the long run , i have hopedavid , 43 , colorado , a lifelong republican who voted for hillary clintoni am very disappointed about the result , but i cant be despondent i am by nature an optimistic person so , as the evening wore on and it became clear that trump was going to win , i started thinking about what is actually going to happen after this in the beginning , there will be dark moments , and things will happen that are not good for our country , or for the world im sure that the affordable care act wont survive , for example but then , i believe that the republicans will start to realize that they didnt really get what they wanted trump , after all , isnt a republican he has made that clear he just agrees with them on some things , or claims to i think the first half of trumps term will go very badly for the republicans , voters will become disillusioned , and the midterm elections in 2018 will be disastrous for them democrats will probably end up with control of both houses of congress well get a new supreme court justice , but im not worried about whether theyll be too conservative i would be more worried that they wont be qualified in the long run , though , i have hope i believe in checks and balancesdan , 59 , california , voted for donald trumpits done ! voted shortly after polls open on tuesday and i voted for trump reluctantly no disrespect intended to the third party candidates , but a vote for an alternate candidate is in reality a vote either trump or clinton so i was faced with a vote for an incompetent or a crook i chose to vote for the incompetent in the end it wasnt the emails that sealed the deal it was the remaining hope that checks and balances would modify the impending chaos the system of checks and balances appears to be in position to better counter trump than hillary trump has already lost substantial support among the gop so he cant count on either the existing supreme court or congress to ignore him then there is the press what we see is a press overwhelmingly anti trump a vote for hillary means we can not count on the press to honestly and diligently keep the public informed of hillarys potential malfeasance nor at this point can we count on the institutions of government to counter hillary in any meaningful way so i voted for the candidate likely to lead us into the weeds without opposition the establishment underestimated the publics ragegeno , 37 , pennsylvania , voted for jill steinwell , i think were all astounded instead of bushs predictable fifth term , were facing nobody quite knows what i never thought this was a serious possibility until today , but the establishment apparently made a misjudgment in underestimating the publics rage after decades of being impoverished to benefit the 1 since the primary was rigged against the only semi progressive major candidate , this was the next prominent way to give the democrats a well deserved heave \( all else aside , its refreshing to see their awfulness finally backfire on them \) im not exactly shocked at that , but dismayed that so many of my fellow citizens still refused to look outside the two party duopoly or help the greens reach federal funding levels the impetus is understandable this is a rejection of the two party status quo more than an actual endorsement of trumps racism or anti intellectualism but the forces hes unleashing are volatile and damn scary as always , the bigger struggle starts after voting positive change only comes from public action , so theres arguably a better chance for it now than under a democratic president if theres no actual policy coming from the oval office , theres space for saner voices to shape it itll be tough , but at least the citizenry seems ready to seriously push back the campaign got younger voters surprisingly engaged and proved that candidates dont have to be owned by corporate money if enough 99 ers remember the power lies with us , we may have a fighting chance after all i am ashamed of how this plays with the rest of the worldsarah , 28 , florida , voted for hillary clintonhillary clinton lost this election because sexism enabled voters to perceive the most qualified candidate in the world as someone more reprehensible than , bar none , the most despicable person who has ever sought the presidency because the contingent of mostly older , white americans overlooked empathy for minority groups due to their own positions of privilege because of voter apathy because we watched brexit happen and refused to heed its warning i am ashamed of how this plays with the rest of the world ashamed of my state in particular and dread what consequences it will bring the fallout of supreme court turnover alone will last long after his term is done it should go without saying that a president should not threaten the wellbeing of certain citizens as a main selling point in his campaign , and my heart goes out to any individual who feels unsafe i know the cold fear you are experiencing the only way we can think to proceed is to brace for a prolonged fight ahead of us the man slated to be president has built his platform on harming the vulnerable and shouting over the voices of the oppressed if you find this rhetoric deplorable , if you are kind , then seize any opportunity to defy it do not wait to speak out until they come for you to clinton , your loss is the nations loss i am sorry they were too blind to see the america im waking up to today scares memonica , 51 , vermont , voted for hillary clintonin my wildest dreams i never would have thought the public would swing so wildly away from reason as to elect someone like trump i grew up in a working class latino family im a liberal but my father was conservative ive been a single mom working multiple jobs to keep a roof over my daughters head and struggled to make ends meet as long as i can remember i understand the feeling that washington doesnt represent the people , but the america im waking up to today scares me and im left with only questions what kind of world will my grandson grow up in \? what will happen to friends and family , people of color who unlike me , werent born here someone once called it my golden ticket \? how could it be a good idea to elect a man who treats women so disrespectfully , makes promises he cant keep , has no interest in learning the nuances of diplomacy , and brags about not paying taxes \? why does the public react so negatively to a woman taking a role of leadership \? where is the critical thinking \? decency and respect have gone out the door in this election and weve just sold our collective soul to the devil a country split in two and at rock bottomchris , 50 , new york , voted for hillary clintonits 3 25am in the morning and im sick to my stomach as i type this the racist won the misogynist won the xenophobe won i guess the moral of the story is dont trust the polls , not even nate silver pundits and experts beyond my station will be dissecting this for years to come and there will be questions how did the republican party allow that reprobate to hijack it \? did the media in their quest for sensationalistic ratings become unwitting dupes providing thousands of hours of free and unfiltered publicity , missing opportunity after opportunity to fact check \? allow the blame game to commence and theres plenty of blame to go around as for me , i blame the democratic party i blame hillary clinton i blame debbie wasserman schultz the republican party has become the party of fascists the democratic party has become the new republican party the faction that sanders represented was the electrified faction , the energized faction and with good reason single payer healthcare , raising the minimum wage , climate change , tuition free state colleges and a variety of other progressive issues resonated with millennials and the working class its unfortunate that sanders version of progressive populism never had a opportunity to go to head to head with trumps regressive cynicism clinton at best personified its my turn , or at its most cynical at least im not trump so many voters \( myself included \) werent actually , they were clearly that wasnt enough and so here we are the unthinkable for at least half the country has happened a trump presidency the severity of this situation cant be understated a country split in two and at rock bottom if youre a woman , if youre muslim , if youre latino , if youre african american , asian , if youre a member of lgbtq community

donald trump the european commission president , donald tusk , wrote to trump on wednesday morning to invite him to an eu us summit at your earliest convenience to explore relations for the next four years , having previously joked on twitter that his wife believed there were enough donalds on the world stage corbyn said many in britain would be understandably shocked by donald trumps victory in the us presidential election , the rhetoric around it and what the election result means for the rest of the world , as well as america the victory for the republican outsider should be taken as an unmistakable rejection of a political establishment and an economic system that simply isnt working for most people , corbyn said , adding it is one that has delivered escalating inequality and stagnating or falling living standards for the majority , both in the us and britain he called trumps victory a rejection of a failed economic consensus and a governing elite that has been seen not to have listened and said public anger had been reflected in political upheavals around the world some of trumps answers to the issue of economic instability , and the rhetoric he used , were clearly wrong , the labour leader said i have no doubt , however , that the decency and common sense of the american people will prevail , and we send our solidarity to a nation of migrants , innovators and

respect for the rule of law , openness and concern for one another can no longer be taken for granted , he said in the united states last night , those values were defeated but those values are vital if we are to live together in peace , prosperity and freedom those who still believed in a future for liberal values need to fight for them , to win the arguments , to inspire new generations to the great and historic cause of liberalism , farron said never in my lifetime have those liberal values been so under threat , and never have they been more relevant and necessary there is nothing inevitable about the rise of nationalism , protectionism and division the election of canadas prime minister justin trudeau proves that i am determined that together we must make it our mission to build that liberal cause the alternatives are unthinkable among other mps and politicians , reaction was mixed in an emailed statement with the subject line caroline lucas responds to racist being

fight against climate change the conservative mp michael fabricant said he was hopeful of closer us uk ties , especially post brexit , given trumps earlier comments that britain would be at the front

our political economy this is the challenge theresa may brilliantly captured in her electrifying conference speech labours stella creasy also drew parallels with the brexit vote in a statement on her facebook page , saying 2016 had set out a generational challenge to everything we thought was ahead for ourselves and our families we can either cower in despair alone or stand up together in dignity for what we believe and work for a better world , she wrote you may feel angry , want someone to blame , just to make it stop but the difficult reality is that leaving this to someone else or shouting at each other will achieve little ukip , the uk party most closely tied to trump , mainly through the support of its interim leader , nigel farage , had little immediate reaction to the result farage himself was on a plane returning to the uk , where he was expected to make a statement of the two main challengers to replace him , paul nuttall had no immediate response , while suzanne evans told

opportunity to reach out to those who felt marginalised by his campaign the scottish labour leader , kezia dugdale , said she was heartbroken by the result while we must all respect the result of this democratic contest , today is a dark day for those of us who believe in compassion , tolerance and equality , she said donald trump was responsible for a hate filled campaign that was dominated by

heres an overview of where we are this morning donald trump has won the presidency in a stunning upset that surprised pollsters and media alike hillary clinton called trump to concede the election shortly after wisconsin was called for the republican candidate , sealing his victory the former secretary of state did not make a concession speech , instead she allowed advisor john podesta to tell the crowd at her party in new yorks javits center to go home shes expected to make a concession speech this morning in his victory speech , trump called for unity , praising clinton for a hard fought campaign and saying now it is time for america to heal the wounds of division oakland , new york , los angeles and washington dc have seen anti trump protests overnight , burning trump effigies and smashing a window at the oakland tribune the republicans won big all round maintaining and strengthening its control of the senate 51 47 after wins in florida , pennsylvania and indiana congress also remains republican controlled 236 191 asian stocks and the us dollar dropped after news of a likely trump win and bounced back slightly overnight , but all eyes on the market this morning this live blog is now closed please join us over at our new campaign live blog , where well be covering the fallout from the election all day donald trump wins us election the world reacts live read more irans president , hassan rouhani , reacted to trumps win by saying that it would not change the trajectory of his countrys foreign policy and that the uss credibility among the international community had already diminished , reports saeed kamali dehghan the us election results will have no impact on the policies of the islamic republic , the iranian cleric said during a wednesday meeting with his cabinet , according to the semi official isna news agency because of wrong policies , the position of america in the international community and worlds public opinion has diminished and the uss growing rift with europe and the world will exacerbate that position the countrys foreign minister , mohammad javad zarif , meanwhile , said that the us had to continue respecting last years landmark nuclear agreement , whose fate rests much in the hands of the new american president america has to implement the international obligation it accepted under the nuclear deal , he was quoted as saying by the semi official tasnim news agency while on an official visit to romania earlier on wednesday , a spokesman for irans atomic energy agency said that tehran would continue abiding by the nuclear accord despite trumps win tasnim cited behrouz kamalvandi as saying that iran is prepared for all kind of change and that the country would continue implementing the barjam , iranian acronym of the joint comprehensive plan of action \( jcpoa \) or the final nuclear accord tasnim , which is affiliated to the elite iranian revolutionary guards , saw donald trumps win as a vindication for the iranian supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , who said last week that the american businessman appeared to be the one saying the truth about the state of affairs in the us referring to trump , khamenei said last week what is interesting is that the person who spoke more candidly attracted more attention from the people of america because that man spoke more candidly and more openly , the people of america paid more attention to him the other party clintons camp said that he is adopting a populist method why populist \? it is because the people were watching him and they saw that what he was saying was correct they saw it in the realities of their life human values have been annihilated and trampled upon in that country there is racial discrimination in that country fouad izadi , a political analyst sympathetic to the conservative camp in iran , said trumps presidency would be better for iran than that of clintons the only advantage of having trump over clinton in regards to iran is that he would have much more difficulties in bringing together the international community in order to make obstacles for iran , he told tasnim analysts such as izadi think that pressure on iran in the past was because obama had managed to persuade the uss european allies to rally behind washington in imposing sanctions on iran they think trump lacks the credibility to do so in case the nuclear deal falls apart donald trump has updated his twitter bio to reflect his new position trumps twitter bio photograph twitter jeremy corbyn mp , leader of the labour party in the uk , gave the following statement many in britain and elsewhere will be understandably shocked by donald trumps victory in the us presidential election , the rhetoric around it and what the election result means for the rest of the world , as well as america trumps election is an unmistakable rejection of a political establishment and an economic system that simply isnt working for most people it is one that has delivered escalating inequality and stagnating or falling living standards for the majority , both in the us and britain this is a rejection of a failed economic consensus and a governing elite that has been seen not to have listened and the public anger that has propelled donald trump to office has been reflected in political upheavals across the world but some of trumps answers to the big questions facing america , and the divisive rhetoric around them , are clearly wrong i have no doubt , however , that the decency and common sense of the american people will prevail , and we send our solidarity to a nation of migrants , innovators and democrats after this latest global wake up call , the need for a real alternative to a failed economic and political system could not be clearer that alternative must be based on working together , social justice and economic renewal , rather than sowing fear and division and the solutions we offer have to improve the lives of everyone , not

to turn that into a political machine capable of ruling we wont know if he can be successful until he actually takes office in january for now , this is a strange day , politically and financially we have suffered a massive political shock , but the markets are wondering if president trump is less of a threat to americas economy in office , compared to what he was during the campaign some more

people aligned with a candidate like trump she said , referencing his comments about women and people of color her friend , jekia brockman , looked around at the women crying one of whom flopped over dramatically as yet another state was said to be leaning trump and said its not unbelievable its completely believable how it all unfolded how the 2016 us election night unfolded women in suits , mothers and daughters , hucksters selling nasty women pins and tens of thousands of members of the public came to manhattans largest glass ceiling on tuesday night , to await the result of a presidential election that many hoped would sweep away the highest gender barrier in us politics as the night went on and results did not go the democrats way , the mood in and around the building grew darker , reports the guardians lauren gambino from clintons election night party in new york inside , clinton was supposed to speak on a stage constructed in the shape of the united states , her podium positioned somewhere over texas , a deep red state that would stay that way despite a nationwide increase in the hispanic vote that had fuelled hopes of turning it purple , if not democratic blue american flags lined the stage the pledge of allegiance was said , the national anthem played thunderous cheers rang off that glass ceiling as newscasters announced that clinton had won illinois , the state where she was born states came and went , largely as expected delaware , vermont , massachusetts and rhode island for clinton , south carolina , alabama and more for trump but things were predictably close in florida , and as trump surged back into contention tension rose at the javits in the early hours of the morning , not long before the race was called and clinton conceded , campaign chairman john podesta took the stage to ask supporters if they could hang a little while longer i can say we can wait a little longer cant we \? podesta said theyre still counting votes and every vote should count several states are too close to call , so were not going to have anything more to say tonight supporters made a teary exit mothers carried weary daughters out of the glass structure that in the end hosted shattered hopes , not broken barriers what just happened , gloria lowell asked , shaking her head she repeated the question a man turned around and raised his beer we lost , he said we lost and it hurts the pair of strangers embraced john podesta calls an end to hillary clinton presidential campaign photograph upi barcroft imagesyou can read the whole piece here british prime minister theresa may has released a statement congratulating trump on his victory in the presidential election she said i would like to congratulate donald trump on being elected the next president of the united states , following a hard fought campaign britain and the united states have an enduring and special relationship based on the values of freedom , democracy and enterprise we are , and will remain , strong and close partners on trade , security and defence i look forward to working with president elect donald trump , building on these ties to ensure the security and prosperity of our nations in the years ahead weve been gathering views on the mood in the us here , a group of american readers tell us what they think susan hall from illinois sent in her response , saying a long hard fought campaign i am very proud of our new president and vice president the message shared has set the right tone for his presidency its time to now begin the hard work and healing of our nation i understand there are many feeling uneasy right now i think if they keep an open mind and open arms , the us can come together like never before the future is what we decide to make it at this point woody from washington was similarly excited , declaring it a victory for average americans i voted for obama twice , and really he should go down as one of the worst presidents in history obamacare is a disaster , our ability to project our strength in the world has diminished we have become more divided as a nation under his guidance hillary would only have expanded on his failures we saw scandal after scandal when bill was in the oval office she should have been prosecuted for her illegal server and lied under oath she would have expanded immigration causing unrest like we are seeing in europe at this moment the supreme court will have several openings and trump will appoint nominees who will preserve our constitution and bill of rights more than anything i am so relieved hillary didnt win as i dont trust her others were much less enthusiastic anton prosser from texas said he felt bad when george w bush was elected , but hes never felt afraid until now im trans , and im worried about what will happen to me in this america now if the courts will see challenges to every bit of equality for lgbt americans im scared that if i attempt to legally transition , my marriage could be invalidated or my health care taken away if we lose the few protections we have im scared to use a bathroom in any public place , because i never know if strangers see me as a

during the brexit debate , one comment stuck in my mind and seemed to resonate with people on both sides of the argument responding to expert claims in june that brexit would damage the uk economy , leave campaigner michael gove delivered a line that sent shivers down the spines of our colleagues in all fields people in this country have had enough of experts four months on , we can start to see the results of the vote to leave the european union the markets are volatile , the future is uncertain and many of us are left trying to figure out what has caused the big divide in our country disillusionment , austerity and misinformation have all been blamed for the polarised result so , what does this mean for science \? for centuries , britain has been at the forefront of science and engineering science is not just part of our heritage , it is part of our future the uks competitiveness and economy depend on it but when mr gove made this statement , it made me wonder if our relationship with experts and scientists was changing mr goves comments are believable , since trust in many sectors has declined sharply in recent years the financial services compensation scheme says that trust in the financial sector was shattered by the recession trust in charities has also dipped from a rating of 6 7 out of 10 to 5 7 since 2014 , with people citing reasons such as aggressive fundraising tactics and the collapse of kids company as the cause of this dip trust in mps also fell after the expenses scandal , according to ipsos mori these events have shaken confidence in the people and institutions we considered to be experts are scientific experts next to undergo a sharp decline in trust \? what could this mean for the uk and our place in the world \? at the british science association , we monitor the relationship between science and society , and its complicated on the surface , trust in scientists is very high more people trust scientists to tell the truth \( 79 \) than the police \( 53 \) or the clergy \( 67 \) , according to ipsos moris veracity index the institute for government also found that most of us want experts to be involved in policy decisions \( 85 \) , and for their evidence to be used by politicians \( 83 \) delve a bit deeper and you find that this trust is less robust than it first seems our research shows that only 12 of the population actively seek out scientific information , media content or events around 52 are open to science but dont actively seek it out , and 27 completely avoid it with most of our citizens disengaged from science , is their trust in experts resilient \? this low level of engagement suggests that our relationship with science and expertise is based largely on blind trust we allow scientists and scientific institutions to get on with their work , often with public funding , without much questioning or scrutiny we rely on science to police itself but who can blame us when science is so inaccessible an academic article in a non open access journal can cost more than 40 to read funding decisions are made behind closed doors and many scientists are not recognised or rewarded for their engagement with people outside their profession this blind trust has been analysed by sociologist anthony giddens as civil inattention many of us have no choice but to trust experts because it is difficult to challenge people who have more specialist knowledge than us events such as the mmr controversy , gm food protests , the bse crisis and climategate then come as a shock to those in the scientific establishment who are not used to being challenged from these examples , its clear that people get involved and question things when they matter to them , or when their trust in others is eroded on the back of a public outcry over mps expenses , charity fundraising and the financial sector , new regulators have been established to push for responsible conduct but its not yet clear whether the recent drop in trust for these groups will force them to re evaluate the way they function it has taken a crisis in these areas to force good practice back in the world of science , many of our colleagues and partners are concerned that a scandal will destroy the seemingly fragile trust many have for researchers and experts at the british science association , we think its time to get ahead of the curve and make some radical changes were working to enable people to access , question and scrutinise research we think its a fast track to accelerated innovation , a democratic society and stronger citizenship we want to see a population that is keen to actively engage as critical friends , with institutions that are open to challenge and scrutiny we organised the huxley summit to bring non scientists into the leadership and decision making structures of science we hope that by bringing together leaders from across our society , we will blur the lines that separate science from business , politics , media , and the arts with provocative talks from speakers such as rt hon the lord david willetts , former science minister dame sally davies , chief medical officer karen blackett , chair of mediacom and sacha romanovitch , ceo of grant thornton uk , we hope the summit will spark the conversations i believe are needed to move our country forward in these uncertain times all of the summit speeches will be made available online so that these conversations can continue we named the summit after thomas henry huxley , a self trained biologist who in 1860 gave his ferocious support to darwins theory of evolution at the bsas annual meeting crucially , the debate included voices from science alongside those from religion and other areas huxley fought for a radical new idea against a powerful establishment , built a network of supporters and pushed for what he believed in we hope the summit will provide a platform for leaders of innovation to spark debate and build trust in the 21st century we at the british science association envision a world where everyone can learn , use and question the knowledge created by our institutions and contribute their ideas and findings we want everyone to feel united in the aim of scientific and societal progress to do this , we need support from all types of organisations and people we want to see an opening up of what happens inside science more accessible communication is a first step towards being fully open and transparent this means more dialogue between citizens and institutions , and crucially before the big decisions are made another step is citizen led scientific research after that , could we see new and disruptive ways to access information from organisations that take us away from blinkered trust and toward a sense of shared ownership and accountability \? we want to see a proactive approach to openness , to help rebuild the relationship between people , experts and institutions we hope that this will help to prevent scandals in science and other sectors these ideas are universally applicable across business , charity and government , and we hope to provide a platform to discuss them today topicssciencepolitical sciencecommentshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content

eu leaders are planning a meeting in december to discuss brexit without the british prime minister , the guardian has learnt \( see 5 03pm \) the uks global diplomatic and security influence is at risk if it cuts itself off from the single market and continues to denigrate foreigners , one of britains most senior civil servants has warned as patrick wintour reports , sir simon fraser , who was permanent under secretary at the foreign office until last year , said britains position near or at the top diplomatic table was at stake after the vote to leave the european union he said there is already evidence of potential self harm in our behaviour to foreign people , the reported spike in hate crime , the insensitive comments of some british politicians , and the shocking press coverage of the legal judgment on article 50 i hope our political leaders will show more skill and wisdom in the next chapter of our european relationships than over the last decade which was strewn with diplomatic errors and misjudgments anti gay laws in commonwealth countries are totally out of date , highly inappropriate and should be changed , the uks deputy foreign secretary , sir alan duncan , has said anne turley , a labour mp , is pressing the government to increase the penalties for animal cruelty offences , noting that research shows people who harm animals are more likely to go on to commit crimes such as domestic abuse thats all from me for today thanks for the comments theresa may was not invited to a european union summit in bratislava soon after she became prime minister she will have to get used to it eu leaders are planning a meeting in december to discuss brexit without the british prime minister , the guardian has learnt donald tusk , the president of the european council , wants the eus 27 remaining member states to discuss brexit around the time of an eu summit scheduled for 15 16 december , according to two brussels sources the british prime minister would attend the eu summit , but would not be invited to separate brexit talks , the third time the uk has been excluded from leaders talks since it joined the bloc in 1973 eu leaders met without david cameron soon after the brexit vote and held the summit in slovakia without theresa may in september the meeting is a sign the eu27 are intensifying preparations on britains eu exit ahead of article 50 , which may has promised to trigger by the end of march once the uk fires the starting gun on talks , the eu will spend four to eight weeks drawing up detailed guidelines for negotiations , a list of red lines that could cover everything from the single market to the status of gibraltar that work hasnt started yet , but tusk wants to start preparing the ground one senior eu diplomat told the guardian the guidelines would be a trade off between speed and precision if the guidelines remain flexible they are easier to adopt , if they are very detailed , they are likely to take more time brussels diplomats are keenly following brexit fallout in the uk some say they have been shocked by the uk media response to the high court decision on parliaments role and the governments limited defence of british judges the welsh governments law officer has strongly criticised the attacks on the brexit high court judgement and explained why he wants to be able to make representations at the supreme court hearing assembly member mick antoniw , counsel general for wales , said the judgement had been deliberately misrepresented by some he said there are those who have deliberately chosen to misrepresent the facts to challenge the independence of the judiciary , one of the cornerstones of our democratic parliamentary system the reporting of this judgment in some newspapers was frankly a disgrace and an insult to the good name of journalism the democratic structure of the uk and indeed this assembly is built on a foundation of the rule of law and the independence of our judicial system the tragic recent history of europe is littered with examples of countries that overthrew the rule of law and undermined the independence of the courts that road is not a democratic one and leads only in one direction i would hope those who may have made comments and statements in haste , will want to reflect explaining to the assembly in cardiff why he wants to appear in person at the supreme court hearing , antoniw said i consider that this case raises issues of profound importance not only in relation to the concept of parliamentary sovereignty but also in relation to the wider constitutional arrangements of the united kingdom and the legal framework for devolution i think it is of paramount importance to emphasise at this point that despite the political furore surrounding it and the frankly alarming tone of much of the press coverage , as the high court itself said , this case involves a pure question of law it is not concerned with the merits and demerits of leaving the european union and the politics surrounding that the sole legal question at issue is whether the uk government can as a matter of constitutional law use the prerogative powers to give notice of withdrawal from the european union in seeking to intervene in any appeal , the welsh government will seek to reinforce the importance of parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law core , established principles of british constitutional law antoniw emphasised that the welsh government was not seeking to reverse the result of the referendum he said having outlined what the case is about i should also make a comment on what it is not about the first minister has made crystal clear and i repeat that sentiment now the welsh government respects the result of the referendum and this is absolutely not about overturning that decision the legal commentator joshua rozenberg has posted a good story on his facebook page he says that liz truss , the lord chancellor and justice secretary , is being sued by six high court judges for age discrimination two of the judges are also claiming sexual discrimination and racial discrimination respectively here is an extract from rozenbergs post all the claims relate to reduced benefits the judges can expect to receive under a new judicial pension scheme introduced last year a two week hearing has been arranged before a tribunal judge who is not affected by the new pension arrangements there could be further hearings before appeal judges its thought to be unprecedented for serving judges to sue the lord chancellor and the ministry of justice turning back to the ifs report \( pdf \) , this is interesting its a table showing how many of the fiscal targets set by the treasury since 1997 have been met success and failure of treasury fiscal targets since 1997 photograph ifsthe ifs counts 12 targets in all , and concludes that only two of them have been hit both were rolling targets that did not involve balancing the budget in a given year , but setting plans that involved balancing the current budget over a five year , and then later a three year , timetable that may sound like cheating , but the ifs commends this approach only two targets managed to be met consistently that is the coalition governments initial target to aim for a cyclically adjusted balance on the current budget five years out and its subsequent revised target to aim to achieve this three years out it is perhaps not a coincidence that these two targets also had much to commend them in contrast the other targets either had more thresholds that were more arbitrary \( when did the cycle start and end \? , why 40 of gdp \? , why should debt definitely fall between two future points in time \? , why should welfare spending definitely be below some fixed level \? \) and or were not sufficiently flexible in the face of adverse fiscal shocks \( why must there be an overall surplus in 201920 \? , why must borrowing in 201314 be no more than half what it was in 200910 \? \) the weaknesses of these other targets often meant that their abandonment was preferable than trying slavishly to adhere to them here are some more pictures from theresa mays india tour today theresa may stands amidst hindu priests after offering prayers to the hindu deity lord shiva during a visit to someshwara temple in bangalore photograph manjunath kiran

prime minister theresa may , center , during her visit to someshwara photograph aijaz rahi apand this is what number 10 said about the visit in a briefing note sent out in advance the prime minister will visit the sri someshwara temple in the ulsoor district of bengaluru later today to pay her respects at this ancient hindu place of worship she will be welcomed by a guard of honour consisting of garlanders \( who place a garland of fragrant flowers around the neck \) and musicians playing drums and horns she will then tour the temple , built by the chola dynasty \( 300 bce1279 ce \) and showcasing an impressive mixture of chola , hoysala and vijayanagar architecture someshwara means he who wears the moon on his head , and is another name for lord shiva , one of the principal deities in the hindu triumvirate the prime minister will conclude her visit by participating in a hindu aarti \( blessing \) aarti is a part of pooja \( prayer \) in which light from wicks soaked in ghee \( purified butter \) or camphor is offered to the deities the prime minister will draw her hands together across the top of the flame and touch her eyes , in a traditional ritual she will then be offered kumkum tika \( red power \) to touch and dab a single spot on her forehead a senior city figure who was a remain supporter during the eu referendum has urged theresa may to get cracking with the process of brexit , warning that any delays would only cause more uncertainty for business john nelson , the chairman of lloyds of london , said to be blunt with you , the longer the uncertainty goes on the worse it is for business his intervention , while travelling to india as part of a delegation accompanying the prime minister , is significant because he has been a vocal opponent of so called hard brexit but while some pro eu campaigners want to push back the triggering of article 50 , nelson said delays could be damaging i think unfortunately if it means greater uncertainty for a longer and longer period it is not so good , he told the evening standard get cracking is my view its not a view thats shared by all my colleagues here lloyds announced major plans to expand during mays three day visit to india , designed to boost economic ties between the two countries nelson said he believed ministers understood the importance to city based firms of resisting non tariff barriers in the deal negotiated with the eu from our point of view we are very , very keen to have passporting rights and single market access i detect that ministers are getting that very strongly now indeed he said it was important to prevent a cliff edge the other thing is we have to negotiate transitional arrangements otherwise we will be at a cliff edge for both sides , the eu and us and they wont start negotiating those until article 50 has been moved nicola sturgeon , the scottish first minister , was inevitably also asked about the us election at her regular press conference this lunchtime unsurprisingly , shes expressed her preference for hillary clinton before now today she added that , whilst this is americas election and not usual for a leader of another country to comment , it would be good to see that biggest crack to date in the glass ceiling sturgeon said of the democratic candidate i think her experience , her strength , her resilience which has been on show throughout this campaign will make her a good president and somebody well able to address the challenges america in common with many other countries faces above and beyond that , im standing here as the first woman to hold the office of first minister and i think it would be great to see the worlds biggest democracy elect the first woman leader the message that would send to women and girls across the world would be a very positive one it would be good to see that biggest crack to date in the glass ceiling theresa may has played down a warning from the institute for fiscal studies about how brexit could prolong austerity , saying the fundamentals of the british economy are very strong \( see 11 38am \) theresa may visiting the sri someshwara temple in bangalore , india , today photograph dan kitwood getty imagesmay has been accused of caving in to business interests after it was reported that she plans to water down proposals to put workers on company boards she announced this during the tory leadership contest , implying that she would compel firms to have workers on their boards , but today the times claims that the government will make this a voluntary initiative the paper \( paywall \) says business leaders expressed concerns about a move that they said risked undermining effectiveness the cbi and insitute of directors were among the groups to raise fears , quietly supported by the treasury mrs may used her conservative party conference speech to underline her commitment to the plan and downing street has repeatedly denied that it was being weakened a senior figure involved in the preparations , however , said that the consultation , probably in the shape of a green paper , would seek to encourage rather than mandate workers representation when it was published as early as next week on workers on boards the intention is not to be prescriptive but also where there is a need to tighten the codes we shall , the source said a downing street spokesman said there was no change to mays plan but he also hinted that the scheme could become voluntary he told the lobby briefing there is no change to our plan to have workers on boards how that actually unfolds , clearly theres a consultation process that were going to start , i clearly cant anticipate what that consultation process will find , but there is no change to what the prime minister said at conference the tuc warned that a voluntary approach would fatally undermine mays plans and turn it into little more than a pr exercise and the lib dem business spokesman lord foster said giving workers a say in how the business they work for operates is an idea whose time has come if it can work in germany and other major industrial countries then it can work here if theresa may wanted to deliver her promise to make britain a place that works for everyone then she could sadly it seems she doesnt have the political will to do so bill clinton disparagingly referred to jeremy corbyn as being selected for labour leader because he was the maddest person in the room , according to a leaked transcript of a campaign speech he made last year yvette cooper , the chair of the

family so im just standing there drinking a coke and this guy comes up to me and says , you dont know me because i was not in government when you were there , but when your wife was secretary of state , i was the british cabinet secretary for northern ireland and i thanked him cameron was good on northern ireland we did pretty well when he was there so he said in 2010 remember when the whole thing was about to come off the track \? we had terrible conflicts he said , i was desperate i didnt know what to do and finally , i realized that hillary was the only person in office anywhere in the world that had enough influence with the irish to solve it , so i called and pleaded with her to help me put it back on track thirty six hours later , we were moving again shes the only person in the world who could have done that and he said , she did that for a lot of us in a lot of different places , and a lot of us would like to help her now clinton did not name the northern ireland secretary but , although he mentioned david cameron , he was probably talking to shaun woodward , northern ireland secretary under gordon brown \( who oversaw a crisis about devolving policing powers \) not camerons

a report into the met polices investigation into an alleged westminster paedophile ring has identified 43 failings the most grave failings identified included officers misleading a judge to get search warrants , believing the complainant known as nick for too long , publicly stating the allegations were credible and true and not closing the investigation sooner the main complainant , whose allegations led to the met investigation has been referred for criminal investigation the man , known , only as nick will be investigated by northumbria police regarding an allegation of perverting the course of justice five police officers have been referred to the police watchdog , the ipcc , including det asst commissioner steve rodhouse , the senior officer in scotland yards investigation rodhouse released a statement saying he did not believe he or any of his officers in operation midland had committed any misconduct the met commissioner , bernard hogan howe , accepted there had been serious failings and publicly apologised to lord bramall and harvey proctor , who were among those accused he also apologised to lady brittan the widow of leon brittan , who was also accused proctor said that he had accepted hogan howes apology but lamented the irreversible impact on his life and that of his friends and family the nspcc warned that the report could prevent victims coming forward in future harvey proctor said he has accepted an apology from hogan howe but that the inquiry had had an irreversible impact on his life , family and friends today , without prejudice , i accepted an unreserved apology from sir bernard hogan howe , the mps \( metropolitan police service \) commissioner , in respect of operation midland however , i have informed him the detrimental impact of the investigation on the life of my family , friends and myself was irreversible this apology does not detract from the adverse effect and hurt of operation midland on my life and me personally i hope the police in such cases in future will always test the credibility of a complainant before someone is thrust into the public limelight my efforts in challenging the metropolitan police service from the beginning over 18 months ago have not been for selfish reasons but in the hope that anybody now and in the future can be spared the trauma that i have experienced i regret that it has taken someone in a high profile position , albeit unwanted , to make an impact , but it is a moral victory for all potential defendants from all walks of life i am proud of the little role i have played i hope the police will learn from this , so the glaring mistakes identified from operation midland will not be repeated i have always had huge respect for the policing of our country , and admiration for the work police officers do this is undiminished i hope the home office will look at these matters carefully and bring forward proposals to amend the current system where a complainant , even a fantasist and liar , can be given life long anonymity and financially benefit while the alleged suspect is routinely fingered and named by the police and in my case left destitute harvey proctor photograph jonathan brady pa the nspcc has expressed fears the report could prevent victims coming forward a spokeswoman for the charity said lessons must be learned from this sorry episode , and it is extremely disappointing that this report has not been published in full it takes unimaginable bravery for victims to come forward we are concerned that this reports recommendations could undermine the confidence of victims to do so , and we cannot allow it to result in a return to the dark days when we looked the other way and failed to confront the horrors of abuse and bring those responsible to justice it makes very difficult reading for the metropolitan police , who despite good intentions at the outset , failed to admit they had got it wrong when it became clear that the allegations were unfounded the closure of the investigation amid immense media fanfare did a huge disservice to those who have been abused in childhood , and risked denting the publics willingness to take action to protect children henriques said it was unlikely that the government would pass an anonymity before charge law , because it would enrage tabloid editors however , the government should pass an anonymity before arrest law , he said in another recommendation which will be challenged by some in the media , henriques says police should not release any details such as age or where a suspect lives to the press or the public before an arrest , bail , search or interview of a suspect at present , the age and the town where a suspect lives is often disclosed to the media henriques also reviewed another investigation , operation vincente , an inquiry into a separate allegation that lord brittan raped a 19 year old woman the retired judge found it involved a grave error of judgment and it was obvious while the peer was still alive that there was not enough evidence to charge him he said it was also manifest that he was very poorly i am in no doubt that he should have been informed during his lifetime that no action would be taken in response met commissioner sir bernard hogan howe said the case against brittan should have been told before he died that the cps full code test had not been met and that there was no intention to prosecute him leon brittan photograph pa deputy assistant commissioner steve rodhouse , the senior officer in charge of operation midland , is one of five officers referred to police regulator , the ipcc , in the light of todays report rodhouse has responded in a statement he said i do not believe that i , or indeed any officer within operation midland , have committed any misconduct while it is right that lessons should be learned from operation midland i want to emphasise that my colleagues and i investigated the allegations made with the best of intentions indeed i am grateful that sir richard himself recorded that the operation midland officers conducted this investigation in a conscientious manner and with propriety and honesty if a further investigation is required then i will , of course , continue fully to co operate with it recommendation 10 of the report says a suspect should have the right to anonymity prior to arrest enforced by statute and criminal sanctions this tallies with what hogan howe himself has previously called for a spokesperson for the mayor of london , sadiq khan , who has the power to sack the mets commissioner and instigate met inquiries , said that a series of extremely serious errors were made by the met which threaten the trust of londoners in its police force it is absolutely vital that victims of rape and sexual assault feel confident to come forward and report crimes and that all allegations are treated seriously by the met mopac \( mayors office for policing and crime \) will work closely with the met and other key agencies to ensure victims are always fully supported when they report a crime the mayor will now be seeking full assurances from the met commissioner on the consistency of the quality of the forces investigations into sexual offences and guarantees that the failings of past investigations will not be repeated the complainant referred for criminal investigation is nick , whose allegations initiated operation midland , police have confirmed the met said it has referred an allegation of attempting to pervert the course of justice to northumbria police the report says that the investigation could have been carried out without those accused by nick learning of itit said the principal cause of the mistakes in operation midland was the decision to search several premises , which it described as a grave error of judgement henriques found these searches were carried out when there were no reasonable grounds to believe an indictable offence had been committed the applications for search warrants had several inaccuracies these included naming lord brittan as one of the owners of a property when , as he was deceased , this was impossible stating that nick had remained a credible witness who is telling the truthother errors identified in the report included police seizing property not authorised by the warrant which was not copied and returned but kept for excessive periods officers also confirmed the location of the searches contributing to the loss of anonymity of those who had been accused failing to supply a psychologist , tasked with assessing nick , with all the relevant information and rejecting the views of another consultant psychologist as biased , relying instead on the views of nicks counsellor without evaluating her qualifications or experience the met has said it is referring the conduct of five officers to the independent police complaints commission \( ipcc \) in the light of the henriques report one of them is a deputy assistant commissioner ipcc deputy chair rachel cerfontyne said we were advised earlier today that the metropolitan police is to refer the conduct of five officers , ranging in rank from sergeant to deputy assistant commissioner , to the ipcc in relation to operation midland we understand the conduct of a deputy assistant commissioner will also be referred to the ipcc regarding a different operation we have assembled an assessment team to analyse relevant documentation to be supplied by the force , and provide me with a recommendation once i receive that recommendation , i will decide whether there will be an investigation and , if so , what form that investigation will take i am aware of the significant public interest in these matters and i will announce that decision once i have made it and all concerned parties have been notified we have not received any complaints from individuals who may feel they were adversely affected by the actions of officers involved in operation midland but , as in all cases , were such complaints to be referred to the ipcc they would be given due consideration sir bernard hogan howe has released a lengthy statement in response to the report this is just a part of it forty three failings are identified in operation midland the principal errors were to believe the complainant nick was a credible person for too long to say publicly that the allegations were credible and true to obtain search warrants with flawed and incomplete information andnot to have closed the investigation sooner i accept on behalf of the metropolitan police accountability for these failures as i accept accountability for failures in any of our operations and investigations it is a matter of professional and personal dismay that the suspects in the investigation were pursued for so long when it could have been concluded much earlier i am today issuing a public apology to lord bramall , lady brittan and harvey proctor for the intrusion into their homes and the impact of operation midland on their lives the public identification of suspects compounded the harm of our investigative failures they have all suffered as a result of the investigation and our description of the allegations as credible and true we should not have said this , and we should have tested the credibility of the complainant more rigorously before conducting the searches he goes on to highlight the pressure he says officers were under these investigations and those in operation yewtree many of which led to convictions started at a time when there was significant concern that numerous sexual attacks on children and others had been ignored , including by the metropolitan police in decades gone by even worse were the allegations that abuse had been covered up by the establishment , including the government it was in the context of the creation of an independent inquiry , together with parliamentary and media scrutiny that officers made their judgment i cannot , and do not expect the sympathy of the suspects in these cases but i do believe that it is necessary to understand the pressure on the investigators at this time the report by retired judge sir richard henriques into operation midland says that officers misled a judge to get search warrants and identified 43 failings it says the investigation was riddled with errors , and a complainant will be investigated for attempting to pervert the course of justice the report does not name the complainant but the main allegations that triggered the operation came from a man known as nick five officers , including four detectives and a deputy assistant commissioner , will be referred to the independent police complaints commission for failings in his report , sir richard henriques calls for an inquiry by the ipcc into the false grounds used to get search warrants the met commissioner , sir bernard hogan howe , said he accepted there had been serious failings and that the investigation should have been closed sooner it has been confirmed that the met commissioner , sir bernard hogan howe , has apologised , ahead of publication of the report , to the former conservative mp , harvey proctor , who was one of those investigated by operation midland the head of scotland yard , said he was apologising after significant failings by the met were identified in the report in a letter dated 8 november , hogan howe wrote now that we have received the final version of sir richard henriquess report i am writing to you formally to convey my apologies for the failings by the metropolitan police service that sir richard has identified in the way in which we handled operation midland in which you were a suspect sir richard has concluded , and i accept , that there were significant failings in the way that the operation midland investigation was conducted hogan howe told proctor the approach adopted in believing the complainant at the outset was wrong , and that insufficient attempts were made to test the credibility of the complainant he wrote while it was right that the allegations had to be investigated , the effect of the approach adopted was to unnecessarily prolong the length of the investigation hogan howe also said it was wrong to have searched proctors property , adding for these failings by the mps \( metropolitan police service \) i would like to offer you now an unreserved apology the key questions we are waiting for from the report are could the met have concluded their investigation sooner \? what does it say about the credibility of nick , the main accuser \? was the met right to investigate his claims for as long as it did , could have it been done sooner \? what does henriques make of nicks credibility \? could the met and maybe prosecutors have been quicker to assess that his testimony would not be enough to get a case to court \? were there sufficient grounds for the search warrants detectives obtained \? if henriques is harsh about nicks credibility , the met may experience considerable difficulty on this point what doers henriques say about a policy that police should believe victims of sexual assault , unless evidence to the contrary emerges \? does henriques support sir bernard hogan howes call for anonymity for suspects in sexual abuse and rape cases \? how high in the met does blame go dac steve rodhouse was in day to day control , but his overall boss was assistant commissioner pat gallen who is close to hogan howe if hogan howe had not already announced his intention to retire by february 2017 , would the pressure after the report have been such that he would have been forced out \? do the victims of operation midland and their families have any confidence in the met \? the media are gathering at a location in south london for the release of the report on a board stating the mets values is a slogan we will learn from experience and find ways to be even better also we will build trust by listening and responding the bbcs home affairs correspondent , danny shaw , reports that the former tory mp harvey proctor , who was one of those wrongfully accused of being part of a vip paedophile ring , has received an apology from the met police commissioner danny shaw \( dannyshawbbc \) sir bernard hogan howe is reported

secretary , leon brittan , and former tory mp harvey proctor were involved in a westminster paedophile ring is expected to make difficult reading for the force all of the accused denied the allegations and were subsequently cleared of any involvement without any arrests having ever been made operation midland , which cost 2m and was based on the claims by a lone complainant known as nick , closed in march amid widespread criticism and calls for the met police commissioner , bernard hogan howe , to resign hogan howe ordered retired high court judge sir richard henriques to conduct an inquiry into the operation after an outcry over police actions and decision making in the case , which saw officers obtain warrants to raid the homes of suspects and search their possessions there have already been complaints that the full report will not be published with the met citing the need to withhold confidential and sensitive information proctor has accused the police of a cover up , demanding that the report be released in full brittans widow , lady brittan , and proctor have also criticised the decision to publish the findings on us election day proctor said they have chosen this date deliberately as a pr campaign , as part of their pr campaign to cover up the disaster that was operation midland after the reports publication , hogan howe will be holding a press conference

impartiality lies at the very heart of good journalism avoiding bias is something on which respectable media outlets pride themselves this is laudable , as robust debate is vital for a healthy media and , by extension , an informed society but when the weight of scientific evidence points incontrovertibly one direction , doggedly reporting both sides equally can result in misleading coverage the bbc provided a high profile example of this in 2011 , coming in for harsh criticism in a trust report which singled out their undue attention to marginal opinion on the subject of man made climate change , among other issues despite the overwhelming scientific evidence that human activity is driving climate change , the report found that several bbc shows fell victim to an over rigid application of editorial guidelines on impartiality , resulting in far too much airtime for climate change deniers a follow up report published in 2014 concluded that this key conclusion still resonates today this situation , known as false balance , arises when journalists present opposing view points as being more equal than the evidence allows but when the evidence for a position is virtually incontrovertible , it is profoundly mistaken to treat a conflicting view as equal and opposite by default with respect to man made climate change , the bbc is far from the only outlet skewing their coverage in the name of balance , and global coverage on climate science remains exceptionally off kilter with the scientific consensus part of the problem is that good science reporting requires a keen understanding of scientific method and the importance of evidence in the absence of this , dubious views can perpetuate in 1998 , andrew wakefield held a press conference , claiming a link between autism and the mmr vaccine these allegations received scant attention from dedicated science journalists , who were familiar with anti vaccination tropes and acutely aware of the paucity of evidence for wakefields claims anti mmr activists instead targeted their stories at non science journalists , selling them as human interest pieces this strategy was devastatingly effective as author and academic ben goldacre recounts , a staggering 10 of science stories in 2002 were mmr related , with over 80 of these pieces penned by non science journalists in goldacres words suddenly we were getting comment and advice on complex matters of immunology and epidemiology from people who would more usually have been telling us about a funny thing that happened with the au pair on the way to a dinner party editors and writers who lacked knowledge of the requisite science fell into a default assumption that two mutually opposed views must have equal merit but the lack of evidence for such ominous claims was still rather telling , and investigative journalist brian deer began to scrutinise wakefield deers work eventually exposed financial conflicts of interest and unethical conduct , and in time wakefields mmr claims were exposed as false since then , a wealth of data has continued to show the mmr vaccine to be completely safe the consequences of the needless panic , however , were anything but faced with conflicting reports and unable to gauge their respective veracity , parents opted to not vaccine their children , with deadly results and an on going resurgence of measles worldwide none of this is intended to pin the blame for these deleterious consequences on journalists and media outlets alone , but the fact that anti vaccine activists could exploit the ideal of impartiality is a worrying one the assumption that good journalism requires mutually opposed views to be treated as equally valid simply doesnt hold when the overwhelming weight of evidence points resolutely in one directionit does however require a certain amount of expertise to gauge this , and for media outlets discerning between valid science and pseudoscience can be a difficult task journalists are under tremendous pressure to produce engaging copy , with tight deadlines one way of reducing false balance and poor reportage is to put scientific experts in direct contact with those covering the story , and organisations such as the science media centre and sense about science have had considerable success in such endeavours i strongly recommend that scientists register their expertise with these groups to help stem the tide of misinformation scientific public engagement is helpful , but the question of when and how to engage is rife with complications i encountered this recently , when an irish radio station asked me to discuss the anti vaccine documentary vaxxed with its star the aforementioned andrew wakefield the producer claimed a rival broadcaster had offered him a slot with a sympathetic host and no counterpoint , and that there was strong local public pressure for him to appear i grudgingly agreed to provide a counter , with the caveat that i would be allowed articulate why giving him a platform to air discredited views was itself unethical the experience was a frustrating one , predictably generating more heat than light this is the crux of the issue with false balance no matter how noble the intention of media outlets , presenting science and pseudoscience in an adversarial format gives a false impression that an issue is scientifically contentious worse again , it gives free rein for dubious motivations to masquerade as scientific opinion whether the issue is vaccination , climate change , alt med or anything else , presenting an evidence free belief as being on equal footing with an established scientific understanding is corrosive to public understanding i asked scientist , author and broadcaster simon singh for his take on this unfortunate trend , and in his view such media requests are as time wasting as they are inept every situation is different , but i am increasingly declining interviews about , say , homeopathy , because it is not my job to provide false balance and thereby justify bad journalism most recently a bbc local radio station wanted to have a jolly chat about cupping in light of its use by olympic athletes i declined , because the piece was inevitably going to be \( a \) simon says it is rubbish , \( b \) cupping therapists says it works for some people , \( c \) patient says it worked for them , \( d \) hosts says that opinion is divided , but isnt it interesting , and \( e \) a series of callers ring in with their tales of cupping miracles i dont want to be part of that sort of journalism it neednt be this way , however it is entirely possible for media outlets to cover publicly contentious topics in an informative and responsible manner the bbc has quite admirably now given its reporters training on how to avoid false balance and present complex and contentious science , pointing out that science coverage does not simply lie in reflecting a wide range of views but depends on the varying degree of prominence \( due weight \) such views should be given part of the disconnect is that there can be a wide gulf between the scientific consensus and public opinion , with broadcasters resorting to false balance to appease their audience but rather than default to adversarial white noise , media outlets might benefit from framing such issues in context as a discussion as an example of this , i was recently a radio guest with dr ciara kelly , discussing the controversy over the hpv vaccine rather than enforce a contrived debate scenario , dr kelly and her producers explained to listeners why it they were opting to avoid false balance , whilst still tackling peoples fears the result of this was , in my view , an informative dialogue that explored misconceptions whilst putting them firmly in scientific context when the science is relatively clear cut , this kind of approach is orders of magnitude better than conjuring up a pointless debate , as it gives an audience an understanding of the evidence base these views are built upon with such an approach , it is possible to cover dissenting views too , and to explore why these are not scientifically accepted this is far more constructive and understandable than the default paradigm of two talking heads shouting one another down media outlets have an important role to play in conveying vital information and view points , pushing a standard for fact checking and quality control that may be lacking in more fragmented modern media but engaging in false balance undermines this strength and risks giving debunked or dangerous fringe views an air of legitimacy and the oxygen of publicity and ultimately , such sophism leaves us all more divided and less informed topicssciencenotes

until recently , black friday was the must do shopping event for british retailers keen to cash in on the mass of frenzied shoppers looking for a bargain but the chinese version singles day , held on 11 november \( or 11 11 \) and created to celebrate single people is gathering pace , potentially presenting a bigger opportunity for british retailers than its us counterpart the sheer scale of the market 11 28bn was spent on singles day in 2015 combined with the acute chinese appetite for british goods , has opened up a significant new sales avenue last year , topshop saw its sales surge by over 900 compared to singles day in 2014 these results clearly indicate how impactful this online calendar moment has become , and as a key focus market for the brand we see 11 11 as a great way to raise brand awareness and conversion in china , says a topshop spokesperson topshop is not alone in seeing the annual event as a chance to gain a foothold in the chinese market more british retailers are cashing in on the worlds biggest online event , says jason yu , general manager of kantar worldpanel china using e commerce as a way to enter the market is relatively low risk approach and they can understand better the appetite of the chinese consumers and learn how to operate in china without substantial investment in opening stores alibaba group , the e commerce giant which trademarked the term 11 11 and made singles day synonymous with people treating themselves to gifts , last year recorded sales of 9 4bn during the 24 hour event meifang chen , international business development at alibaba group , echoes yus thoughts if a british retailer wants to enter the thriving chinese market and engage with its consumers , 11 11 delivers both excellent product accessibility for consumers and massive exposure for brands cashing in on the shopping bonanzait is an approach taken by waitrose , which partnered with chinese marketing and logistics specialist avenue 51 to start exporting to china in april this year , selling through the royal mail shop on chinas tmall although weve had a modest introduction into the market , the potential for waitrose in china is huge , says nigel roberts , waitrose b2b growth and development manager singles day is a big occasion for consumers and businesses in china and has the potential to give the products we offer more exposure and provide another opportunity to test demand for our brand waitrose has already expanded its product offering from 30 items to more than 50 on tmall , and its first singles day will doubtless provide more valuable insight into what tickles the fancy of chinese consumers chen says part of the success of singles day comes from the diversity of products on offer last years 11 11 broke eight product sale world records these included selling 10 1m litres of milk , 3 1m mobile handsets , 1 1m watches and 643 , 964 televisions it is certainly all embracing consumer healthcare start up make a dent ventures \( mad ventures \) sells tint , its teeth whitening product , to chinese consumers via tmall mark curry , founder and director at mad ventures says singles day will act as both a great launch pad to showcase tint to the chinese market and as an opportunity to drive trial of the new product curry was formerly a senior buyer at boots , which participated in black friday with huge success , but he acknowledges the potential of singles day to eclipse the event in importance it is common knowledge that black friday is now the highest grossing sales day in the uk , but this may get superseded by singles day because the concept of gifting feels a lot more meaningful than an arbitrary sales day building awarenessyu also believes singles day will gain the edge on black friday , in part because more british retailers are beginning to sell their wares via tmall according to kantar worldpanel , approximately 50 of chinese consumers already shop in the e commerce stores , and given that singles day presents an enormous opportunity for retailers to present their offers to the chinese shopper , we believe eventually it will become a bigger opportunity , though it may take years for british retailers to build more online awareness a key point is knowing what to discount and by how much during the event independent british jewellery brand lily charmed works with avenue 51 and began trading in china over two years ago it is also gearing up for its first singles day director jonathan lee says the company will heavily discount its range to ensure a decent share of voice among all the other discounts available on that day rightly or wrongly , consumers are not only searching for but expect deep discounts so you have to give them what they want , says lee unlike any other country , its only because of the sheer scale of the chinese market that we can offer such discounts others , such as multi website retailer the hut group , which has been investing in the asian market for over two years and has participated in singles day before , will be running offers including 40 off haircare and up to 30 off skincare wing chan , group marketing director at the hut group says the company has previously seen massive spikes on singles day in china and expects to see at least double the sales on beauty products compared to last year the holland barrett franchise is also confident the company began trading on tmall a few months before singles day last year , generating close to 0 5m in online and offline sales during the event it is hoping to hit the 1m mark this year with alibaba alone racking up sales of 9bn on singles day in 2015 , up 60 on 2014 , its likely that revenues this year will rocket once again this year attracting international brands the pickings could be rich for british retailers going forward chen points out that singles day is bigger than the entire black friday weekend , including cyber monday , and says the increase in the number of international brands joining has been significant , with dyson coming on board in 2014 and macys , hugo boss and united biscuits joining the event in 2015 he attributes some of its success to the growth in technology in contrast , many black friday opportunities are concentrated on the high street , which is not always convenient for those just wanting to shop from home , on their mobile or from more rural areas indeed , figures from worldpay have shown that the total value of transactions made on uk cards on singles day grew 251 year on year in 2015 , while the volume of transactions was up by 307 , suggesting that singles day is gaining traction among uk shoppers too curry has high hopes this year and next year could be a real blue touchpaper moment for 11 11 with uk brands and retailers who are china focused so watch out black friday topicsmedia tech networkdigital businessblack fridayalibabaretail industrymarketing prsponsored featuresshare on facebookshare on twittershare

an opposition dominated senate committee has recommended attorney general george brandis be censured for misleading the parliament when he said he consulted former solicitor general justin gleeson

goodnight the lnp senator barry osullivan is speaking on the gleeson report he rejects mckims point about the production of documents , suggesting he has tried to get documents in the past from other departments we not going to take a lecture off you guys on the standards of senior officers who are paid pretty significant money osullivan goes through the revelation from justin gleeson that he had a conversation with labors mark dreyfus during the campaign then somehow former family first senator bob day is raised osullivan says tersely to the labor benches that senator day would buy and sell any one of you and is a much better man than you then it is all over the greens senator nick mckim , a member of the committee , has outlined his concerns with the gleeson matter mckim is particularly concerned at the lack of access to the attorney generals documents he says arguably , the government is wilfully obstructing the senate mckim goes to this point , contained within the report , over access to documents the committee has sought access to any documents and correspondence which would clarify the nature of any consultation that occurred with the solicitor general it has made requests for information from the attorney generals department \( the department \) that are relevant to the terms of reference this includes an order for the department to produce documents , sent on 18 october 2016 the department has advised the committee that it has provided relevant documents to the attorney general , and that these are still being considered with a view to the attorney general making a claim of public interest immunity the committee is concerned that the attorney general has only been prepared to provide documents that could in some way be construed to substantiate the assertion that the direction was substantively discussed at the meeting on 30 november 2016 , despite other participants contradicting this claim the committee has not been provided with any of the documents it has asked for pertaining to the direction in his submission , the attorney general refers to handwritten meeting notes taken by his staff , which merely refer to the process of obtaining advice , as defined by the direction and guidance note no documents \( which the committee understands exist \) have been produced to substantiate the actual consultation process and drafting of the directionmckim wants a senate select committee created to assess whether they are reasonable claims it is time for the senate to stand up and be counted because we are being treated by contempt by the government mckim says he is talking to labor and other senators about the issue he gives no indication whether he has the numbers for the committee the opposition and greens dominated the senate committee so there is always a dissenting report from government members government senators say the inquiry set up by labor destroyed the career of the solicitor general this is from the dissenting report during the course of the inquiry , government members came to the conclusion that the position of the solicitor general had become untenable the solicitor generals subsequent decision to resign was , in the view of government members of the committee , commendable and perhaps an unavoidable consequence of the public inquiry government members regret that this inquiry , set up by the labor party to attack senator the hon george brandis , attorney general of the commonwealth of australia \( the attorney general \) , has in the end destroyed the career of the solicitor general who was himself appointed by the previous labor administration government members of the committee are concerned that the majority on the committee have used the senate committee process , and thereby the taxpayers indulgence , to pursue a partisan political agenda recommendation 1that the senate disallow the amendment to the direction or the attorney general withdraw it immediately , and that the guidance note be revised accordingly recommendation 2 that the attorney general provide , within three sitting days , an explanation to the senate responding to the matters raised in this report recommendation 3 that the senate censure the attorney general for misleading the parliament and failing to discharge his duties as attorney general appropriately senator ian macdonald is criticising

chair louise pratt , has told the senate that the attorney general is unfit to hold office as she tabled the report into the justin gleeson matter the senate committee report calls for senate to censure brandis after his failure to consult with the former solicitor general justin gleeson on a direction that the sg must gain consent before providing advice to other government departments \( this post has been amended \) the nationals leader and deputy pm , barnaby joyce , is blaming labors for the backpackers tax , which is highly confusing because as i have said previously , this was a proposal that emanated from the 2015 abbott budget labor revel in the problems , they revel in the intrigue , they revel in creating chaos they know full well what their objective is barnaby joyce \( barnaby joyce \) aussie fruit pickers will pay more tax than any backpacker from overseas under the shorten lambie one nation pact auspol agchatoz pic twitter com gp4of4oy49november 8 , 2016joyces tweet is even more confusing when you consider the numbers original backpacker tax 13 but with tax free threshold with differences for resident \( for tax purposes \) and non residents tony abbott and joe hockeys original proposed tax in 2015 32 5 scott morrisons revised package in september 19 revised labor announcement today 10 5 the greens have announced they will move their own amendments to the backpacker tax bill which seeks to tax backpackers at the same rate as australians the greens senator peter whish wilson has been consistent on not wanting change on the tax as opposed to labor , which opposed but without stating its alternative position but without the numbers , the greens amendment will not pass so the greens will support the crossbench labor amendment for a 10 5 backpacker tax the treasurer , scott morrison , has said if the bill is amended , the government will knock it off in the lower house which means it will be status quo or will it \? morrison says in the absence of the changes , the default tax will be 32 5 which was what the abbott government originally proposed in 2015 \( where it all started \) whish wilson was claiming the win , no matter what happens the greens have led on this issue we were the first party to oppose the backpacker tax we were the only one to take a costed policy to the election we were the ones who discovered legislation was required and that the automatic default is not 32 5 now the default position of the tax is complicated the key thing to remember is that though the abbott government originally proposed the tax in 2015 , this has been argued about ever since no backpacker legislation has passed the house since then that means there is no change to the existing position which means some backpackers will continue to qualify as residents for tax purposes , getting a lesser rate and some will continue to qualify as non residents , getting a higher rate whish wilson barnaby joyce is talking bulldust that a default rate of 32 5 will start on january 1 2017 the only thing due to come in on january 1 was the governments law if their legislation passed both houses of parliament if the legislation fails to pass then the status quo remains unchanged , that is some backpackers are treated as residents , and some are not tasmanian farmers , at an individual level , have told me they want this bill dead they will never trust the government again barnaby joyce did not even visit tasmania during this debate he has done nothing to fix the mess his government created no props opposition deputy leader tanya plibersek

for the past month , while the attention of the world has been fixed on every dramatic twist in the us presidential election , the renewal of armed conflict between india and pakistan has barely touched the headlines in the past few weeks , the two nuclear states have , between them , killed two dozen civilians and injured scores of others in exchanges of artillery fire across the disputed border known as the line of control that divides kashmir into parts controlled by india and pakistan the latest flare up in the long running war of attrition between the two countries comes on the heels of a bloody summer of protest and repression in kashmir that has now been erased from memory by the banging of war drums in delhi and islamabad since july , when the killing of a young militant leader sparked a furious civilian uprising across the kashmir valley , the indian state has responded with singular ruthlessness , killing more than 90 people most shocking of all has been the breaking up of demonstrations with non lethal pellet ammunition , which has blinded hundreds of kashmiri civilians in four months , 17 , 000 adults and children have been injured , nearly five thousand have been arrested , and an entire population spent the summer under the longest curfew in the history of curfews in kashmir all this has been quickly forgotten in the past two months on 18 september , a small group of jihadi fighters , widely believed to have come from pakistan , staged a commando raid on an indian army camp near the northern kashmir town of uri , killing 19 indian soldiers the deadliest attack on indian security forces in kashmir in two decades indian politicians quickly blamed pakistan , which the countrys home minister described as a terrorist state , while pakistani leaders made the implausible claim that india had staged the attack itself to distract from the protests in kashmir the indian prime minister , narendra modi , who came into office promising to take a harder line with pakistan , announced that those behind this despicable attack will not go unpunished at the end of september , india retaliated with what it called a surgical strike against alleged militant camps in pakistan controlled territory , which , according to an army statement , caused significant damage to terrorists pakistan denied the attack ever took place claiming that there had been nothing more than the usual exchange of fire across the border meanwhile , an ugly war of words continued to escalate in tv news studios , some of which were refurbished as pop up war rooms since then , the relationship between the two countries , which is at the best of times characterised by varying degrees of hate depending upon the political temperature in kashmir has soured to the point where both are now suddenly finding spies in each others diplomatic missions a tit for tat nearly every day , on tv , on social media , in ambassadorial corps even in the realm of culture , where india has effectively banned pakistani actors from working in bollywood , and pakistan has banned the screening of indian films in cinemas according to recent reports , civilians caught in the crossfire have been evacuated , hundreds of schools shut , and local residents pressed into service to ferry supplies to troops stationed high in the himalayas as always , the victims of the artillery duels have been the civilians living on either side of a border that did not exist until the middle of the 20th century in the war of words that has followed the bloodshed in uri , the brutal oppression of protest in kashmir has been largely ignored indeed , the indian state , aided by a near militaristic tv news media , has used the uri attack and its aftermath to cover up a surge of killings , maimings and blindings in one of the longest running conflicts in the world this is the story of the bloody summer that kashmiris have endured and of why they will not forget it on 8 july , a militant rebel leader , burhan wani , was shot dead by indian armed forces and police in a remote kashmir village the killing sparked a series of spontaneous demonstrations and protests , which , in a matter of days , turned into a reinvigorated popular revolt against indias dominion over this disputed state wanis path to militancy began in another one of kashmirs bloody summers back in 2010 , when indian security forces killed 120 protesters wani , who was then 15 years old , is said to have joined a small group of homegrown militants after he and his brother were humiliated and abused by indian soldiers over the next few years , he became kashmirs most famous militant commander , and acquired something of a cult following among young kashmiris , who saw him as a symbol of resistance against indian occupation wani was a new breed of militant unlike the first generation of kashmir separatist fighters in the early 1990s , he did not cross over into pakistan he didnt use a nom de guerre , and he amassed a huge following on social media , where he issued brazen challenges to the indian state it was therefore no surprise that thousands attended wanis funeral in his hometown of tral or that those who could not get there organised their own funeral services across the kashmir valley as kashmiris took to the streets , police and paramilitaries were deployed in large numbers across the region thousands of young protesters charged at the armed forces with stones and slogans demanding freedom indian forces responded with lethal effect , firing bullets , cs gas , and metal pellets into the crowds in less than four days , nearly 50 people were killed and thousands injured more people took to the streets to protest against these killings , and the indian forces and kashmiri police killed and injured more of them a cycle of protests connected to the funerals of those protesters were , in turn , fired upon , resulting in yet more killings and blindings by the end of july , india was faced with a full scale popular revolt in kashmir facebook twitter pinterest an indian policeman aims a pellet gun towards kashmiri protesters in srinagar in july composite syed shahriyar syed shahriyar nurphoto via getty imagesthe most recent figures put the number of dead at 94 , including a young kashmiri academic who was battered to death by indian soldiers , and an 11 year old boy , whose body , riddled with hundreds of pellets , was found on the outskirts of srinagar , the joint capital of kashmir , in mid september shockingly , more than 500 people , most of them young , were shot in the face with the pump action pellet guns that the indian forces routinely use to suppress protests these weapons discharge hundreds of small metal pellets , or birdshot , capable of piercing the eye as the uprising continued , the armed forces , by their own admission , fired nearly 4 , 000 cartridges at stone throwing demonstrators , crowds protesting against police brutality , and even onlookers this means that they sent , by one recent estimate , 1 3m metal balls hurtling towards public gatherings predominantly made up of young unarmed people children as young as four and five now have multiple pellets in their retinas , blinding them partially , or fully , for life at the start of september , doctors at kashmirs main hospital reported that on average , one person had their eyes ruptured by pellets every other hour since 9 july it means 12 eye surgeries per day , one doctor told a local newspaper it is shocking on 12 july , the fourth day of the protests , the state government , which is run by a controversial coalition between modis hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party \( bjp \) and a local ally , the peoples democratic party \( pdp \) , finally issued its first official statement on the use of the so called non lethal pellet guns a spokesperson for the government , representing the pdp , described its position to the media we disapprove of it but we will have to persist with this necessary evil till we find a non lethal alternative there is no recorded instance of a modern democracy systematically and willfully shooting at people to blind themat first , the statement appeared as a typical soundbite , the sort of thing that officials must compose and recite with studied ambiguity for the press the government version , as its known but i was struck by its cavalier defence of state violence and brutalisation it was obvious that this was not the spokesmans personal view it was a clear articulation of the intent of the indian state in kashmir this was an unprecedented expression of state violence there is no other recorded instance of a modern democracy systematically and wilfully shooting at people to blind them at the end of august , according to data obtained by one of indias national newspapers , nearly 6 , 000 civilians had been injured , and at least 972 of them had suffered injuries to their eyes according to official records at smhs , the main hospital in srinagar , 570 people sought treatment after their eyeballs were ruptured by metal pellets ophthalmologists at the hospital performed more surgeries in three days from 10 to 12 july than they had in the past three years many of the wounded were protesters , but not all not one of them deserved to be robbed of their sight by 14 august , as india prepared to celebrate its independence day , kashmir was under a near total blackout i briefly lost touch with my parents , as the state cut off all telephones and the internet i was reminded , once again , of the lines of the late kashmiri american poet agha shahid ali , which still echo 20 years after he wrote them the city from where no news can come is now so visible in its curfewed night that the worst is precise just before the shutdown , i had talked to my youngest sister over whatsapp she was a little girl in the 90s , when kashmir witnessed the first rebellion against indian rule id never imagined my three year old child would see everything that i saw as a child , she told me rebellion against indias rule over kashmir is neither new nor surprising and the brutality of the states response is equally familiar in the 1990s , india came down hard on a widespread uprising in the kashmir valley killing , torturing , disappearing , and imprisoning thousands some estimates put the number of people killed since 1989 at 70 , 000 some 8 , 000 non combatants are thought to have been disappeared , and 6 , 000 are believed to have been buried in mass graves human rights reports have identified thousands of cases of torture , including shocking techniques such as simulated drowning , striping flesh with razor blades and piping petrol into anuses according to a 2012 report in the guardian , government documents revealed that one group of security agents had lopped off the limbs of suspects and fed prisoners with their own flesh in southern kashmir , four girls , aged between 13 and 18 , were shot in their faces as recently as last weekyears later , very little has changed in the indian states response to the demand for self determination from the people of kashmir in a matter of four to five weeks this summer , indian troops , with a clear mandate to be unsparing , wounded over 10 , 000 people one of the youngest five year old zohra was admitted to a hospital in srinagar with lacerations to her abdomen and legs fourteen year old insha was in the family kitchen when a swarm of pellets pierced her face she has lost vision in both eyes in southern kashmir , four girls , aged between 13 and 18 , were shot in their faces last week the prognosis for the youngest of these , 13 year old ifra jan , is not good , a doctor said it is doubtful that these little girls posed a threat to the military force estimated at 700 , 000 soldiers and police stationed in kashmir as the showers of metal pellets were unleashed upon protesters , bystanders and homebound schoolchildren , hospitals in kashmir began to resemble scenes from the great wars of the 20th century rows of beds with blindfolded boys and girls on them , parents waiting anxiously , doctors and paramedics in attendance around the clock on occasion , police and spies also infiltrated the wards to compile profiles of the injured , in order to place them under surveillance after their release the wounded were brought in by the dozen , like birds in the hunting season all of this was incomprehensible , even to longtime observers of violence in kashmir one of the largest military forces on the planet could not be waging a war against seeing perhaps a few aberrations , a crowd control tactic gone woefully wrong one hoped so , but the numbers kept piling up , eye after mutilated eye popping up on the screens of phones and computers , as journalists began to publish their reports as none of the powerful men who run kashmir from delhi expressed qualms about the blinding of children , it became clear that in its hubris the indian state had decided that snatching vision from a few hundred young people was a fair price to pay for keeping kashmir in check perhaps itself blinded by a strain of arrogance peculiar to occupying powers , it continued to pummel a subject population into submission the phrase raqs e bismil , used in mystic persian poetry to denote the passion of the devoted , translates as the dance of the wounded in the slaughterhouse of the kashmir valley , even the grievously injured with pellet scarred eyes or broken limbs have remained defiant we have even got some patients whose guts are perforated and they are asking when they can go back and join the protests , one doctor reported two and a half decades of rebellion in kashmir have hardened the indifference of indias political and intellectual classes to the human cost of the countrys repressive tactics in the valley amid rising nationalist fervour , any sense of the basic rights of a suffering population has been eroded or vanished entirely the hostility now appears to be total , unbridgeable , and for those on the receiving end , unbearable powerful tv studios urge the state to be more aggressively macho , while actively suppressing or distorting news from kashmir one prominent newspaper ran an online poll about the continued use of the pellets that had wounded and blinded so many kashmiris a clear majority voted in support eminent columnists speak calmly of the need for harsh love toward civilian protesters to rationalise the states ruthless response and the twitter account for a government initiative , digital india , posted a poem calling for the army to murder kashmiris until they surrender as images from kashmir began to circulate on the internet despite frequent attempts to block communications , including at least one midnight raid on the offices of a local newspaper , and a blanket ban on one english daily , the kashmir reader pictures of the wounded emerged by the dozen , many of them looking as though they had ruptured fruits where their eyes should have been on the second day of the protests , more than 50 people were admitted to the main hospital in srinagar medics and parents were desperate to save vision in at least one eye for those who had been shot , attempting to extract the jagged and irregular pellets this only happens in a war like situation , a surgeon sent from delhi later said facebook twitter pinterest a kashmiri protester who was shot by indian security forces in srinagar , in july 2016 photograph tauseef mustafa afp getty imagesthe protocol for the use of these crowd control weapons is to aim at the legs to disperse demonstrators but it seems that the paramilitaries and the police have been deliberately firing into faces some may only have minor wounds , some will suffer limited loss of vision , some will lose one eye , some both , and some will be impaired for life , but the pitiless assault on protesting adolescents forces us to ask one question is the indian state happy to blind a generation \? it is inconceivable that policy mandarins in delhi or their advisers in kashmir could be unaware of the destructive power of non lethal weapons earlier this year , the international network of civil liberties organisations and physicians for human rights published a report titled lethal in disguise pellet rounds , it stated , cause an indiscriminate spray of ammunition that spreads widely and cannot be aimed they , therefore , are not only likely to be lethal at close range , but are likely to be inaccurate and indiscriminate at longer ranges , even those recommended by manufacturers for safety many countries have banned police from using ammunition meant for hunting animals the multidirectional spray of pellets was designed to catch prey in flight but many countries have continued to use them as a means of force to control civilian demonstrators in israel , security forces often deploy lethal and non lethal ammunition against palestinian protesters , and crowd control weapons have blinded at least five young palestinians in the last two years the use of rubber bullets by police was banned in the spanish region of catalonia in 2014 , after at least seven people were blinded by them on the streets of barcelona in 2011 , months after the uprising in tahrir square that toppled an egyptian dictator , a young police lieutenant , mohamed el shenawy , became infamous for firing pellets into the eyes of protesters against egypts military government his exemplary skill at blinding civilians earned him the nickname the eye sniper , and his notoriety as a symbol of ongoing state brutality eventually led to a three year jail sentence will india prosecute its own eye snipers \? or outlaw the use of these weapons \? in the countrys present hypernationalist mood , every kind of other is a suspicious figure , a ready made scapegoat for any failure that befalls the politicians determined to make india great again the secessionist kashmiri , the impure dalit , the traitorous beef eating muslim , the woman who speaks her mind , the anti national journalist , the dissenting writer any voices who might call for a ban on these non lethal guns are certain to be ignored to the contrary , ministers and police , and their demagogues and cheerleaders , have continued to advocate the use of both pellets and bullets against protesting crowds in kashmir unruly cattle must be reined in at any cost because kashmiris have become accustomed to the violence inflicted on them as they are to the indifference of the world when pellets were first sprayed at protesters in the heated summer of 2010 , most people processed this as nothing more than a new misfortune just another element of the war in kashmir if one were to draw a diagram of the assaults inflicted on kashmiri bodies over the decades , hardly a single part would remain unmarked in the 1990s , when the violence was at its worst , the eyes were spared now they seem to have become a favourite target the victims of such tactics , consciously and not , cultivate reserves of tolerance for pain , but also a capacity to remember i remember , too i grew up amid the darkness of the late 80s and early 90s i remember that most of us teenagers innately understood that being abused , slapped , or beaten with batons and rifle butts by an indian trooper was a bit of a joke when compared to the horrors that others endured in the dungeons of kashmir \( one of the most notorious torture centres , papa ii a colonial era building on the banks of dal lake in srinagar was refurbished and redecorated , and served as the stately residence of the late pro india politician mufti mohammad sayeed his daughter , as the current chief minister , now presides over the brutalisation of another generation of kashmiri youth \) i remember that the war in those years taught us to treat corpses and shrouds as reminders of passing time , which was measured for the young in massacres and assassinations i recall , too , the tragic rupture in the kashmiri body politic when an atmosphere of fear and loathing forced out the kashmiri pandits a hindu minority that had cohabited with muslim kashmiris for centuries in an almost overnight exodus , many of them targeted and killed by separatist militants sanjay tickoo , who runs an organisation for the welfare of kashmiri hindus , says over the past 20 years , we estimate that 650 pandits were killed in the valley i dont know what happened to sunil and rajesh , my childhood mates from the primary school we all attended near an idyllic river bend in verinag in south kashmir growing up , i experienced a brutal , bleak time , as indias response to the uprising included the grotesque policy of catch and kill , under which combatants and non combatants alike were dispatched in summary executions or tortured to death and yet , i dont remember such a vengeful assault on ordinary people as we are seeing now buoyed by a belligerent nationalist at the helm in delhi , the security forces on the ground perhaps feel emboldened to unleash a more widespread cruelty in 2013 , an affecting photo essay by journalist zahid rafiq in the new york times documented a few of the stories of those who had been blinded by pellets it remains a grim testament to the darkness in kashmir even though the blindings at that time , amid hundreds dead , did not attract too much notice at the time , hardly any indian civil society group or human rights organisation thought fit to speak up about such a wicked crime the wanton demonisation of the kashmiri muslim , a project that some media organisations in india take particular pleasure in , was perhaps fully realised even then it certainly is now , when thousands , fed on a daily diet of nationalist fury , take to social media to celebrate the killing , maiming , and blinding of young kashmiris that the government in kashmir a collection of local elites comprising career politicians , technocrats , and chancers loyal to india considers pellet guns a necessary evil , might make us feel grateful at least they acknowledge the evil part perhaps to address their own guilty consciences a few days into this summers uprising , the kashmir observer , a local english language daily , reported that the local government had deployed a fleet of brand new ambulances to securely ferry visiting vips to picnic spots in the valley this was while protesters were being killed , maimed and blinded and while the ambulances carrying them to hospitals were coming under fire from security forces facebook twitter pinterest victims of police shooting who have been blinded in one or both eyes in hospital in srinagar photograph yawar nazir getty imagesan ophthalmologist at the main hospital in kashmir told the indian express in july for the first time the foreign bodies are irregular edged , which causes more damage once it strikes the eye irregular , sharp edges \? i had assumed that the pellets fired at protesters like rubber or plastic bullets , were round discoid things it turns out that there exist different kinds of pellets , and in 2016 , some indian forces are using the jagged variety which inflict greater damage to flesh and eyes alike , and which doctors say is far more difficult to remove how did india get here \? how is it all right for a constitutionally democratic and secular , modern nation to blind scores of civilians in a region it controls \? not an authoritarian state , not a crackpot dictatorship , not a rogue nation or warlord outside of legal and ethical commitments to international statutes , but a democratic country , a member of the comity of nations how are indias leaders , thinkers and its thundering televised custodians of public and private morality , all untroubled by the sight of a child whose heart has been penetrated by metal pellets \? this is the kind of cruelty we expect from assads syria , not the worlds largest democracy historically , such an inhuman response to an uprising to mass dissent has been the province of empires and tyrants a modern democratic nation rarely unleashes such violence , except upon victims whom it does not regard as its own people it is quite clear that for india and its rulers , kashmiris have been subjects and not citizens for as long as kashmiris have refused indian rule you do not shower projectiles that target eyes and viscera on a people you consider your own in snatching away the vision of kashmiri children , the indian state has decisively announced that it has only one message with a hubris derived from its might and military dominion over kashmir , the state convinces itself that it has the power to inflict blindness in no time , then , it blinds itself too to the character of democracy that is its central founding principle the harsh repression of kashmiri protests , the nobel prize winning indian economist amartya sen declared in july , is the biggest blot on indias democracy it is hard not to see this mood of brutality connected , at the very least in its tenor , to the larger register of extreme violence , by both state and non state actors , that has come to be normalised over the last couple of decades there has been some dissent in india journalists , activists , even some politicians , have written elegiac columns and essays on the savage response to the rebellion in kashmir they have implored their government to cease the brutality , to be kind , and to talk to kashmiris but it appears that the indian government , clouded by a newfound chauvinism and a hunger for votes , is in no mood to listen to the nations voices of sanity in august , only a few days after indian forces in srinagar murdered a 21 year old cash machine watchman by firing 300 pellets into his body from close range , the indian prime minister used a speech on kashmir to taunt pakistan over its own atrocities against separatists in the province of balochistan , where the pakistani army has inflicted forced disappearances and summary executions on the baloch people pakistan forgets that it bombs its own citizens using fighter planes , he said but modi chose to forget that his own forces had , by then , killed scores of young kashmiris we need to interrogate the circumstances that have led to the deliberate blinding of hundreds of young people at the hands of armed forces in kashmir , before this too is forgotten as some of the wounded have begun to heal , some accounts have suggested that the damage may have been less severe than initially feared that perhaps many of those who underwent eye surgery will regain some vision in at least one eye this might make one feel better relieved that its not worse but there is something wrong with that kind of moral reckoning , akin to the indian security officials who continue to maintain that pellet guns must be used because the alternative would be worse one security official told an indian news website that pellet guns had actually saved lives it is unfortunate that there have been eye injuries but the pellets are less lethal than getting hit by bullets so we might ask what if the armed forces stationed in kashmir had fired live bullets instead \? but this doesnt compute in 2016 , the security forces have already killed nearly 100 civilians is that an acceptable number \? in a year or two , as india , and pakistan , continue to harp on their territorialist positions , there will arrive a season of surface calm a return to normalcy in kashmir people will shop , marry off their children , and celebrate an uncurfewed eid they will also welcome tourists in their blighted land but when this new generation of freedom seekers grows up into blinded , maimed , adulthood , they will carry our guilt ridden consciences for us they will remember more than they have seen they will certainly remember the country that did this to them follow the long read on twitter at gdnlongread , or sign up to the long read weekly email here topicsthe long readindiapakistanfeaturesshare

it was while gareth southgate was looking ahead to englands game against scotland and reiterating the importance of emotional control in these fixtures that his mind went back to euro 96 and the kind of sketch that probably felt perfectly normal then bearing in mind the identity of the man around whom the story revolves those were the days when paul gascoignes team mates felt a collective sense of duty to help , in the carefully chosen words of southgate , calm him down or to be brutal about it , get him out of our hair for a couple of hours and one ploy was to send him fishing in the afternoon with david seaman , knowing the only occasion when englands most talented player could be guaranteed to sit still was if he had a fishing rod in his hand on the day of england scotland it was out of the question and gascoigne , a rangers player at the time , was hyped to the point his team mates were starting to think he might spontaneously combust im not sure emotional control was his style , southgate recalls , with an element of unmistakable fondness so , bryan robson made him a little fishing rod with a line dangling from it not a real fishing rod but something they created out of the stuff they found in the medical skip and there was gazza , sitting on the side of the big bath in the wembley dressing rooms , with his fishing rod pretend fishing , because that was the only time he ever relaxed jack wilshere back in england squad to face scotland and spain read moregod knows what he was actually fishing for but presumably whatever might have been floating in the bath , which was probably more pleasant before the game than it was after funny , but that was the sort of bizarre thing that would go on when gazza was around it did the trick , bearing in mind gascoignes contribution to a 2 0 victory included an expertly manoeuvred up and over to put colin hendry on his backside followed by a right footed volley past andy goram for what was later voted the goal of the century in one television poll the celebration was not bad either , lying on the ground while his team mates squirted drink into his mouth to re enact one of the more infamous nights involving englands players only he could have done that celebration , southgate says i mean , how does it even cross your mind \? oh yes , got to do the dentists chair that goal will feature prominently in the video montage the football association has put together , on southgates request , for englands players before fridays world cup qualifier and an occasion the caretaker manager is absolutely determined will not pass with the opposition having a better understanding of the sporting enmity that exists between the sides one story southgate recalled was of the wembley crowd cheering patrick kluiverts consolation goal in englands 4 1 defeat of holland , their next match at euro 96 after the scotland win , on the basis it meant the dutch qualified on goal difference at the expense of scotland the video regales englands finest moments against the old enemy , going back to the 1930s , with an unapologetic bias that means the players will not be getting a history lesson about jim baxters ball control or the scottish invasion of wembley , 1977 it does not , southgate confirmed , feature any keepy uppies or anybody sitting on the crossbars southgate , it may be no surprise to learn , was not among the players who accompanied gascoigne to a hong kong club , having been given a free night by terry venables , and were photographed , in various states of disrepair , strapped into a leather chair while tequila was poured down their throats the man now angling to become englands full time manager is willing to admit it was a close call that was the night terry had cut the squad , southgate says he had left out ugo ehiogu , wisey dennis wise , peter beardsley and a couple of others rob lee and jason wilcox i had got pally with stuart pearce and i said to him were having a night out with the lads he said nah , in my experience of england if you go out for a drink its as if nobody has ever drunk before in their lives my advice is swerve it id just got in the squad sometimes advice like that is good twenty years on southgate bristled slightly when it was put to him that england , post euro 2016 , and scotland , 18 years since competing in a major tournament , had never met with the two teams at a lower ebb history sometimes paints a slightly rosier picture of the past , he countered there have been tournaments in the past when we havent qualified there have been matches and tournaments , when i was growing up , with defeats that were considered the worst ever i was with gordon taylor the chief executive of the professional footballers association on saturday and he said i can remember 1950 , losing to america , and everybody was saying the same thing then maybe we colour the past with a different view but i dont think englands games in the past were always as great as our memories think they were the point remains that the qualifier is one england dare not lose on the back of a traumatic few months and , however much southgate tried to argue his own position was immaterial , it is a huge occasion for him personally given the common perception that he will be offered the job full time on the back of a strong performance the last game at wembley was an incredible atmosphere , probably as good as ive seen at the new wembley , he said , recalling englands 3 2 win in august 2013 its a special fixture these are the games you want to be involved in and , if i go back to my days working as a tv broadcaster , the viewing figures will be five times that of a premier league game what more could you want \? southgate intends to tell his players they have a chance to make some history or to play in a game that people will remember forever and thats incredibly powerful i want them to be aware of that and pitch it in the right way so the performance level is right and we are not over emotional we have to be cool headed , he added but its the oldest international fixture , with all the history between the two countries , and , if the players dont understand that already , and im pretty sure they do well make sure this week they are aware of it i want the players to understand the importance of the shirt we have to embrace the emotion of the occasion scotlands mentality for a game like this will be unquestionable their spirit will be unquestionable well have to better that and outplay them topicsenglandgareth southgatepaul gascoigneworld cup 2018 qualifiersscotlandworld cupfeaturesshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content

you dont have to be drunk to fall over even gina rinehart fell over and the photographers were there to capture it , just as they captured her pre fall showing off her curves in a white dress on the internet , we are invited to scrutinise and judge these degraded women the comments section below is a good place to throw metaphorical rotten fruit im sure there were lots of men getting trolleyed but type drunk people at the melbourne cup into a search engine and the majority of pictures will be of women where are the blokes \? where is the equal opportunity shaming \? as a society , were used to the drunk man at the races , at the football , at the pub but the drunk woman still holds our attention , and in some quarters is still blamed for any crime committed against her while intoxicated complicated feelings are unleashed french philosopher rene girard was writing about societys need for a scapegoat 40 years ago the scapegoat is a representative who must be subject to violence in order to restore order out of chaos societies need for somebody to blame is deeply coded he could have been writing about the internet age when he wrote they are all going to gather against the same opponent , they gather speeds and ultimately one victim must be killed and this is what i call the scapegoat we have to have a scapegoat on melbourne cup day because we get off our collective tits and the results can be ugly its good to have someone who is perhaps in worse shape than us , whom we can hide behind on melbourne cup day we create an environment all around the nation that is conducive to people getting really drunk the melbourne cup bin rider told the daily mail , that free champagne on the day had contributed to her inebriated state the birdcage the posh enclosure at the melbourne cup is a drunks dream , with an unlimited open bar and specialty cocktails if you are with friends trackside or in the carpark , it is considered good hospitality to have an inexhaustible supply of alcohol you can be a thousand miles away from the melbourne cup and alcohol is still flowing we create these conditions for drunkenness and then expect women to self regulate and act like something from the 1950s in the ladies lounge sipping quietly on their shandies well that horse has bolted if drunk women at the races so shocks us , then shouldnt we dig deeper and ask why it is that we celebrate in this way \? and why it is that we drink too much and why is booze and sport intertwined and why are we never really taught to drink properly \? it happens when you are young behind the hall at the school disco quickly and roughly , a shot of this mixed with a slug of that , down the hatch before teacher comes , drink it all up , dance , then fall down that is how it goes that and the fake ids and the parties when the parents are away almost half of young australian adults binge drink every month , report says read morethen , before we know it , we are unleashed on the world and taught that drinking on australia day , anzac day , any national holiday , and while watching any kind of sport , is part of what makes us australian in our grown up heels and cocktail dresses , in our fancy hats and the plastic glass filled with something in the midday sun , we have no idea how to regulate ourselves we ride bins , and forget to eat , and have one more for horse and one more for the road some of us get in fights many of us , men and women , need a lesson in boozing properly , particularly now , as party season kicks in in earnest and the type of behaviour we see at the melbourne cup \( and much worse \) is on the streets , at taxi ranks , in pubs and restaurants and clubs the big department stores are filled with stylists to advise on the hats what we need is a booze consultant until then , all we have is the tabloids holding up the dirty mirror they are a regulator , our judge and jury , our court of final appeal and as long as we feel the urge to shame and punish , theyll give us what we want topicswomenopinionmelbourne cupcommentshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
donald trump lies like he tweets erratically , at all hours , sometimes in malice and sometimes in self contradiction , and sometimes without any apparent purpose at all the guardian has catalogued more than 100 falsehoods made by the republican nominee over the last 150 days , and sorted them according to theme hillary clinton has been caught in more than a dozen falsehoods of her own , for instance about her email practices and her past support for the trans pacific partnership but clinton often makes her falsehoods in dense legalese , making them hard to pin a motive on many could as easily be errors as lies , careless exaggeration or deliberately misleading claims trump , on the other hand , will say wrong when he hears his own quotes his own lawyers met him in pairs to counteract his lying , court documents show he has invented false statistics , fictional videos and sex tapes and a nonexistent man named john miller to talk about his sex life months of fact checking , however , reveal methods and , whether he means to or not , trumps guide to success through lying fbi director new hillary clinton emails show no criminal wrongdoing read moredegrade and destroyfor decades , trump has described america and its leaders in apocalyptic terms he thought ronald reagan weak and a disaster , he lambasted george hw bush and bill clintons policies , and after supporting george w bushs iraq invasion , quickly dismissed that war as a mess in trumps world , crime is always rising \( the national rate fell for decades \) , and african americans are living in hell \( they are not \) migrants are flooding in \( more mexicans are leaving than arriving \) , and they bring violence \( there is no evidence that they do \) civilian and military leaders are always clueless \( trump received five deferments from vietnam \) , except when they love him we have no idea who refugees or undocumented migrants are , and they take our jobs \( we know very well who they are they include his wife \) trumps vision of the us has been , for decades , one of dystopia he even described the 1990s as a crisis worse than the great depression but amid all this desolation trump gains three things he fuels doubt and fear , leaving people vulnerable he denigrates his opposition en masse , blaming the world on them and he raises himself up above the nonexistent wreckage embiggen big leaguelike a man who once took a joke about the size of his hands too hard , trump spends a lot of time trying to look as large as possible , from his never proven 10bn worth \( forbes estimates 3 7bn \) to crowds at his rallies and his success in meaningless internet polls this self inflation is pierced throughout by paperwork in march , the guardian found that trump valued a new york golf course at 50m in one document and at 1 4m in a court filing \( he sued to pay lower taxes \) on thursday , the new york times reported similarly huge discrepancies in his reported income the washington post has shown repeatedly that trumps boasts of charitable giving have virtually nothing behind them he has also falsely bragged of endorsements from federal agencies and claimed many environmental awards , and tried the ploy in reverse he has called the millions his father gave him as a small loan and portrayed his 916m loss in 1995 as an example of smart tax avoidance this sort of exaggeration is a common sales technique overstate the value of a product to make it more attractive and assume it will be bargained downward in february trump confessed everythings negotiable about his statements , then quickly said building a wall on the southern border was not negotiable the equivalent of a liar saying everything i say is false , but not that shout at the messenger facebook twitter pinterest donald trump on hillary clinton and the fbi shes protectedwhenever in doubt , trump attacks what he calls the dishonest media , accusing reporters \( without evidence \) of bias , inaccuracy and a failure to show the size of his rallies he ignores that reporters quote him extensively , call his campaign for comment , interview his supporters , his rivals campaign and independent voters and experts he often cites news stories about clinton , and even praised fact checkers in a presidential debate for catching her in a falsehood at every rally , trump says the cameras refuse to show his audience , even though his campaign forces cameras to stay within a small pen , where they pan to show the crowd as anyone at his rallies or watching online can see only one camera at each event stays fixed on trump the shared pool camera , whose footage networks share and which stays on trump so as not to miss his speech last week , nbcs katy tur , a target for criticism from the podium , noted that trump has joked in private with reporters about how he understands how the pool camera works this is a shtick that he does to rile up his base , she said , to give them an excuse for polls that might not be in his favor , to give them an excuse to berate someone thats not donald trump trumps scorched earth insults , like his attacks on other institutions , try to delegitimize authority and leave only himself in its place but while most americans still respect other institutions that trump has demeaned , the press was vulnerable decades of cable news punditry had already diminished opinion of the press , and the internet has sapped major newspapers of their powers to compete with openly partisan sites , fake news and social media networks trump tried to fill the vacuum conspiracy smoke , fire not requiredtrumps most famous false conspiracy , about barack obamas birthplace and who started birtherism , is only one of many there was ted cruzs father and jfks assassin , drawn from a tabloid with ties to trump the climate change hoax that was invented by the chinese the muslims who cheered september 11 the vaccines that cause autism the miss universe sex tape the political correctness of san bernardino the secret muslim president and his secret terror agenda and the antisemitism tinged plot of bankers and the media this category includes what the toronto stars daniel dale calls pointless lies , the oddest of trumps falsehoods these claims include an invented letter from the nfl about debates , the authorship of the poem the snake , and that frank sinatra didnt hate my way his entire life trump himself seems to get lost in the intrigue , and sometimes slips into a dadaist jumble of anti clinton allusions whitewater , cattle futures , benghazi , uranium , blumenthal , bleaching 33 , 000 emails that sound sinister when put together this is apparently the desired effect a haze of noxious sentiment , even if no one has found fire for all that smoke for more than 20 years , journalists and congressional republicans have tried the latter have spent tens of millions of taxpayer dollars investigating the clintons associations and careless email practices but have yet to find criminal conduct arguably trumps worst conspiracy is his insistence that voter fraud has rigged the election , which merges his fringe claims with his attack on institutions no evidence supports the claim of widespread fraud and the decentralized electoral college makes such a conspiracy functionally impossible but the claim gives trump something to blame failure on besides himself like his other conspiracies , it sows doubt and distrust , diminishing the nation so that trump can portray himself as an authority trumps favorite escape from this maze is the phrase theres something going on , which lets trump suggest malevolence , claim ignorance and say nothing of substance at all deny everything facebook twitter pinterest trump ive never used language as bad as jay zs in my lifewhen cornered by his own quotes or something he doesnt know , trump often lies with blunt denials wrong ! or variations of the phrases thats very important or well look into it inside a donald trump rally good people in a feedback loop of paranoia and hate read morehe also tries to wriggle out of uncomfortable situations with this tactic , most notably when he claimed ignorance of david duke , the former ku klux klan leader who has professed approval for his policies , and white supremacists trump had disavowed duke a few days earlier and denounced him in 2000 , but in february he refused to condemn like minded supporters , saying i dont know anything about what youre even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists on the edge of pointless self inflation and denial is trumps fixation with vladimir putin , whom he has claimed to know very well , to have spoken with indirectly and directly , and to have never met and know nothing about trump also falsely insists that putin called him a genius \( putin called him flamboyant \) distortionsnot all trumps falsehoods are exotic like clinton and many career politicians , he sprinkles misleading statistics into speeches , including on the murder rate , african american unemployment , poverty among hispanic americans , the deficit and taxes trump also takes the tactic a step further , condensing whole arguments into outrageous soundbites this is how a conservative argument about military presence in iraq transformed into the claim that obama founded isis and how clintons support for immigration reform became open borders clinton has similarly oversimplified arguments into claims , for instance linking bush era tax cuts to the financial crisis topicsdonald

at a cost of 1bn to put a chill in the air during texas rangers games , it would surely go down as the sports worlds most expensive air conditioning bill voters in the city that is home to the rangers go to the polls on tuesday to decide whether to finance a new major league baseball stadium that would replace a popular facility that is barely two decades old the election raises the question of how much a team is really worth to its community , and whether , just a few days after 102 year old wrigley field basked in the world series spotlight , stadiums are becoming almost as disposable as their corporate naming rights globe life park , then known as the ballpark in arlington , opened in 1994 for less than 200m when a certain george w bush was the clubs managing general partner local taxpayers were on the hook for most of the cost as the ringer pointed out , bush called it a monument to baseball and the team president at the time said it was being built for 100 years it may not last 30 these days the team is emphasising what it lacks air conditioning , a retractable roof and capacity crowds the rangers want to move to a new , smaller , stadium across the street by 2021 , even though eight years remain on their deal to play at globe life the projects cost is estimated at 1bn voters must decide if arlington will contribute 500m through sales , hotel and car rental taxes \( a model used for the current ballpark and the dallas cowboys adjacent home \) with the team responsible for any cost overruns the heat and humidity can undoubtedly be oppressive , and the rangers average attendance this year of 33 , 461 was some 15 , 000 below capacity , even though the team were the runaway winners of the american league west but the park still looks smart and is one of mlbs more visually appealing venues both inside and out , with a design that evokes old time charm and texan touches such as giant stone longhorns on the facade the cowboys play only half a mile away at at t stadium arlington funded about a quarter of that arenas 1 2bn cost the perceived shelf life of stadiums is getting shorter and shorter it used to be that if you had a stadium that wasnt at least 30 or 40 years old you had to be crazy to propose building a new one but now all kinds of teams are proposing that , said neil demause , co author of a book on publicly funded stadiums , field of schemes suddenly the idea of whats considered obsolete has gotten reframed , he said its really just about at what point do you have the chutzpah to demand a new one \? andy prior , media liaison for the save our stadium campaign , expects a close outcome on tuesday last month a wfaa fort worth star telegram poll found respondents were split evenly , with 42 for and 42 against only in texas can 70m on a high school football stadium ever be justified \? read moreim a third generation rangers fan and when i heard the plans on the news way back in the beginning of may , early june , i was really flabbergasted , he said weve had the texas rangers here in arlington for 45 years now , its always been played outdoors , theres absolutely nothing wrong with the current ballpark , its one of the best in the major leagues the cult of the new stadium is not restricted to baseball the georgia dome has twice hosted the super bowl since it opened in 1992 but next year it is scheduled to be reduced to rubble , the site destined to be a parking lot for mercedes benz stadium , the new home of the atlanta falcons nfl franchise in general these days , demause said , i think theres a little bit more awareness and a little bit more public opposition just because some of the demands are getting so outrageous because the timespans so short i think the fact that the arlington vote is expected to be close is significant because this is a city that has voted before with no problem for stadium subsidies and its a campaign where the rangers and the stadium advocates are outspending the opponents tremendously changing fan expectations , the growth in luxury seating and the success of the new retro oriole park at camden yards in the early 90s helped inspire a ballpark construction boom only 10 current ballparks are older than the rangers of the 30 major league stadiums , half have been built this millennium if we include suntrust park , the atlanta braves new digs from 2017 they are leaving turner field after only 20 years , also for a smaller venue am i happy that theyre going to have a new ballpark \? well , if it makes them bigger , better and more competitive , sure but i was stunned when i heard that a deal had been cut fairly quickly and behind the scenes for a ballpark to be built in arlington years and years and years before the current deal ends , said michael cramer , the rangers president from 2002 04 structure is good , viewing lines are good , theres plenty of room for concessions and places to sell merchandise , plenty of suites it had all of the features that you never would have found in the old breed of ballparks , he said to say theyre doing it to be competitive because its hot in texas \? wait a minute , they didnt know it was hot in texas in 1993 \? still , cramer understands arlingtons desperation to ensure the club stays in the city and believes it will be able to absorb the costs if i were a voter i would vote for this , he said arlingtons mayor , jeff williams , is spearheading the campaign for a yes vote on 8 november he argues that the plan does not call for new taxes detractors call this claim misleading , since taxes that would have ceased would instead continue at issue is not only fans perspiration tolerance levels but the fear that a no will encourage the team to leave , dealing a blow to the local economy and the citys prestige williams told the texas tribune that if the rangers go elsewhere , arlington will lose out on 77m in annual economic impact and 2 5 million visitors per year in a metropolitan area of about seven million people over an area of roughly 9 , 000 square miles larger than the state of new jersey there is no shortage of space or ambitious municipalities the rangers and dallas have flirted with the possibility of joining the citys nhl and nba sides downtown , though without any indications the relationship might get serious but arlington , a functional place of 390 , 000 people between dallas and fort worth , lacks tourist appeal beyond its sports teams and an amusement park it is understandable that the city is so eager to keep a team it has hosted since 1972 , and also that many locals would balk at the cost according to census figures from 2014 , 17 of residents live in poverty , 25 are without health insurance and the median household income is 53 , 055 critics argue that the city should have more pressing priorities than subsidising a private sports business co owned by a billionaire its not like dallas had a deal on the table and arlington had to come and match it , demause said all the rangers owners really had to do is sort of hint at , well , dallas is sitting right there and arlingtons response was well , how about half a billion dollars , does that sound good \? weve seen this time and time again where cities make huge offers just based on the vague threat of the team could go somewhere else this tactic is hardly unique to the lone star state as the arizona republic reported , the arizona diamondbacks recently threatened to leave chase field opened in 1998 in downtown phoenix and air conditioned in a fierce dispute between the team and its county over who should pay for repairs projected to cost 187m over 12 years its not just stadiums that cost a fortune though that sum is 19m less than the diamondbacks agreed to pay star pitcher zack greinke over six years when they signed him last december topicstexas rangerssportblogmlbbaseballtexasus sportsfeaturesshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content

the selling of the american self , and its dream of a better future , began with the declaration of independence and founding father benjamin franklin , who once observed that god helps them that help themselves selling and salesmanship pervade american life and literature \( theodore dreiser \) , \( sinclair lewis \) , \( eugene oneill \) , \( arthur miller \) , and \( david mamet \) exactly 80 years after first appeared , it comes as no surprise to find a distorted , and sickeningly corrupt , version of dale carnegies homespun and inspirational self help manual flourishing in the presidential campaign of donald trump , bestselling author of trump , indeed , continues actively to extol a later carnegie fan \( norman vincent peale , author of \) for his contribution to the american way of life whatever the outcome of tuesday 8 november , theres no doubt that the ecstatic selling of american greatness will remain part of the national psychodrama for years to come trumps diehard supporters are an apt reminder that , for many americans , the pursuit of happiness is unsatisfying , success painfully elusive , and failure shameful and or infuriating the hunger for a better future remains a constant feature of the american sociopolitical landscape in the depths of the great depression , it was this desperate need that carnegie addressed in carnegies message was to inspire go getting americans to look on the bright side , and sell themselves better by the time of carnegies death in 1955 , more than 5m copies had been sold , the book had been translated into more than 30 languages , and its title had passed into the language today , my paperback reprint from vermilion \( an imprint of random house uk \) boasts over 16m copies sold as jay parini , a devout student of carnegies work , has noted between 1989 , when soviet communism failed and 1997 , went through no fewer than 68 editions in a russian translation ideas of success usually make for a bestseller carnegie saw himself as an enabler , quoting herbert spencer 'the great aim of education is not knowledge but action'carnegie himself , born in 1888 , the same year as ts eliot , embodied the american idea of self or re invention he grew up the son of a failed missouri farmer named carnagey ambitious young dale changed the spelling of his name more closely to associate himself with the great steel baron , andrew carnegie , a late 19th century household name , and embarked on a career as a salesman while also attempting to make a future in the theatre as an actor , auditioning successfully for the american academy of dramatic arts theatre life was hard it was at this stage , he wrote , that the dreams i had nourished back in my college days turned into nightmares but he didnt give up , and it was from this pit of despair and disappointment that he conceived the idea of giving courses in public speaking paraphrasing rw emerson , a deeply influential american we shall meet later , he would say , do the thing that you fear to do , and the death of fear is absolutely certain by 1916 , he was in a position to rent carnegie hall and lecture to full houses about his self help techniques his first book , , followed in 1926 , and led inexorably through his growing stateswide audience to the key to this new iteration of his optimistic message was its 12 principles \( which ranged from no 1 , the only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it , to no 12 , throw down a challenge , via no 6 , let the other person do a great deal of the talking \) each principle was deftly illustrated by carnegies well chosen examples of influential and successful americans in action carnegie left nothing to chance to convince his readers of his wisdom , he went to the top of american society in the 1930s i personally interviewed scores of successful people , he writes , some of them world famous inventors like marconi and edison political leaders like franklin d roosevelt movie stars like clark gable and mary pickford and tried to discover the techniques they used in human relations he saw himself as an enabler , quoting herbert spencer the great aim of education is not knowledge but action this , he declared , was an action book as donald trump knows only too well , to hook the uncommitted , any good salesmans pitch must subtly invite the buyer to risk leaving his or her comfort zone , and take a chance carnegie was not afraid to connect his message to new ideas early on in his pitch for a mass audience , carnegie mixed a simple american credo with radical european thought he writes sigmund freud said that everything you and i do springs from two motives the sex urge and the desire to be great carnegie also traded in folksy wisdom , in the manner of his idol , abraham lincoln his first chapter , if you want to gather honey , dont kick over the beehive , encourages a positive , warm and optimistic attitude in dealings with others he argues against attacking or criticising people that will only make them aggressive towards you after that , successive chapters deal with how to get people to act as you want them to how to make people like you how to convince people of your arguments and finally , how to be a leader \( making people glad to do what you want \) all this was packaged into carnegies systematic method , an important key to his popular success the measure of carnegies extraordinary achievement can be seen in his many imitators the most immediate was norman vincent peale whose keynote sentence could have been written by carnegie if you feel that you are defeated and have lost confidence in your ability to win , sit down , take a piece of paper and make a list , not of the factors that are against you , but of those that are for you forget self help we 're programmed for change read moreunlike carnegie , peale was that now familiar american figure a charismatic preacher trading in a crude , faith based optimism the officiating priest at the marble collegiate church in manhattan for more than half a century , peale first began to promote positive thinking on the radio with a programme entitled the latest edition of declares this book could change your life , and specifically offers to enable everyone to enjoy confidence , success and joy here , in about 300 pages , is a succinct expression of the american dream in its purest form from the outset , like carnegie , peale identifies squarely with the common man his book , he declares , was written for the plain people of this world , of whom certainly i am one with a sly allusion to abraham lincolns origins a straight lift from carnegie he then makes a classic assertion of white american solidarity i was born and reared in humble midwestern circumstances in a dedicated christian home the everyday people of this land are my own kind whom i know and love and believe in with great faith then follows peales kicker when any one of them lets god have charge of his life the power and glory are amazingly demonstrated what peale offered was not merely spiritual counselling \( over the years , plenty of other preachers had already done that \) , but a system of simple procedures that would generate untold peace of mind , improved health and a never ceasing flow of energy extolling the common sense of his system , he goes on this book makes no pretence to literary excellence , nor does it seek to demonstrate any unusual scholarship on my part this is simply a practical , direct action , personal improvement manual after peale , the other american titles that owe a huge debt to carnegie include by ken blanchard and spencer johnson \( 1982 \) by stephen r covey \( 1989 \) and by joel osteen \( 2007 \) from these popular bestsellers , bought by people who probably possess almost no other books , it is only a short step to trumps make america great again dale carnegie has something to answer for a signature sentence charles schwabs personality , his charm , his ability to make people like him , were almost wholly responsible for his extraordinary success and one of the most delightful factors in his personality was his captivating smile three to compare norman vincent peale \( 1952 \) donald trump \( 1987 \) malcolm gladwell \( 2005 \) topicsbooks100 best nonfiction books of all

the investigative journalist gavin macfadyen , who has died aged 76 , was founder director of the centre for investigative journalism in london he set up the cij , which is funded through charitable foundations , in 2003 to address what he saw as a worsening media climate for serious , in depth and critical reporting and , over the following 13 years , established its reputation as one of the pre eminent investigative journalism training institutions in the world gavin intended the cij as a refuge for critically minded journalists who want to do adversarial , public interest journalism he thought that journalists had become accessories to the powerful , rather than acting as a check upon them in his view , journalisms role in a democratic society should be to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable it was not surprising that , in 2010 , when wikileaks began publishing documents on the iraq and afghanistan wars , and then the us state department cables , gavin became a close ally of the group and of its editor and founder , julian assange while many of the institutions that profited from assanges revelations later turned on him , gavin was steadfastly loyal , seeing his role , as always , to stick up for those under fierce attack from powerful forces gavin and his wife susan benn were trustees of the julian assange defence fund , set up to help raise money for assanges legal defence gavins house in london was a salon and refuge for dissidents , journalists and revolutionaries from all over the world people often young , sometimes difficult would stay for long periods and be fed and housed i love it , gavin once told me i come down for breakfast and i dont know who is going to be there he said the previous week that brilliant indian writer arundhati roy had been over with that hollywood actor with good politics john cusack that was typical the cij itself was wonderfully chaotic and breathed with creativity and energy gavin was an arch democrat , completely open to anyone and everyone he wanted to stretch the definition of what an investigative journalist is , to include artists , historians and even architects who use society as their raw material and try to filter information to reveal truth the cij was and remains an open shop born in greeley , colorado , to marion hall , a concert pianist , gavin spent his formative years in hyde park , chicago he never knew his father , and in childhood took his stepfathers surname , macfadyen in the 1960s , he became an activist in the civil rights movement in chicago , he participated in the rainbow beach wade ins of 1961 that challenged segregation on public beaches , and was arrested and jailed while protesting against discriminatory university housing , segregated restaurants and in defence of civil rights activists in the south gavin led a convoy of trucks filled with relief supplies to an embattled civil rights outpost in tennessee on arrival he discovered that police fire had pockmarked the truck with bullet holes , and on returning to chicago he was informed that fbi agents had raided his house in chicago at this time , he met the young bernie sanders , then a student at chicago university , and exposed him to the world of revolutionary leftist politics by working subsequently as a longshoreman in new york , gavin was able to pay for a trip to britain , where he joined the international socialists , living for a time in the home of one of its leading writers , michael kidron he described this as a formative period in developing his political consciousness gavin attended the london school of film technique \( the forerunner to the london film school \) in 1964 , and shortly after graduation he formed an independent collective , chicago films he filmed the 1968 democratic convention in chicago , anti war demonstrations and race riots in detroit , washington dc and harlem for the bbc as he became more interested in marrying his aesthetic commitment to film with his politics , he decided he wanted to make hard hitting investigative documentaries he produced and directed more than 50 documentaries , many for granada televisions world in action , in countries as diverse as ecuador , guyana , south africa , mexico , hong kong , thailand , the ussr , the us , sweden , india and turkey his investigations covered topics including industrial accidents , neo nazi violence in the uk , chinese criminal societies , the history of the cia , watergate , election fraud in guyana , the iraq arms trade , child labour , nuclear proliferation , and frank sinatras connection to organised crime in 1980 gavin left london to work in hollywood he became a close friend of the screenwriter , director and producer michael mann , and was involved in three of his films , as well as motion picture research projects in south east asia and a john frankenheimer film project he joined haskell wexler in nicaragua to make the independent feature latino in 1985 he also appeared as an actor in latino , as well as two other movies , thief \( 1981 \) and ulterior motives \( 1993 \) there was little time for small talk with gavin only the big ideas exercised him he would throw his hands up when he got excited by a devious way of getting a story and shout yes , yes , yes ! followed inevitably by lets do it ! being around gavin for any amount of time made you feel anything was possible and that , eventually , if gavin was around to help , justice and the truth would prevail one approach he favoured in the cause of linking social justice activism and investigative journalism was direct action information gathering for example , chaining yourself outside the offices of a multinational corporation or department of state and staying there until they gave you the information you needed for your story he was unbreakable in his commitment to the oppressed , risked his own life and liberty to stand with them , and saw unspeakable acts of human brutality yet at the same time , none of it had broken down his ability to love and bring joy to those around him his presence lit up any gathering for many journalists , work is simply a job , he once wrote their interest is in lapdog confidences and dining with the powerful those who passionately want to provide a voice for those without one , and who fight hypocrisy and exploitation , are sadly rare gavin not only gave a voice to the voiceless he handed them a megaphone gavin is survived by susan , whom he married in 2010 , his son michael , from a previous marriage , to virginia daum , which ended in divorce , susans three daughters and six grandchildren gavin hall macfadyen , journalist , born 1 january 1940 died 22 october 2016topicsinvestigative

at skys sprawling campus near heathrow , sky newss energetic chief , john ryley , is beaming as he proudly points to the channels new glass box studio , which juts out into thin air a storey above the open plan ground floor atrium we are making the biggest investment since sky news began in 1989 , he says at a time when certain observers say the future of live rolling news is moribund and dead , the glass box is a very good illustration of sky challenging the status quo it is a manifestation of the future of non stop journalism a very good physical embodiment of what we are about the custom built studio also provides a symbol of the contrast in fortunes between ryleys news empire , which he has run for 11 years , and his former employers at the bbc martin baron 'we took donald trump seriously from the beginning' read moreuntil july , when director general tony hall guaranteed its future , speculation had been rife that the bbc news channel might be axed or merged with the bbc world news channel to help find the hundreds of millions in savings the bbc is being forced to make over the next few years does ryley think his counterpart at the bbc , the head of news james harding , should have axed the news channel to help find his divisions 80m share of the savings \? i think competition is good so im pleased we have a competitor , says ryley , after a significant pause daily journalism can be a very tough business i do feel if im honest that over the last 18 months that the bbc news channel has lost a bit of its life and vitality but theyve made a decision that they are putting their editorial focus into their jewels , the bbc radio 4 today programme and the bbc ten oclock news he cant help adding one more dig at auntie , where he began his career as a graduate trainee in the late 1980s , saying he felt the today programme was a little slow on the uptake on the airport attack in brussels this year we were lucky , we had our correspondent alex rossi at the airport at the time which gave us a distinct advantage , he concedes , before adding the bbc has fantastic journalists but they have to cut their costs accordingly sky has made its own job cuts , with a number of senior journalists and on screen presenters leaving , including sunrises eamonn holmes , andrew wilson , lorna dunkley , samantha simmonds and jeremy thompson , who retired saying it was time to make space for young talent is there a hint of ageism creeping into a sky which , like most media organisations , is looking at a younger , cheaper , digital future \? we have to sometimes as leaders of news organisations make tough choices about where we invest our money , ryley says the quality of our journalism is really important and ive decided to invest our money in specialist journalists we are not at all ageist he points to the likes of dermot murnaghan , adam boulton and kay burley who are about his age \( 54 \) or older so would he be interested in mark austin \( 58 \) , who after 30 years is leaving itv news , where ryley worked prior to joining sky in the mid 1990s \? avoiding any direct comment on austins departure , let alone the possibility of getting him on board , ryley cagily keeps his options open we are always on the lookout for bright talent , young or old he thinks recent changes at itv news , which began a little over a year ago with tom bradbys elevation to news at ten anchor , were needed given sky has become what he believes is the second biggest newsbrand in the uk over the past 10 years i quite admired itn and the news at ten team at itv for trying to do something different , he says and i think tom bradby and his people tried to do things differently and therefore i applaud it a visit to see the glass box is an interesting experience it puts you in the position of an observer of those working on floors above and below , yet also exposes those within to the outside world , much like a fish in an aquarium during breaks , presenters and visitors need to be wary of the occasional low orbit loops of the cameras that circle the set from above one presenter jokes that the steel frames holding the cameras could do with rubber protectors ryley characterises the creation of the new studio as part of a wider reinvention of sky news which also includes getting our act together with apps and our mobile approach the only way to achieve longevity is to go through renewal , he says ten to 15 years ago people would have thought of sky news as purely and only a breaking news service with big red straps across the bottom of the tv nowadays i feel you need to do much more than that the tv news channel is the backbone , the production core , that generates content for all the different outlets , whether it be mobile , supply to commercial radio or snapchat ryley says people were at first sneery of skys push on to snapchat , but it has become a serious place for news in terms of numbers 3 million people accessed sky content on snapchat discover on the morning of the brexit vote he says that by the end of this year sky will have achieved 1bn views on social media , and on mobile weekly viewing is 5 1m , up 18 year on year when pressed , he admits that like most publishers a relationship with web giants such as facebook can be a two edged sword , an attractive distribution platform but with questionable revenue returns for example , he says sky supplies facebook live content three times a day but it is early days on how much revenue will come of it i think it has yet to play out , he says we along with other news organisations will need to take a hard think about it he also comes armed with a bit of news sky news has found a new studio to service the city after it was forced out of londons gherkin this year the operation , home to the weekday evening business show ian king live , was moved to skys westminster location at millbank studios , which some observed might make it trickier to attract some city guests sky has struck a deal with none other than news corporation , controlled by rupert murdoch \( who through fox is skys biggest shareholder \) , to set up a full studio in the so called baby shard ryley says that despite the landlord being family the building is home to the times , sunday times , the sun and dow jones sky paid pretty good money to get in there the proximity to the murdoch owned news organisations brings us to one of the big questions hanging over the long term future of sky news before fox was forced to give up on its attempt to take full control in 2011 , plans had been hatched to spin off the loss making channel to address concerns about media pluralitydoes ryley worry about what happens if rumours of fox mounting another takeover bid for sky turn out to be true \? im an optimist , he says i dont worry about the future of sky news sky and fox have a very strong history of investing in news rupert murdoch has invested in journalism at the times for a very long time , and invested in journalism at sky so i dont worry about the future cvage 54education eastbourne college , 1975 1980 durham university , 1981 1984career bbc news graduate trainee , 1987 1989producer , bbc nine oclock news , 1989producer , itn news at ten , 1989 1992itn assistant programme editor , 1992 1995 sky news executive producer , 1995 2000sky news executive editor , 2000 2006 head of sky news , 2006 present topicssky newsmedia interviewsky plctv newstelevision industryinterviewsshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content

picture a world where no one ever posts anything on social media about nights out or evenings slobbing in front of the tv instead they share details about work meetings , or recommendations for accounting apps why \? because exhibiting exactly this sort of conscientious behaviour on social media could potentially shave hundreds of pounds off your insurance premiums , it emerged this week motor insurer admiral announced it was going to use social media to analyse the personalities of first time drivers if their facebook posts indicated they had personality traits admiral could link to safer driving habits and fewer claims , annual discounts of up to 350 would be offered via the insurers new firstcarquote product but just before launch the insurer was forced into a u turn facebook said the product would break its terms and conditions , which prohibits the use of data obtained from its service to make decisions about eligibility following discussions with facebook , the product is launching with reduced functionality , an admiral spokesperson announced it will still , however , ask for access to drivers public facebook profiles before it provides them with a quotation , so customers can share some information to secure a faster , simpler and discounted quote this is the new world of big data and insurance , where social media websites are vast sources of valuable information just waiting to be plundered insurers have been recruiting data scientists , and i think it is very likely they are already using information from social media websites to set premiums , says gary frost , managing director of 51zero , a software consultancy specialising in data gathering and analysis for financial services firms if theyre not , theyre missing a trick it provides extra detail and information which can help improve their risk scoring insurers can access all the data that is posted publicly on twitter and facebook , frost says you cant buy access to a private social media profile , but insurers can potentially find out all the public information these sites store about you , such as who you are friends with , your public updates , public pages you have liked and posts you have publicly recommended or shared i think it is very likely insurers are already using information from social media to set premiumsgary frost , data analystso if you buy a cherry bomb sport exhaust to soup up your vauxhall corsa and talk about it on social media , classification and clustering technology is likely to place your profile with a community of higher risk consumers any lifestyle information the insurer can glean about you from any source for example , your sexual orientation , race , religion , predilections , estimated consumption of alcohol , cigarettes and even saturated fat when out socialising could potentially be used to reassess your application and increase or decrease the cost of your premiums mining other informationits not just your social media data that insurers are using , however insurers are always looking for new ways of creating an advantage for themselves , so they can win more customers and be more efficient , says simon mcculloch , director of insurance for comparethemarket they will use all the information they can gather about you to offer more accurate pricing and personalise your quotes even seemingly innocuous information can potentially be linked to a higher or lower claims ratio , and therefore affect your premium this includes the web browser you use to buy your policy , the time of day and month of the year you do so , and whether you use a comparison site each time you apply for insurance , regardless of how you pay for your policy , your insurer is likely to soft search your credit record there are very significant correlations between likely claims and credit scores , says kevin roberts , director at legal general better credit scores generally result in fewer claims we dont know why consumers shouldnt assume they can control the data they share insurers will look for any previous contact and use that to make a judgment about a new application for example , if you visit two comparison websites in quick succession to request quotes , all the insurers which offered you quotes the first time will be able to match your profile when you visit the second site and because they know theyve quoted for you previously , they may take a dim view of any changes to what you disclose , such as your annual mileage id expect that to have a negative impact on your premium it may be seen as indicative of dishonest behaviour , says mcculloch similarly , if you already hold a policy with an insurer , the answers you gave when you first applied may be analysed in relation to the new application for example , any disclosures about high value ticket items or burglaries on your home policy may be considered in relation to a motor policy insurers have also found a correlation between callouts on motor breakdown and home emergency policies and claims on motor and home insurance products , says roberts so if you are loyal to a breakdown service and make few callouts , you may be offered a cheaper insurance policy by any provider with access to that data aa members tend to be a better risk for us , says ian crowder , spokesperson for the aas insurance arm we know them so can offer discounts they tend on the whole to care for their vehicles and thus are more likely to recognise risks when it comes to motoring the aa is running a 10 , 000 driver trial of connected cars \( vehicles connected to the internet \) to , it says , identify faults before a breakdown this will involve installing a dongle , which will allow it to track drivers behaviour , including speeding , cornering , acceleration , braking and high rev incidents , and to map what happens where this could inform insurers of potential risk , not just about behaviours but the type of roads that are driven on and when , crowder says when you apply for insurance , firms will already attempt to analyse your whereabouts and the places you travel to companies can obtain lots of information about postcodes from third party sources , says toni vitale , director at law firm addleshaw goddard for example , he says , if you provide your car insurer with details of your home and work postcodes , it may map out the most likely route between the two , and then take into account the crime rates of the postcodes you will be passing through each day like the aa , supermarkets also factor in the information theyve gathered about you when deciding your premiums when you apply for a car , home or pet insurance quote from tesco bank , it looks for a clubcard number linked to your household its privacy policy tells customers that tesco stores limited make this clubcard information \( including information about purchases \) available to us to enable us to generate a risk score for your household , which is used to calculate the level of clubcard discount tesco bank and its insurers may offer you aa motorists tend to care for their vehicles and thus are more likely to recognise risks when it comes to motoringian crowder , aa insurancetesco bank says the most important factors it considers are not your individual transactions , but the length of time you have been shopping at tesco and the amounts you spend some clubcard holders will pay 25 less than other people , although tesco says most are typically offered discounts of 10 15 we only use clubcard data to reduce the cost of our policies for customers , a spokesperson says similarly , if youre a nectar card holder sainsburys says it will look at the size of your spend and how frequently you shop at its stores , and offer you up to 15 off its home and car insurance premiums information about your individual purchases is available , but we dont use it to make any decisions , a spokesperson says data discriminationjim killock of the open rights group is sceptical about the rewards on offer in return for this data i think insurers are tempting people to share their data by saying they might get a discount , but in fact theyve just priced everybody else up , he says an insurers goal is to maximise its profits , after all , and now they are using unrelated information to make judgments about people we are not aware precisely how far these judgments might go for example , a machine might decide theres a correlation between someones ethnic background and the claims data , and start pricing people out of insurance in this way , using unrelated data may introduce racial biases and discriminate against people without good reason in september , the financial conduct authority identified that the use of big data had the potential to leave some consumers worse off , and said it was concerned that it could enhance an insurers ability to identify ways to charge certain customers more the increasing amounts of data from a wider range of sources , alongside sophisticated analytical tools , might lead to the use of reasons other than risk and cost in pricing becoming more prevalent , said christopher woolard , the fcas director of strategy and competition to assess how different pricing factors are used , we will look at pricing practices in a limited number of firms in the retail general insurance sector this year manage your profiles check a sites terms and conditions , says toni vitale from addleshaw goddard know what you are signing up to and how they are going to share your information with other companies dont fill your facebook page with fast cars or show that youre an adrenalin junkie keep your profile as private as possible , says kevin pratt of moneysupermarket

in a landmark legal decision last thursday , the high court upheld a legal challenge brought against the government by gina miller and others , and ruled the government cannot use the royal prerogative to trigger article 50 of the lisbon treaty , and so formally commence the process to leave the eu , without parliamentary approval the courts judgment means that the process must be subject to parliamentary control and oversight importantly \( especially in the light of some recent media comments \) , the court stressed that this is purely a question of law and that the court is not concerned with , and does not express any view about , the merits of leaving the eu that is a political consideration in brief , the case arose because article 50 allows the uk to withdraw from the eu in accordance with its own constitutional requirements but there was disagreement as to what the uk constitution actually requires the government argued that it could use royal prerogative powers \( namely , that residue of monarchical authority now exercised by ministers \) to authorise the uks withdrawal while it is clear that prerogative powers cover international relations and the conclusion of treaties , it is settled uk constitutional law that an act of parliament in this case the european communities act \( eca \) 1972 cannot be supplanted by the exercise of a prerogative power the court accepted the claimants arguments that , once notice is given under article 50 , some rights under eu law \( as incorporated into domestic law by the eca \) would inevitably be lost on completion of the article 50 process therefore , the government cannot give notice under article 50 without reference to parliament this judgment can be seen as a victory for parliament during the eu referendum , voters were constantly urged to take back control and regain parliamentary sovereignty from the eu yet in what sense is parliament taking back control , if the government is able , using its ancient prerogative powers , to manage the whole eu withdrawal process without any significant parliamentary involvement \? that would be extremely undemocratic and democracy is what we are told the eu referendum was about every uk national has been endowed with rights under eu law some of these will vanish on triggering article 50furthermore , the courts judgment makes clear that the exclusion of parliament in the process is not only undemocratic , it is illegal there is a wealth of case law supporting the claimants case , some of it dating back to the 17th century and the english civil wars those wars , and the ejection of two kings during that century , established that parliament is sovereign and that the executive cannot ignore it , where it has no legal authority to do so this judgment makes clear that the government does not have any such legal authority in the context of triggering article 50 however , it must be stressed that the judgment also makes clear the importance of rights in the brexit process much of the judgment concerns legal arguments over the eca , which can seem arcane yet they are of vital importance to every citizen the eu has been described as a new legal order and it is in many important aspects different from ordinary international law one such aspect has been the extent to which it confers rights on individuals through the eca , every uk national has been endowed with rights under eu law rights of free movement and residence in other eu countries , but also many other types of rights , such as employment rights , consumer rights , or rights to information some of these will vanish as a result of triggering article 50 and the withdrawal process the government has said it will transfer some eu law into uk law through a great repeal bill , and then decide in future whether or not to retain it thursdays judgment makes clear that decisions that inevitably remove rights may not be taken by the executive alone parliament must be consulted what are the practical consequences of this judgment \? first , a government spokesperson has said the government will appeal , in which case it will be fast tracked and heard very quickly by the uk supreme court the government might try to change its position , and argue that a notification under article50 could be revoked this would be the opposite of its high court concession that triggering article 50 would inevitably result in the withdrawal of the uk from the eu \( and so lead to loss of individual rights \) at present both government and claimants are treating the triggering of article 50 as the inevitable point when it becomes clear that the eca will be repealed but if it were acknowledged that such a move is reversible , the point would be that , in triggering article 50 byexecutive act , the government would not be subverting statute at that point , it would not be rendering the eca a dead letter , inevitably leading to a loss of rights liz truss defends judiciary after brexit ruling criticism read moresome believe a notification under article50 is revocable but this would involve a question of eu law , and the final answer could only be given by theeuropean court of justice moreover , such a reversal of the governments arguments would be politically risky , as it would amount to acknowledging that the uk might decide not to leave the eu , and that brexit does not mean brexit after all , perhaps not a very likely position for the government to take thursdays ruling is a strong judgment , by a powerful trio of judges including the lord chief justice , and its reasoning looks hard to overturn if the ruling stands , it will be necessary for a bill to be introduced in parliament although it is highly unlikely parliament will vote against triggering article50 , parliament may well seek to impose certain conditions on the government the june referendum resulted in a vote for the uk to leave the eu however , it did not determine the way in which the uk leaves the eu the courts judgment means that the elected parliament will have a role in debating and deciding many matters , rather than their being determined in private by the executive finally , the judgment raises a question of the role of the devolved nations if westminster is to be involved , what about the devolved parliaments \? by constitutional convention , devolved parliaments are asked for their consent when westminster either legislates with regard to devolved matters \( see section 28 \( 8 \) of the scotland act \) or where it legislates to increase or reduce their powers if a bill is introduced allowing article50 to be triggered , would this require legislative consent motions , and , if so , would the devolved nations give their consent \? conflicting answers have been given on this point , and the issue is highly politically charged one thing is clear brexit is constitutionally fascinating , as well as constitutionally problematic it also raises as many difficult questions for our understanding of the british constitution as it does of the uks relationship with the european union topicsbrexitthe observeranalysisshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content

latin americagovernments have often preferred republican presidential candidates because they historically put an emphasis on free trade , but this time , politicians and commentators are lining up to express doubts about donald trump , who has alarmed many with his dismissive comments about latinos , plans to build a wall on the mexican border , and his unpredictable behaviour demtrio magnoli , a sociologist and prominent voice of brazils new right , said a trump victory would be a geopolitical earthquake trump is the closest the us has gotten to fascism you would have an american president that is nationalist and nativist and we would see mass deportations , and a wall being built , which is likely since he will most likely not deport 11 million people he predicted this would force mexico to turn more towards latin america and could upset free trade agreements and hurt economic growth trump is so unpredictable and politically inexperienced we have no idea what he will do , but he seems authoritarian , sexist and contemptuous about latinos , said violeta granera , of the opposition alliance in nicaragua by comparison , hillary clinton is seen as a safe pair of hands who is likely to continue the relatively benign policies of the obama administration carlos lins da silva , a senior consultant for the so paulo research foundation , said us regional policies were unlikely to see a major change , but added the election of trump would at least in the short term cause dramatic impacts on the international system if he puts into practice some of the programmes he is advocating brazil wont come away unscathed for example , if he makes the entrance of muslim people more difficult , builds a wall between mexico and the us , has nato members pay for us defence , encourages japan to have a nuclear bomb , gets tougher on nafta and other free trade deals all of these ideas would have negative consequences for many countries diplomats said they did not expect a major shift in washingtons latin american policy regardless of the outcome hillary clinton knows brazil better than trump , as she has been here before and knows people here , but there will not be any substantial change in relations either way because external relations with south america are a low priority for the us , said rubens barbosa , former brazilian ambassador to washington the country with most at stake may be cuba , which has enjoyed a reconciliation with the us under barack obama former cuban president fidel castro weighed in with an article last month in the newspaper in which he awarded trump the medal of mud , but the old revolutionary also had nothing good to say about the democrats middle easttrump outraged the arab world with his comments on muslim immigration and regional public opinion certainly reflects this a survey of 3 , 017 people in the middle east and north africa found that if they had a vote half would snub both trump and clinton on the fight against islamic state , clinton has pledged to never send troops back to iraq , and ruled out boots on the ground in syria trump has been less specific about his plan to fight isis , but said in march that the us has no choice but to send 20 , 000 to 30 , 000 combat troops to the region in the survey , from the jeddah based daily and pollsters yougov , 46 said the us should send troops to fight isis and collaborate closely with russia on syria the rest did not want a us presence on the ground but did feel that washington should be more involved in the humanitarian efforts for syrian refugees , arm moderate groups and increase air strikes on isis clinton was most popular , with 78 saying she would be the best for the arab world on the candidates policies , arab opinion is much more balanced clintons stance on climate change and us israel policy found strong support in the poll but arabs overwhelmingly back trumps stance on abortion and , ironically perhaps , border controls russiavladimir putin was thrust into an unexpected starring role in this election , and whatever the result , it will please the kremlin that it has been able to cause so much mischief how much of this was down to direct kremlin meddling , we will perhaps never know , although the state medias bias towards trump has been fairly clear most russian analysts believe the us is systemically set up to oppose russia , and while there is an understanding that trump is an unusual candidate , many believe a trump presidency would not change things much other more sober heads are well aware that for all trumps friendly rhetoric , as president he would be a much more unpredictable quantity than clinton , the devil they know to go on the public rhetoric alone , the casual observer would think the russian establishment is banking on trump russian television has been giving airtime to many of trumps claims that the election could be rigged , but this is as much to help discredit the us system in the eyes of viewers as it is sincere backing for trump he has been backed not because of his politics , but because he is the chaos candidate in the same way russia was also keen on brexit even if clinton wins , russia knows that after this divisive campaign , us democracy is in for a period of soul searching which will leave less energy and focus for meeting external threats africaif africa has barely featured in the campaign , then the continent has , in part , returned the compliment but though many experts believe the result may not imply any drastic change in us policies in africa , there is still widespread anxiety and trump has already alienated many , particularly with his apparently racist rhetoric few africans are putting any store on trump if he wins the election , that is if he remembers we exist once hes done with mexicans and illegal immigrants , wrote gitau warigi , in kenyas trumps call for a ban on muslims entering the us received widespread coverage and provoked outrage the somalia based islamic militant group , al shabaab , included a clip of trump proposing the temporary ban in one of its recruiting videos the tycoon does have supporters although a poll in nigeria found that 77 would vote clinton and only 19 trump , while in south africa the proportion was 59 to 15 , some african commentators see trump as an anti establishment candidate of a sort they would welcome one who could disrupt an unjust status quo the world and nations dont reform when they are comfortable they only do so when they are afraid or have been severely injured bring on trump , wrote charles onyango obbo , a kenyan publisher and columnist however , neither candidate has given any real clues to their attitude on africa on trade , there is speculation that trumps support for greater protection of us industries could mean higher tariffs that would damage some african economies , local analysts say nearly 40 countries in sub saharan africa can export goods to the us duty free under legislation from 2000 in some , the regime has served as a catalyst for industrial production on aid , there are fears for the funding of projects to prevent and treat hiv and aids which have helped millions clinton is seen as backing continued , or enhanced , public health assistance trumps allegations of vote rigging in the us have prompted strong reactions in a continent where manipulation of electoral process is widespread donald trump is a gift to all tin pot dictators on the african continent he is giving currency and legitimacy to rigging because if it can exist in america , it can exist anywhere , zimbabwean opposition leader tendai biti told reuters news agency last week however , it is a fake quote which has caused the biggest stir trump has been widely reported to have pledged to lock up both robert mugabe , the veteran president of zimbabwe , and museveni the false comment was not questioned and prompted anger , hope , ridicule , excitement and hilarity as well as a small demonstration of support in uganda where five protesters waved placards outside the us embassy germanya new video by german comedian jan bhmermann was released last week , entitled grab us by the pussy it waxes lyrical about the foreign policy that washington might pursue if trump were in the white house we like the new spirit of your nation lets walk hand in hand into isolation goes one of the lines in reality , the majority of germans view the prospect of a republican victory on tuesday with fear some 65 of respondents in a yougov survey released last week said that they were afraid of such an outcome if germans could vote , a poll by the magazine found that only 5 would cast their vote for trump in political circles , germanys biggest concerns relate to how much damage a trump presidency would do to the transatlantic alliance the us is the key contributor to the un budget and has the highest military budget within nato , yet during his campaign trump has described nato as obsolete and indicated that he would , at the very least , seek to renegotiate its framework if the republican wins and lives up to his own words , germany and france would , after brexit , be the two countries expected to try to fill the geopolitical vacuum in europe hope remains that trumps rhetoric would prove more dramatic than his actions in berlin government circles ,

there are times in football when you hear a story that sounds so daft , so utterly inconceivable , that if it happened in just about any other sport you would probably think it might be too far fetched to be true unfortunately , this is football , land of the absurd , and it all fits into the narrative to learn that coventry city , under the permanently bewildering sisu regime , briefly discussed the idea no kidding of being the first club in england to introduce a textasubstitute option during matches supporters would be given a number they could text , at premium rates , to say who the manager should take off and who should come on an announcement would be made at the appropriate time about the most popular vote and the manager , the poor patsy , would be under instructions to comply with the crowds wishes the london stadium an unloved venue resulting from expensive mistakes owen gibson read moreto be fair , the idea did not get far , but it does you give you an example of the boardroom buffoonery that is prevalent within the sport and it did make me wonder whether the supporters of southampton , experiencing the kind of joys the modern day coventry can scarcely imagine , ever contemplate how life might have been entirely different but for one of those moments that has sent the two clubs in their respective directions when the story of southamptons success is told , it tends to be forgotten that sisu , the hedge fund that has brought coventry to their knees , was once on the brink of buying the southcoast club and closing a deal that , 125 miles north , would have spared another club the distress it has endured over the last nine years how close was it to happening \? very close on 19 october 2007 , the directors of southampton leisure holdings , the clubs parent company , voted 5 2 in favour of accepting the 40m deal that sisu had put forward everything was in place until the proposals were rejected by three of the major shareholders rupert lowe , michael wilde and leon crouch to spark a falling out that eventually split the board in two the announcement of sisu taking control at coventry came eight weeks later and within three days southamptons chief executive , jim hone , the chairman , ken dulieu , and the commercial director , andy oldknow , had quit , blaming a major difference of opinion between them and certain major shareholders knowing what we do now , we can all probably agree which club made the wiser decision , and who was offering the best advice , even if southampton did have to endure some prolonged pain , including a spell in administration and relegation to league one , before markus liebherrs 2009 takeover began the recovery we see now dulieu was so embedded to sisu he turned up at coventry proclaiming himself to be the man who would save the club and announcing he used to look after security operations in northern ireland orange ken , as he became known because of his permatan , became chairman , then head of football operations , and started attracting suspicion when he ordered himself a training kit bearing his own initials he invited himself into the dressing room when the manager , andy thorn , was giving his team talk and watched one game from the dugout , apparently living out some childhood fantasies , before the stink it caused led to his resignation he left coventry in the championships relegation zone , proudly claiming to have turned the club around and , unless someone can tell me otherwise , he has not worked in football since it is amazing the kind of people this sport attracts and , unfortunately for coventry , they have suffered more than most when it comes to the list of those passing through with big ideas , little expertise and the general sense that they think running a football club must be a doddle another was leonard brody , a canadian entrepreneur and social media guru , who joined coventry at the same time as dulieu , forming part of the clubs best ever board and in one meeting announced he had a master plan to stop the club haemorrhaging so much money the details are recounted in , a splendid new book telling the story of the sisu years in the words of simon gilbert , the s award winning chief reporter leonard brody said he had 10 ideas , so i said what is your best idea \? gary hoffman , the former vice chairman , tells the author that was when he talked about text a substitute i said even if that was allowed under football league rules , how do you think thats going to transform the revenues of coventry city \? another idea was to make a sky blue rolls royce available for wedding hire then , at the end of the meeting , someone asked if there was any other business and hoffman remembers sisus representative , onye igwe , raising his hand onye said yes , i want to raise the subject of our mascot the club was going bust and he said i think sky blue sam is too fat and its not setting a good example for children thats when ray ranson the former chairman said onye , its a fucking elephant we are all probably aware of what has happened to coventry since and why southampton should thank their lucky stars that sisu \( who also expressed an interest in derby county and looked at manchester city before thaksin shinawatras takeover \) ended up somewhere else on the one hand , there is a southampton side that have just beaten internazionale to show , again , why they should be regarded as the prime example of what can happen at a medium sized club that applies common sense , a sound business structure , makes shrewd appointments and understands what a football team means to the local community on the other hand , there is a desperate , grieving club where the supporters old enough to remember the crumbling terraces of tatty , homely highfield road must pine for more innocent times and the scandal runs so deep john sillett , one of the great names from coventrys past , has shed tears while talking about it publicly coventry have already suffered the indignity of a 68 mile round trip to sixfields , northampton towns ground , to play their home matches and the really galling part is that however much the supporters protest , however many frothy column pieces are written , and whatever you or i might like to do about it , the owners still continue with the same cold detachment the club have no stadium agreement beyond next season , the training ground could be sold off for housing and their academy is at risk of closure coventry look like they have been dragged through a hedge fund backwards and the scary thing is it might get even worse the club , in gilberts opinion , face the very real possibility of dropping out of the football league completely in the coming years unless something dramatic happens to change their fortunes for the better when we spoke on friday it was the morning after southampton had beaten inter , six years to the week since the south coast club faced dagenham redbridge in league one most supporters probably thought coventry city had got one over on southampton by attracting sisu , gilbert said in reality , southampton dodged a bullet it all feels incredibly sad and unsatisfactory when next may ushers in the 30th anniversary of that sun drenched fa cup final against tottenham hotspur , keith houchens diving header , brian kilclines wild hair and sillett swigging imaginary champagne , back in the days when it felt like that competition meant everything there are coventry supporters of a certain generation who can remember when it was their team making similar headlines to the ones southampton now attract and , in 1970 , winning 2 1 against bayern munich in the intercities fair cup , the equivalent of the europa league \( albeit having lost 6 1 in the first leg \) these days , however , they are just trying to make sure play up , sky blues is not heard in the fourth tier next season the fitness coach , it transpires , had to find a lawnmower and cut the grass after the team arrived for one match at the ricoh to discover nobody else had bothered and a once proud club must look back at the day the deal was signed with sisu and wish , desperately , it had been another way united put beds ahead of football three years have passed since ed woodward , manchester uniteds executive vice chairman , said he would look at returning the words football club to the teams official badge and made it clear he did not agree with the decision , taken during the peter kenyon years , to remove it in the first place i didnt like that change of badge , woodward said joel glazer didnt like that change we will look at that and have a think about that we are a football club , not a business the two can go hand in hand , of course , but if united were serious about changing it back they appear to have quietly abandoned the idea and it is tempting sometimes to suspect their priorities might be somewhat blurred when they do not even hold a press conference after making paul pogba the worlds most expensive footballer but arranged one last week to plug a bedding company from shanghai wayne rooney , juan mata and luke shaw looked absolutely thrilled , as you can imagine , to go through their carefully rehearsed lines about the cutting edge technology of the mattress that had just been lugged on stage and i have it on good authority the players , as a whole , have been complaining behind the scenes about the increasing amount of time they are expected to devote to these kind of commercial events they get paid well enough , you might think , to suffer in silence but equally they probably have a point when they returned from one night game in london in the early hours and , rather than resting , had to clock in the following morning to film a go kart race outside old trafford , driving a fleet of miniature chevrolets andrews elbow met by silencethe video footage of calvin andrew elbowing an opponent to the side of his head is the most brutal piece of violence i have seen on a football pitch since the night , in 2006 , when ben thatcher appeared to overdose on his own testosterone and delivered the forearm smash that left pedro mendes unconscious on the side of manchester citys pitch andrews assault on peter clarke while playing for rochdale against oldham athletic last weekend has left him with a 12 match ban , one of the longest punishments ever meted out by the football association it was a pity , though , that the announcement was not accompanied by any statement from his club making it clear what they thought of his behaviour , or any form of public contrition from the player , and it hardly reflects well on andrew that he admitted the charge of violent conduct but also had the gall to argue it did not deserve more than the standard three match ban topicscoventry citysportblogsouthamptoncommentshare on facebookshare on twittershare via

picture a child entering the world , around the time that a new social networking venture known as thefacebook com is making its own entrance to the world it is 2004 , and the child is easy to picture her parents have photographed their daughters first breath , first smile , first spoonfuls and first steps when she reaches school age , she is snapped in uniform , probably outside the front door , and one parent , probably her mother , shares the image with friends the child learns to read , write her name she wins certificates , excels at sport when twitter , instagram and later vine arrive , her public identities multiply she starts secondary school in a few months , this child and her classmates will begin to turn 13 and , perhaps , create their own facebook accounts when they do , they will come face to face with their digital shadow they may step into it easily , or try to sever themselves from it , but it wont let go , this pre existent media identity , because it has logged their lives from the moment they left the womb some will recognise their digital shadow , but what of those whose online identity bears little relation to their sense of self , or to the public identity they want to share \? for years , parents have fretted about their childrens posting activities , while continuing to post as they wish about their offspring is it time they stopped or at least asked for permission first \? do parents overshare pictures of their children on social media \? read moretoday these questions are on the minds of the children at kingsford community school in beckton , east london , where the 13 , 14 and 15 year old members of the debate mate after school club are filing into a classroom on the first floor , slinging down school bags and glancing at the motion on the whiteboard this house would ban parents from posting about their children on social media , the debate leader writes its kind of weird your parents are still posting pictures of you on social media , someone says one boy , malachi , bows his head and writes a single word on his notepad reputation this is really about consent , his friend says do i want to be seen by a larger , broader range of people \? there is a loud hum of agreement and one girl raises her voice parents ! we dont want them invading our privacy because some of us , the only privacy we get is through social media these pupils often discuss social networking sites , their attractions and perils , but this is the first time they have turned their scrutiny on their own parents and yet parents are the object of an increasingly aggressive interrogation this spring a mother from shropshire called out her sons bullying on facebook , only for the post to go viral the criticism of her became so intense she removed it and changed her facebook page and phone number next came the 20 year old mother from balloch , scotland , whose photographs of her 11 month old daughter in tiny high fashion outfits attracted an instagram following that included khlo kardashian until critics claimed the woman was sexualising her baby she has since locked the account and gone to ground after her came the arizona father who nakedly cradled his naked , feverish baby in the shower , an image his wife snapped and shared , before facebook removed it as offensive excessive sharing about your children has long incited disapproval , but recently the disapproval has begun to acquire a proto legal tinge in march , french police warned parents against posting photos of their children on social media according to social media analyst eric delcroix , the children could soon be able to sue them for posting inappropriate pictures , under the countrys privacy laws the treasurer of the uks human rights lawyers association , leanne targett parker , echoes the idea that it is only a matter of time before children mount legal challenges against oversharing parents you cant imagine it not being something that starts to develop within the next five to 10 years , she says i cant see how there be attempts at suing people for putting up posts that theyre unhappy with one day my hair was all raggedy , sticking up all over my auntie put iton facebook i was so embarrassed icriedsome parents may shrug off the shaming stories and the professionalised sharing of family vloggers such as the shaytards , the brataleys , the ballingers as beyond the range of their own moderate social media activity but listen to the children in the kingsford classroom and it becomes clear how many degrees there are of shame to these teenagers , even small instances of sharing can be divisive when i ask if anyone has experienced being overshared themselves , hands shoot up , but the answers are a long way from the public shaming that normally grabs headlines they are exactly the sort of infringements that many parents will commit without a second thought i was eating a subway chicken teriyaki eating that and my mum just took the picture and posted it on facebook , one pupil says when i was little my parents took a picture of me being potty trained three weeks ago they posted it on facebook me on the toilet it was really embarrassing , another adds i was with my aunt in the park i was wearing my scarf but i didnt have a pin it flew off and my hair was all raggedy , sticking up all over the place my auntie put it on facebook i was so embarrassed i was crying i asked her to take it down but she said , no , it looks cute my uncle posted when his daughter had diarrhoea pray for her one girl , 14 , raises her hand parents love to post things about you , personal information that you might not like , she says which kind of affects your relationship with them now , when you want to speak to them about certain things , youre worried they might post it her classmate erin stands up her team supports the motion on the whiteboard that parents should be banned from posting and they have an idea we want to pass a law that requires open forms of social media to put a consent button on their pages , so a child can report whether their parents have posted about them without consent , she declares if parents refuse to cooperate , they will be fined the amount of 1 , 000 these suggestions may sound excessive and unfeasible in fact they lie squarely within the recommendations made by a number of adults campaigning in this field erins idea of a penalty , for instance , echoes the attempts by a democratic state representative in illinois , la shawn k ford , to make the shaming of children on social networking sites an offence offending parents should face a penalty , he has argued , which , just like erins , would be a fine paid directly to the child as for the apparently far fetched idea of a consent button , this sounds uncannily similar to the delete button proposed by 5rights , the campaign steered by the peer and film maker beeban kidron to protect and empower children online more generally , the debaters irritation chimes with research published in march by a team at the university of michigan after interviewing 249 parent children pairings across 40 us states , the researchers found that children were more than twice as likely as parents to say that adults should not post information online about them without permission would the kingsford children concur \? class e11 rings with shouts of , yes ! it aint going to happen , their teacher , miss alimi , says miss ! one of her students cries theres a thing called wishful thinking miss alimi is right children are unlikely to gain control over their parents posting habits but there is still scope for a conversation about what constitutes fair sharing , and each family will draw its lines differently consider the case of heather whitten , the arizona based photographer and teaching assistant who took the photograph of her husband and son in the shower that facebook didnt like whitten saw the moment , and the image , as the height of parental care their toddler , fox , had had a temperature for hours her husband , thomas , was trying to cool the childs fever for two years , whitten kept the image private , finally posting it in may after facebook removed other pictures she had shared of her children she wanted to take a stand , to show that its just innocent pictures that people are twisting and getting offended by she was unprepared for the response for the way in which facebook removed images from her page every time it received sufficient complaints , for the level of disapproval the image provoked , including claims that it was sexual or inappropriate but whittens stand had one other unexpected consequence as the interested and the outraged followed the link to her blog , some began to question the legality , as well as the sense , of showing children naked i just thought you were free to post what you wanted on the internet , whitten says now but then she discovered that in the state of arizona , you cant show any naked images of childrens pelvic area or butt , and i realised i was technically breaking a law she removed the blog took everything down but in the bigger , moral sense , i dont feel ive done anything wrong im not exploiting my children im not abusing my children im just sharing our lives exactly how they are she saw how many pictures there were of her and she didnt like it now any time you see lily , it is with her permissionwhittens experience shows just how nebulous and fraught the territory of sharing can be sure , her experience would never befall those for whom posting naked images of children is strictly out of bounds but the case of whitten is complicated she and her partner are raising their children to not be ashamed or embarrassed of their bodies they are living online within the offline boundaries they have set for themselves people dont show nudity a lot of times because they think it will have a negative impact on their child your footprint is for ever on the internet , whitten says for me , its absurd i just hope to combat that a little who knows how it will actually turn out , but i hope that my children wont ever look back and see pictures of themselves as children and feel embarrassed by other people seeing them as well because there is nothing to be embarrassed about fox , the toddler in the shower , is still too young to veto or cherish the photograph that caused such controversy , but his older sister lily , nine , loves it , according to her mother she couldnt really wrap her head around why people would think there was anything wrong with it and yet , while lily was comfortable with the image of her baby brother , she was deeply unhappy with other photographs her mother had uploaded the apparently harmless kind that many parents post one day at around the age of six , lily began to scroll through her mothers instagram she saw how many pictures there were of her and she didnt like it , whitten says for months , whenever lily saw whitten with the camera , she hid that really opened up a conversation about why i take pictures , why i share pictures , who i share pictures with now , whitten says , any time you see lily , it is with her permission alicia blum ross , a researcher at the london school of economics , believes we are entering a crucial moment we are starting to see kids who have grown up , whose parents have shared images , and who are beginning to say wait a minute im not sure im comfortable with that what families need , she thinks , is a coming of age conversation after all , it was lily whitten herself , at six , who instigated the dialogue with her mother that earned her the right to veto content does lily have advice for other children \? they should say , please dont take any pictures of me it makes me uncomfortable , she says and i might change my mind one day , but today i dont want to have to hide from your camera soon this digital rulebook chat might become as standard as the one about the birds and the bees blum ross sees nothing to fear both parties , she points out , are united by being the first generation of parents and children to negotiate this path it can be a really shared experience , she says enthusiastically the dilemmas are shared dilemmas , the pleasures are shared pleasures its a moment of overlap blum ross , who has three year old twins , says she is not a person who advises total protection i certainly wouldnt say , dont share things about your children online its important that parents are able to claim their own space about that its ok to say , i need this community whitten , too , has always seen her sharing in those terms i feel i share everything as my story this is my perspective on my life as a mother with these children im not trying to put words in their mouth , or tell the story from their perspective it is one of the oldest questions of storytelling who does the story belong to \? blum ross , whitten and countless others believe they are telling their own stories , and sharing posts about their children where they fit that perspective but its complicated i never had a filter before , says whitten , sounding forlorn i love the idea of having connections with other mothers and people but i cant share the way i used to after the facebook furore , she is still fathoming whether to photograph differently or simply stop sharing photograph getty imagesfor other parents , such as the author amy webb , who has written about her commitment to post nothing about her daughter online , the same process of consideration deters them from sharing altogether they have the big conversation with themselves , each other , sometimes their children and decide the best answer is silence when the guardian asked readers about their experiences , apricot , who is 30 and lives in the north of england , wrote when i started to facebook my own childs pictures , i began to feel intensely uncomfortable how could i instil in her a principle of privacy when i had essentially devalued hers from the beginning \? she stopped posting what we post is facets of ourselves , said tamasine preece , a teacher in bridgend , whose phd includes a chapter on oversharing i think there is a morality to using children to explore parts of ourselves my children are not me they are separate kidron , who says she has never interacted with her children on social networking sites \( they are now 19 and 21 \) , thinks that her behaviour reflects the idea that oversharing is inappropriate when the whole point of the journey to adulthood is to self define to work out who you are , what your values are , how youre going to fit in i think we have not thought hard enough about what that process might be like , if so much is shared and so much is public there are three issues here , she says one is the right to a certain sort of privacy the second is the need of young people to transgress and bump into their edges , and for that to be somewhat safe the third is the need to break away from the model of your parents my own facebook posts dried up as i researched this article of course , i can ask my children for consent , but i am not sure they are ready for a responsibility with permanent consequences if an eight year old consents to a post , is it fair to act upon that consent , or should a parent second guess how those feelings might evolve \? after all , posts are eternal and a child cannot speak for his or her future self in any case , a childs consent can be capricious , even within one given day my daughter , at eight , would prefer her photo not to appear on facebook , but would be more than happy to see a video of herself playing swingball on youtube my six year old , meanwhile , says he is sad that google doesnt know me even the teenagers at kingsford are conflicted in the end , they vote against erins suggestion of a fine for parents who share without their childrens consent , but they squirm in their seats , clawing the air for a turn to speak when i ask what rules they would lay down for their parents dont say embarrassing jokes cos thats too much as far as the world is concerned , were not related post pictures of me when i look amazing dont post baby pictures unless im happy and fully clothed dont ever comment on my pictures dont stalk my profile waiting for me to load pictures dont follow dont add me or my friends dont tell dad jokes dont take pictures of me eating food , cos my friends take it out of context dont try and use internet slang on our wall on your friends profiles you can embarrass yourselves all you want , but when its on our profiles it looks like weve taught you to say that and it makes us look really bad stay behind the times of course , every family is different in a quiet cul de sac in newton abbot , devon , with sunlight pouring into the lounge , molly povey and her 11 year old son roman are sitting on the sofa discussing their experience of going viral in april 2015 , with roman desperately unhappy at school , molly posted a plea on her facebook page for his classmates parents to send her beautiful son birthday cards roman doesnt have any friends and often cries himself to sleep , the post began it was shared around the world maybe 40 , 000 times , molly says \( interestingly , her post breaks only the second of the kingsford rules , by disclosing that molly and roman are related \) neither molly nor roman , nor his two brothers , nor his dad ian , who says he hates social media , were prepared for what happened next thousands of people left birthday greetings online at the office of a friend whose address was hastily borrowed to protect romans privacy cards and gifts began to arrive molly formalised the chaos into a cards for roman facebook page friendships were made , and some of them have lasted to the extent that in april , a year after his mothers plea for help , roman celebrated his 12th birthday with 150 friends , strangers and facebook friends at a nandos in exeter and at a second party in london they have even met up with well wishers in germany facebook twitter pinterest molly povey , whose post about her sons loneliness went viral , with some of the birthday cards he was sent by strangers all over the world photograph rebecca rees for the guardianwhile molly tells this story , talking quickly because there is a lot to fit in , roman scurries to and fro with his gifts a star wars chess set from someone in the netherlands , pictures from brazilian schoolchildren \( molly says he is very big in brazil \) , wicker baskets of cards but sometimes molly worries a bit i think , what happens in years to come if he googles himself and finds lonely boy with no friends \? last year the local paper ran a front page headline saying just that i thought , oh my god , what have i done \? roman was with her , and comforted her but it is true , he said i am really lonely for the povey family , the benefits of mollys post are visible each day his tearfulness has declined the whole household is happier molly herself has found , in the facebook page , a community that makes her feel supported and which , in turn , needs her and now youve got a responsibility , ian says its a strange thing he himself has never read the initial post , usually declines to appear in photographs , and thinks that when it comes to sharing , its best to err on the side of caution occasionally , molly tells her community that roman is having a bad day , or that she is she doesnt want to pretend to people who know loneliness that loneliness doesnt happen and yet , as ian says , its difficult to know sometimes what roman really thinks about it molly leads the way up to romans bedroom , to show more of the gifts people sent there is james bond notepaper from the actor andrew scott , who played the baddie in spectre , and a crew t shirt from star wars episode iii i wonder if roman minds thousands of strangers knowing hes sad do you mind \? molly asks him do you mind that people know you get really lonely \? maybe , roman replies i dont know ill go yes i dont like it you dont like it \? molly repeats , incredulous no what , that people around the world know you are lonely \? yeah you dont like it now \? she asks again no oh , molly says she sounds deflated it just feels weird , it does , roman tells her although molly has publicly revealed aspects of her sons emotional life that other parents might hesitate to share , she is not incautious for months she withheld romans full name and has only recently felt comfortable disclosing that he is autistic before her heartfelt post , she deleted baby pictures of romans older brother because he was about to start secondary school surely the kingsford debaters would approve like alicia blum ross and heather whitten , molly has rules think about whether its appropriate if in a year or five years your child would be embarrassed by anything youve done and just why are you actually doing it \? is it a positive thing , or is it to give you a social boost as opposed to the children \? molly might appear to be at the opposite end of the spectrum from tamasine preece , who never posts , but the morals that underpin their behaviour are remarkably alike and while molly thinks you shouldnt be posting pictures of kids in the bath , in some ways her posts are as exposing as whittens later that evening molly emails to say that the conversation with roman had troubled her after id left the house , she offered to take down the page , she says , but roman said not to turns out he was confused in his room and was talking about not liking being lonely , and not his page or maybe roman , in that moment , wished no one knew he was lonely then , later , when his mother checked , he minded less or maybe he understands that the community his mother has created has benefited him and his family but these are only guesses it is impossible to know he is young , and the world changes many times a day his parents have his best interests at heart , but like any who share news of their children , every time they post , they cross a line between privacy and publicity where each parent sees the line is an unsteady , unsettleable question for roman , and others like him , the truth may be something they are still working out , or simply prefer not to share ive gone online after a few glasses of wine and said things i shouldnt have parents and children talk social media facebook twitter pinterest her posts can be really personal sadie star with her mum , elaine photograph jonathan browning for the guardianelaine star , 47 , a pa and poet , and her youngest daughter sadie , 17 , a student , live in brighton elaine ive had a facebook account for about 10 years , so sadie was probably seven when i first joined i use it to keep in touch with different groups of people old friends , my poetry group , the puppet show i work with im also friends with a lot of my kids friends , because its often the best way of locating where mine are i dont think it bothers them all their friends are happy to come to the house and sit around my kitchen table and chat , so i dont think its odd i dont post on their friends pages maybe just a happy birthday message but im really impressed by the sorts of things they share about science , politics theyre very funny and insightful i have definitely made mistakes online ive gone on after a few glasses of wine and said things i shouldnt have there have been some angry messages about the state my kids and their friends have left the house in and they have all asked me to take down various photos i get it im sensitive to the fact that theyre trying to be cool or whatever i think im past the stage of worrying too much about embarrassing my kids i write poems that are very personal , and i share them on facebook but thats how i express myself the kids have occasionally said , stop living your life on facebook but im an open person theyre all fairly streetwise we have a very open dialogue in our house they have occasionally posted things that i think are a bit questionable showing off a bit about drinking with their friends , that sort of thing i might have said , hmm , you might want to think about that but ive never said , take that down im glad facebook wasnt around to record my teenage years , though id hate it sadie my siblings and i all use facebook in different ways stevie posts a lot of pictures maisie likes to talk about stuff me and joe post a lot of news stories , and i like posting videos or songs i dont like to put up personal pictures , or get too emotional on facebook my mums posts can be really personal at the beginning , i didnt really want to be friends with her on facebook i didnt really want her seeing pictures of me that my friends had posted they werent anything bad they just felt like a bit of my life that was separate from her now i dont mind as much im more open shes also friends with a lot of my friends on there thats not a problem , except that shes quite free with what she writes something would happen between us , and shed put it in a poem , and post it to facebook , and i wondered whether my friends would see her in a different way i think maybe i felt protective of her but no one has ever said anything she has a lot of photos of us when we were little when i was a bit younger , i hated seeing some of them online i remember there was one where i was holding my pet hamster and i just thought i looked greasy and rough and once my room was really messy and my mum said , ill take pictures and put it on facebook i would have hated it if shed actually done it now im a bit older , ive learned to let go of it all a bit more i think im ok with whats out there about me facebook twitter pinterest i dont feel like the same person i was when i was little nell redelsperger talbotwith her mother , juliet photograph lewis khan for the guardianjuliet redelsperger talbot , 43 , a marketing and events manager , and nell , 13 , live in eye , suffolk , with nells father and her brother lawrence , 10 nell ive been cyberbullied before one of my followers on instagram , someone i knew , turned on me , then a couple of others who id thought were friendly were making comments on my posts it wasnt nice , and i wasnt sure how to handle it in school they give you lessons about what to do if it happens to you , but when it comes to it , the reality is very different but the school did deal with it after that , i became a lot more careful about who i accept as friends , and what people can see now i have one account for my photography and a separate one for my closest friends i have looked briefly at mums facebook account , but i dont have a clue about how facebook works i dont think i mind that there are photos of me if you know the people that can see those photos , then thats ok if its not private , im not so sure about that but i dont find it embarrassing maybe its because i dont feel like the same person i was when i was little it doesnt feel as if those pictures are of me juliet the cyberbullying was a harrowing time for nell , but what was good was that some of her friends were supportive and took screenshots of the comments as proof of what was happening nell was worried i would be angry , so she didnt come to me until after it was over it was awful , but in a way , i think it helped her understand what youre exposed to online nell is a great photographer , and she sends me pictures , but i check that she is happy before i post anything on facebook your children have every right to veto what you put online , although they have to be a certain age before they understand what it means neither of mine have ever had an issue with something ive posted , but then theyre the generation that are used to having photos of themselves everywhere i think it meant something different for my generation it took so long to get photos developed that seeing yourself was so much more important the children were very little when i first signed up i dont remember thinking much about privacy then it wasnt until i read in the paper how posts about your children might be seen by complete strangers that i changed my settings as time went by , i began to feel uncomfortable about posting it felt like everything online was becoming more about look how wonderful i am and it made me feel quite down so i left for a while

how do i become an agony aunt \? ive tried using social media but it hasnt workedas you are something of an agony uncle , i am seeking your advice on how to become an agony aunt all my life i have helped others with their problems i have tried hard to find out how i can do this publicly i have started my own facebook and twitter pages , but have been unsuccessful so far any tips or advice you could offer would be gratefully received jeremy saysid like to know in what way your facebook and twitter pages have been unsuccessful theres nearly always something constructive to be learned from failure but you have more than failure to guide you you say that all your life you have helped others with their problems , so you must have some fairly clear ideas about the kind of advice that has been most useful adapting this experience to your online presence makes obvious sense , but i imagine youve done this already as for the advice itself , a surprising number of peoples problems stem from their failure to see things through the eyes of others they are genuinely baffled , and often upset , because a friend , partner , boss or colleague doesnt see things in the same way empathy comes naturally to some , but others have to work at it however , it can solve or ease a great many differences of opinion as a solver of other peoples problems yourself , some degree of empathy is probably your most valuable talent readers say as someone who has worked in a counselling type role my whole life , i would say , dont in my experience the people who would actually be the best at this type of thing dont do it , for a host of rational reasons , or cant do it , because theyre not journalists or famous journalism is probably the more reliable route , because becoming famous is more by happenstance than design being a professional counsellor , psychologist , or psychotherapist etc may help you see the issues better , but you simply wont have enough information to provide anything truly helpful momenta consider volunteering with an organisation such as the samaritans , which provides training and support it responds to people who are struggling , lonely , ill , poor , in jail or at school anyone who wants to talk being an agony aunt is a niche role and one that is often as much \( if not more \) about the adviser than the person asking for help id ask why its that route in particular that appeals pumpkindoge it is about having an appropriate background in publishing , a reputation for having a clear thinking , balanced approach to issues , and a substantial amount of luck starterforten train to be a counsellor or , better , a psychotherapist itll take years and money but , most of all , you will be forced to question whether what you do is of any help onalongsabbatical write to yourself for advice if its good advice you will reach your goal if its bad advice , maybe choose another path iamtherobotmanhow can i help my daughter to choose a career after she finishes sitting her a levels \?

a russian frigate armed with cruise missiles has passed through the bosphorus on its way to the eastern mediterranean in a potentially ominous development for the embattled syrian city of aleppo the admiral grigorovich , part of russias black sea fleet , arrived off the syrian coast on friday as the latest pause in the russian bombardment of eastern aleppo came to an end , adding to an emphatic russian show of naval force in the mediterranean unlike the admiral kuznetsov aircraft carrier and peter the great nuclear powered battle cruiser , whose arrival in the region has drawn considerable publicity , the newly commissioned grigorovich has a fearsome ground attack capability in the form of kalibr land attack cruise missiles three russian submarines from russias northern fleet capable of firing kalibr missiles are also reported to have arrived in the mediterranean five maps that show how the net closed on eastern aleppo read morerussia has used kalibr missiles , equivalent to us tomahawk missiles , against syrian targets a handful of times over the past year the concentration of forces in the eastern mediterranean in support of the syrian regimes ambitions to retake aleppo from rebel forces , suggest they may be used again in the coming few days or hours earlier this week , vladimir putin warned syrian rebels and civilians trapped in eastern aleppo to leave the city by friday night , when a temporary moratorium on air strikes was set to expire but opposition groups told the guardian that promised safe passages out of besieged areas did not exist as the deadline drew near , opposition groups pushed on with an assault on loyalist west aleppo , while residents seemed resigned to a resumption in airstrikes nothing can be done nobody can stop the planes , bebars mishal , an official with the white helmets volunteer rescue service , told reuters the kuznetsov battle group paused in its approach towards syria off the east coast of crete on thursday , to carry out aviation exercises russian ministry of defence footage showed warplanes taking off and landing on its deck the kuznetsov is carrying about 10 sukhoi 33 and four mig 29 fighter aircraft , as well as up to two dozen helicopters although the su 33s have recently been adapted to drop bombs more accurately , the plane has never been used for ground attack only the mig 29 is designed for that purpose if the planes are used to bomb targets in syria , it would mark the first time russia has used its only aircraft carrier in combat that lack of experience , however , may limit its usefulness there are very few carrier trained pilots in fact , there are more planes than pilots , and most of the planes on board are not made for ground attack for naval aviation this is largely a training run , michael kofman , a russian specialist at the centre for naval analyses , a federally funded research institute they havent done anything done anything like this in a long time , and its getting heavily covered by the local and international media , said peter zwack , a retired us brigadier general and former military attache to moscow , now at the national defence university they are arriving in the eastern mediterranean right before our election its posturing and secondarily adding capability in syria the visit of its flagship to the mediterranean is also a morale boosting demonstration of military capacity for the russian navy , which has not played a significant role in the ukraine or syrian conflicts , but which is seen by vladimir putin as vital to russian self image as a global power russias naval presence in the mediterranean is as much about military posture and ability to project power beyond its region as much as the syria campaign in general moscow sees it as important attributes of a great power , said maxim suchkov , an expert on the russian foreign affairs council and an editor at al monitor covering russian relations with the middle east the importance of image to this naval expedition is illustrated by the fact that russian sailors have spent several days during its mediterranean journey painting its deck bright blue , presumably so it looks better in aerial photographs the carrier has had a long and troubled history it was launched in 1985 , but took a decade to become fully operational it was first called the riga , then renamed the leonid brezhnev as the former soviet premier died , and then the tbilisi , after the georgian capital , and then rechristened after the soviet union fell apart and georgia gained independence it was initially armed with a dozen granit anti ship missiles , but those have recently been removed to make more space for aircraft the carrier has had persistent problems with its propulsion system , based on turbo pressurised boilers , which belch out black smoke due to an excess of fuel over air in its engines they have frequently broken down and require the kuznetsov to be accompanied on high seas duty by a tug the ship has spent more time in port than at sea and will be out of action for several years for refurbishment from next year it is accompanied by the peter the great , a massive battle cruiser , with a fearsome array of missiles , but which are designed to hit planes , ships and submarines rather than attack land targets a more potent threat from the flotilla sent from russias northern fleet may have escorted the kuznetsov under the surface uk reports , quoting british government sources , say two nuclear powered akula class and one diesel powered kilo class submarine have been spotted trailing the battle group into the mediterranean at the same time as the kuznetsov left murmansk , two destroyers left vladivostok , the headquarters of the pacific fleet those destroyers , the bystry and the admiral tributs , are reported to be off the gulf of aden kofman said that they could be on call in case the kuznetsov encounters engine trouble , possibly a plan b for nervous admirals however , the bystry , has the same unreliable propulsion system the arrival of the grigorovich and the russian submarines armed with cruise missiles could add to the devastation being wreaked on eastern aleppo , home to 275 , 000 people however , if that was russias only aim , it could easily increase the number of planes it bases at hmeimim air base , near

to say on todays non farm payrolls report from the us , to be published in a little over half an hour among all this election chaos comes the us non farm jobs report for october now , one could argue that this is the most pointless non farm friday of the year given the proximity of the election , and the fact that the months federal reserve meeting has already happened however , the fed stated on wednesday that it only needs to see a bit more evidence that the us economy is in decent health before it feels confident enough to raise rates meaning that , in the eventuality of a clinton victory ,

non farm payrolls report that could act to confirm a move to higher interest rates in december there is some selling exhaustion in us equities so the unemployment figures could help form a short term base before the election next week the market is assigning an 80 chance the fed will hike rates in december so it would take a huge labour market downturn for a single unemployment report to change the course of monetary policy neil wilson , market analyst at etx capital , says markets are on a knife edge before americans go to the polls on tuesday with donald trump having closed the gap on hillary clinton the election result is too close to call and markets are on a knife edge there is a definite sense were heading for a brexit like event if trump wins there could be a sharper selloff in risky assets like stocks and the us dollar if clinton wins , a rally is on the cards ignoring the longer term implications , there is a strong chance of immediate and significant movements in

answer was short and to the point thirty five years later we are both married , fathers of three adult children and experienced in our chosen fields my parents still call to ask questions about tim voice plans now allow for unlimited talk , but my brief answer has never changed hes the best person i have ever met closing out her address in raleigh , north carolina , democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton said that the best way to repudiate the bigotry and the bluster and the hatred and discrimination is to show up with the biggest turnout in history i believe americas best days are still ahead of us if we do what were supposed to do , clinton concluded every social movement , every economic advance , has only come about because people going to work and sacrifice and keep pushing forward in the affect of adversity it wasnt easy to get the vote for women it wasnt easy to have the final efforts made to ensure that the civil rights act was enforced it wasnt easy , because there are powerful interests still trying to push us back and push us down , clinton continued it is now our turn , our turn to stand up to people like your governor and your legislature who wanted to shut you down and push you back ! we are fundamentally a good nation and we need to make sure we deliver on that promise , clinton urged the crowd you can make the difference not only in who you elect , but in the agenda that those people then get to work i want you to hold me accountable i want you to be my partners everything ive done started by listening to people listening to hear your stories

pharrell here ! every time i see him which is not often enough , clinton says , of the musician , he is a passionate advocate for issues that are too often neglected and ignored are you really ,

protecting the hard fought civil rights that his supporters value we can disagree on many issues but we have come too far , too many people have gone to jail , too many people have died in the struggle for civil rights we are not going back to a bigoted society and furthermore , sanders continued what we understand is our strength , our uniqueness , is our diversity we should be proud of it ! we are not going to allow trump or anyone to divide us up ! vermont senator bernie sanders lauded hillary clintons stance on the environment , and drew contrasts with , well , differences with donald trumps platform there is one difference that is very , very profound , sanders said secretary clinton believes in science and i know , i know i put her in a difficult position in 2016 , to believe in science is a little bit dangerous , but what the heck the debate is over climate change is real , climate change is caused by human activity , and climate change is already , today , causing devastating problems in this country and around the world trump , meanwhile , has concluded that climate change is a hoax emanating from china now , why he chose china and not mexico or some muslim country , i dont know , but thats the way it is this is not a funny issue ive got seven grandchildren , sanders continued our job as custodians of this planet is to make sure that we leave our children and grandchildren a planet that is healthy and habitable and that means that we have to have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry and tell them that their short term profits are not more important than the future of our planet donald trump attempts to praise veterans im brave in other ways im financially brave big deal vermont senator bernie sanders , campaigning for hillary clinton in raleigh , north carolina , hit hard on the subject of paid family leave , one of clintons most committed policy planks that is why secretary clinton and i will fight o guarantee 12 weeks

scotland yard spent too long pursuing the investigation into allegations that prominent establishment figures sexually abused and killed children and should have ended it sooner , the unpublished draft report about operation midland has concluded the guardian understands that the findings of the inquiry about operation midland , which collapsed amid controversy earlier this year , are more critical than police chiefs were expecting and have sent scotland yard into crisis mode the report by sir richard henriques , a retired high court judge , is understood to say that inconsistencies in the account of the main witness , known as nick , compromised the investigations chances of success , which meant it was unlikely a criminal case would reach the threshold needed for a court case against any of the suspects the report also criticises decisions and actions by officers involved in the high profile and complex investigation police brace for operation midland report as former suspects call for 'severe criticism' read morenicks claims led to allegations against public figures , including a former military chief , lord bramall , and a former home secretary , leon brittan , as well as the former tory mp harvey proctor the report was ordered by the met commissioner , sir bernard hogan howe , after a furore over police actions and decision making in the case , which saw officers obtain warrants to raid the homes of suspects and search their possessions operation midland , which cost 2m , ended in march this year after the met concluded that there was insufficient evidence to arrest anyone , let alone ask prosecutors to consider a charge the findings from henriques have been studied by senior officers and senior advisers at the met since they were delivered four weeks ago in draft form henriques is understood to have concluded in his draft report that the investigation should have ended sooner and it should have been apparent more quickly to police that nicks credibility was too low to form the basis of a prosecution the met says there is no timetable for the publication of limited excerpts but has said it will withhold the full report because it contains confidential and sensitive information it is believed this refers to information about and from exonerated suspects and their accusers some in policing are understood to be concerned that henriques has failed to take sufficient account of important factors that may explain decision making these would include guidelines that were in place at the time about how officers should investigate sex abuse cases and a need to believe the victim unless evidence undermining their credibility emerged on thursday night the met appeared to confirm that criticised officers have raised objections asked if police officers who are criticised have a right of reply before the report is finalised or published , in a so called maxwellisation process , the met replied this is one of a number of considerations leading up to the publication of the report one source with expertise in the issues involved said just because it is someone from the establishment , doesnt mean you can write it off from the outset you have to investigate , and if you dont the victim will go to the ipcc independent police complaints commission and it will be three years before you clear your name the decision to raid bramalls home , distressing his then ill and now deceased wife , elicited considerable public sympathy for the d day veteran and opprobrium for the met the final version of the report is expected to be completed in the coming days the findings are potentially damaging to the mets reputation and the controversy around operation midland has been one of the worst episodes of hogan howes five year commissionership , which will end with his retirement in february 2017 the claims made by nick relate to the period between 1975 and 1984 , when he was aged between seven and 16 launching operation midland , the police said the credibility of the allegations was assessed after a process involving extended questioning of the complainant by specialist child protection detectives in december 2014 the then head of operation midland said nicks claims were not just credible but true the met later withdrew the assertion that the claims are true , as it faced allegations that it had subjected former public servants to a baseless witch hunt operation midland was launched following the jimmy savile scandal which shook up the criminal justice system and showed it failing victims , resulting in the shielding of a prolific offender but the way the investigation was conducted led to vehement criticism of the met from parts of the media the negative findings in henriquess review may lead to more attacks on the force and hogan howe , who insists his retirement is not linked to the controversy since receiving the draft report , hogan howe has met with bramall to apologise lady brittan is refusing to meet hogan howe until the met shares with her in confidence the portions of the report covering her late husband , who served as home secretary under margaret thatcher lady brittan feels it unfair that hogan howe would have full knowledge of the report while she is in the dark the met said in a statement we are giving the report very thorough consideration to ensure that the publication of any material does not compromise any legal process , responsibilities or duties of care to any party the force added there are no ongoing proceedings that may delay publication of the report in october 2014 claims were made to the met that a group of vips who were alleged to have sexually abused children had also murdered some of their victims by november 2014 the met announced that operation midland would investigate the claims and involved detectives from the child abuse investigation command and the homicide and major crime command in december 2014 the then head of operation midland , det supt kenny mcdonald , said experienced detectives from two teams had spoken to nick at length and concluded his accounts were true mcdonald said in december 2014 nick has been spoken to by experienced officers from the child abuse team and experienced officers from the murder investigation team they and i believe what nick is saying is credible and true the scotland yard investigation found evidence that they believed pointed to the credibility of aspects of the account given by nick nick correctly described the interior of a military premises in southern england , where he claimed abuse had taken place the details he provided were not publicly available and the premises are not open to the public , making it likely he had been there at some stage , police concluded a review , conducted six months into the investigation by a senior met detective superintendent with no previous connection to the team , concluded there was sufficient substance to continue the homicide and sexual abuse inquiries it suggested further lines of inquiry investigations into bramall and brittan were dropped and , by march 2016 , operation midland was closed , after it was decided there was no evidence worthy of asking the crown prosecution service to consider against proctor while being accused of being overzealous in operation midland , the met

increasing numbers of people have been warming to the notion that brexit may not have to mean brexit after all this was probably inevitable given that those who voted for it did so for a very wide range of reasons , and it is abundantly clear that the cabinet is about as unclear as the rest of us the announcement that the uk government has lost its high court case about article 50 \( report , 3 november , theguardian com \) means that , subject to appeal , it will have to be debated in parliament this presents a golden opportunity for mps to throw a spanner in the works by refusing to vote for article 50 to be triggered without knowing precisely , or at least , generally , what brexit will actually look like whenwe know the awful truth i predict a stampede towards brexit exit any arguments about this thwarting the will of the people needs to be shown up for the nonsense it is it would not be thwarting the will of the 48 who voted against and , i suspect , a high proportion of those who voted to leave didnt vote for hard brexit , having believed some of the lies of leading brexiters perhaps we can still pull back from the brink if parliament is prepared to face the fury of ukip and the tory right , two groups that are increasingly difficult to tell apart alan healey the high court decision is not about whether we stay in or leave the eu , it is about common sense i have always been a reluctant remainer not against brexit as such , i simply believe that the decision was reached in a fatally flawed way , partly because the leave campaign never had to explain exactly what leave would mean people were being asked tovote for a blind option we cant turn back time and redo the referendum , but at least if there is a full debate in parliament we will get a proper discussion on the reasons for leaving and the options for the future it is highly likely that parliament will vote to leave , but at least the decision will have been reached in something close to a proper process this could make a big difference in healing the fractured and politically intolerant mood that has emerged in the country since the vote ken abbott claims that the high court ruling is an attempt to scupper brexit altogether are ridiculous in addition to committing the cardinal sin of defining a word using the word itself \( brexit means brexit \) , the government has also made no sense when arguing against parliamentary ratification of article 50 theresa may has stated , rather patronisingly , that any negotiator knows you should not show your hand to those on the other side of the table before negotiations have even begun she is correct however , it is not implicit that anyone but parliament is able to see our negotiating hand parliament is able to sit in private , meaning only mps may be present and no media coverage may take place this was done in 2001 when mps debated the anti terrorism , crime and security bill parliamentary involvement in brexit will not reverse the referendum result , it will simply scrutinise the terms of withdrawal and it can be achieved without showing our hand to the eu gabriel osborne brexit means brexit is a meaningless and unhelpful phrase and todays high court judgment reminds us of this two words , one repeated , designed to make us forget the constitutional framework and legal process brexit \( a consultative referendum \) means \( voted for by a narrow majority \) brexit \( that we should leave the eu without further parliamentary scrutiny or consideration of the implications or constitutional foundations of the vote \) our constitution , despite being unwritten , is based in law parliament \( not the government \) decided to ask the public their opinion and parliament should decide what to do with this the house of lords must be given the chance to do its job too if it exists at all surely it is for moments like this , to intervene and apply perspective in a situation when the government of the day is trying to do something deeply unconstitutional and to ensure that the proper time and consideration is given to a decision with such significant consequences the result of the referendum is causing divisions not just because of how deeply many people feel about the issues or that the result feels inconclusive , but because the referendum itself was not put in a robust constitutional framework , and as a result its consequences are open to debate kevin olding liam fox and dominic raab dont seem to understand the high courts ruling the nub of the matter is that the executive cannot by royal prerogative alter the rights that british citizens currently enjoy as members of the eu the most important of these is the right to live and work freely in 28 european countries ifwe leave the eu , poles and romanians will have that figure reduced from 28 to 27 british citizens meanwhile will have it reduced from 28 to 1 charles turner what a lovely irony ! having spent months arguing for the return of british sovereignty , the brexiters dont seem to like it much roy boffy whether you supported leave or remain , the decision of an unelected judge to prevent the prime minister from triggering article 50 is disgusting rarely has there been a clearer example of the establishment frustrating democracy and disrespecting the will \( for good or ill \) of the majority of the people tim raymond if the government fails to overturn the decision to allow parliament a vote on article 50 in the supreme court , then they could always appeal to the european courtsteve flatley on 3 november 1774 , edmund burke spoke as follows to the electors of bristol certainly , gentlemen , it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union , the closest correspondence , and the most unreserved communication with his constituents their wishes ought to have great weight with him their opinion , high respect their business , unremitted attention it is his duty to sacrifice his repose , his pleasures , his satisfactions , to theirs and above all , ever , and in all cases , to prefer their interest to his own but his unbiassed opinion , his mature judgment , his enlightened conscience , he ought not to sacrifice to you , to any man , or to any set of men living these he does not derive from your pleasure no , nor from the law and the constitution they are a trust from providence , for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable your representative owes you , not his industry only , but his judgment and he betrays , instead of serving you , if he sacrifices it to your opinion martin thomtopicsbrexitarticle 50european unionforeign policyconstitutional reformhouse of commonslettersshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content

those who cant rule today try to rule yesterday this weeks demand by labours andy burnham for a show trial of policetactics at the battle of orgreave , 32 years ago , was a piece of pure politics his rebuff by the home secretary , amberrudd , was proportionate and wholly reasonable we know what happened at orgreave the police reaction to the miners union picketing was excessive but this fact has been examined , fought over and iconised for decades to equate it with hillsborough or bloody sunday is an offence to those who died in those tragedies there were no deaths at orgreave there was violence on both sides but the arrested miners were tried and acquitted that some suffered through being bailed is sadly true of thousands of innocent citizens every year why does burnham suddenly want an inquiry into orgreave \? back in 2005 he was a junior minister at the very home office he now wants to put on trial there was no inquiry then could it be that burnham was part of tony blairs new labour establishment , eager to forget the taint of scargillism , whereas he now wants to be mayor of manchester \? orgreave was miserable for those involved , but pit closures are history the miners were victims of that history , as were workers at the same time in dockyards , steel foundries and newspapers protest was understandable and probably inevitable but does burnham really want to go back to subsidising dirty coal \? public policy and resources should surely go into helping the stranded , demoralised communities left behind buy jobs , not lawyers who will invest in these places if they continue picking at old sores \? this was a third of a century ago weve had alder hey \( 1999 \) , climbi \( 2001 \) and soham \( 2004 \) what good did they do \? public inquiry has become a catch all salve to any political embarrassment or lingering grievance no one asks if it really delivers justice , which is strictly a job for the courts no one asks the opportunity cost no one doubted that what happened in derry on bloody sunday in 1972 was a ghastly mistake the 12 years and 179m spent re investigating it by lord saville would surely have been better spent compensating victims families and on wider community rebuilding as for the three inquiries into the 1989 hillsborough football disaster , they have still not laidit to rest , with calls for yet more criminalinvestigations the supposition that a drawn out judicial inquiry is somehow macho accountability is bizarre the brisk inquiries familiar in the 1950s and 1960s lasted on average three months by the 1990s this had tripled to 10 months the 1992 scott inquiry drooled over a relatively trivial issue of arms for iraq for four years , to no particular end franks on the falklands took six months in 1982 by this year , chilcot on iraq had taken seven years and 10m the current inquiry into child sex abuse has become an industry , a parody of the genre we have had inquiries into the inadequacies of the child care system for decades there has been cleveland \( 1987 \) , north wales \( 1996 \) , alder hey \( 1999 \) , victoria climbi \( 2001 \) and soham \( 2004 \) , among many others what good did they do , that we need yetanother \? we do not know if this abuse inquiry , under professor alexis jay , is to be a court hearing of a number of elderly men or an encyclopaedia of past maladministration all we know is that it has spawned 13 sub inquiries , 180 staff and a battery of victim lobbyists meanwhile , victims hopes of compensation are inflated and postponed as lawyers pump up each line of inquiry and costs soar isit really sensible to starve a desperately under resourced care service for this circus \? it seems no longer to matter how long these inquiries take politicians and officials alike have a vested interest in distancing themselves from publicity and blame accountability postponed is accountability denied public inquiries have become a cynical appendix of modern government , like honours , tsars and special advisers inquiries should be for specific system failure , like investigating a political scandal or a dreadful accident they used to be incisive exposures , as of the profumo affair , the aberfan disaster , the brixton riots and the death of stephen lawrence , where no other mechanism seemed appropriate such a case today might be the collapse of audit and regulation in the bhs philip green affair all we got was an abusive torrent from the prime minister and mps alike meanwhile , there has been no inquiry into the bank of englands handling of the 2008 9 crash , or the chaotic state of nhs finances , or allegations of bribery by rolls royce and bae inquiries into project cost concealment , as with the olympics legacy , hs2 or hinkley point , must presumably await the retirement of the politicians concerned orgreave was part of the class war that ended with 96 dead at hillsborough owen jones read morepublic inquiries have assumed from parliament the job of debating public policy as such they upstage both the house of commons and the investigative functions of select committee they anaesthetise controversy , lancing some political boil by removing it from the theatre of parliament but they have come to seem more like kangaroo courts , with the voices of victims loudest , and little attempt to balance blame chilcot lost credibility by being absurdly indulgent of downing street officials leveson sought to chain the press , yet let the police and bbc off the hook inquiries are always bidden to learn lessons a few do , such as scarman on riot policing , but most tell us little more than we already know that public services operate under stress , must take risks and can sometimes fail inquiries seldom acknowledge risk , because risk is not a concept known to law trial and error is part of the relationship between ministers and officials it is a trial and error that should be vulnerable to constant scrutiny by parliament , the courts and the media , not delegated to some passing judge as for the past , there should be some statute of limitation history is for historians i cannot believe tony blairs apologies for slavery and the irish famine were about justice , or made anyone feel better , except him the poet george santayana warned us not to not forget history , lest we repeat it but harbouring old grievances blights too many societies around the world sometimes we should put our faith in the future and move on more misery is caused by those who cannot forget the past than by those who cannot remember it topicsthe miners' strike 1984 85opinionamber ruddpolitics pastconservativescommentshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content

but it is not a given that the fed will hike in december , says economist james knightley at ing bank there is little in the statement to suggest that a december hike is definitely going to happen \( markets currently pricing in a 67 chance of a move \) the statement comments that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen while adding the word some to the line that it wants to wait for some further evidence of continued progress towards its objectives this all suggests that things are moving in the right direction , but the presidential election is an obvious reason for waiting assuming clinton wins , markets are likely to react with relief given expectations of policy continuity this , coupled with the reasonably firm growth , rising employment and a gradual pick up in inflation should reinforce market expectations for a december rate hike should trump win then this is likely to hurt market sentiment given uncertainty as to what he will actually do when in power it is hard to imagine the fed hiking in this environment we also have plenty more data to come ahead of the december 14 fomc meeting , including two more job reports so there are other reasons for caution the fed statement has failed to give much support to the dollar , and us markets have struggled for direction after the news the dow jones industrial average is now down 33 points , compared to around 70 ahead of the statement the us dollar index has lost 0 3 to 97 38 gregory daco \( gregdaco \) fed fomc statement us economy chugging along , inflation expectations

strengthen fed remains on track for dec rate hikenovember 2 , 2016 although there was no rate change today , it looks increasingly likely there will be one in december paul sirani , chief market analyst at xtrade , said with just days to go before election fever sweeps america , janet yellens federal interest rate statement held no shocks with rates remaining the same however , its becoming ever more likely that yellen will implement a raise early next month following signs that the american economy is gradually picking up steam she made clear in september that a rise before the end of 2016 was more than likely and with employment and inflation continuing to strengthen the central bank may get its wish the fed has dropped a reference to inflation remaining low in the near term in september it said inflation is expected to remain low in the near term , in part because of earlier declines in energy prices , but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further this now reads inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further the fed said in its statement the committee expects that , with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy , economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further near term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced the committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments against this backdrop , the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 4 to 1 2 percent the committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided , for the time being , to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative , thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation this time there were only two fed dissenters who wanted to raise rates not three , esther george and loretta mester eric rosengren , who voted for a rise last time , has now sided with the majority breaking newsto no ones great surprise , the federal reserve has opted to leave us interest rates unchanged just days ahead of the presidential election it said it was waiting for further evidence of progress towards its objectives before hiking anthony cheung \( awmcheung \) awaiting any subtle change in fomc language to hint towards dec hike look out for next meeting or further strengthened november 2 , 2016 the us federal reserves interest rate decision will be released in less than an hour while most commentators expect there to be no change not this close to the presidential election the prospect of a rate rise in december is thought to be reasonably likely , given the recent reassuring us economic data there is likely to be a focus as usual on the exact wording of the fed statement and whether it shows any changes from the september comments at that meeting seven of the fed members voted for no change , with three , esther george , loretta mester , and eric rosengren , backing an increase any variance here could also give a clue to the likely outcome in december investors have been unnerved by suggestions that donald trump is gaining ground in the us presidential race , with one poll this week even showing him in the lead over hillary clinton combined with a slump in oil prices following a record weekly rise in us crude stocks , this has pushed markets in europe sharply lower but on wall street the dow jones industrial average , which lost 100 points or so on tuesday , has not been hit as badly \( so far \) , and is currently down just 20 points ahead of the latest us federal reserve interest rate decision meanwhile the vix index of volatility , seen as a gauge of investor fears , is up 3 to 19 when clinton looked a shoo in to win , the index was hovering around 13 but despite this recent rise , it is still well below the 25 level it reached after the brexit vote in june jasper lawler , market analyst at cmc markets , said less than a week out from the us election and markets are demonstrating both complacency and a palpable fear at the same time a surge in the vix index shows volatility is on the rise and investors are hedging equity exposure with safe havens like gold and government bonds but at the same time equity benchmarks are only modestly down , showing an overriding comfort in owning stocks the vix is up over 40 in the last seven days , reaching above 18 , a level in which many investors sit up and pay attention to signs of heightened risk in the market over that same period the ftse 100 and s p 500 are down 2 3 there is still a general perception that hillary clinton will take the white house , but the surprise brexit result is fresh in minds of investors and they are buying gold and vix index tracking products to hedge their bets the final scores in europe showed the ftse 100 fell 71 72 points or 1 04 to 6845 42 , its lowest level since 27 septembergermanys dax dropped 1 47 to 10 , 370 93frances

pic twitter com yywjzduxfwnovember 2 , 2016 with investors spooked by the prospect of donald trump possibly winning the us election , not to mention the plunge in oil prices following the jump in us crude stocks , markets remain under pressure the ftse 100 is currently down 0 9 , germanys dax has dropped 1 2 and frances cac has lost 1 1 on wall street , the dow jones industrial average has not been so badly hit and is currently 0 2 lower that could mean that investors are not necessarily convinced by polls showing trump in the lead kathleen brooks , research director at city index , said the markets are not in full on panic mode right now , suggesting that they still think clinton could clinch a win next week this is reflected in the vix volatility index , which is considered a fear gauge for wall street even though it has risen in recent days it is still below 20 , to put this in context , after the brexit vote in june volatility spiked above 25 global stock markets are generally lower on wednesday , but us markets have outperformed their european counterparts even with 6 days to go before the us election interestingly , the dow jones transport index , considered a lead indicator for wall street , is higher today considering a trump presidency is considered the worst outcome for the us economy , the fact that this index has not fallen further on the back of the bad poll news for the clinton camp , suggests that the us equity market may not sell off sharply until volatility spikes further , or until the actual result is confirmed but the other potentially market moving event is the us federal reserve interest rate announcement later brooks said the market is expecting a 14 chance of a hike tonight if the fed does hike , that would throw the cat among the pigeons , and we could see a steeper sell off in equities , a rally in bond yields and a broad based recovery in the dollar however , in our view the bigger risk from todays meeting could be a dovish slant from the federal reserve , who may not want to commit to a rate hike until the election result is confirmed although the fed is expected to be politically neutral , a potential market sell off on the back of a win for trump next week could put the prospect of a december rate hike to bed for the fed added to this , the fed chair and vice chair have given speeches with fairly dovish slants in recent weeks , so a sell off in the dollar on wednesday could be in advance of a dovish shock from the fed later on today jamie mcgeever \( reutersjamie \) 50 fading fast brent crude oil 12

walter hain stumbled into the anti apartheid struggle , according to his son , the politician peter hain , who in 2014 wrote a memoir of his father and mother , ad wal values , duty , sacrifice in apartheid south africa peter wrote of his parents at the time , in 1953 , it just seemed the right thing to do , in keeping with their values of caring , decency , fairness and , perhaps equally important , their sense of duty that was when walter , who has died aged 91 , and his wife , adelaine , joined the newly formed liberal party the only non race based political grouping in south africa then living in ladysmith , the couple helped to organise the inaugural meeting of the partys local branch and ended up holding it at their home the author alan paton , the partys national president , attended that first meeting the following year the family moved to pretoria walter worked as an architect , while adelaine became an unpaid political organiser she made illegal trips into black townships to visit party members , and supported activists who had been arrested , helping them to find legal representation , and sending food to their families when they were imprisoned when i met the couple in 2007 , to write an article marking adelaines 80th birthday , they gave me a nightmare description of the south africa of the 1950s prisoners taken to the jail in pretoria could be sold to farmers as cheap labour , and a black servant not carrying his pass papers could be arrested merely for stepping outside his employers front garden as the repression worsened in the early 1960s , the hains became even more active politically adelaine attended the trial of nelson mandela and his co defendants in pretoria , and was at times their sole supporter in the whites only gallery that in turn made the hains the target of a paranoid regime in 1963 adelaine was banned a draconian measure forbidding all political activity and making her , in effect , a non person walter faced the same treatment a year later they were the first couple to be banned , and an unprecedented codicil had to be added to their banning order allowing them to communicate with each other walters banning order followed the support he had given to the couples close friend john harris , who in 1964 had planted a bomb at the railway station in johannesburg , killing an elderly woman in his book , peter hain alleges the authorities deliberately ignored harriss phoned warning in order to use the resulting carnage for political ends the hains were opposed to violent action because they believed it was counter productive , but they remained supportive of harris , a fellow liberal party member who had joined the african resistance movement and had come to believe that only violence could shake the apartheid system , although he always denied he had intended to kill harris was hanged for murder in april 1965 , the only white person to be executed in apartheid south africa for political activities the hains helped his wife , ann , and their baby son during the months of his imprisonment and took them into their home after his death harris had wanted walter to give the oration at his funeral , but because walter was banned he was unable to do so peter , who was 15 at the time , read it instead walters banning order meant he could no longer work as an architect in south africa , so in 1966 he and his family left for the uk they settled in london , where they became prominent opponents of the south african government they supported the anti apartheid movement , helping peter with his stop the 70 tour campaign , which succeeded in blocking the all white south african cricket team from coming to britain in 1970 they also backed their son when he faced a trial for conspiracy in 1972 and trumped up bank robbery charges in 1976 the south african secret police continued to target activists in exile the hains phone was tapped and in 1972 they received a letter bomb , addressed to peter but sent to their home it was opened by their daughter sally , but did not explode walter was born in durban his father , also called walter , and his mother , mary , hailed from glasgow , and in 1920 had emigrated to south africa , where walter sr worked as an engineer in 1935 they moved to pretoria , and walter attended pretoria boys high school , where he developed a lifelong love of sport he also learned to sketch at school a skill he put to good use in the second world war , when he joined the signal corps at the age of 18 and took part in the allied assault on italy he kept a diary during the campaign , illustrated with pencil sketches in 2015 he published them in a book called apennine war diary walter was wounded in the advance , but recovered and was assigned to the natal mounted rifles he was still in italy when germany surrendered on 8 may in his book about his parents , peter says the war was a profoundly formative experience for his father , both changing him and enlarging his perspective on life to one so much broader than that of a home grown , young , white south african after the war , walter took up the place to study architecture at witwatersrand university that he had gained before joining up in 1942 though studying in johannesburg , he still liked to pay regular visits to his parents in pretoria , and on one of those visits , while out riding with a group of friends , he met adelaine stocks the couple married in 1948 , initially living in nairobi , kenay , where walter had found a job in an architectural practice peter , their eldest son , was born there in 1950 it was in nairobi that the hains exhibited the first flickerings of their political rebelliousness india had just got independence , walter recalled , and a whole lot of british ex indian army people had come to kenya , where black people were still kept in their place one of the partners in the firm that i was working for said to me , oh , we must learn from you south africans you know how to treat the blacks i had a hell of an argument with him walter described himself and adelaine as political late developers it was very lucky because we both felt the same , he said it would have been awkward if wed developed differently exiled to the uk after their decade long struggle in south africa , they settled in putney , south west london , where walter played cricket until he was 80 the couple were also passionate supporters of chelsea football club their sole accommodation with oligarchical power in 2009 they moved to neath , south wales , to be close to peter , who was the towns mp until he stepped down in 2015 walter and adelaine returned to south africa on three occasions , the first visit immediately after the end of apartheid in 1994 to do a whip round of the whole country to see as many of our old friends as possible whom we didnt think wed see again on that trip , walter had something of an epiphany in a toilet we stopped at a garage on the road from cape town to port alfred to put petrol in i went to the loo , and was standing at the urinal somebody came to the next urinal and i looked at him he was black i knew then that things really had changed walter is survived by adelaine , their children , peter , tom , jo anne and sally , 11 grandchildren , 18 great grandchildren and a great great grandchild walter hain ,

artwork for halloween last year , knows that from experience dressed in a bulky cardboard costume , quick stood in the astor place plaza for hours , hoping to brighten up the nights of passerby

told the guardian i was not a stranger to them i was like an old friend one couple told him of a ritual at their high school in which kissing the cube ensured a relationship would last forever they worried for the fate of their own relationship when the cube was removed in 2014 for safekeeping as the plaza was renovated another couple who lived nearby were worried that their newborn would never get to see the real thing they dont need to worry any longer the cube was reinstalled on tuesday after months of false starts as one of the citys best known pieces of public art , the cube is a

is one of five of his public sculptures in new york city , and one of many that he created for locations around the country originally part of a temporary exhibition , the cube became permanent after local residents petitioned for it , according to a 1967 new york times article rosenthal created a number of similar cubes , which reside in florida connecticut ohio at his alma mater , the university of michigan and on a lawn in westchester county , new york since its installation in 1967 , the alamo has only been removed twice the first time was in 2004 when it needed internal repairs the more recent removal was for a redesign of astor place construction began in 2013 to turn the confusing intersection into a pedestrian plaza , with new rules , more tables and chairs , and the alamo as a

cooper union when ada calhoun , the author of st marks is dead , was researching photos of east village characters for her book on the areas history , she noticed the alamo in many of them in the 60s its there and the hippies are all hanging out around it in their fringe vests smoking pot and then its really desolate and the seedy looking characters in the 70s and then skateboarders , calhoun said its just been this witness to all these different subcultures a producer for kids , the 1995 film about new york city teenagers , said it served as a departure place during filming skateboarder harold hunter starred in the movie and really did hang around the astor place cube with his board , calhoun said the cube has been the subject of numerous pranks and hoaxes , from being covered in yarn to being converted to a rubiks cube in 2013 , a fake documentary claimed a 37 year old writer named dave lived inside the sculpture in the video , eventually revealed to be an ad for a mindfulness training company , his belongings clattered off the shelves whenever passersby spun the cube gerry snyder , dean of the pratt institutes school of art , remembered spending time near the cube when he was working on his masters degree at new york university in the 1980s it was a favorite of skateboarders and tourists who were turning it and taking their picture in front of it , snyder recalled though the alamo seems to be widely appreciated , it is difficult to anticipate what the public will love or hate when it comes to public artworks , snyder said when he was the vice president of academic affairs at pacific northwest college of art in portland , oregon , snyder was part of a group that commissioned the artist kenny scharf to build brightly colored totem poles around the city , called tikitotemoniki they were kind of perceived as bad and wrong and unfortunate , snyder said of the artwork at its inception in 2001 now , he says , theyre well liked its an example of how something can shift over time the tilted arc , a 120 by 12 feet curved metal wall by richard serra that bisected the plaza outside the jacob k javitz federal building in new york , was considered an irritant to those who worked in the area because it blocked foot traffic snyder , who liked the 1981 work , called it a brutal commentary on the building and a menace to the people who worked there

museum director , wished that astor place would showcase temporary exhibitions instead of rosenthals alamo sculpture choose an extraordinary artist who wants to comment on that space , on life in the city , on something else from some completely unique aesthetic perspective , he suggested though the astor place cube has a nostalgic connection to the community , it could be so much more than that ,

president obama photograph ty wright getty imagesclinton campaign officials have dismissed a poll suggesting that donald trump may have taken the lead in the final days before tuesdays election , insisting they see no evidence of a negative impact from fridays new fbi email disclosures house speaker paul ryan has repaid donald trump for months of acrimony including a refusal to endorse ryan by voting for him in a continuation of the weird republican quirk this cycle of not naming trump , ryan told fox friends that he had voted for our nominee speaking in dade city , florida , former beauty queen alicia machado introduced hillary clinton by describing her interactions with trump during her reign as miss universe 1996 i was only 18 years old a little girl , machado said there was still so much i didnt know trump was overwhelming i was scared of him he made fun of me , and i didnt know how to respond he told me that i looked ugly , and i was massive he even called me names he said to me , miss piggy , miss housekeeping , miss eating machine soon , it became a joke alicia machado was the fat miss universe it was really painful for me he was cruel with the presidential election one week away , a handful of republicans are already vowing to oppose any nominee to the supreme court proposed by hillary clinton should she be elected at least three republican senators ted cruz of texas , richard burr of north carolina and john mccain of arizona have voiced support for indefinitely blocking clinton from filling the supreme court vacancy left by the late justice antonin scalia hundreds of the worlds most respected economists , including eight nobel laureates , have signed and published a letter urging us voters not to support republican presidential nominee donald trump , calling trump a dangerous , destructive choice who would doom the country to recession , or worse wisconsin senator ron johnson , who is expected to cruise to reelection victory in next weeks election despite fellow republican donald trumps underwater polling numbers in the state , told the beloit daily news that hillary clintons use of private email servers are impeachable offenses donald trumps campaign responds to the endorsement of trump by a kkk newspaper the trump campaign responded with criticism of the article mr trump and the campaign denounces hate in any form this publication is repulsive and their views do not represent the tens of millions of americans who are uniting behind our campaign a us cybersecurity firm hired by a russian bank to investigate allegations of a secret line of communication with the trump organization said on tuesday there was no evidence so far of substantive contact , email or financial links mandiant , which is owned by the california based company fireeye , said it examined internet server logs presented to the bank by media organisations investigating the link donald trump photograph chip somodevilla getty imagesthe online magazine slate published a story on monday about communication between a server hosting trump domain addresses and a server owned by the moscow based alfa bank , owned by two oligarchs , mikhail fridman and pyotr aven aven worked with vladimir putin in city government in st petersburg in the early 1990s the slate story , quoting a range of cybersecurity experts , said the communication between the servers suggested it was human rather than robotic , and that it was intended to be secret and exclusive in a statement , fireeye said it had been presented with a log of the communication between the servers over a period of 90 days , listing the separate contacts the information presented is inconclusive and is not evidence of substantive contact or a direct email or financial link between alfa bank and the trump campaign or organization , the statement said the list presented does not contain enough information to show that there has been any actual activity opposed to simple dns lookups , which can come from a variety of sources including anti spam and other security software the statement continued as part of the ongoing investigation , alfa bank has opened its it systems to mandiant , which has investigated both remotely and on the ground in moscow we are continuing our investigation nothing we have or have found alters our view as described above that there isnt evidence of

bush told the associated press potentially but hard to speculate from donald trumps press pool donald trump finished his speech at 6 54 cdt , pausing near the end as his audience erupted in a chant of president trump ! president trump ! pool left at 6 59 in the van , joining mr trumps motorcade for a ride to the airport and a 3 hour flight to miami , fl tonights speech was steady , and lacking in the off the cuff departures that tend to characterize his rallies in your poolers humble opinion , trump has not stayed this on message in any other public rally since the republican national convention your pooler would bet an expensive lunch that he diverted very little from his prepared remarks wisconsin senator ron johnson , who is expected to cruise to reelection victory in next weeks election despite fellow republican donald trumps underwater polling numbers in the state , told the beloit daily news that hillary clintons use of private email servers are impeachable offenses she purposefully circumvented the law , this was willful concealment and destruction , johnson said im not a lawyer , but this is clearly written i would say yes , high crime or misdemeanor , i believe she is in violation of both laws johnson referred to two laws regarding the willful destruction or removal from proper custody of information relating to the national defense , the punishment for which includes fines and the forfeiture of holding elected office johnson dismissed the conclusion by the fbi that clinton did not break the law that was a corrupt conclusion , johnson said every election is a binary choice , but she has disqualified herself , johnson said of clinton i would love to be voting for ronald reagan , and im sure the democrats would rather be voting for harry truman , but the reality is that is not our choice hundreds of the worlds most respected economists , including eight nobel laureates , have signed and published a letter urging us voters not to support republican presidential nominee donald trump , calling trump a dangerous , destructive choice who would doom the country to recession , or worse donald trump is a dangerous , destructive choice for the country , the letter asserts , after listing off more than a dozen reasons for voters to support a different candidate he misinforms the electorate , degrades trust in public institutions with conspiracy theories , and promotes willful delusion over engagement with reality if elected , he poses a unique danger to the functioning of democratic and economic institutions , and to the prosperity of the country for these reasons , we strongly recommend that you do not vote for donald trump the letters 370 signatories , which include oliver hart of harvard university , one of the two nobel winners in economics this year , and paul romer , the chief economist at the world bank , accuse trump of , in order degrading trust in vital public institutions that collect and disseminate information about the economy , including the bureau of labor statistics misleading voters by asserting that the renegotiation of nafta or the imposition of tariffs on china would substantially increase employment in manufacturing trump has diverted the policy discussion to options that ignore both the reality of technological progress and the benefits of international trade he has misled the public by asserting that us manufacturing has declined falsely suggesting that the toughness of negotiators primarily drives trade deficits misleading american voters with false statements about trade agreements eroding national income and wealth lowering the seriousness of public discussions of the national debt and deficits by suggesting that eliminating the environmental protection agency or the department of education would significantly reduce the fiscal deficit he claims he will eliminate the fiscal deficit , but has proposed a plan that would decrease tax revenue by 2 6 to 5 9 trillion over the next decade according to the non partisan tax foundation proposing a reduction in public saving that is likely to increase the us trade deficit using immigration as a red herring to mislead voters about issues of economic importance misleading the electorate by declaring that the us is one of the most heavily taxed countries his statements reveal a deep ignorance of economics and an inability to listen to credible experts , the letters signatories conclude he repeats fake and misleading economic statistics , and pushes fallacies about the vat and trade competitiveness he promotes magical thinking and conspiracy theories over sober assessments of feasible economic policy options polls are often conducted over multiple days , so were only just starting to measure the effect of the fbis decision to release new details of its investigation into hillary clintons private email server to lawmakers on friday according to the abc washington post tracking poll published on tuesday \( conducted october 27 30 \) , the democratic candidate has now slipped behind donald trump , on 45 to her republican opponents 46 the polling average calculated by realclearpolitics , a much better indication of national sentiment , shows clinton is now leading by just 2 percentage points , down from 5 percentage points a week ago those numbers are interesting but not necessarily indicative polling wont neatly translate to votes far more important will be the turnout especially since the two leading presidential candidates are so close in terms of unpopularity and the candidates know it a senior adviser to donald trump reportedly revealed last week that we have three major voter suppression operations under way intended to reduce votes for clinton among african americans , white liberals and young women even though election day is still a week away , we already have some clues about whether turnout is lower among those groups because more than 25m ballots have already been cast under the us early voting system approximately 125 million to 145 million americans are predicted to vote in the 2016 election , so those early votes represent a significant share of the expected total higher turnout than at this time in 2012of the 15 states that provide detailed information about those ballots , north carolina , california and nine other states report more early voters than at the same point in the 2012 election ohio , nevada , colorado and iowa showed a decline in early voting , and those declines were small early signs of declining turnout from black voters and young votersthe early results offer mixed news for clinton early votes suggest that young voters who are much more likely than older voters to lean democratic might be staying at home in 12 states , fewer americans aged 18 to 29 have cast a ballot so far in this election compared with this point in 2012 this could be especially problematic for clinton if this group is indicative of a broader bernie or bust sentiment in which supporters of the former democratic candidate bernie sanders choose to stay at home rather than voting for clinton young voters arent the only demographic group that appears put off early votes suggest that black turnout has fallen in eight states especially in north carolina , a state that yields 15 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the election and where polling suggests clinton is in a close contest if trumps strategy is indeed to suppress the black vote , that makes a lot of sense those voters could be crucial for clinton to secure the white house election polls tighten but turnout is the real key to clinton v trump read more speaking in eau claire , wisconsin , donald trump predicted an unprecedented constitutional crisis if hillary clinton were to be elected president the work of government would come to an unbelievably unglorious halt , trump said , and she is likely to be investigated for years , likely to be concluded with a very large scale criminal trial the audience chanted lock her up ! in response this is a message for any democratic voter who have already cast their ballot for hillary clinton and have a severe case of buyers remorse , trump said , referring to a few states wisconsin included where early ballots can be reversed before election day a lot of stuff has come out since youve voted you can change your vote to donald trump well make america great again , okay \? she will never make america great speaking in eau claire , wisconsin , republican presidential nominee donald trump greeted the audience by declaring that in one week , we are going to win the great state of wisconsin lauding the states governor , scott walker , as one tough cookie , trump moved swiftly past local flavor for a casual listing of polls \( valid or otherwise \) that show him surging in battleground states were on the cusp of something incredible historic change that transfers power from a failed political establishment , trump said watch it live here
anyone who feared that the ukip leadership contest would get dull following the withdrawal of raheem kassam will be relieved after that with john rees evans , ukips reputation for eccentricity is in safe hands he fared badly this afternoon , but paul nuttall , the clear favourite , suzanne evans , the most assured media performer , and peter whittle all got through the debate without difficulty there was no clear winner , but equally nothing happened to challenge the view that nuttall will be most popular with ukip members \( evans was good , but she doesnt sound much like a proper kipper \) here are two of the key news lines paul nuttall and suzanne evans , the two favourites in the contest , disagreed over ukips controvesial breaking point anti immigrants poster evans said she did not like it i didnt think it was racist , but i dont like it i think it was insensitive and ill judged but nuttall defended it the point behind that poster was absolutely correct we do need to get control of our borders and there is a deluge of people coming from the middle east and the european unions idea of a common asylum policy certainly isnt the right route to go down nigel farage launching ukips controversial breaking point poster during the eu referendum photograph philip toscano panuttall and whittle both sought to downplay the significance of the rise in hate crime after the brexit vote asked about the increase , nuttall said if you look at the hate crime figures , they did not go up substantially there has been a slight rise but ive spoken to the police about this that happens after any national event this is nothing out of the ordinary the rise hasnt been that substantial and whittle said that hate crime had been going up anyway he added the only point i would make is that in july , after the brexit vote , actually a huge amount of hate crime was more related to the terrorist attacks that were happening at the time thats all from me for today thanks for the comments nuttall says he would for some crimes , like killing children but it is ukip policy to have a referendum on it if enough people call for one evans says she is strongly opposed to one and always has been , and the stefan kiszko case clinched it for her rees evans says he would back the death penalty for people who kill children , and paedophiles convicted for preying on children under the age of 12 and thats it the lbc hustings is over i will post a summary soon this entry was corrected on 1 november 2016 to more accurately reflect the views of the candidates evans says she would work with whoever won nuttall says if he were american , he would probably vote for the libertarian candidate he does not like either trump or clinton rees evans says one thing in trumps favour is that he is not in anyones pocket whittle says clinton is deeply unsavoury with trump he thinks right cause , wrong man whittle says putin is a pretty unsavoury character there is an expansionist impluse there but there is in the eu too no , says whittle rees evans says he does not really have an opinion about him evans says putin is someone who needs careful handling nuttall says he agrees with evans but russia is not the biggest threat facing the country it is islamic extremism evans says the uk security services have suggested that terrorists could be coming to europe posing as refugees evans says she was angry when she saw child refugees coming to the uk there are children in the uk who are not being looked after properly she says it is reasonable to check their ages rees evans said he recently went to calais his investigation was on bulgarian tv he says many migrants there have sold their homes they spend 10 , 000 or 11 , 000 there are genuine refugees , he says he spoke to 39 refugees but he thinks only three or four of them were genuinely fleeing for their lives rees evans says he has 10 acres there his wife likes organic food , and they can grow their own food on their land evans says she would like him to stay involved she would like him to be an elder statesman , someone she could consult that is how she used to work with him it would be like alex salmond and nicola sturgeon , she says whittle says she would like farage to stay involved rees evans says , if you do not like farage , you can vote for nuttall , because nuttall and evans both favour shunting farage off into the lords nuttall says he has worked with farage for years farage should become the honorary president of the party and , if he wants a peerage , he should get one after 2019 farage wont be an mep , he points out rees evans says he wants to introduce direct democracy into the party evans says that is not the case she wrote the party manifesto you cannot make policy like this , he says rees evans says that illustrates the problem she does not trust members nuttall says the last time something like this was tried was when labour wrote its manifesto in 1983 he implies rees evans idea wont work nuttall says ukip is the only party that has a blanket ban on anyone who has been a member of the bnp joining just because you want to control immigration that does not make you a racist , he says evans says she did not approve of the anti immigrant poster released during the campaign she tells the spanish caller she has a beautiful voice rees evans says the media are partly to blame the media accuse ukip of being racist and so , after the vote to leave , genuine racists thought that people who voted to leave the eu were also racist the media needs to consider its responsibility , he says whittle says the london assembly has looked at this hate crime has been going up for some time anyway , he says and he says that the increase over the summer was linked to terrorist attacks taking place at the same time whittle says these people do not make that distinction nuttall says he is very sorry for what has happened to the female caller but he is not responsible brexit is a great thing , he says he says the government should repeal the european communities act nuttall says the hate crime figures did not go up substantially after the referendum but both sides pushed the boundaries well , the 350m a week claim , nuttall says nuttall says that poster was correct the uk does need to get control of its borders but he says eu nationals should not feel under threat they will not be asked to go home nuttall says there has been a slight rise in hate crime but this kind of thing happens after every national event nuttall seeks to downplay significance of rise in hate crime after brexit not necessarily , says rees evans he says he employs 800 people , and he does not employ them for their gender whittle says he does not think this is relevant he did not stand for london mayor on the basis of being gay evans says she does not think gender should matter nuttall also says he does not think gender should be a factor suzanne evans photograph lbc he can be , says nuttall nuttall says if he becomes elected leader , he will see all ukips parliamentarians and try to get them to work together whittle says a recent book \( the brexit club , by owen bennett \) says carswell joined ukip to undermine nigel farage he says this needs to be addressed carswell has not commented on this , he says evans says she has worked with carswell he did not join the party to undermine farage he says having an mp in the party is a big asset rees evans says carwell criticised farage at a time when the party needed unity rees evans says people

a russian dissident jailed under a controversial new kremlin law says he is being beaten , repeatedly tortured and threatened with murder at the penal colony where he is being held in north west russia ildar dadin says he is the victim of systematic abuse perpetrated by the head of the prison , maj sergey kossiev , and his staff he alleges that kossiev has told him that if he complains about his treatment he will be killed and secretly buried a kremlin spokesman , dmitry peskov , told reporters on tuesday that president vladimir putin would be informed of the allegations , while russian media reported that the regional branch of russias investigative committee would look into dadins claims in response to the letter , amnesty international has called for dadins release we are urging russian authorities to end the pattern of impunity for torture and other ill treatment and investigate ildar dadins appalling allegations , sergei nikitin , the director of amnesty international russia , said they must also immediately and unconditionally release ildar dadin , and provide him with full remedy for the injustice done to him dadin , 34 , was jailed in 2015 after staging a series of anti government protests he was convicted under a new law which criminalises public assembly , and given a three year sentence , which was later cut to two and a half in the letter to his wife , anastasia , smuggled out of prison by his lawyer , he described having all of his belongings confiscated , and claims two razor blades were planted on him as an excuse to send him to solitary confinement by way of punishment the following day he says kossiev arrived with three prison warders and began to beat him over the course of that day , i was beaten a total four times , by 10 12 people at once they would kick me , he writes after the third beating , they lowered my head into a toilet right there in the holding cell he goes on to describe being cuffed and hung from the ceiling being suspended in this manner brought about terrible pain in the wrists , twisted out my elbows , and caused horrible back pain i was suspended like that for half an hour then they took off my underwear and said they would bring another prisoner to rape me unless i stopped my hunger strike the prison boss later allegedly told dadin that if he complained his beatings could be made worse , and he could be killed and buried under the fence dadin also claims he is being beaten several times a day as well as bullied and routinely humiliated this is happening with the other prisoners , as well , he writes mikhail khodorkovsky , the oligarch who spent 10 years in jail in russia before being amnestied in 2013 , told the guardian he was familiar with these conditions khodorkovsky said he was locked up in the same penal colony in karelia after being convicted for a second time ildar dadin has finished up in the same prison camp , simply for protesting peacefully and for expressing his personal views before i was there , in soviet times , political prisoners were locked up there too , he says its an extremely tough place in recent years the prison authorities specialised in breaking serious criminals using illegal methods im afraid were once more in times where the new task is the intimidation of political activists russian prison officials cast doubt on the claims not one physical injury has been found on dadin , said the deputy head of russias prison service , valery maksimenko , according to the russian news agency interfax russian newspaper novaya gazeta quoted an unidentified local prison service official as acknowledging that physical force had been used on dadin , but only when he refused to leave his cell or defied prison guards dadin denies the accusations bill browder , the chief executive of hermitage capital investment fund , said dadins treatment was reminiscent of that meted out to his lawyer , sergei magnitsky magnitsky was jailed and died in prison in 2009 after uncovering a 230m \( 188m \) tax fraud carried out by senior kremlin officials kremlin pours cold water on mi5 chief 's claims of russian threat read morebrowder said those responsible for torturing dadin should be put on the magnitsky sanctions list , introduced by the us and several eu countries the act freezes the assets of russian officials who violate human rights what shocked me is that they hung him up by his wrists it brought me right back to seven years ago when sergei magnitsky was killed , browder said i pray it doesnt happen to dadin approximately 50 people went to the moscow headquarters of the federal penitentiary service on tuesday night to submit requests for an investigation into dadins mistreatment , a photographer at the scene said ildar dadins letter in fullnastya ! if you decide to publish this information about what is happening to me , then try to distribute it as widely as possible this will increase my chances of staying alive know that there is an entire mafia operating at penal colony 7 it involves the entire administration , among them the colonys head major sergey leonidovich kossiev and the vast majority of its employees , including the doctors upon my arrival at the colony on 10 september , i had practically all of my things taken away from me two razor blades were then planted amongst my remaining possessions and subsequently discovered during an inspection this is a common practice here it gives them grounds to throw all newcomers into solitary confinement , to ensure they immediately understand the hell that they found themselves in i was put into solitary without any official orders all of my things were taken away , including soap , my toothbrush , toothpaste , and even toilet paper in protest of these illegal activities , i went on a hunger strike on 11 september , the colony head kossiev came to me with three employees together , they started beating me over the course of that day , i was beaten a total four times , by 10 12 people at once they would kick me after the third beating , they lowered my head into a toilet right there in the holding cell on 12 september , several employees cuffed my hands behind my back and hung me up being suspended in this manner brought about terrible pain in the wrists , twisted out my elbows , and caused horrible back pain i was suspended like that for half an hour then they took off my underwear and said they would bring another prisoner to rape me unless i stopped my hunger strike i ask you to publish this letter because there is a information blockade and i see no other way to break through itafter that , i was brought to kossievs office , where he said to me in the presence of other staff you have been beaten very little if i give the order , you will be beaten much worse if you try to complain , they will kill you and bury you under the fence after that , they beat me regularly , several times a day regular beatings , bullying , humiliation , insults , intolerable detention conditions this is happening with the other prisoners , as well all subsequent punishments were based on blatant lies all of the videos in which i was filmed being penalised were staged before filming , they would tell me how to behave and what to do not to argue , not to protest , to look at the floor otherwise , they said , they would kill me and no one would know about it , because no one knows where i am i cannot send letters without going through the administration first , and the administration has promised to kill me if i write any complaints nastya , i ask you to publish this letter because there is a real information blockade in this place and i see no other opportunities to break through it i am not asking you to get me out of here or to have me transferred to another facility i have repeatedly seen and heard how other prisoners are being beaten , so my conscience will not allow me to run away from here i am going to fight to help others i am not afraid of death most of all , i am afraid not being able to withstand the torture and surrendering if the committee against torture a russian human rights ngo has not yet been destroyed in russia , i ask for their assistance in ensuring my right to life and security and those of other prisoners in russia i ask to you to openly reveal that major kossiev has directly threatened to murder me for any attempt to complain about what is happening i will be glad if you find an attorney who will be able to reside in segezha near the colony and provide legal support mikhail khodorkovsky on life after prison and russia after putin read moretime is against me surveillance footage would be able to prove that such torture and beatings are happening , but it is becoming less and less likely that such footage remains intact if i am again subjected to torture , beatings and rape , it is unlikely that i will last more than a week in case of my sudden death , you may be told that i committed suicide , had an accident , was shot while trying to escape , or died fighting with another prisoner , but this would be a lie my murder would have been planned in advance to eliminate witnesses and victims of torture i love you and i hope to see you someday your ildar topicsrussianew east networkeuropehuman rightsnewsshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
the news is hard to escape these days , with many people hearing about world events not just from news websites but also on social media platforms but what impact is this having on children \? it could be making them more anxious , according to the nspccs childline service it reported an increase in the number of children seeking help for anxiety , with concern around world affairs such as the eu referendum and syria conflict its thought that the rise is down to a combination of personal and political issues , while the charity said others felt it was also partly due to disturbing events seen in the media and on social media we asked parents and grandparents about their experience of this , and how they try to calm children down about world affairs young and anxious do your children express fears over global events \? read moresalley vickers , from london my granddaughter loses sleep over terrorist attacksi am a former psychoanalyst , working with people who suffered serious trauma , and am now a full time novelist my eldest grandchild , aged 11 , is extremely anxious about political events , particularly potential terrorist attacks she has become worried about travelling on the tube in london when she visits me she is also worried about going into big shopping centres because of the threat of bombs and was deeply concerned after the paris attacks she is not at all frightened by any supposed muslim threat indeed , she is rather promuslim having many muslim peers , which is a good and reassuring aspect of modern childrens education , but she is insecure about being suddenly attacked in a place that she previously experienced as familiar and fun she loves coming to london but feels being there is nowadays more dangerous these concerns affect her sleep she has confided she has periods of lying awake , worrying about terrorism and reassurances that it will not happen to her do not , and in my view cannot , dispel her concerns my experience of working with trauma convinces me that anxiety needs to be addressed and not given a superficial bandage of comfort my granddaughter doesnt have a computer or ipod , or direct access to the web on her phone , but inevitably she sees the news with her parents and hears about whats happening in school from other children who tend to big up scary events inevitably , she absorbs often false or exaggerated information from her peers who have access to social media while she cannot check out the truth what they say in my view , the current state of the world needs to be discussed in schools as well as at home , and the spreading of rumour and gossip about scary events needs to be addressed more fully as a serious element in the school curriculum teachers need to rethink how children are introduced to political world events now there is so much greater access to them more consideration needs to be given to the way social media , which can now feed into a bullying process , affects children bullying is hardly a novel phenomenon in schools but i dont think we are really up to speed with the way political events can be deployed to terrify the less well informed or the more sensitive there needs to be greater education on civic responsibility for everyone and i believe for the sake of a responsible future society it should start at a younger age children need to be taught to look at the news and public reactions critically and not take them at face value , in the way they were once taught to be critical of texts amet akolawin , 28 , from london my daughter gets more anxious about issues such as global warmingmy daughter , who turns eight next week , watches the news when i do , so in the morning and evening she also watches cbbcs newsround most days we do talk about the headlines a lot , she takes an interest in what is going on around the world she does worry about some of the stuff she sees , just yesterday at bedtime we spoke about the us election and the wall donald trump wishes to build between mexico and america it lead on to us chatting about the berlin wall and the great wall of china my daughter is very inquisitive so talking about news is an simple way to give her some insight and pass on some of my knowledge she doesnt like watching clips of war torn countries , but she will still listen to what the report is saying she is quite sensitive so if there is a piece on syria , for example , and i think the images are disturbing , her i will ask her if she would like to watch something else to be honest she gets more anxiety from topics touched on in school , such as global warming and natural disasters we go to visit her gran in sardinia twice a year and much of the news recently has been about the earthquake there she has become very fixated about this and i havent been able to reassure her about her uncle lives in rome so its understandable that she would worry but its definitely made her afraid of something similar happening to her when shes there jessica eaton , 26 , from staffordshire my sons worry they will end up as refugees and no one will take care of themmy sons , who are five and eight , had a shocking realisation about three months ago that the war in syria was real they had been in the room with me and my husband when we were discussing the decision to launch airstrikes in syria we were watching footage about the civilian casualties and condemning the decision they have lots and lots of questions about war , politics and weapons the boys went away to play for a while and must have got talking because they came back into the living room shortly afterwards very upset , saying real people are dying in syria , with real guns and bombs they had got confused between real and pretend war because of how war is depicted in video games and the fact that they have toy guns my five year old son started to cry , saying we need to stop the shops and the government from selling things that try to make war and bombs and guns fun because its real mum its happening in syria its not the first time the news has made them upset my boys worry a lot about war and nuclear weapons they also worry that they might end up refugees too and no one will love them or want them they have lots and lots of questions about war , politics and weapons i dont shield them from current affairs and i dont lie to them , but instead spend time explaining stuff and suggesting empowering solutions , such as getting them to make posters or write a letter to the government we have also registered to take in refugee children for fostering while the media is busy playing everyone off against one another , children are absorbing dangerous messages from all sides our children spend more time using technology than any other generation and are very engaged in the media i would prefer them to experience moral uncertainty and question everything they read rather than just swallowing information anonymous , 41 , from london my eldest worries about animals dying and the destruction of the earthmy eldest , who is nine , has been very worried about climate change since he did a class project on habitats last year he often talks about environmental issues , such as animals dying , trees disappearing and the general destruction of the earth both my children actually stopped eating meat last year and decided to become vegetarian theres a lot of focus on this issue and they cry when they think about animals being killed they even made a how to save our planet game together we dont allow our children to watch the news the images are too graphic and the language is not suitable for under 10s they occasionally hear the news on the radio , but we monitor their internet use , only letting them online for a limited time they dont have access to any social media despite their protests but this is at home , outside in the world we cant censor or guide them in what they hear or read social media is impossible to censor thus we have a blanket ban geoff jein , 36 , from london brexit was the worst news my son had ever heard my son is quite sensitive , but half hearing news headlines and stories does make him anxious he usually asks questions about stories four or five weeks after he has seen them , which makes me think hes been worrying for all that time a particular concern for him at the moment is donald trump getting elected at the time of the primaries he picked up on him being a joke candidate and being a disaster for the world if elected some of his friends in schools do donald trump impressions that their parents taught them , so trump is a bit of a funny character in school but then he hears phrases like , this man could have his finger on the nuclear button , and gets worried he takes things very literally so imagines there actually being a button the brexit result really upset him we were late to school that morning trying to calm him down geoff jeinwe dont let him watch the news but he hears the headlines as the 10 second trailer for the 6pm news usually comes on after programmes he likes watching thats worse , because he just hears the headlines and gets no other details and then worries he is not on social media as he is too young and i dont think any of his friends are either the brexit result really upset him it got to the point where we were late to school that morning trying to calm him down he thought that it was the worst news he had ever heard he was so scared of leaving europe i take the blame for that really , as i didnt see it coming i gave him a very polemic view of why we should stay and no insight really into why some people wanted to leave i am hoping to give him more information on news events now so he is less anxious a few weeks ago , for example , i signed up to the week junior , which is a magazine that explains big news events to children anonymous , 45 , from kent we need to help children analyse media stories and sources of informationsince the age of seven my daughter has worried about global events but its not had a negative impact she listens to the radio , reads the week junior and watches newsround daily if she wants to find out more , we research it together online we discuss stories and sources of news regularly after the paris attacks , a number of children were pulled out of a trip to london i discussed this with my daughter and explained that the government does all it can to keep citizens safe , and why you cant let terrorists win we thought about what we could do , so she wrote to david cameron and got a response a few weeks later its important to give children a way to try to positively effect change we also need to help them to understand risk and analyse media stories , and sources of

its been a long old day , and quite a dramatic one as mark carneys future came to a head faster than most experts expected no one really predicted that the boe governor would split the difference between his fans , and his critics , and plump to do an extra 12 months duty at threadneedle street thats why the decision has been greeted fairly calmly , with the government insisting its good news , but businesses understandably concerned about what happens in 2019 sir martin sorrell probably spoke for many business leaders when he said it was a pity that carney wouldnt be at the helm until 2021 whatever you think about the european union , theres an argument that its better not to change central bank governors in the middle of the brexit negotiations now , the treasury has almost three years to find the perfect candidate to replace carney on 1 july 2019 and help steer britain into its post eu future the immediate reaction from the city is still quite positive , with the pound up 0 6 of a cent at 1 2245 bloomberg brexit \( brexit \) the pound rose when mark carney said he 'd stay at the bank of england until 2019 https t co bce96yn2bt pic twitter com 4nwz7ehnq7october 31 , 2016well may find out one day how hard theresa may fought to keep carney , or whether this compromise really suits all parties we may also find out whether the governor still has serious political ambitions back in canada several commentators , including bloombergs jill ward , have suggested he has an eye on the next federal elections , which are due in late 2019 jill ward \( jillianfward \) and right before the next canadian federal election cdnpolioctober 31 , 2016with that , im wrapping up for the night larry elliotts full story on carneys decision is now live heres a flavour mark carney to serve extra year as bank of england governor mark carney has ended weeks of speculation about his future by agreeing to stay on as governor of the bank of england until brexit negotiations with the eu have ended in 2019 despite being urged by the prime minister , theresa may , and the chancellor , philip hammond , to serve a full eight year term at threadneedle street , until 2021 , carney said he would only agree to remain in place for an extra year hestarted in the job in july 2013 the governor said in a letter to hammond that he had intended to leave the bank for personal reasons after five years , but the altered landscape for the uk following the vote in june to leave the eu had caused him to change his mind mark carney to serve extra year as bank of england governor read moregoodnight , and thanks for reading and commenting gw elizabeth martins , an economist with hsbc , has dubbed carneys decision a halfway house \( which is a relief , as i plumped for that term earlier \) \) she says i guess that markets would have liked to see a 2021 extension , and expected it given indications in the media but this will go down better than an earlier departure \( thats via reuters \) and howard archer of ihs global insight has given the news two cheers out of three , and suggests carneys detractors should rein themselves in now that mr carney has made his intentions clear , it is to be hoped that everyone gives the governor maximum support , including his critics the uk faces a very challenging period ahead which will be demanding for all policymakers matters will not be helped by sniping at the bank of england governor or making statements that seemingly question at the bank of englands independence some bank of england trivia , from newnights lewis goodall lewis goodall \( lewis goodall \) if you were wondering this makes carney the shortest serving governor of the bank of england since leslie o'brien in the 60s you were n't \?

those of you unfamiliar with the old testament will most likely know the teachings of ezekiel from pulp fiction there , samuel l jackson solemnly intones that prophets words before clipping some kids the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men in the walking dead , there is a new ezekiel not a prophet trapped in babylonian bondage , but a former star of community theatre playing the role of king of an apparently thriving community in post zombie apocalypse usa hes a compelling character , with lavish dreadlocks , shakespearean regal patter and nearly forgot a tiger on a chain this last trapping of kingly power , as you might expect , impresses his subjects who believe the hokum that he wrestled the big cat into submission the truth that ezekiel was a zookeeper who found the injured beast alone in a pen after the zombie outbreak and tended it back to health and thence obedience is , to my mind , hardly less far fetched no matter who doesnt like watching a cgi tiger \? that said , the life of pi set the bar high put a tiger on a raft with a boy on the indian ocean , then see what happens what a premise ! shiva , king ezekiels noble pet , has its work cut out to eclipse that performance this new ezekiel is beset like his predecessor by inequities of the selfish not least having to produce weekly truckloads of goods for negans darkly evil gang the saviours , who we saw at work last week , torturing and murdering members of ricks crew for the best part of 45 minutes after that scarcely watchable episode , this more contemplative one was a blessed relief but heres the twist when king ezekiel and his horse riding breastplate wearing henchpersons \( who look like game of thrones extras duded up in 21st century us army surplus \) supplied negans hoods with the carcasses of eight kingdom reared pigs as their weekly tribute , little did the saviours know the horrible truth those pigs had been reared on zombie flesh i didnt pay attention in nutrition 101 , but my guess is that king ezekiel was subtly trying to slay his oppressors with this grotesque pork it was , perhaps , his application of what the other ezekiel said in the bible about striking down with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers except now its ezekiel whos doing the poisoning its the return of carol the dissembler , who we last saw with her brutish husband photograph fox when world weary carol was brought by morgan to ezekiels court to recuperate after serial unpleasantnesses involving the tyranny of evil men , she was sceptical about the kingdom , but initially confided her doubts only to morgan i enjoyed the resulting return of carol the dissembler , who we last saw with her brutish husband , smiling impossibly sweetly as she receives the kingdoms bounty breakfast cobbler ! its like flavour on top of flavour ! she exclaimed cod enthusiastically after being offered a meal by an underling we were eating possums out there she was faking it , of course really , she thought the kingdom was a joke , a cosy lie that distracted king ezekiels subjects from the unbearable reality of human life that has become nasty , brutish and most likely short what made this episode so effective was that both carol and morgan arrived at the kingdom beset by their own existential crises she was despairing over life what is the point of surviving if it just brings more killing and death \? he was wondering if he could and indeed should rejoin the path of non violence after recently killing one of the saviours to stop him murdering carol in a particularly fine scene , ezekiel called carol on her despair he told carol the dissembler that he recognised her type whats that saying , he asked her never bullshit a bullshitter \? he realised she despised the kingdom , but thought she needed to understand how it works before passing judgment the marvellous khary payton as king ezekiel , flitting between speeches that were more merrie england than post apocalypse georgia \( we have matters of great import to attend to \) and then into down home demotic \( i faked it till i made it \) , explained that his kingdom worked on the principle of the platonic noble lie he had no real royal lineage , no true heroic exploits but none of that mattered if he was to be an effective ruler why \? people want someone to follow its human nature they want someone to make them feel safe and so he did ezekiel even arranged the slaughter of the pigs out of his subjects earshot so the squeals didnt freak them out and he didnt confide the truth about the compromising deal hed cut with the saviours he was , or at this point seemed to be , a good man as the other ezekiel put it blessed is he , who in the name of charity and good will , shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness , for he is truly his brothers keeper and the finder of lost children this latter day ezekiel , then , ruled a kingdom that is an oasis of seeming civilisation walled against the surrounding barbarism it had allotments , livestock , a little school , a choir , even fruit baskets to welcome guests like carol in this year of bob dylan becoming nobel laureate , how fitting that the kingdoms choir was rehearsing his bobnesss dont think twice , its all right , that song of farewell to a lover who wasnt all that carol and morgan both arrived at the kingdom beset by their own existential crises photograph foxthe choir sang it aint no use to sit and wonder why , babe quite so aint no use wonderin just get on with living perhaps that was why morgan found a role at the kingdom , training a young man called ben in aikido , this martial virtuosity with a staff and perhaps in his code of never killing humans carol refused to be so readily co opted into the kingdom youre a joke , she sneered at ezekiel out there its real perhaps but , suggested ezekiel , life must be about more than mere survival if it is worth living or as he put it where theres life , theres hope heroism , grace and love those are the necessary fictions , perhaps , that make human life liveable he invited her to stay , since hope is what youre walking away from i embraced the contradiction maybe you could but , apparently , carol didnt at the end of the episode , morgan took her to a house where she planned to live a life of bitter renunciation on her own like the freewheelin bob dylan in that song the choir was rehearsing , carol was off on the dark side of the road and then , rather wonderfully , there was a knock at her door , followed by a feline growl it was ezekiel and shiva , come to pay their respects clearly carol hadnt moved that far away from the liveable lie that is the kingdom perhaps , we hope , carol hasnt given up on hope plus , maybe or maybe im wrong the kings visit had more than neighbourly intentions ezekiel had brought a pomegranate you really gotta try one of these , he said , suggestively we could do with a nice romance to make season sevens current bleakness more palatable would be words of wisdom the pessimist looks down and loses his head the optimist looks up and loses his footing the realist looks forward and adjusts his path accordingly king ezekiel , explaining his philosophy to morgan people cant show you the way you have to find it yourself morgan , explaining his philosophy to ben the dead are alive best not the alive be dead the slogan painted on the walls of the canteen in the kingdom topicsthe walking deadthe walking dead episode by episodetelevisionepisode recapsus televisionshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content

prime minister matteo renzi swore that italy would rebuild devastated towns and villages across central italy that were rocked by a 6 6 magnitude earthquake on sunday morning , saying the area represented the soul of our country it was the most powerful earthquake to hit italy since 1980 , striking a blow to the regions of marche and umbria just days after they were hit by two other earthquakes it also frightened and displaced thousands of already jittery residents who have seen the ancient structures and walls in their towns , including the san benedetto basilica in norcia , which is considered a sacred site , crumble into heaps on the street we will rebuild everything the houses , the churches , the shops we are dealing with marvelous territories , territories of beauty , renzi said the epicentre of the latest earthquake was about 40 miles \( 68km \) \( 40 miles \) south west of perugia and close to the town of norcia , which had also been hit by wednesday nights quakes there were no reported fatalities in the wake of the quake on sunday , although it was even more powerful than the 2009 earthquake that hit laquila , killing more than 300 people , and worse than the august earthquake that killed hundreds in amatrice there were about a dozen injuries , with one person described as being in serious condition emergency services pulled three people from the rubble in tolentino , a town in marche main roads to the affected areas were closed , some impassable due to large boulders falling to the ground in the rocky , mountainous terrain were safe , alberto rendina , the owner of a bar in norcia , told la stampa this morning , my wife was late opening the bar and was saved the family was at home but had been sleeping on the floor near the door , in preparation for any eventuality , rendina said residents in visso , a town of 1 , 107 in marche , told sky tv that their homes are no longer there the bedroom has collapsed into the living room , one resident said a man looked stunned as he was asked question by a journalist on television and could barely answer as he fiddled with a crate holding his dog , which he put in the back of a pick up truck regional officials in marche warned that the earthquakes could lead to 100 , 000 residents being displaced requests for some 5 , 000 beds have been made to hotels along the adriatic coast but we think this number will rise , marco manfredi , the chief of the ancona unit for confcommercio , the italian business association , told la stampa the earthquakes in august and earlier this week had already displaced about 14 , 000 , said paolo bazzurro , professor of hazard and risk assessment at the university institute for superior studies \( iuss \) in pavia , but he said the number would rise that there have not been any deaths is partly due to the fact that many houses were not inhabited after the quake on wednesday also there were many that hadnt been inspected yet , so people would not have received an order to return home , bazzurro said with the winter drawing in , housing people will be much more complicated , he added , saying more aftershocks or other earthquakes could be expected in the next days and weeks while there was relative relief that the area was spared mass casualties , there were other losses that were devastating centuries old structures , including the cathedral and basilica of san benedetto in norcia , a 14th century church that was built to honor the patron saint of europe , saint benedict , was reduced to rubble , as was a tower and st augustine church in amatrice news of the basilicas destruction was confirmed by benedictine monks in norcia who reported it on twitter in a statement on sunday morning the monks said they were safe because they had temporarily moved their monastery after augusts earthquake in amatrice , but that there were looking for victims who might possible require the sacrament of last rites , given to people close to death the statement , posted below an image of the ruined basilica , said may this image serve to illustrate the power of this earthquake , and the urgency we monks feel to seek out those who need the sacraments on this difficult day for italy the quake was strongly felt in rome , where it temporarily shut the citys metro lines to let officials check for damage , and some reported feeling tremors as far away as tremors in neighbouring countries slovenia and croatia st pauls outside the walls basilica was also temporarily shut after some plaster fell off the church but was later reopened vatican firefighters inspected st peters basilica and other churches in the area on sunday morning , live television images showed firefighters in norcias main square helping people running down small alleyways seeking safety , including monks and nuns from a nearby monastery some then fell to their knees in prayer in the towns main square towns affected by italian earthquakemajor destruction was also reported in other small towns it all came down now there is no more town , said aleandro petrucci , the mayor of the marche town of arquata del tronto there had already been red zones in place , abandoned after the previous quakes the few people who remained have gone out to the streets and are embracing now were going around to see what happened , he said cesare spuri , the head of civil protection in marche , said there are collapses everywhere we report collapses in muccia , tolentino and in the areas surrounding macerata were trying to establish if people are underneath the rubble there was also a strong shock in ancona everythings collapsed i see plumes of smoke , its a disaster , said marco rinaldi , the mayor of ussita , a town in the marche that was among the worst hit in a 6 1 magnitude quake on wednesday night in rome , the strong tremors caused concern i was woken up by the earthquake , gianpaolo giovannelli , who lives in the flaminio area of rome , told the guardian the apartment started to shake we feel them here in rome , but we never get used to them so each time we feel fear assia staffoli , from rome , said her husband put their six year old daughter under

the latest furore over hillary clintons alleged misuse of private emails when she was secretary of state in 2009 2013 has thrown a tumultuous and unedifying us presidential election into even greater confusion , with little more than a week to go before voting day the fbis unexpected and very public revelation that it is recommencing its investigation into clintons conduct may not be politically motivated , but its timing certainly makes it appear that way the row represents yet another hammer blow to a democratic process whose credibility has been repeatedly challenged , principally by the unscrupulous republican candidate , donald trump despite this new firestorm , stoked by republicans and rightwing media , it remains likely that american voters will deliver a clear , possibly resounding , rejection of trump on 8 november although opinion polls show the race tightening nationally and nothing is certain as a febrile campaign climaxes , clinton is ahead almost everywhere that matters and she is the sane and reasonable , if uninspiring , choice a trump defeat will be richly deserved as we have noted previously , he is not a fit and proper person to serve in the white house his behaviour during a long , raucous and often embarrassingly vulgar campaign made that abundantly plain yet consigning the donald to the rubbish bin of electoral history is easier than getting rid of trumpism this is likely to take a lot longer trumps platform was based not on thought through policies and careful analysis but on prejudice , grievance , ignorance and fear , spiced with opportunism his unexpected success in winning the nomination , despite the republican establishments hostility , reflected his close identification with mainly white , working class and lower middle class voters who , like him , feel angry , undervalued and alienated while public figures such as barack obama , trumps failed republican rival jeb bush and clinton appear to this constituency to be remote , out of touch and uncaring , trumpism peddles the delusion that the candidate is on their side again and again , in ohio , florida and elsewhere , disaffected voters claimed that only trump could be trusted to tell the truth , only trump would keep his promises , only trump could make america great again oblivious to paradox , irony , history or facts , trumpism projects a distorted vision of american greatness the trump doctrine decrees that a nation built by immigrants , that became the most powerful on earth is so scared of migrant and refugee hordes that it must build a 2 , 000 mile wall with mexico trumpism holds that a great nation that incorporated religious tolerance into its groundbreaking constitution and bill of rights must now shatter its own principles and deliberately discriminate against muslims to keep itself safe as general concepts , trumpism makes an enemy of the other , equates nationality with homogeneity , calls honest critics liars and seeks to threaten , jail or harm opponents it says individualism outweighs state authority , as in the unfettered right to bear firearms , but not , perversely , in the case of a womans right to choose abortion trumpism distrusts and fears foreigners it believes free trade , international treaties and economic globalisation in general are loaded dice intended to rip off americans paranoid trumpism holds that long term allies such as germany and japan get a free security ride at americas expense trumpism admires the domestic authoritarianism and international bullying of dictatorships in russia and china vladimir putin is a strong leader standing up for his people , national beliefs and way of life any inconvenient truth that contradicts this or other trumpist narratives is inherently mendacious , part of a web of lies and falsehoods spun by the treacherous mass media conspiring with the establishment to dupe honest citizens and dont forget trumpism cannot be fairly defeated if it loses , it was cheated for sure trumpism appeals to the worst in people , cynically exploiting and fanning the anger , grievances and prejudices of the economically disadvantaged , the embittered , uneducated and plain ignorant it appeals to base instincts , to lowest common denominators its is political dumbing down writ large it is underpinned by a pervasive and comprehensible insecurity , engendered across the west by post 2008 economic injustice and social division , the growing gulf between rich and poor and incompetent , unfeeling or corrupt governance fear is the common enemy , but fear is trumpisms friend this phenomenon is not confined to america european countries , including britain , experience variations on the theme in germany and france , concern about rising immigration has boosted hardline nationalists whose appeal and disturbing ideology extend far beyond the cathartic issue of syria in greece , poland , austria and hungary , rightwing extremists evil , dehumanising ideas about refugees , migrants and foreigners in general have become a commonplace of political discussion in britain , ukip , provides a noisy echo chamber for some of trumpisms most divisive , chauvinistic and discriminatory refrains if trumpism is indeed a transnational pestilence , it would be wise to look for a common remedy but first , the symptoms must be accurately diagnosed and its long term effects should not be exaggerated much of the political turbulence and iconoclasm witnessed of late in america and europe is the direct result of continuing , negative economic fallout from the 2008 financial crash hard times , austerity cuts , high unemployment and low wages are the manure in which political aberration takes root but as history shows , they sometimes , yet rarely , lead to disaster when economies improve , generally speaking , so too does the quality of political discourse ensuring all people benefit equally from such an improvement is the one certain antidote to extreme politics while protest movements share characteristics and aims , it is also evident that they are not all the same as each other trumpism is an infection others can catch , yet it is also unique to america before panicking about the advance of the far right and far left in europe , commentators in britain and elsewhere should remember that , when all is said and done , mainstream politicians such as angela merkel , alain jupp , mariano rajoy and yes , hillary clinton do , on the whole , get elected or re elected notwithstanding greeces epic upheavals , the centre does mostly hold more than anything else , trumpism will fade and fail because , ultimately , it is a minority pastime , pandering to bigotry , which runs against the grain and spirit of the times , brexit notwithstanding trumpism decries the impact of globalisation , yet globalisation , for all the dislocation and often unwelcome change it brings , is the inescapable way ahead for a more integrated , more connected and more mutually responsible and caring world for good or bad , this clock cannot be turned back closed borders and closed minds , crude nationalism , trade barriers , xenophobia , religious , racial and sexual discrimination these are old mistakes and old hatreds that , while still in evidence everywhere , belong to times past the world is moving forward , not

by declining to put up an official candidate to fight the richmond park byelection , the conservative party has shown itself to be cynical , cowardly and rational it took the decision knowing that it is not a great look for the governing party to absent itself from the contest it calculated that it would be an even more dreadful look to field someone in the colours of mrs may and see them slaughtered which is what would have happened the chances of an official tory candidate winning in this leafy patch of southwest london would have been somewhat lower than a flying saucer piloted by elvis and lord lucan landing on the head of the loch ness monster there is no constituency in the country with a more intense concentration of rage about heathrow expansion and the government has just declared that it wants to multiply the number of planes flying over its rooftops the constituency voted heavily to remain within the european union and the government is embarked on a trajectory towards one of the harder versions of brexit a candidate in the name of the tory party would have split the conservative vote , enhancing the chances of the lib dems taking the seat so cowardice and cynicism combined with logic yet this does not mean that the absence of an official competitor for the tory party is an unalloyed blessing for zac goldsmith , the former conservative mp who is recontesting the seat in the guise of an independent once upon a time , when he had a reputation as someone who was not enslaved to his partys line , he might have been convincing in that role not now only a few months ago , he was the conservative candidate for mayor of london moreover , he made the disastrous decision not to run on his own terms , but to be the frontman for a racially charged campaign designed by the tory machine both nasty and ineffective , even his sister , jemima khan , was moved to publicly deplore that campaign only very occasionally in british politics have we seen genuine independents in parliament one such was martin bell , the former bbc correspondent famed for his white suit , who ran and won as the anti sleaze candidate against neil hamilton in tatton at the 1997 election zac goldsmith is no martin bell to see how truly independent he is , we only have to visit the website of the local tory party when i checked there on saturday , the banner at the top of the home page still featured his mugshot alongside the tory logo the strapline read supporting zac goldsmith in the richmond park constituency the video content is a stream of images of the man who is supposedly no longer a member of their party a statement by the chairman says that the association and its resources will not play a part in this byelection , before declaring that individuals who are members of the association may well wish to support zacs campaign and they are at liberty to do so it then provides an email address for joining his campaign statements from the tory party nationally have conveyed their warmest wishes for his re election should he be returned as an mp , it is widely suspected , and he has not denied it , that he will only sit as an independent for a while before , after an interval he judges to be decent , rejoining the tory party if words in politics retain any meaning , zac goldsmith is no independent if he is re elected , it will be a message to mrs may to carry on as you are it is a big challenge to run as a genuine independent because they cant usually compete with the money , logistical capacity and activist base at the disposal of organised parties i guess the money is no obstacle in this case the trustafarian mr goldsmith has exceedingly deep pockets there is an issue over how much support overt or clandestine he is going to get from the conservative party will the tory machine feed him with voter data \? this is a highly valuable commodity , especially at a byelection when turnout is often pivotal to the outcome it seems to be a legal grey area whether the tory party can gift him resources without it counting against the byelection spending limit or whether he should be expected to pay a commercial rate and count that as a campaign expense he starts with some significant advantages he has a well known name , enjoys the benefits of incumbency and won a chunky majority of more than 20 , 000 in 2015 the first opinion poll for what its worth has him comfortably ahead in an age that expects politicians to betray their pledges when they become inconvenient , he may earn credit with some voters for keeping his promise to resign and recontest the seat if his party went ahead with heathrow expansion here , though , is a paradox this byelection may have been triggered by the runway decision , but it is essentially irrelevant to the contest his lib dem rivals are just as opposed to the expansion of heathrow and , unlike mr goldsmiths party , they have always been united in their conviction that it is a terrible idea the lib dems , who came second in the seat in 2015 and held it until 2010 , ache for the boost in media attention and party morale that they would receive from a victory vince cable suggested that he might be up for attempting a comeback there , but in the end he did not apply to be the candidate it concerns some lib dems that their flagbearer , sarah olney , lacks the name recognition and the experience of her opponent , but that has not prevented them from pulling off byelection sensations before tim farrons party seeks to cast the contest as a referendum on the tory government and particularly its trajectory towards a hard brexit this makes sense if they are to see a national revival from their near death experience at the last general election , a good hunting ground for the lib dems is among remain voters alienated from both a brexiteering tory government and corbyn labour on europe , labour is split and scared about how to deal with the division between its london stronghold , which voted heavily for in , and its midland , northern and welsh heartlands , where there was hefty support for out that prevents labour from being a clear voice for the 48 the lib dems dont have that difficulty they can be unequivocal opponents of hard brexit they believe that helped them to do well at the recent witney byelection where they leapfrogged from fourth place to second , with a swing of 19 the swing to them from the tories would only have to be a smidge higher for the lib dems to take richmond park mr goldsmith is at odds with most of his constituents , who voted by more than two to one to remain within the european union it is probably not to his advantage that he is so to the liking of nigel farage that ukip has stood aside from the contest and endorsed him in such an anti brexit constituency , it is of dubious benefit to be the lightly camouflaged candidate of the tory party and the explicit candidate of ukip some hoped that richmond park might be a testing ground for the idea of a progressive alliance between parties on the other side of the spectrum three relatively senior labour figures , clive lewis , lisa nandy and jonathan reynolds , last week jointly suggested that their party should stand aside to maximise the chances of a lib dem victory , on the grounds that in this parliament progressives will need every vote that they can get this was an interesting intervention and the more so because the trio hail from different wings of the party their initiative might even deserve to be called quite brave , for committing the heresy against tribal gods of suggesting that sometimes people should support a party other than their first choice the idea has got nowhere because it received a predictably icy response from the party leadership jeremy corbyn and his deputy , tom watson , dont agree on much on opposing this idea they are as one caroline lucas , the greens only mp , is one of the more eloquent advocates of deeper co operation between non tory parties she visited the richmond greens to see if they might be persuaded to stand aside and found them unwilling she concluded the old politics dies hard sure does this episode is a lesson to the advocates of a progressive alliance about just how hard it will be to turn the concept into something meaningful so there will be labour and green candidates contesting richmond park , even though they dont stand a hope of winning this may not ultimately matter if the lib dems can get one of their bandwagons rolling , they will put a hard squeeze on support for the also rans the british electorate has a lot of experience of byelections they understand the dynamics and act accordingly richmond park has the highest proportion of university graduates in the country

monday 24 october my 11th dose of high energy radiation , which , to be honest , im finding a bit more punishing than the seven cycles of chemotherapy ive just finished ive lost my appetite , im more tired at the end of the day , and pain when i eat and drink around the main tumour where my oesophagus joins my stomach is definitely worse in fairness to the radiotherapy staff at the royal marsden whove been brilliant they did say my symptoms would most likely get worse before they got better too true ! but details aside , this is a big week for me and my cancer since the first line of chemotherapy which initially worked so brilliantly , reducing the cancer and the liver and lymph node metastases was shown to have failed completely , the key question has been what to do next and aside from the high dose radiotherapy aimed at controlling the main tumour hopefully preventing it from further restricting the oesophagus thats really about whether to start second line chemotherapy immediately or wait for some promising clinical trials due to open up in the next couple of months thats a conundrum because the rules of eligibility for many clinical trials stipulate , first , that any previous treatment must have ended some time before the trial starts for the reason , i guess , that if theyre not careful the trial will inadvertently reflect the results of the previous treatment rather than the drug or drugs its aimed at testing second , in the case of the trials that might be relevant to me , it is a requirement that any previous line of systematic chemotherapy treatment has failed and when you think about it from an ethical point of view , you can see why taking a patient off a treatment with a scientifically underpinned , known set of costs and benefits before it has failed , to put them on to a new unproven treatment no matter how promising would be questionable and these questions of eligibility potentially so critical to me because of the huge promise offered by some of the new treatments being trialled all boil down to timing so there you go isnt cancer just like the rest of life ! so the question for me and my consultant now is whether my cancer especially the metastases in my liver are stable enough to allow us to wait for the trials to open or whether we need to get on with second line chemo immediately which , unless it fails really quickly and lets hope that doesnt happen will probably rule out access to this next batch of trials which is why im due for another ct scan this afternoon tuesday 25 october back at the royal marsden for the last of 12 daily sessions of high dose radiotherapy thank goodness ! but critically also to see my consultant the amazing dr starling about the results of yesterdays ct scan and unfortunately , although the cancer hasnt spread anywhere else , and it looks as if the radiotherapy is working on the main tumour \( although i can tell you it most certainly doesnt feel like that ! \) the news on my liver is not good the cancer is on the march , says dr starling , so we need to get on and treat it asap and that means a second line chemotherapy drug called paclitaxel delivered as an intravenous infusion every week for three weeks out of four and most likely no clinical trials at this stage of course , there are new ones coming up all the time , but whether theyll be relevant to me and my cancer , and whether ill meet the eligibility criteria , are for now all unknown as a fellow cancer combatant , nick robinson has been a real source of support and invaluable advicebut heres the next twist in the story there is another drug called ramucirumab which has been shown to produce significantly better results when combined with paclitaxel in some patients as much as a 10 per cent improvement in response rates , says dr starling but heres the rub ramucirumab has been fully clinically trialled and licenced for use in the us , europe , asia and beyond and is now almost part of standard second line treatment for my cancer but on account of the way they measure its cost effectiveness , nice do not recommend it in england , and so the nhs does not fund it so what to do \? if money were no object or i was sitting here with full service private health insurance \( which by the way i dont have \) , what would you say \? i ask dr starling she says id say take it without hesitation which raised the question of what it would cost if i chose to pay for it from my savings as that would be the only way i could get it first estimate from the marsdens private patient unit , when you include day case fees for the treatment to be given along with the cost of the drug , was stand by 15 , 624 per monthly cycle ! cue very sharp intake of breath from yours truly friday 28 october filming this morning for a bbc special on cancer with my very good friend nick robinson we first worked together on in the mid 1980s , and then again 10 years later at when i was editor as a fellow cancer combatant , hes been a real source of support and invaluable advice , and is one of the reasons i decided to go public with my diagnosis as he has done realising how much i didnt know , and sensing how perplexing that can be , might explain the huge public reaction theres been to my interviews with eddie mair on radio 4s programme anyhow , back to the cost of improving my chances with my second line chemo due to start this coming thursday on further investigation where would i be without google ! it transpires that i dont need as much of the drug as the private patient unit calculated , and that the stark difference between what the drug company sells it for \( and i should say that manufacturer eli lilly were most helpful here \) and the price proposed to me by the marsden included a 20 mark up i understand and accept that if i choose to add an nhs unfunded element to my treatment , then i should pay for it , and that the nhs should be insulated from any of the costs involved , but a 20 mark up on the drugs , and over 1 , 000 of day case fees for a procedure that shouldnt take much more than two hours \? not things insurance companies or visiting multimillionaires might question but a very big issue for a potential self funding individual like me anyhow , to their credit , the marsden have taken my questions about costs in good faith , and so ill let you know how we get on heres the real paradox im lucky in that i can probably afford this drug provided its not for too long in other words , the sooner the treatment fails the happier my bank manager will be ! and then of course the facts are that , in the end , only 50 or so of people treated with paclitaxel even when you add ramucirumab will get any benefit at all from it and that is the eternal unknown im an individual and so is my cancer part of me , but also with its own dna so which 50 do i fit into will it work or wont it \? absolutely no idea ! which i guess is what living with uncertainty is all about topicscancermy cancer diarynhshealthradio 4bbccancer researchfeaturesshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
she is thought of as the original wild child , a pearl twirling party girl who died at the age of 47 after a fire broke out in the north carolina sanatorium where she was a patient now zelda fitzgerald , the southern belle turned jazz age heroine , dubbed the first american flapper by her husband and partner in drink scott , is to have her own hollywood make over two films are in the pipeline and a television series will air on amazon prime early next year all three projects have starry names attached jennifer lawrence will take the lead in , a biopic directed by ron howard and based on nancy milfords best selling biography scarlett johansson will bob her hair for and christina ricci will play the young and impetuous zelda in the amazon series the title of the tv series comes from scotts awestruck comment on meeting zelda i love her , and thats the beginning and end of everything so what is it about zelda that fascinates almost 70 years after her tragic end \? in part it is that the upheavals the couple lived through find an echo in our own tumultuous times interest in the fitzgeralds has definitely been on the increase not only since baz luhrmanns film of in 2013 but also from the many parallels between their lives and work and the period were living through right now , says sarah churchwell , author of the critically acclaimed its a story of boom and bust and it resonates as we are grappling with our own boom and bust , our own worries about the cost of our excesses and our own social failures the lives and fortunes of scott and zelda peculiarly mimicked their eras in the 1920s they were roaring for all they were worth , but with the crash in 1929 , everything fell apart it helps , too , that zelda was so vibrant a figure it begins with her beauty , says churchwell but also with the stories told in the 1920s about the high jinks and fun she and scott seemed to have people really liked her she was surprising , intelligent , shrewd , funny and loved a good party she also liked to be the centre of attention , and so had her detractors too these things combined to make her a legend scott repeatedly returned to their relationship in his fiction , most notably in his second novel , , which details the heady early days of their marriage and his melancholy fourth , , in which the gilded dream has faded into a more tawdry reality zeldas only novel , , presented the relationship from her side they were arguably americas first celebrity pairing a carefree golden couple who wrote their way into the spotlight , creating their own mythology of gin soaked days and fun filled nights , only to linger too long once the light had started to dim their recklessness makes the story exciting and dramatic , says churchwell but they paid a very high price after a few giddy years , all the youthful promise crumbled away , leaving scott a dazed and drunk jobbing hack in hollywood and bringing zelda to breakdown at the age of 30 , a diagnosis of schizophrenia , now widely thought to be a bipolar disorder , and a life in and out of sanatoriums her story is both fascinating and tragic , says therese anne fowler , on whose novel the amazon series is based here we have a woman whose talents and energy and intellect should have made her a brilliant success , who was determined to be an accomplished artist , writer and ballet dancer in an era where married women were supposed to be wives and mothers , period her devotion to scott was , in many ways , her undoing although he was just as imprisoned as she was had they loved each other less , they might both have come to better ends the idea of zelda as a brilliant woman trapped by her time has gained traction in recent years , with a number of works re evaluating her through the prism of feminism although it is not always the easiest of fits as early as 1974 , the couples daughter scottie resisted such claims , writing that attempts to view her mother as a classic put down wife , whose efforts to express her nature were thwarted by a typically male chauvinist husband were not accurate writing in the in 2013 , molly fischer agreed , noting saving zelda fitzgerald is no easy proposition she does not want to be anyones pet , and theres something disconcerting about the literary readiness to domesticate her , to transform an exasperating woman into an appealing heroine the new films may well further hollywoodise zelda , sanding away her rough edges and reinventing her as a relatable heroine for our modern times the casting of lawrence so often described as americas sweetheart in the howard biopic is no accident a report about the upcoming johansson film in the suggested it would draw on previously unreleased material to indicate that her husband misappropriated his wifes ideas as his own mark gill , president of millennium films , the production company behind , agreesshe was massively ahead of her time and she took a beating for it he stole her ideas and put them in his books the marriage was a codependency from hell with a jazz age soundtrack the film has , however , secured the co operation of the fitzgerald estate fowler agrees that there is a growing tendency to apply our own concerns to zelda we do anoint her as a kind of proto feminist heroine , even though she didnt see herself as a feminist and didnt fully succeed at anything , she says but her original reputation is based on conventional paternalistic standards of what a woman , mother and wife ought to be and do her ambitions and her insistence on pursuing them were considered inappropriate and unhealthy after her psychotic break she was literally told that this insistence had created her split mind and that the path to a cure lay in giving up all ambitions that didnt conform to the paternalistic ideal facebook twitter pinterest scarlett johansson , jennifer lawrence and christina ricci are all set to play zelda fitzgerald in the forthcoming productions the beautiful and the damned , zelda and z the beginning of everything composite getty imagesthe backlash against this image is understandable given that popular opinion of zelda was initially driven by ernest hemingways notoriously caustic descriptions in , published posthumously in 1964 , in which he dismissed her as insane and blamed scotts growing dependence on drink on his wife our perception has very much changed , says churchwell we have come to sympathise with her frustration , to recognise her gifts and to be more fair minded about her choices that said , she cautions against attempts to create a team scott team zelda divide , as is so often the case in famous literary partnerships its important to say that they always loved each other and wouldnt have appreciated people taking sides fitzgerald wrote a few years before he died that it was a moral imperative that their friends understood they were a couple , a unit and would stay that way , even if her illness meant they couldnt live together churchwell is also scathing about attempts to suggest zelda had a larger role in her husbands work than previously presumed there are people who want to credit zelda with scotts work , which is just silly and doesnt do women any favours , she says its not a zero sum game we can recognise both of them for who they were zelda had many talents , but where writing was concerned she was probably too ill when she started to hone her gifts , and while it is true that scott didnt particularly want her to write partly out of territoriality but partly because her doctors told him it was bad for her its also true that her work isnt in the same class as his her individual sentences are often lovely , and she can create a mood and has clever turns of phrase but her works tend to be sketches rather than full stories if they had made different choices , maybe she could have been an important writer , but the reality is that she wasnt perhaps , then , the true key to zeldas continued pull on our imagination lies not in her work but in her modernity i dont want to live i want to love first and live incidentally , she proclaimed and it is that vitality and greed for all of lifes experiences , both good and bad , that stretches down over the decades , allowing each generation to see something new they said i have rarely known a woman who expressed herself so delightfully and freshly she had no ready made phrases on the one hand and no striving for effect on the other critic edmund wilsoni fell in love with her courage , her sincerity and her flaming self respect , and its these things i would believe in even if the whole world indulged in wild suspicions that she wasnt all that she should be f scott fitzgeraldi did not have a single feeling of inferiority , or shyness , or doubt , and no moral principles all i want is to be very young always and very irresponsible , and to feel that my life is my own to live and be happy and die in my own way to please

were going close our rolling coverage of the 2016 presidential campaign , with a few hours and 10 days before election day you can read a summary of the days events here , about hillary clintons subsequent remarks on the new fbi review here , and about a falsehood strewn speech by donald trump in iowa here hillary clinton reacts to new fbi investigation into her emailshillary clinton demands fbi explain review of new batch of emails read more were a divided nation but we are fighting to bring us all together , like here tonight theres love here theres love , trump says we will make america wealthy again we will make america strong again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again god bless you with that trump closes out his rally we have the highest murder in this country in 45 years , trump says , very falsely trump is distorting an fbi statistic into a false claim in september the agency reported that murders and non negligent manslaughter rose in the us by 10 8 in 2015 , the largest single year increase since 1971 that is not the same as saying there are more murders in the us than at any point since 1971 15 , 696 murders were reported in 2015 , down from 1991 and 1993 highs of 24 , 703 and 24 , 526 there were more murders in 1971 \( 17 , 780 \) than in 2015 the murder rate declined 42 from 1993 to 2014 , even though the population increased by a quarter during this weeks debate trump almost cited the statistic accurately , saying we have an increase in murder within our cities , the biggest in 45 years the fbi figure is a national one , not restricted to cities you dont hear that from these people , he adds , gesturing toward the press they dont want to talk about it you can read our report on it , from the day of the release and before trump remarked on it , through the link below murders up 10 8 in biggest percentage increase since 1971 , fbi data shows read more when i am elected president i am going to keep radical islamic terrorists out of this country , trump says , without details and yes , we will build the wall and yes , mexico will pay for the wall 100 100 the cost of the wall is peanuts compared to what were talking about , trump says nonpartisan analysts estimate the wall would cost at least 25bn the us goods trade deficit with mexico is about 58bn , which is offset by the us surplus in services of 9 2bn if not for the open border policies of this administration , trump says , countless americans would be alive today the us does not have open borders , and barack obama has deported more than 2 5 million people , a record as trump himself noted at hte final presidential debate hillary has pledged open borders , trump says , and supports sanctuary cities clinton does not support open borders but does support sanctuary cities and reform to let people pass background checks and pay back taxes in order to stay in the us , and she supports obamas executive actions to shield some migrants , such as people who were brought to the us as children like obama , she supports deportation for people with criminal records we are going to have the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan this is only true if youre in the wealthiest bracket of american earners half of trumps tax cuts would go to the top 1 of earners , according to the tax policy center , and most families below the top 20 of earners would have income gains of less than 1 trump doesnt linger long on the affordable care act though he leads the crowd in a chant of drain the swamp , his new catchphrase for taking on corruption in washington forty five percent of african american children under the age of six are in poverty , trump says inaccurately , citing outdated data per politifact the poverty rates in question were as high as trump says they were at the depths of the great recession , but they have since eased , to somewhere between 20 percent and 37 percent , depending on which income threshold you use still , the rates for african american children are disproportionately high , so trump has a point even if his statistics are too old and exaggerate the scale of poverty in that age group on balance , we rate the statement half true another two million hispanic americans have fallen into poverty under the obama administration , he says , also falsely per the guardians own fact check trumps use of two million is misleading on two points he starts counting from 2008 , when george w bush was still in office and from right before the financial crisis peak and he ignores that the hispanic population has grown dramatically in the eight years since then almost 1 4 million hispanic people fell below the poverty line between 2008 and 2009 , census poverty numbers show , but the number of hispanic people in poverty has decreased during the recovery in 2015 it fell to 21 4 , down from 25 2 in 2009 it will be very hard to leave your farm to your children and your heirs , he says , alluding to the so called death tax on inheritance , though the estate tax actually only affects wealthy families and not the majority of americans trump then moves on to saying that hes really moving in the polls , and that hes leading in many of them this is not true , as election models and poll averages show i dont know whats going to happen now , trump continues so much is at stake in this election when we win in november we are going to have honest government once again hillary clinton destroyed 33 , 000 emails destroyed 13 iphones he then says , without evidence , that clinton put her office up for sale to corporations and foreign donors hacked emails show concerns within the campaign that clintons husband , bill , was too close with various donors , but no one has found evidence of a favor returned in exchange for donations to the clintons charitable foundation trump moves on to reminiscing about how , last june , he came down an elevator with his wife to announce his presidential campaign he abruptly segues into saying how were going to be the smart country once again , and saying we never win anymore abroad he correctly says that the white house has admitted healthcare premiums will increase by as much as 25 next year , but then misleadingly says that the true number is twice that premiums will increase by varying amounts according to each state some will be quite high , as trump warns , others will be far lower trump then correctly notes that obama misled americans about whether they could keep their doctor under the affordable care act repealing and replacing obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on november 8 , trump says donald trump appears on stage in cedar rapids , iowa he thanks everybody as youve heard , earlier today , the fbi after discovering new emails the crowd cheers is reopening their investigation into hillary clinton this is not technically correct comey said the emails are part of a new review pertaining to the prior investigation lock her up , the crowd chants the investigation is the biggest political scandal since watergate , and its everybodys hope that justice at last can be delivered in the very brief remarks tonight hillary clinton tonight tried to politicize this investigation , trump continues , by attacking and falsely accusing the fbi director of only sending the letter to republicans another clinton lie as it turns out it was sent to both republican and democratic leaders trump says that the fbi would never have reopened this case at this time unless it were a most egregious criminal offense i give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong justice will prevail trump has suggested for months that the fbi has acted politically to hide alleged corruption someone is back at the podium after more than 45 minutes of waiting its not donald trump , but he praises the candidate , who is reportedly en route hes put his finger on a deeply underappreciated body of people , the man at the podium says he is going to be the next president of the united states of america then the man leaves the stage lets get the next president up here as of 6 45pm pt , trump has an 18 5 chance of winning the election and hillary clinton has a 81 5 chance , according to fivethirtyeights election model far from the podium in cedar rapids , vice

realdonaldtrump \) just landed in iowa speaking soon ! october 29 , 2016 trump is now an hour and 15 minutes late to his own rally , but reporting continues to trickle out from washington on fbi director james comeys decision to announce a review into emails of unknown significance officials speaking on condition of anonymity have told the washington post that he sent a cryptic letter today because of politics within the agency and with congress fbi director james b comey decided to inform congress that he would look again into hillary clintons handling of emails during her time as secretary of state for two main reasons a sense of obligation to lawmakers and a concern that word of the new email discovery would leak to the media and raise questions of a coverup the rationale , described by officials close to comeys decision making on the condition of anonymity , prompted the fbi director to release his brief letter to congress on friday and upset a presidential race less than two weeks before election day it placed comey again at the center of a highly partisan argument over whether the nations top law enforcement agency was unfairly influencing the campaign in a memo explaining his decision to fbi employees soon after he sent his letter to congress , comey said he felt an obligation to do so given that i testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed of course , we dont ordinarily tell congress about ongoing investigations , but here i feel i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record , comey wrote to his employees greg sargent \( theplumlinegs \) important new reporting from sarihorwitz suggests comey sent letter because he felt pressure from inside https t co wwjrqgcqjh

attempted voter fraud in a donald trump supporter , according to the des moines register terri lynn rote , 55 , was booked into the polk county jail about 3 40pm thursday on a first degree election misconduct charge , which is a class d felony rote , a registered republican , reportedly cast an early voting ballot at the polk county election office , 120 second ave , and another ballot at a county satellite voting location in des moines , according to a des moines police report its the first time in 12 years that polk county auditor jamie fitzgerald can remember ever having to report potential voter fraud , he said thursday morning the other two suspects are accused of casting mail in ballots and also voting in person , according to police reports as of friday morning , neither of those suspects had been arrested the case is under investigation by des moines police i think it shows that our voting system works in iowa , that were able to catch it , fitzgerald said tensions are running high on both sides as election day approaches , the county auditor said , but the cases of double voting could also have been simple mistakes thats not for me to decide , he said rote was held in jail on a 5 , 000 bond , but she had been released as of friday afternoon her next court appearance was scheduled for nov 7 , court records show trump has repeatedly and falsely claimed that voter fraud is rampant throughout the electorate , and especially in largely black precincts of philadelphia and chicago it is not the businessman has also suggested that he would not mind voter fraud

kid in first year at a lutheran primary school in queenslands sunshine coast my school was almost breathtakingly monocultural and white i was one of three asian kids in the entire year level , and there were no black students whatsoever this made it a problem when my teachers decided we were going to perform as aboriginal people for the schools talent showcase every year level had a different act , and my grades involved slathering on jars of school issued black body paint over our semi naked forms and singing carra barra winna canna , a song we assumed was indigenous , written by a man

the same party as i was so i asked him , hey mate , you going to the henno party \? where is it \? turns out he had no idea who henno was that was just his regular saturday night attire my failure to

graphic designer we had been living in sao paulo for a few months , and life was pretty good , but we were young and didnt have much money so i always felt a little like a fraud among the fashion art scene people of brazil this was highlighted most spectacularly at a party vogue hosted the invitations were of course in portuguese , but we understood them to a point the dress code said black tie or fancy dress i didnt have a tuxedo so was reluctant to go , but my wife was keen to make a good impression and encouraged me to go for the fancy dress option i figured it would be fun and to be honest we didnt give it that much thought we were from london , we went to loads of parties , we were used to this sort of thing i opted for a pirate outfit cut off jeans , flip flops , and a hook hand and sword i had purchased from a local toy store a few hours before the party eye liner , eye patch , bandana my wife wore a beautiful vintage ball gown ready to go the party was held at hotel unique , a huge modernist luxury hotel and it was hosted by naomi campbell gilberto gil was performing we turned up on the red carpet , and not being celebrities we were of little interest to the paparazzi , but i did feel we had a certain presence and caught the eye we entered im not saying all 600 people turned and looked at me , but it did feel like that the editor of vogue rushed towards us what are you doing \? why are you dressed as a pirate \? and why are you wearing flip flops to this party \? im in fancy dress on the invitation it said black tie or fancy dress what \? no , no , no black tie or dress fancy wear your finest clothes , or expensive robes not fancy dress i pointed at guy dressed as a sheikh what about that guy , hes dressed up no , hes an actual sheikh on closer inspection , his robes were made of fine golds and luxury materials we exchanged a nod of mutual respect \( thats how i saw it \) it actually worked out well i brought a smile to faces , and got talking to lots of

cronulla rioter but people just thought i was racista few years ago i got roped into a halloween party in sydney at the last minute i thought about what really scared me , and landed on the people involved in the infamous 2005 cronulla race riots it was ease of assembly that sealed the deal australian flags , fake tattoos and green and gold zinc are pretty easy to come by on short notice it was six or seven years after the riots , and im a quick to laugh , gregarious kind of person , so the idea that anyone would confuse me with an actual bloodthirsty hooligan honestly didnt cross my mind if anything , i thought i might get the odd high five in solidarity against racism ! the party was bigger than i expected and drew a wide cross section of sydney folk patriotic australian , people would guess , only to quickly move on when they saw fuck off , were full scrawled along my arm on one side of the spectrum i was upsetting people who were rightly disheartened by the riots on the other , i was pissing off rioter sympathisers everyone in between just wanted to cut loose with reckless abandon , and my downer costume wasnt helping in the wee hours of the morning , a guy tapped me on the shoulder that is a really , really good costume he didnt high five me though , so im still chalking this one up as a fail adam tingay i crumbed myselfthe theme was nice and broad tis a silly place so apparently when i go to my silly place i get crumbed shorts , shoes , three dozen eggs and five kilograms of breadcrumbs i applied it on the lawn with the assistance of some friends and a drop sheet

wore that to my 21st at the time , my friends and i were engaged in a constant battle of oneupmanship who could go to the most extreme lengths \? i realised my costume may not have hit the sardonic mark i was going for when i saw the other partygoers dressed in pyjamas , ugly wigs , garbage bags , bad 80s powersuits and ill fitting bikinis two of the parents at the party pointed , scowled and

and back with uber , here is our roundup of the tribunals comments , from shane hickey uber tribunal judges criticise 'fictions' and 'twisted language' read more and on whether and when it might chance its views , s p said we could lower the rating if we conclude that sterling will lose its status as a reserve currency or if public finances or gdp per capita weaken markedly beyond our current expectations in addition , we could lower our ratings if significant constitutional issues arise and create further financial and economic uncertainty we could revise the outlook to stable if investment and economic growth remain above our expectations , while negotiations with the eu prove amicable and not significantly detrimental to the u k s economy and trade s p is also forecasting a slowdown in the uk from next year given brexit uncertainties and the likely fall in investment , we are forecasting a slowdown in 2017 2019 , with gdp growth averaging 1 the bank of englands asset purchase plan and the monetary policy committees decision to reduce the base rate have helped growth in the short term , but we expect reduced investment to begin to weigh on growth over our forecast period warming to its theme , s p added the negative outlook reflects our opinion that the recent decision to exit the european union \( the destination for 44 of the u k s goods and services exports \) poses a potential risk to the u k s national income , as well as its fiscal and external balances we also see heightened risks of a deterioration in external financing conditions in light of the u k s high gross external financing requirements \( as a share of current account receipts and usable reserves \) complex and protracted negotiations between the u k and the eu could , in our opinion , pressure the u k s financial services sector \( which is a major contributor to employment and public receipts \) we also think brexit could create challenging constitutional issues if it results in a second referendum on scottish independence leaving the eu will also significantly diminish the u k s capacity to influence eu policy on key sectors of the u k economy , such as financial services , that are vital to the u k s economic performance brexit could also , over time , diminish sterlings role as a global reserve currency since the referendum , sterling has depreciated against the dollar by more than 17 , at one point reaching a 31 year low uk prime minister theresa may in parliament this week photograph pain early october , prime minister theresa may announced that the government will invoke article 50 of the eus lisbon treaty no later than march 2017 this decision will be followed by at least two years of negotiations on the terms of eu departure while two years may suffice to negotiate a successor treaty that will have to be endorsed by european national parliaments and the european parliament , and could face referendums in one or more member states , the process could take much longer the risks of an inconclusive or detrimental outcome are also material while some believe the u k can arrive at a beneficial agreement with the eu , others take the view that the remaining eu members will have no incentive to accommodate the u k rather , their focus will be on detering other potential departures and containing the rise of their own national eurosceptic movements in particular , it is not clear if the eu will permit the u k access to the single market on existing tariff free terms , or impose tariffs on u k products further arrangements regarding the export of services , including by the u k s important financial services industry , are even more uncertain , in our view given that curtailing immigration was a major motivating issue for leave voters , it is also uncertain whether the u k would agree to a trade deal that requires the country to accept the free movement of labor from the eu the negotiation process is therefore fraught with potential challenges and vetos , making the outcome unpredictable we also believe that the divisions , both within the ruling conservative party and society as a whole over the european question , may not heal quickly and may hamper government stability and complicate policymaking on economic and other matters scotlands first minister nicola sturgeon photograph andrew milligan pain addition , we take the view that the scottish national party will push for another referendum on scottish independence , given that the scottish population voted overwhelmingly in favor of remaining within the eu such a move will have consequences for the u k s constitutional and economic integrity northern ireland is another source of potential issues these multiple and significant challenges will be very demanding and will detract from macroeconomic goals , such as maintaining growth and consolidating public finances the lack of clarity while negotiations ensue will also significantly deter private investment at the same time , we continue to recognize many of the u k s institutional strengths the u k benefits from its flexible and open economy and , in our view , has prospered as an eu member we believe that the u k economy has been able to attract higher inflows of low cost capital and skilled labor than it would have without the preferential access that eu membership delivers in our opinion , significant net immigration into the u k over the past decade helped its economic performance eu membership has also enhanced londons position as a global financial center the ratings agency said in our opinion , brexit presents a significant risk to the u k s track record of strong economic performance , and to its large financial sector in particular the leave result has also led to a less predictable and stable policy framework for the u k the outlook remains negative , reflecting the continued institutional and economic uncertainty surrounding brexit negotiations , and what arrangements will emerge post departure s p has issued its latest update on the uk following the brexit vote , and it has kept its rating at aa with a negative outlook given the future uncertainties as we reported earlier , s p had cut the uks rating by two notches on the monday after the referendum result back with stock markets , and european shares have ended on an uncertain note french and spanish gdp figures gave some support while stronger than expected us growth increased the chances of a federal reserve rate rise before the end of the year the final scores showed the ftse 100

crowley woodford , employment partner at ashurst , reckons a huge one this decision could be the beginning of the end for the gig economy as we know it and will have wide implications for a number of employers beyond uber , inevitably leading to a flood of further claims labour is tabling an amendment to the digital economy bill , which is currently going through parliament the amendment , if it is accepted on tuesday , would extend employment rights to workers at firms like uber who operate in the gig economy the clause , tabled by shadow digital minister louise haigh , would change the law so that workers at companies who provide a service to customers through a digital intermediary such as uber are defined as employees of that business louise haigh photograph stefan rousseau patodays tribunal ruling only applies to uber and the us based company plans to challenge it anyway louise haigh said this amendment will , for the first time , enshrine in statute the rights of workers in the

mapping out the likely features of the brexit age , it is hard to know where to start headlines about government support for the nissan factory in sunderland and gdp rising immediately after the referendum do not detract from the big picture the uks post eu future remains gloomy , and then some we are , it seems , at the start of a new era of border queues , inflation , renewed austerity , with the prospect of rising unemployment , and the exit from britain of banksand other financial services they may be modern villains , but they are also one of the only dependable sources of tax revenue weve got left the richmond park byelection is a golden opportunity to fight brexit hugo dixon read morepolitical debate about what happens next is currently carved up between supporters of hard and soft brexit with , just to add to all the absurdity , the labour party saddled with a new position all of its own as reconfirmed by john mcdonnells media appearances this week , hard in the sense that its leadership is relaxed about britain having only access to the single market , but soft in its attitude to immigration even among the people who spent the late summer wondering whether the referendum might somehow be annulled , the enemy is now a destructive brexit , not the thing itself the pro eu noise that followed the vote , it seems , has dwindled to almost nothing you would think that no one is now calling into question what 48 of us voted against but listen closely , and you can hear it people wondering why the uk is doing this at all this week , a yougov poll suggested that if a hypothetical stop brexit party put up candidates at an election , it would get the support of 25 9 of voters \( including 4 of those who voted leave \) , leaving labour trailing on 18 7 \( the tories , the poll says , would be on 34 \) indeed , trawl recent surveys , and you quickly get a sense of the people who are spooked , with good reason the 36 of people who say brexit will be bad for jobs the 28 who think there will be negative effects on pensions the 38 who agree with the no brainer proposition that leaving the eu will reduce britains influence in the world a lot of these people would presumably agree with ac grayling , who may yet find himself in the unfamiliar position of speaking for a substantial body of public opinion leaving the eu , he recently tweeted , is obviously such an incredibly bad idea just stop it for many people including me that kind of talk always triggers a deep ambivalence if what took the leave side to victory was the support of so called left behind voters who had not been listened to for decades , it still seems to me that arguing they should be ignored may not just be democratically questionable , but a gift to the forces that , even with ukip apparently imploding , would know a once in a lifetime chance when they saw it , and strike witness the pro brexit tycoon arron banks , who now wants to bankroll nothing less than a peoples movement , and give voice to england rising in that sense , there remains a good argument for those of us who voted remain to stand back , and let this frazzled example of government by plebiscite run its course , while bearing in mind the immortal words of the us writer and satirist hl mencken democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want , and deserve to get it good and hard the snowballing brexit disaster will create a groundswell of public anxiety and outrageand yet , and yet whatever your view , it is unquestionably the case that at this rate , the snowballing brexit disaster will create a groundswell of public anxiety and outrage , and a big opportunity for a party willing to channel them at the national level at least , this seems unlikely to be labour , for three reasons the number of core labour voters who supported leave , the anti eu inclinations of its leadership , and the general cluelessness that suggests it tends to view glaring political opportunities as some kind of bourgeois trick in which case , there is one obvious candidate the liberal democrats for sure , they have a hell of a lot to surmount the deep damage to their reputation done by the coalition years , a leader who has yet to break into the public consciousness , and an almost total lack of powerbases , even in their traditional redoubts but with memories of their grim partnership with the tories fading , an intersecting alliance of voters could yet be theirs those variously worried about hard brexit , drawn to the lib dems insistence on a second referendum , and in many cases opposed to leaving the eu per se people who , if the government sticks to its current hard line and or the eu refuses to play ball , may well become one big anti brexit bloc there was a flavour of this at this at last weeks witney byelection , whose pretty miraculous result a 19 swing from the tories to a party we all thought was dead has been rather overlooked , along with tim farrons trumpeting of the result a clear rejection , he said , of the conservative brexit governments plan to take britain out of the single market what happened there highlighted a tension , hardly unique to that corner of the country , that was arguably always going to explode the conservative party faced thousands of tory inclined voters who supported remain \( in west oxfordshire , the pro eu side won by 54 to 46 \) after weeks of telling them that whatever their anxieties , it was now likely to be hard brexit all the way , surprise , surprise a lot of them didnt like it something similar is likely to happen in the looming richmond park byelection which zac goldsmith wants to be about a third heathrow runway , but thanks to the absence of an official tory candidate and an already energised lib dem campaign , may well turn out to be a contest much more focused on europe , and goldsmiths leap away from thousands of his constituents they live in a borough that voted 70 for remain in which context , he will be hobbled not just by his support for the leave side , but the downright racist mayoral campaign that gave a sharp flavour of the nastiness that would erupt both before and after the referendum im old fashioned i would rather political divisions were based on such trifles as inequality , and the limits of the market but these are hardly normal times as also evidenced by a steady stream of council byelection results , a proper lib dem revival may only be a matter of time whatever the contortions of the labour leadership , i wonder about the labour leaders of our big cities , and the first minister of wales , and at what point they may break from their hopeless party line , and begin to pointedly question something that will so deeply damage the places where they hold power all the time , it gets louder the early stirring of a messy realignment , and the birth pangs of 48 52 politics , whose consequences on both sides of the divide

european union leaders have expressed hope of signing a trade deal with canada after belgian politicians overcame differences that had been blocking the treaty the belgian prime minister , charles michel , confirmed that leaders of five regional parliaments had reached an agreement with the federal government shortly after midday on thursday he tweeted charles michel \( charlesmichel \) belgian agreement on ceta all parliaments are now able to approve by tomorrow at midnight important step for eu and canadaoctober 27 , 2016the belgian compromise a four page text that sits alongside the 1 , 600 page treaty was approved by ambassadors from 28 eu member states on thursday afternoon belgiums regional parliaments are expected to endorse the text on friday , paving the way for the deal to come into force on a temporary basis canadas foreign minister stphane dion said he was prudently optimistic that the treaty could be signed if it happens , it is excellent news but he added that a scalded cat fears cold water what does ceta mean for brexit \? the european union and canada have spent seven years negotiating a trade treaty the comprehensive economic and trade agreement \( ceta \) would abolish most tariffs between the eu and canada and pull down many barriers to transatlantic business conservative politicians , including boris johnson and david davis , have hailed the treaty as a model for post brexit britain but ceta has to be approved by all eu member states it has faced opposition from regional parliaments in belgium and scrutiny from germanys highest court some fear the uk could encounter similar problems in striking a free trade agreement with the eu the british government has dismissed the parallel officials argue that putting up trade barriers \( brexit \) is very different from taking them down \( ceta \) the belgian compromise came too late for an eu canada summit that had been scheduled for thursday the canadian prime minister , justin trudeau , had been due to meet the eu leaders donald tusk and jean claude juncker in brussels , but decided at the last minute not to get on the plane , as belgian politicians wrangled over the agreement late on wednesday night cecilia malmstrm , the eu trade commissioner leading the trade talks with canada , said she hoped a date could be set soon to sign the accord tusk , the european council president , sounded a note of caution , tweeting donald tusk \( eucopresident \) i am glad for good news from pm charlesmichel only once all procedures are finalised for eu signing ceta , will i contact pm justintrudeauoctober 27 , 2016the comprehensive economic and trade agreement , known as ceta , which has been seven years in the making , stumbled near the finish line amid strong opposition from the belgian regional parliament of wallonia the eu requires all 28 member states to support ceta for the treaty to come into force , but the belgian federal government , which has always backed the trade treaty , was barred from giving its consent because of opposition from regional parliaments in wallonia and brussels paul magnette , wallonias minister president , who had been leading opposition to the agreement , had wanted to reopen talks with canada , but the eu institutions insisted that was impossible wallonia has been nervous about exposing its agricultural sector to competition from canadian farmers magnette had also raised objections to a proposed court system for settling disputes between foreign investors and governments one concession he won means that belgium would be able to go to the european court of justice to determine whether a system of investor state tribunals were compatible with eu law the four page document contains a guarantee that the belgian government will assess the socio economic and environmental impact of ceta the walloon minister president , who has been dubbed super magnette in the belgian media , said wallonia is extremely happy that our demands have been heard speaking of the delay , magnette said he was sorry for our european partners and for the canadians , but what we managed to get here is important not just for wallonians , but for all europeans the special court that ceta would create has proved so controversial that the commission has decided it will not come into force immediately eu member states insisted that national parliaments should have a say on aspects of the eu canada deal that touch on national competences even if the eu and canada sign the treaty in the coming weeks , ceta will only become a complete and permanent legal document following ratification by at least 38 national and regional parliaments in europe only the backing of national parliaments would trigger the creation of an exclusive trade court to replace the investor state dispute settlement \( isds \) , the existing system for resolving trade disputes that has existed since the 1960s this system is written into thousands of investment contracts , including 1 , 400 involving eu countries critics have rung alarm bells about the scope isds gives private companies to sue governments the commission argues that its proposed changes to existing investor courts deepen transparency and end conflicts of interest , as judges would be appointed by governments and not companies , but critics have dismissed the reforms as rebranding campaign groups welcomed the belgian challenge to the investor state tribunals the use of investment tribunals allows companies to sue governments for lost profits if they introduce laws to protect people or the environment , said paul de clerck of friends of the earth europe these corporate courts have no place in our democracies and we welcome the stance of the dissenting belgian regions in contending them the european commission had no immediate comment on the challenge to the investor court idea it has championed , but a spokesperson said events were unfolding in a good direction what matters is not when the ceta signing happens but the fact that it happens and it will happen shortly after the compromise was announced , several dozen activists launched a rowdy , but peaceful protest outside the commission headquarters in brussels holding aloft banners reading stop ceta , protesters banged drums , occasionally jeered at passing eu officials and sang songs , including the les misrables musical number , can you hear the people sing the cliffhanger story of the eu canada trade treaty is seen as a bad omen for post brexit britain as it seeks a trade agreement with europe britains secretary of state for trade , liam fox , told mps on wednesday that the difficulties over ceta underscored the importance of the uk signing a trade deal before it leaves the eu the uk would only face a procedure similar to ceta , he said , if it failed to conclude a trade agreement before the end of two years of divorce negotiations under the eus article 50 that sort of procedure would only be undertaken were we to leave the european union after our article 50 period without any agreement whatsoever and were looking to seek a new fta free trade agreement from outside , he said some observers think that is a likely prospect , as the article 50 divorce talks are dedicated to unwinding britains eu membership and european leaders will not sign a trade deal before agreeing the divorce settlement fox , a prominent leave campaigner , said the experience of ceta might cause some to think twice before seeking a trade agreement with the eu those who put politics ahead of prosperity might want to think twice , he said topicsinternational tradebelgiumeuropean unioneuropeeconomicsglobal economynewsshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on

kent university student union has been criticised after using images of former one direction singer zayn malik and london mayor sadiq khan to promote black history month the universitys students branded this an embarrassment black history month traditionally celebrates the culture of britons of african and caribbean descent the union apologised and said that in the planning stages kent union worked with students to develop a campaign that celebrated a range of ethnic cultures , following the national union of students position on black history month , which is to recognise and celebrate the immense contributions that people of african , arab , asian and caribbean heritage make to humanity this definition has roots in the idea of political blackness , a term which was used by many in the british anti racist movement during the 1970s the idea that anyone from a group affected by racism could identify as politically black , to form a united group but is this idea still relevant today \? amrit wilson political blackness lingers on , but the unity of africans and asians has fadedwhy were zayn malik and sadiq khan selected as poster boys for black history month \? they are not black they are not politically black either although the two men are very different , neither even self identifies with the powerful politics of political blackness which originated in the united struggle of working class african caribbean and asian communities against racism and imperialism in the 70s that unity was deliberately destroyed , after the 1981 youth uprisings against racist policing \( mainly african caribbean in brixton and bristol , mainly asian in southall and bradford , and more heterogeneous in liverpool \) , when the thatcher government imposed not only more police powers , but the term black and minority ethnic \( bme \) to define us all bme people and organisations were then made to compete for handouts from the state , leading to division , not unity the term politically black lingered on useful at times , counterproductive at others while the vitally important underlying concept of african asian unity faded away black history month was first celebrated in the uk in 1987 , long after bmeness had tightened its hold it was always about black not asian or minority ethnic history while it makes sense to commemorate the grunwick strike \( 1976 78 \) as part of black history month because , although primarily asian , it was part of a united struggle foisting malik and khan on the celebrations as black icons is both ridiculous and just plain wrong it is also utterly divisive there is no dearth of inspiring people of african origin in britain , both historically , and in the present from claudia jones to ben okri to bill morris kehinde andrews solidarity shouldnt mean creating a shared identitytheres a new type of negro , who calls himself black this new type of black man who wants to think for himself , speak for himself , stand on his own feet , and walk for himself , explained malcolm x in 1963 the embrace of blackness , rooted in african ancestry , was a powerful political tool that fuelled an unapologetic and radical resistance to racism blackness has always been a political idea that has its roots in much earlier struggles against enslavement , colonialism and racism in britain , the use of the term political blackness is problematic for a number of reasons i am not a non white to define ourselves in relation to whiteness is to entirely disempower our politics i am black , embracing my features as not a symbol of shame , but a glorious symbol of greatness , as marcus garvey put it , connecting me to the african diaspora student union promotes black history month with zayn malik picture read morea dangerous myth has developed that ethnic minorities rallied around the banner of political blackness before the state money from multiculturalism caused bitter divisions this erases the history of political organising based around shared african ancestry , which has strong roots in britain the first pan african congress was held in london in 1900 the hugely influential fifth pan african congress in manchester in 1945 and there has been an unbroken history of grassroots organising , including the black supplementary school movement anti racist unity has historically involved organisations based in different ethnic minority communities coming together to fight specific issues when caribbean , indian and pakistani groups worked together to fight the commonwealth immigrants act in 1962 , for instance a shared non white identity has never been necessary to build coalitions real solidarity is based on organising around shared issues and not trying to create a shared identity that erases the substantial differences between a wide variety of peoples vera chok political blackness flattens out many different experienceswhen we talk about race , we tend to use the language of black and white its clear , yes , but i dont find this simplistic binary constructive it positions blackness at one end historically negatively associated with darkness and evil , or today , with drugs , poverty , or crime and whiteness as the pinnacle i fully understand why a person of colour might choose to self define as being politically black , sharing , as we do , experiences of institutional racism but i do not assume this position because i believe it reinforces counterproductive shadeism where my worth is tied to the shade of my skin and because it positions me in relation to white oppressors or the black oppressed the experiences and narratives of non black people of colour shouldnt be flattened out in this way blackness shouldnt be reduced to a victimhood that needs to be rebalanced white privilege absolutely exists , yes , but it should be diluted with the plurality of the rest of humanity , rather than sitting in opposition to a socially constructed position of \( political or otherwise \) blackness labels and messaging shape our worldview whats media friendly and prominent in our consciousness \? in the uk media , we dont see south asians portrayed in a way that reflects their position as the largest racial minority group in the uk \( 3 million to 1 9 million black british \) east asians , the third largest and fastest growing racial group at 1 2 million , people bear the damning model minority label which isolates them from other people of colour , and condemns them to an invisibility where violence against them is ignored because we dont care to ask why only certain races are listed in the census , too many people end up ticking other , which simplifies the picture of who shares the uk products and surgery allow us to make bodies appear more white light skinned black people or big eyed asian people sell more goods isnt it awful how , in order to gain attention against yellowface , the term blackface has to be invoked \? if the aspirations of people of colour are tied to elevating dark skin to white standards , humans will remain divided in a million other ways in this age of abbreviation , my suggestion to complicate the picture might seem counter intuitive recognising plurality helps , for example what does the word asian mean to you \? we should look beyond unquestioned british or american world views acknowledge our bigotry but curb bigoted actions categorise but withhold value judgments intersectionality calls for us to consider the complex interactions between various social factors gender , class , sexuality , religion etc this absolutely makes things less black and white , but im interested in starting from this point topicsblack history monththe panelrace issuescommentshare on facebookshare on twittershare via

the ticketing website viagogo has been branded disgusting for seeking to profit from a charity event hosted by the actor and comedian peter kay to raise funds for cancer research uk criticism of viagogo came as it emerged that the company and its competitors faced being questioned by a parliamentary select committee amid a political crackdown on ticket touting tickets for kays dance for life events went on sale last weekend at a face value of 28 50 , with all profits donated to the cancer charity hundreds of fans tried to buy tickets as soon as they went on sale , but missed out and thensaw tickets for the events appear on viagogo minutes later and for hundreds of pounds there has been growing scrutiny of touts who use a variety of specialist methods to harvest hundreds of tickets within seconds to sell at a profit via secondary ticketing platforms such as viagogo tickets for the dance for life event appeared on viagogos website over the weekend one ticket , at the

tickets tended to be listed as a publicity stunt rather than with an expectation of a sale , but that many other tickets listed for hundreds of pounds were likely to sell viagogo , which has a large call centre in london but has headquarters in geneva , typically takes up to 25 on the value of tickets sold claire rowney , director of stand up to cancer , at cancer research uk , said all the money we raise will help fund vital research that will accelerate new treatments and tests to uk patients and save more lives , more quickly weve been made aware that tickets are being sold for much more than the set ticket price , with the profit going to the seller and not to the charity cancer research uk relies entirely on the generosity of the public to fund our life saving research and so we encourage anyone who is buying a ticket , to support the event , to be aware of any sellers who are not donating all the profits to stand up to cancer the conservative mp nigel adams , who recently tabled an amendment recommending criminalisation of the use by touts of software called bots to harvest tickets , called on viagogo to donate its profits to cancer research uk i would like to think that viagogo would do the right thing and donate an appropriate margin from their commission towards the charity im sure peter kay would be interested if they dont it would be a sad reflection on them kay did not respond to requests for comment adams added that he hoped to talk in person to executives from ticket resale firms such as viagogo , stubhub , getmein and seatwave ill be pushing for a further select committee enquiry into ticketing because technology has developed industrial touting and the fleecing of fans continues apace id like to see all the ticketing sites appear before the inquiry the labour mp sharon hodgson , who has campaigned for reform of ticketing , said it seems that nothing is beyond their grasp and greed and their willingness to exploit some of the most vulnerable in society whilst they are in a life or death battle such as cancer patients by profiteering in such a callous fashion , shows the very worst aspect of their business model fans expressed their disappointment on twitter after missing out on tickets and seeing them resold at a profit ash hayward \( ashhhayward \) sad to see people buying tickets for peterkay co uk dance for life for life selling them on for a lot more , no wonder we couldnt get oneoctober 22 , 2016kiah smith , 19 , from leeds , said she , her mother and a friend tried to get tickets for the lancashire comedians dance a thon the morning they went on sale but were unsuccessful i am absolutely disgusted tickets that were originally bought for the original face value of 28 50 are now being sold for 100 and above , she said there are genuine fans and people who want to go to the show to see peter kay and raise money for charity , and ticket touts are making a large margin of profit from them its horrible i was hoping to buy these tickets for my family as a christmas present and now no one gets to go and these people are making a fortune out of it it is even more disgusting because this is an event for charity and those able to pay upwards of a 100 per ticket could spend that extra money at the event and donating it to charity kiahleigh \( kiahleigh1997 \) absolutely gutted i did n't get tickets for peterkay co uk dance for life next year sold out well fastoctober 22 , 2016viagogo , which has also been warned that it could face legal action for advertising tickets before they go on sale , did not respond to a request for comment last month , the ticket resale websites seatwave and getmein , both owned by ticketmaster , agreed to remove tickets for the bbc children in need rocks for terry event from their website seatwave lists tickets for the peter kay dance for life event , but has pledged to donate all of its commission from their sale to cancer research uk however , those using seatwave to sell the tickets could simply bank their profits secondary ticketing has come under scrutiny in recent weeks , following the tabling of an amendment to the digital economy bill that would usher in jail terms for touts who use bots to grab tickets within seconds of their going on sale a government backed review by mike waterson , an economics professor at warwick university , warned this year that websites could be flouting consumer rights law viagogo is the brainchild of eric baker , 43 , an american tech expert who co founded the ticketing website stubhub which he sold to ebay for 310m \( 254m \) , a deal believed to have made him more than 30m viagogo has grown rapidly , capitalising on the huge demand for live events by providing a marketplace for people to resell tickets often at a hefty mark up and taking a commission a fundraising effort in 2009 valued the company at 300m but it is believed to have grown significantly however , since it moved from the uk to switzerland in 2012 its financial accounts have been private the companys investors include the tennis players steffi graf and andre agassi , bernard arnault , chief executive of the luxury brand lvmh , and the

how is everyone doing \? ready for november 8 yet \? tonight , i was asked to speak about a vision for the next hundred years of reproductive choice and justice its such a wonderful frame to think about what a feminist future might look like but i bet like a lot of you , its hard to imagine what the next hundred years will look like when so much of that , for women especially , will depend on what happens in just 18 days there is no overstating how important this election is its not just about the next four or eight years this decision is about sending a message about who we are as a country , and setting a very particular course for the women who live here well look back on this time as a watershed moment a moment that could , in fact , shape the next hundred years of womens rights but first i want to share a personal story a little over six years ago , i was pregnant with my daughter , layla and when i was 28 weeks pregnant , i got incredibly ill i developed pre eclampsia , which some of you might know is dangerously high blood pressure during pregnancy i was admitted to the hospital and within just a few days , i developed another complication called hellp syndrome , the short version being my liver was in danger of failing , and i was in danger of dying if my daughter was not born i had an emergency c section and layla was born weighing 2lb 2oz she stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first two months of her life , undergoing medical interventions to save and protect her that to this day i try to avoid thinking about but i was lucky , and she was lucky , and today shes a wonderful healthy six year old and i feel grateful for that every day i share this story often , because this was something in my life that changed me forever , that shaped who i am today and when i think about this moment , what i think about most often is how fortunate i was that i got sick far enough along in my pregnancy that i wasnt faced with the reality of needing an abortion to save my life and when i think about those days in the hospital the fear , the urgency , the confusion , the stress the idea that the government could ever become involved in my lifes most pivotal moment \? it horrifies me so one thing i want for the next hundred years \? i want for no person , ever , to fear that their most personal life choices will be made by someone else i want for no woman , ever , to be afraid that her scariest life moment will be made even more difficult and traumatic by government interference in the next hundred years , i want to see every woman be free from the fear that her body is not really her own and thats why i want to talk about this election tonight because thats whats at stake never before in american politics have womens bodies been so front and center in the national conversation and so at risk we are choosing between a candidate who has spent her political career fighting for reproductive rights , and a candidate who says that women who have abortions need to be punished a candidate who said this week in the final debate unequivocally that she will defend planned parenthood , and a candidate who promised to defund it a choice between a person who has spent her life in public service , and a braggadocious businessman who rips off his workers and , perhaps most tellingly were making a decision between a woman who has said that womens rights are human rights and a man who says if you want to , you can just grab women by the pussy theres a feminist rallying cry online right now that i like a lot , and it says november 8 , pussy grabs back now , i know that so much has been made of that comment , and the ensuing allegations against trump by multiple women that he did just what he bragged about doing on that tape and while some people may not see the link between sexual assault and reproductive rights , those of us here in this room know better we know that there is a direct connection between those who think they can touch womens bodies without permission and those who think they can legislate our bodies reproductive rights and justice has always been about a fundamental respect or in this case , disrespect of womens bodily integrity and autonomy either our bodies are our own , or theyre not and make no mistake , the conversation that were having right now about groping is not just salacious media fodder the way we come out of this moment the direction our culture shifts because of it will absolutely determine womens rights in the future we are witnessing a moment where our country could move backwards back to a place where boys will be boys and men will make decisions for women or towards a future where our culture and politics understand and respect women as autonomous full human beings those are the two paths right now , im optimistic that were on the right one the one that brings us to the feminist future all of us in this room have been waiting for when trump said he wanted to punish women for having abortions , there was outrage and he had to walk back those comments but more importantly , pro choice activists and organizations like planned parenthood were there to point out that while other politicians may not say they want women to be punished , thats exactly what would happen if abortion were made illegal and in fact , what has already happened to women like purvi patel , who was put in prison for inducing her own abortion in indiana our feminist future has no place for criminalizing women who decide if and when to parent when donald trump claimed that what he said on that access hollywood tape was just locker room talk , and later when former new york city mayor rudy giuliani said that all men talk like this , men across the country came out to say no this is not normal this is not acceptable men are better than this the feminist future that were fighting for has men fighting alongside of us , men who refuse to be insulted by antiquated and sexist ideals about what it means to be a real man when trump claimed that the women who have accused him of sexual assault were not attractive enough to warrant his unwanted attention , when he called women disgusting , when he called women pigs , the media who can so often get things wrong took him to task because our feminist future is not one where misogyny will go unchecked women have been disparaged and harassed for too many years , and were not going to take one more minute of it were done of course this feminist future the future that were so close to getting its not just being hinted at by the reaction and opposition to donald trump we are getting a sense of what that future could look like when we see the incredible way feminists and women themselves have changed the conversation this week , for the first time ever , a presidential candidate offered a nuanced and empathetic defense of late term abortions on a national debate stage this is a third rail issue that most politicians wont touch , but clinton talked about womens lives and experiences in a way that reminded us that this issue isnt just about policy its about us were living in a moment when feminism is wielding more cultural power than it has in decades , maybe ever people dont shy away from the word feminism any more , they embrace it when i started speaking on college campuses 10 years ago , i would ask how many people in the room considered themselves feminists back then , just a few people would raise their hands when i speak at colleges today , nearly everyone does feminism has become so popular that the conservative right has tried to appropriate it sarah palin calls herself a feminist , anti choice organizations call themselves the real feminists they recognize the power that the word and the movement have , and they want to use it toward their own , very anti feminist , ends but our feminist future is a smart one , and it knows that anyone who would legislate womens bodies , who would interfere in womens and families private medical decisions have no place calling themselves feminists of course , being in this incredible feminist moment when the first female president is about to win by taking down a man who is as close to a caricature of misogyny as you can get being in this moment doesnt mean that our feminist future is guaranteed its not those of us who have been doing this work for years know that every time women make political and cultural strides , there is an intense backlash were in the midst of it now , and it will only intensify if hillary clinton becomes president making sure that this backlash doesnt define us that we are not put on the defensive by it that is what will truly determine our feminist future will we get pushed back on our heels or will we look straight ahead and move forward \? will we rest on our laurels because we have the first woman president or will we take our moment to celebrate and then move on to the hard work that still needs to be done \? if the people in this room , and the people at planned parenthood are any indication we know the answer to those questions this is just the beginningmy daughter tells me that she wants children one day \( though she says she doesnt want to be pregnant her wife will have the kids \) but when she talks about having children , when i think about being a grandmother or a even great grandmother one day thats when i think about those hundred years that weve been talking about i think about what the world will be like for them and i have faith , i really do , that it will be a world that this will be a country where people determine their own destiny a world where we understand that reproductive rights are not just an issue of womens bodies but an economic issue , a family issue , and a human rights issue and the reason i have faith that future generations will see this vision of feminism and justice unfold is because of activists like you all here because of planned parenthood every day they are ensuring that the next hundred years will be years where womens words , lives , bodies and experiences matter years where were not defending ourselves from attack , but building something progressive and something real all of you in this room are doing what is necessary to ensure that feminist future i could not be more grateful to you , and i could not be more honored to join that fight with you topicsfeminismwomenabortionhillary clintonfeaturesshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare

a melbourne cinema has cancelled a screening of a documentary on mens rights activism for fear it could be potentially damaging to our credibility following online uproar the red pill , a documentary by film maker cassie jaye , was due to screen at palace cinemas kino cinema on sunday 6 november , at an event organised by mens rights melbourne the film professes to take a balanced approach to the mens rights movement , documenting jayes life altering journey where she would never see the world the same way again but it has faced backlash from members of the feminist community and has been criticised as unbalanced and in favour of mens rights groups the australian premiere was cancelled on wednesday , after an online petition calling on the cinema to abandon the misogynistic propaganda film eclipsed 2 , 000 signatures susie smith , who founded the petition on change org , said the film gave a platform to views similar to those of daryush roosh v valizadeh , a self described neo masculinist whose planned visit to australia caused a stir with immigration in february this is the kind of disgusting , violent message that is totally out of line with australian values and law , smith wrote daryush 'roosh v' valizadeh cancels neo masculinist meetings over safety read moreplease do not associate your cinema with the kind of people who teach men how to violate women physically and emotionally please stand with the women everywhere , and do not promote misogynistic hate the petition was directly referenced by kino cinema in its email to notify david williams , the event organiser and a spokesman for mens rights melbourne , that the screening had been cancelled guardian australia has contacted williams for comment williams pasted the email above a rival petition on change org , set up to stop extremists censoring what australians are allowed to see at time of writing it had more than 5 , 000 signatures in the email , the representative of kino cinema told williams that much of the feedback to the screening of the red pill assumed that it was a curatorial decision which is potentially damaging to our credibility as we are yet to see the film so cannot stand by its contents in the face of the criticism we are receiving a spokeswoman for palace cinemas confirmed that the email pasted by williams was sent by staff at kino cinema benjamin zeccola , chief executive of palace cinemas , told guardian australia on thursday that the decision to cancel the screening was made in the absence of any judgement of the film , filmmakers or attendees however , what was initially booked as a closed , private screening was being publicised widely and this in turn upset a significant proportion of our customers , who communicated their feelings to us directly upon receiving such direct feedback we realised that irrespective of the content , its presence in one of our cinemas was offensive to a large section of our core audience and movie club members therefore we took the decision to cancel the screening aware that regardless of the decision we took , a significant number of people would be disgruntled so we took the decision that we think was best for our customer base at that time jaye rallied against the decision on social media , and called for one melbourne movie theatre to defend free speech and host the screening the numbers are on our side , people want to see the red pill , so why arent any australian movie theatres wiling to stand up to censorship \? she wrote williams told the herald sun he was determined to find a new venue to screen her film cassie jaye \( cassie jaye \) it 's confirmed palace cinemas has pulled the red pill , a film they have not even seen ! read their letter here https t co ukarlj7s2xoctober 25 , 2016cassie jaye \( cassie jaye \) 2 , 370 uninformed protestors bullied a melbourne theater into censoring redpillmovie , but 4 , 700 have signed wanting to save the red pill ! october 26 , 2016cassie jaye \( cassie jaye \) just need one melbourne theater to defend free speech and screen redpillmovie , but they 're all saying they do n't want to invite controversyoctober 26 , 2016jaye told guardian australia she was very disappointed that a petition filled with lies raised the response it did , and that kino cinema had decided to cave to these bullies demands rather than stand up for whats right im still hopeful that the red pill will find a courageous australian cinema to support a screening of the documentary , and if that happens i believe that theatre will receive a lot of praise and support from the general public for standing up for free speech pointing to her portfolio of work , she said she was a supporter of womens rights and gay rights i am not a mens rights activist , even after making the red pill , but i do believe in having an open dialogue about gender equality and thats what my film is about , she said she told the website breitbart last year that she had struggled to find executive producers who were prepared to work on a balanced film about the mens rights movement we found people who wanted to make a feminist film though the film eventually raised more than us 211 , 000 on kickstarter , its release has been plagued with controversy , much centring around one of its central subjects paul elam , the founder of the mens rights website a voice for men , which has published some deliberately inflammatory articles on domestic violence , feminism and rape you see , i find you , as a feminist , to be a loathsome , vile piece of human garbage , reads one of his posts on the site i find you so pernicious and repugnant that the idea of fucking your shit up gives me an erection alan scherstuhl referenced elams writings in his review of the documentary for the village voice the red pill , he noted , was screened in theatres mostly so that outlets like this one get tricked into running reviews that , even if negative , confer some kind of legitimacy i apologise for taking the bait , he added david futrelle , a chicago blogger who tracks and mocks the mens rights movement on his website we hunted the mammoth , on tuesday updated his scathing open letter to cassie jaye published last year , to ask readers not to campaign against screenings of the red pill its just free publicity for them , he said jaye has has accused futrelle of sending her bullying emails , and told guardian australia he was a radical feminist troll blogger who has been discredited a countless number of times but futrelle wrote on tuesday that petitions against the red pill gave jaye and mens rights activists the opportunity to play the part of free speech martyrs its exactly what they want , he wrote so please dont petitions against the red pill , dont petitions against the red pill dont petitions against the red pill let it sink into the obscurity it deserves on its own guardian australia also apologises for taking the bait topicsmoviesdocumentarynewsshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content

right we dont know what the truth is my point to you is , as a media story , we dont get to say the ten women are lying , kelly continued we have to cover that story , sir gingrich dismissed kellys assertion , and decried the amount of focus paid on trumps sexual assault accusations you are fascinated with sex , and you dont care about public policy ! gingrich responded and thats what i get out of watching you tonight im not fascinated by sex , but i am fascinated by protection of women and understanding what were getting in the oval office , kelly retorted its not about me its about the
