the mainstream media is faulting trump for a turbulent start to the presidential but part of the chaos is baked into the process and its excessively large job says analyst r pillar disarray in the trump transition apparatus has been a major news so much so that one of the recent twitter offensives has been to assert that there any disarray and to castigate the new times for covering the disarray amid all the transition horse race coverage of in and out and which appointment will be even more controversial than other almost no one is taking this episode as another reminder of how needless is much of this confusion and turmoil trump and mike pence during day three of the republican national convention grant the united states is alone among advanced representative democracies in subjecting itself to disruption in which thousands of government officials are replaced every time the electorate changes the political leadership far more common among sister democracies is changing of government that entails replacement of a slate of ministers and a small number of assistants and with a permanent professional service underneath them charged with carrying out whatever policies are identified with the leaders whom the voters have elected most of the positions that have been the focus so far of the transition in the united states are posts that would be changing as well in those other democracies but there are thousands more jobs to the turmoil is just beginning the confusion is worse this year because so many of the presumed policies are themselves confused extrapolations from fragmentary and often contradictory comments he made during the with no prior public service on his part from which to draw conclusions because of the quality of so much of what passes for a trump more is riding this year than most years on who wins the contests for plum jobs but the disadvantages of the whole disruptive process are not unique to this transition or to trump unnecessary disruptions one of the biggest disadvantages is the sheer disruption with all the resulting interruptions to governmental programs and foreign relations newcomers are still learning the location of rest rooms and the phone numbers of essential contacts elsewhere in the government as continuing business must be transacted it also has become routine with each transition for many senior positions to remain vacant for months after the inauguration president returning to the white house on white house photo by the quadrennial purge of upper levels of the government may be consistent with the habit of thinking of policy in terms of discrete but it is inconsistent with the larger reality that notwithstanding the understandable focus on where political parties and candidates differ most of the important business and important interests of the united states continue across administrations this certainly is true of the vast majority of issues in foreign relations here the trump transition has made transition confusion among overseas partners even worse by eschewing the usual procedure of coordinating a contacts with foreign leaders through the state departments operations center the politically sensitive matter of who gets a phone call before whom has been thrown to the wind and the ordering determined by such things as whether pro golfer had trumps phone number to give to his prime minister not least and the knowledge that comes from continuous work on a problem matter a lot in the sound administration of policy that is what one gets from a professional civil service and does not get from most newbie political appointments political support appears so far to be at least as important a criterion in trumps appointments as it is with other incoming administrations it is not what makes for carefully crafted and skillfully executed policy passing out plums the usual rationale for making political appointments in the thousands is that this helps assure that the elected presidents policies will be fully implemented and is thus consistent with the democratic principle of policy reflecting the will of the voters who elected that president political adviser to trump from in the filling of those jobs often has nothing to do with the will of the results in policies that may even be contrary to that and puts into office people more inclined to pursue their own agendas rather than any agenda associated with the president or any platform on which he or she ran in most transition probably the single factor that most influences which of the ambitious and willful people aspiring to senior executive branch jobs will get the jobs is which of those early in the primary stage of the election made better political predictions than other people and hitched their wagons to what turned out to be the winning horse amid the disarray of this we have the added spectacle of senior appointments depending on such things as internal squabbling over who runs the which in turn depends on such things as the getting revenge on the previous transition head because he had prosecuted the father for tax evasion and other crimes none of this has much of anything to do with democracy the periodic purging of the senior governmental ranks is one of several ways in although may be reluctant to admit democracy lags behind democracy elsewhere a better this years election gives multiple reasons to long for a parliamentary system one reason is that those appointments that are the focus in the united states of transition team politics and possibilities such as a john or would instead mostly go to members of the winning party who had been shadow had themselves been elected by the and had acquired and demonstrated some expertise with clusters of issues as exhibited in parliamentary debate the system also makes for far clearer and better understanding of who is responsible for policy and who should be held accountable for failures or rewarded for successes notwithstanding the advantages of checks and balances in the it does not provide democratic accountability when
two very unpopular candidates made the presidential campaign an embarrassment for democracy the outcome could become one more tragedy for observes marks by marks mourning seems a strange response to election as i consider my feelings after the presidential realized its another chapter in a sequence of tragedies throughout my life i was eleven when the news of president assassination came over the loudspeaker in our classroom our yet inspirational teacher wept at her desk in front of us her tears taught me more than any explanation of those events could ever reveal not many years i suffered the shock of the killings of and martin and wondered at how these horrific events would shape the future i had wanted to be an but soon realized that going to the moon as a air force pilot might have the prerequisite of bombing i began understanding the damage the was doing with its military and made a conscious decision to stay away from space and politics it seemed you could only improve yourself to make a better world politics was not for the peaceful by the stench of drifted across the country i was a smoking gun is not needed in a murder but somehow had become a necessity in political crime but defenders could not counter undeniable evidence of illegal activity by both the president and his aides that was found in white house audiotapes most of the political nobility escaped the consequences while and a few accomplices took the fall we knew was a war criminal years but set a precedent that our leaders must be caught in the act of some far narrower and less consequential crime to prove they are scoundrels we do know that feared and obsessed on the revelations of worse crimes in his past s the heinous crime behind retreating from politics ever more convinced of the darkness in i retreated convinced that only personal actions and relationships could shape the world and his running mate bush there was a glimmer of hope during jimmy carters he was a seemingly honest supporting alternative energy and a cleaner and allowing investigations into foreign and domestic assassinations of the previous decade but few were moved or surprised by the contradiction of the warren commissions findings and the congressional pronouncement that had been killed by a conspiracy in my first daughter was born during the northern summer even the election of two months later eclipse my elation i recall thinking about how the world might be different when she became a woman i could only attempt to be a good enough father so that she would be kind and and brave and bright enough to gain her equanimity it was only a month after the election that john died it was then i mourned his murder and rise as a converged event had been hounded by the junta that had taken over the country he had once our society is run by insane people for insane objectives i think were being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and i think liable to be put away as insane for expressing that i recovered with the knowledge that the power of johns music would stay with and knew his spirit would give perspective and strength to my daughter and the many children whose lives were just beginning despite his john idealism had been magnified the combination of rise and death in with the background of earlier assassinations of political continued to shape my world disgusted and repulsed by the it was a time for further retreat and the nurturing of ideas for a better future my second daughters joyful arrival in of coincided with the stabilizing the middle firing shells into our ally and the people were fighting a horrific ground war with the conflict was far though i knew interests in oil resources in the region would eventually turn around to impact our lives directly despite the violence perpetrated by our i was still resolved to make a better world for both daughters in my own small way although very i knew they were part of a generation of empowered women who might be able to change the course of the planet hypocrisy of in revelations of the hypocrisy of and his gang emerged during the contra investigation and hearings i was fascinated that had sent a bible and cake with of to leaders when he had publicly invoked as greatest enemy by helping with sophisticated weapons for and his team could secretly fund the contras in a dirty war outside the scope of congress president bush with director at the white house on the issue of foiling congress seemed to distract from what was an important why was helping the strongest voices for jihad in the i recall thinking how any democratic president would have been drawn and quartered for such a betrayal to the country came away from the affair largely he protected by as the press he was surrounded by organized criminals of the highest order i could no longer bear just watching events unfold the crimes of pushed me to where i had to get involved i offered my support and assisted with the work of a handful of dedicated journalists investigating the tracing back secret arms sales to in the to an earlier arrangement in which secretly approved arms sales via to immediately after taking office in the evidence pointed to presidential campaign having secretly made a deal with leaders to delay the release of the hostages until after the presidential election polls had shown that if the hostages were released before election jimmy carter would have won reelection the held the hostages until had taken the oath of office on but the statements and testimony of a couple of dozen witnesses including officials in and the united states along with important documentary evidence failed to shake off in i watched as a modern version of the emperors new clothes played before us
email trump has stated on advice of his he will not release his tax returns until his audit is by has released her federal not her state or possible other language on her campaign website asserts that she and her running mate continue to set the standard for financial transparency the returns reveal much but they reflect a standard short of full financial transparency more the tax reductions the receive when donating to their foundation and the lower rate of taxes they paid compared to those who make much less reflect some of what is wrong with the tax system gross income is the gross receipts minus their business expenses and of a carried forward capital loss that started in total federal taxes is their income taxes minus foreign tax credits only years plus taxes and additional taxes due to the affordable care act taxes and taxes on investment income starting in for the the foreign tax credit came to or less each year from and arose from work done abroad for years the table below shows the reported gross total federal taxes charitable and the amount of the latter going to the foundation what follows mainly focuses on the tax return income almost all of the gross income after deducting expenses was derived from with the biggest amounts for making speeches more than million made by and million by consulting million made by and writing million made by all of their speaking income is paid by the harry walker agency under who paid the agency or to whom they spoke is not disclosed the tax return indicates that million of bills consulting before deducting was paid by gems education a article describes gems education as the largest operator of private schools in the as of has over schools in over a dozen countries in bill named gems education a strategic partner of the global initiative according to the tax in for the first gems education paid bill raising its payment each year thereafter laureate education paid bill it is described in the new times as a network of schools in laureate hired bill as its new honorary chancellor as disclosed on the tax it paid him over million from bills visits to laureates campuses were described to have inspired the nature of the advice provided is not part of the tax return business deductions both took deductions against their income these deductions are supposed to be ordinary and necessary meaning they are common and appropriate their expenses deducted for and hotels came to several times what most people earn at their jobs in bill claimed travel expenses of for his speaking an amount considerably less than the spent on travel for that business in by his total travel expenses for his consulting business for and together came to less than travel expenses for making speeches in came to another was spent on travel for her writing business in under specific details such as where they went and and for how are not provided tax income is subject to social security and taxes paid by the in social security taxes were paid on only the first of net income at a rate of resulting in a maximum tax of the portion which is of all net income had no income limits if one adds the tax to their additional tax under the affordable care the total comes to or of their total net income the returns show the gross unfairness of the tax that leaves those with high incomes paying a rate that is much lower than those with significantly less income for a person making of income after deducting expenses would pay a tax of which is over of their or more than times the rate paid by the unearned income from the reported no dividend income from stock only interest income in it came to only all but was paid by chase bank how their money is invested with the bank as allowed by the not made clear probably in the form of or bonds by in the made over million in interest income and over in dividends all of the latter is reported as coming from trusts in they also reported over million on the sale of stock held by their trusts most sales were for less than with only one for slightly more the most sales occurred on or before may reflecting very good timing since this was shortly before the financial meltdown their stock holdings were diverse they consisted of holdings in major corporations including bank of general and brothers prior to its bankruptcy at first one might see the as acting upon information that the economy would soon but they may have decided to rid themselves of holdings that might be used against in her run for the presidency in reporting no dividends from probably indicates no into the stock market after the or that they only purchased stocks that paid no dividends there is a huge difference between their total interest and dividend income in of with their interest income of and no dividend income despite the low interest how could their dividend and interest income have plummeted so given the size of their total income all these one has to wonder if they have been spending it all or investing it in ways that do not show up on their tax this raises other questions have they been making large donations or paying large personal legal have they set up an entity that handles investments and pays taxes on the income generated instead of passing it through to them individually to report on their tax charitable contributions those who usually receive the biggest reduction in their taxes per dollar donated are those with the highest income because they are in a higher tax bracket many charitable donors receive no tax reduction because they do not itemize their deductions in the donation to their foundation of million reduced their taxes of the money
by why did they vote for this if we understand why that choice was we will all get and not only in north but also all over the since the results of the latest presidential elections were i am longing for while the overwhelming cacophony of deafening noises is assaulting my and in fact all my senses suddenly everyone around me wants to to and to declare people who are surrounding as well as those who are far away from me are frantically watching the reading newspapers and browsing through countless political websites my friends and comrades all over the world are poking jokes at the us political or trembling in anticipation of something even apocalyptic many are just having fun even some thoughtful and educated individuals are behaving like obsessive football passing and spending countless hours on the in front of their television screens of course there are also many gigantic protests in countless cities against the the leader of the mightiest nation on earth there are some massive desperate and hopeless protests there are also personal resigned shrugs of shoulders and downcast glances overall there is a lot of noise everyone is speaking from the top of his or her lungs people are shouting over each other they want to be desperately while very few are listening very few also appear to be reflecting on what is being said by the on what is truly on what has happened despite millions of words and images assaulting our brains from all i know that something is definitely something and even something essential it is not just my analytical mind that comprehends it is also my intuition as a i want to smash those television sets in my i want to throw newspapers into the garbage and i want to go far from all my politicizing friends and comrades but what is it that is being omitted in the official and even in the alternative what is it that i want to longing to hear so much longing with such even with such am i desperate for some precise for exact for revealing am i yearning for one brilliant for a do i want to hear from someone why on earth did the people elect someone like like or is it all actually much more simple and do i expect those wise words to come from my own typed into my computer with my own how did it all really come to and what will happen what will happen to them the what will happen to the which despite everything used to be my home for many what will happen to which took so but which also gave me i kept above what will happen to the to the entire which is now my true and which is also their true home of the although perhaps they do not fully comprehend it yet i did not want to hear the i care less about the numbers i was not longing for and i felt absolutely no desire to there was only one longing left in to to to absorb the millions of voices of those who just recently went to the polls and stuck those pieces of paper into most likely changing the destiny of the world and since i knew i be able to absorb millions of i wanted to listen to at least a few hundred or even thousands of them if possible i wanted to hear the stories of those men and women from the from the deep from isolated farms and exhausted mining towns i wanted to put my glass of beer next to in some and just nod and whisper what so many storytellers before have done for and what they will be saying for many centuries to please tell me your story i want to hear their stories so i can collect arrange and pass them onto the world i want the people who voted for trump to speak to to to let me into their thoughts and emotions i want to understand what occurred through their stories i want to judge i am usually very very and very ideological this time i have no desire to be this is too too damn i owe that much that is the least i can do to return to fly there all the way from to rent a and drive from coast to for long and to finally listen to trying to understand who they what they and i am what i am because i am a passionate i was once told by one of the greatest people always know what goes on all we have to do is to listen to them and we have to lead them only when they ask when they order us to do so there is no doubt in my mind that now is the time to attentively listen to the to fill newspapers and websites with their words but almost no one seems to be doing that all we hear is why they voted as they did how they particular classes or states we read about numbers but we hear people we hear them formulating the words and that is what i am longing to shut to be and to listen and i want other intellectuals to shut up and to humbly listen not because i agree with what the have done not because i want trump to lead the country and the empire not because i suddenly fell in love with the small people it is simply because the people of the most powerful country on earth have because they made their choice and if we understand why that choice was we will all get and not only in north but also all over the i want to listen and to understand so the course of action can be so that we know where all this will lead because this is not the just the beginning of something

riots in on third night of protests trump returns to twitter to complain about protests by media by reason there were more protests around the country against the election of trump last with police in declaring the protest there a riot due to deteriorating conditions rioters there threw objects at attacked newspaper and smashed windows police said protesters were trying to stop from destroying and tweeted that it encouraged others to leave the before declaring the situation a riot and issuing orders to disperse the police say they made arrests and dispersed the crowd using pepper ball distraction and rubber baton returned to twitter for the first time since being elected on night after spending the day in tweeting that incited by the are calling it news described the tweet as an end to a brief stretch of conciliatory behavior since although one salty tweet in a hour period does seem like enough data to come to that conclusion trump had to as news put also pointing out trump himself had tweeted in favor of a march on after mitt and suggested if he lost riots could least two other prominent trump sheriff and former rep had also tweeted supportively of protests and civil disobedience before the election but called for a tough response after they did not expect trump to so the calculus changed things are different now that he not for trump tendency to make loose statements and the media tendency to botch interpretations of those tweet was characterized as not sure what was expected at this particularly since such protests until worked in trump favor the trump campaign a rally in after massive protests there trump said the protests would his clinched the nomination in may by i noted how attacks on trump supporters by protesters were an apparent effort to help get trump elected in late when protests and riots erupted in after a fatal police shooting i suggested the city was working hard to get north in the trump when there were protests and around the i suggested this trend to could end up helping trump by earning him political capital and helping drive conservatives back into the fold protesters say they are demonstrating because trump has created a climate of fear for minorities riots also have that tendency if the mostly white rioters in last night provide police in the city to ramp up that endangers marginalized people the most protests last month over a police contract the outgoing mayor pushed through before leaving office failed to stop the and it not unreasonable to fear tonight riots will increase tensions in altogether different for all the talk of what else could violent protests over the result of an election be other than voter won but that still leaves a minority of trump voters watching their fellow citizens destroy property over the way they voted and it leaves a slew of residents who did but will probably eventually be blamed for trump win as well blame anyone but and the democratic protesters like to compare trump to yet it does seem they understand their own comparison used civil the greatly expand his powers after he had already been elected at the republican trump called a crime and said he could solve the country problems protesters are setting the stage for him it hard to imagine what continued violent protests group has organized as a can accomplish other than creating a climate of fear trump could exploit to make it easier to get what he whatever that turns out to of a mostly white riot in would perhaps be incomplete with a note about the occupation of a remote outpost in the national wildlife refuge in in protest of federal prosecutors reneging on a plea deal with two ranchers who had set a fire on their property that spread onto federal appealing the sentences handed down in favor for longer ones those protesters were called by many commentators because they were armed the went viral no one has suggested or have been under attack nor has anyone called the protesters or rioters terrorists but as one side has created a precedent when it was convenient rhetorically in the short term that can be used by the other side with as if not protesters are concerned about the powers trump will president and the congress have two and a half months to try to get something accomplished in terms of limiting executive power the prospect is unlikely already protests make the prospect less and also place efforts at reducing government power after trump is in office at a disadvantage although protesters may be more interesting in expressing their including by than reducing government power and constraining the office of the smashed protest in proclaimed riot some people started their protest at pioneer courthouse square and moved to northeast according to the daily

rotten to the core who will be in trump a few possibilities by information clearing house today after a stunning win that upended the political trump and his top advisers now must put together a white house staff and cabinet a group that may well include some of those same are a few possibilities for some of the most powerful roles in a new trump administration the city mayor became one of trump surrogates the former prosecutor could now be in line for attorney the speaker became a top adviser and television spokesperson for trump during the campaign and was even among the real estate mogul finalists for running mate he is said to be interested in becoming secretary of corker the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee could also be a possibility to lead the state a onetime trump emerged as one of trump most steadfast surrogates the renowned physician would be an obvious candidate to be surgeon the retired general emerged as trump most visible military adviser he could be in line for defense secretary or some other national security sessions during the primary sessions became the first sitting member of the senate to endorse trump campaign the senator could be another possibility to lead the the chairman of the republican national committee which ran the trump campaign operation could wind up as trump white house chief of trump finance formerly of is in line to possibly become treasury though shadowed by the recent the new jersey governor has been a fixture at trump side since endorsing him in and will likely have his eye on a spot in the new administration at the justice department or in the white the news executive became trump campaign in august he could be in line for a spot as a white house his job is already known vice president the governor and former congressman is expected to play a large role in the trump administration as a partner to the new who lacks any experience serving in government
the foul stench of fascism in the may be shocked by the election of trump but black and brown smelt it throughout this summer and i have interviewed fellow asking them about their feelings and experiences regarding this presidential election in all of these one thing was we knew this was some of it hung like a foul smell in the air the acrid stench that generations before somehow learned to live though it choked them many of us coughed and spluttered when that suffocating air filled our lungs some of us cried out in when those of us who spoke up were heard at we were greeted with or with laughter like some i wrote about that were given the assurance that there were some for whom that acrid stench was a breath of fresh but those foolish people were few and unimportant we were told the smell would go away on its own it went nowhere it lingered and it got for some of it was more than a smell for some unlucky ones such as it became a physical parked his car in my beloved town of hood to take his dog for a walk as told the town started to get out of the and heard someone the car door smacked my head and then my head hit the door frame i lost part of my memory for about news of the assault hit our small it shocked us all we had a hard time believing especially when reported that the only other words he heard were you is not a he is a monk in typical monk his response was filled with am happy it happened to me and not to a he ca feel safe in a third of my own in my we spoke at length about the assault and what it meant by we had already seen that racism and white nationalism were on the rise the fact that an innocent monk was attacked at all was but that he was attacked for being something he for being nothing more than not was what really my town assumed it was isolated we assumed there was a small minority of people filled with assumed that the smell would go away on its news stories abounded about white people verbally or physically attacking and people with disabilities many people mostly white allies thought that it was rare not something to worry did believe that for a is a black designer who was living in in but was returning to his native white girlfriend and i are moving back to this he told me had originally planned to drive across the country and stop in new and phoenix needless to we not doing that any and his girlfriend took an plane instead too many stories of white backlash attacks in too many disparate places made them cancel their was jokingly worried about being opinionated in the south before this he said it untenable it incredibly sad that in i ca feel safe in a third of my own is not alone by many minority people in had already changed their and outlook marina an artist from began to avoid eye contact with people on the metro when someone looked at her and people are so experiences with actions and violence have existed before but have gotten the attention they getting now social media makes sharing these experiences easier than ever so things encountered kept to but with and twitter talking about with people throughout the i saw this pattern repeated minority people of various and racial groups were all doing the same were talking about the foul smell in the pointing out the real danger to anyone who would and they were all being more cautious around white people many of them changed their in subtle ways wear headphones more at work said a white lesbian woman who wants to remain anonymous for fear of a backlash at the legal practice where she works outside i just want to avoid the chance of getting into was being verbally assaulted and called because she spoke about wanting to marry her partner even in national symbol of a lesbian woman felt afraid to argue for her right to a marriage that the state had already given a black writer and actor in who did not want his real name had a somewhat similar take on avoiding arguments when he talked about the police goal is not to win the he told me goal is to get home happens to be tall and his car is fitted with special gearing to allow him to drive only with his hands it is a car that only someone his size can a white cop pulls me over one he told is looking me up and looking at my insurance and my and he asks me this your i what is that question supposed to we all know what it supposed to mean you looking at my and i have a car only i can drive i know why you asking that but not going to say because the goal is to get home so i just say sir it is white men are taking back to the i heard similar responses throughout the summer and minority people universally spoke of this election as a they spoke of being scared white people universally saw it as an accidental event that would just that could really happen warned us of exactly that sentiment a political writer who studied has written of the seriousness of this election in numerous telling us that ca happen is exactly how fascism happens her essays are like a plan for how to avoid a yet it seems that no one wanted to bring her map on this i warned us writing that are on the cusp of a historic decision in the us we can make history and transition from the first black to the first female

comments yet another one of the obnoxiously ostentatious monuments to trumps ego is going under the trump international hotel in is filing for a mere four years after it opened the champagne and caviar toned tower will be auctioned off after a bankruptcy judge placed the building into receivership on in a story that is now very familiar to all of us the million project was beset with lawsuits from the start from angry investors who claim that trump and his partners lied to them with wildly overstated projections of trump telling investors the worst case scenario for occupancy rates would be when in fact court documents show it varied between and politico details just how hard trump screwed his it is clear from affidavits in the fraud cases and the bankruptcy case that the buyers have taken a financial beating a warehouse supervisor named who was earning about a testified that he borrowed money from his a retired for the deposit on his hotel he never closed on the but he says he still lost a homemaker who was married to a mortgage borrowed money for her deposit from her she did and ended up losing through she says trump licensed his name for the project to talon owned by a the whole business model has been and and its trumps name on the thing said an insider to politico the hotel has been the site of numerous protests against the racist and a city of has publicly demanded the trump name be removed from the saying in a statement to the project managers there are some who may suggest that should just ignore or that he matter because he is a political figure in another country recent attacks against in and other show that we are not immune to hateful actions against peaceful people as the governments similar internment of is a part of our past that is still very painful for many to have the trump name displayed so prominently on our skyline signals a tacit acceptance of hateful and divisive views such is the legacy of disgraced businessman and divisive sexual angry angry and a prominent stain where the letters of his name once stood
the trump campaign is having a collective nervous breakdown after the letter about new emails failed to swing the election in his direction of the post tweeted a view from inside the trump my read of they know the path is very narrow they see the pub and but they scrambling map many of them describe the way to not as a direct shot but a series of upsets and bank of strong r showing depressed d turnout but list of hurdles goes on and on and highly organized early vote top hitting trail news also enthusing d voters what you seeing is a small group of aides who truly believe trump pitch can put new things in in spite of data the trump campaign is now that reality detached place where a few true believers are running the show this is why trump is going to spend the last week of his presidential campaign in blue states that he has no chance of winning trump still thinks that he can win and new might be the most laughable of three delusions because trump was routed in the republican primary and support from republicans like and walker has been lukewarm at best these are the final days that all losing campaigns go through when the nominee refuses to accept the likelihood of their defeat the letter move the needle for trump it give him a surge of national momentum or make the majority of voters rethink their support for the emails save so now he is going to waste his time campaigning in states that he will lose in search of a miracle as his poorly managed presidential bid stumbles to the finish line
by now everyone has been reminded that the media is not infallible it is composed of very fallible human beings who make mistakes with the same regularity as all the rest of us i was recently reading a bit about something in statistics called an observational dynamic named after its sir state it very problem is a situation resulting when observers assume that certain things are separate and when in fact they are not for those who failed to predict trumps electoral victory assumed that social conditions in the united states were isolated from those of the rest of the world such people failed to notice the evidence of widespread public anger in many other most notably and to take into consideration the big picture is still of no one can be right all the or even most of the time systems in the modern world suffer from too much input and rather than too little but deliberate lying is quite another matter and it is undeniable that some mainstream media outlets have deliberately sought to conceal the truth on a variety of domestic and foreign issues rather than act as a check on governmental the media has actually become an arm of government enforcing doctrinal orthodoxy with a variety of carrots and sticks that have proven to be reasonably journalists can play significant roles in this process consider a favorite example of the case of famed baseball player been an admirer of for a very long ever since reading his autobiography as a boy something never quite felt true about all those stories that other biographers would tell about him the worst of these was sports writer whose biography of has now been discredited as mostly was granted exclusive access to in and for his biographical purposes shared with him many intimate details of his life and but instead of faithfully reproducing those stump and outright fabricated numerous anecdotes designed to cast in the worst possible light stump portrayed as a southern racist was from a and even a murderer was not alive at the time all these stories began to circulate and was unable to defend add insult to stumps writings were used as the basis for a terrible film called which starred tommy lee the film is a tissue of lies and distortions that deserved at the box office the real was a and highly intelligent who knew how to court controversy when he had but was actually a gentleman by the standards of the era readers interested in further reading should consult the wonderful biography by entitled a terrible beauty famous photo of stealing third begin used brains rather than brawn to beat his opponents he made careful studies of all the top players of his day and crafted strategies designed to exploit their weaknesses for when he learned that pitcher hated hitting batters with would crowd the plate to force to walk him he learned how to get inside the heads of his forcing them to lose their when they would steal bases right under their noses he remains one of the few players in history who knew how to steal home legend about that has persisted is that he was a violent brawler this is simply not true it is true that men of his era got into fistfights was part of a healthy masculine culture back he never gratuitously assaulted or struck anyone the few incidents that have been held out as examples of his misbehavior a fight with a black and assorted hotel prove to be on closer inspection nothing

since we were we have been bombarded with propaganda that romantic love is the ultimate relationship ideal and literary fiction all portray romantic love as an absolute necessity in any wedding but how much of that narrative has been a is it possible that our pursuit of romantic love is actually preventing us from forming a lifelong pair began to question the notion of romantic love when thinking about its emotional root love is a fleeting and like all it comes and goes like the clouds in the sky why have i been taught to select my life partner based on an surely not encouraged to use emotion when buying a applying for a or doing my personal but when it comes to choosing a human being that supposed to spend the rest of my life advised by the establishment narrative to use emotion for the biggest decision of them major clue that romantic love is a childish strategy for choosing mates is the fact that countries with arranged where partners are picked based on purely practical have lower divorce rates that in countries where romantic love is used to select mates while there are multiple reasons for divorce in any it is rather coincidental that the countries most impacted by notions of romantic love happen to have the highest divorce rates was invented it turns out that your desire to use love as a precondition for marriage or pair bonding is an invented construct that had roots in destroying tradition and theistic authority a movement that began in the put romantic love at the not just for individuals but nations as all from a central thesis of individualism it wanted you to take the focus away from boring old rules and traditions to focusing on how you feel movement came primarily from bourgeois who used family money to fiddle away on idealistic writings the romantic movement was nothing more than a protest against bourgeois bourgeois society and morality to be extreme and flamboyant and unusual and violent even at the risk of becoming grotesque was the desire of every young romantic the romantics in bourgeois who were trying hard to escape from their own shadows source romantics believed that men and women ought to be guided by warm emotions rather than the cold abstract rules and rituals established by bourgeois society source they sound a lot like modern day social justice warriors many of whom are trust fund babies that lash out against privilege and inequality to relieve the psychological pain of being wealthy without having had to earn it combined with the fact that also trump feelings over its clear to see how romanticists were whose individualistic ideas are just what the enlightenment needed to complete its destruction of what relationships should be based on prior to the romantic love was the relationship form often described in literature and other historical love is the emotion which often gives people extreme feelings of and can also give people feelings of anguish love is the form which creates a steadfast bond between two and gives people feelings of peace scientists have described the stage of passionate love as being on since during that stage the brain releases the same as when cocaine is being used source song of songs in the old testament writers were not encouraged to muse endlessly about passionate and there is zero evidence it was used as the principal factor in forming new but its this passionate love that were told to strive of feeling like been swept up in an exciting before publishing the gory details on or in a bestseller like eat pray authored by a woman who is embarking on her second divorce of the romantic era played a big part in elevating romantic and why its much more fun to get swept up in the excitement created by alpha male than it does to do arduous daily duties before you and god women were given the chance to pick between excitement or and we know what they have works of the romantic era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period the romantic period saw an increase in female authors and also female readers source modern era has doubled down on the notion of romantic love psychologist proposed the popular triangular theory of love which is often used today as defining the love ideal this theory has caused immense harm for stating that all three forms of love are needed in equal measure for a successful who takes an introductory psychology or who reads a pop psychology will be exposed to this and walk away thinking that passion is absolutely required in a relationship if its not the presumption is that the relationship is no longer consummate and far short of that romantic love and passion are necessary in a marriage makes it that much easier to exit out of because when a woman no longer feels she will walk away knowing that experts like would agree that the relationship degraded and was no longer worth saving and this is exactly what modern women are doing in droves they have shown an appalling disregard for their wedding especially upon realizing that they initiate of divorces and the rise of nationalism if nationalism came out of the romantic and passionate love was a does that mean nationalism is also a of romanticisms key ideas and most enduring legacies is the assertion of which became a central theme of romantic art and political philosophy from the earliest parts of the with their focus on development of national languages and and the importance of local customs and to the movements that
