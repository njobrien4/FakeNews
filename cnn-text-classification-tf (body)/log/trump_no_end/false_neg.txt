picture the scene a us air force falcon has come down over the pilot is being held by state which threatens to behead him video shows the pilot being tortured in a while the terrorists taunt new us trump the family plead for the white house to save him the drama is dominating the news networks a media storm what will trump nobody has a clue trump lacks military experience he has never served in the armed forces nor does he have any background in diplomacy what trump does by all is a short fuse a tendency to shoot first and ask questions later his predecessors would have played for appealed to local or pursued talks while examining options for a president trump is different unused to the awesome responsibility of the oval under fierce pressure to enraged by personal infuriated by accusations of and determined not to show it is easy to imagine trump making a hasty and disastrous call with a few translated into trump could not only lose the he could plunge the us inextricably into the quagmire of another middle east war there are grave doubts about trump volatile temperament and macho doubts about volatile temperament and macho instincts also apply in other global where a us or are always critical and sometimes lethal here are five dangerous issues that could suddenly and unpredictably test the novice cool and common sense in the first days of his and hostage scenario is not wholly imaginary in last a royal air force was captured and burned to death in a cage by the after negotiations for his release failed similar repeat incidents involving and members of the and local are becoming more likely as the endgame in the fight against the caliphate battle is being fought out on two main fronts one is the siege of northern principal city trump has the conduct of the which involves the mainly and militias backed by us special forces commandos but he has not offered an alternative the same holds true of the attempt to seize the headquarters in in northern trump says that defeating terrorism is a top priority and he will the shit out of but including appears to know what this means in practice if the battle goes will he will he cities where millions of civilians is he prepared to deploy us ground what will he do as seems both sieges become bogged or begins daily executions of is also silent about significant military intervention in and and its parallel fight with the president wants two things from an end to us support for the and the extradition of a cleric exiled in the us who he blames for last failed coup with on the back foot and the

rupture with but a reset will come with a price in the first authoritarian will want a relaxation or scrapping of punitive sanctions imposed after annexed in to dismay in trump has suggested he may also seems likely to get his way in where forces have pushed his to the brink of victory in and elsewhere trump has made no serious objection to actions in even though the says they may constitute war crimes he seems content to have remain in or even to treat him as an the renewed use of chemical for new or a suddenly escalating humanitarian and refugee catastrophe could all trigger a new crisis that blows up in forcing him to move against the idea of zones and civilian safe havens still has backers if trump goes down this he could end up directly confronting allies cannot do much about insouciance but they will strongly oppose him if he tries to run down the as he has suggested pressure on easternmost members in the and in terms of political missile deployments and military exercises is reaching new heights and operations are increasingly reported in and elsewhere in the eastern remains a ticking any of these could ignite at any time in first governments want to present a united front but trump seems more interested in buying off by acquiescing in reclamation of former cold war spheres of influence disdain for the he loudly applauded vote to leave and critical reaction to his notably in and point to a possible schism down the road if it trump will have helped achieve a strategic shattering years of shows no sign of backing away from its expansionist policies in the south china and east china seas it is busily transforming reefs and tiny islands into military which will ultimately give it control of sea lanes through which much of the maritime trade passes china continues to ignore the rival territorial claims of including whose commerce is directly counter the us and japan have stepped up naval and air patrols in the disputed areas they

nationalist feeling in china is periodically whipped up by the communist party if trump blunders into this delicate or deliberately tries to push the the fallout could be terms of as a trap for an unwary leader elected a new president earlier this year whom the suspect of pursuing an independence agenda it has since increased pressure on including suspending talks has been a frozen conflict for so long that it is hard to imagine it suddenly going but xi is clear that he will
the polls were wrong and because we are obsessed with predicting opinions rather than listening to we see it coming the world woke up believing that republican candidate trump had a chance of winning based on polling predictions roughly the same chance of rolling a total of six if you have two dice despite those the next us president will be have a few ideas about what went wrong in the four years spent as a data been concerned by how much faith the public has placed in polling just like check the weather before getting many people checked presidential polling numbers before heading out to vote understandable politics can feel as unpredictable as the and who want to eliminate the world is a scary and confusing place right those are two very different kinds of forecasts one is based on natural the other on social science people are different from planets they can change their they can decide to not share their opinions or they can lie and before you even get to some of the statistical issues that make polling not new information polling analysts like me knew the numbers were inaccurate before happened despite the polling predictions kept coming spent almost two years working for website where i hoped to learn the secrets of political forecasting i walked away totally disillusioned it sometimes seemed as though their interpretation of the math free from subjective bias there was also a certain arrogance that comes from being part of an elite that the and an entrenched hierarchy meant that predictions properly analysts such as a man dubbed an a soothsayer and a savant have an interest in continuing to share these predictions where would the career be if he simply replied when asked what would not just the new times also got it along with news and countless others just about everyone did because they resist the temptation to try to guess human guilty too i wrote column after column under the label explainers and videos cautioning against the use of but no one really cared i carried on describing who was ahead because readers still wanted me so the are also complicit in this huge mistake you probably want to hear you probably want to have a difficult conversation with your aunt whom you knew was voting for trump you probably want to think too much about the fact that the united states is a country deeply divided along racial and economic lines rather hit refresh on a little web page that tells you how will vote too bad the numbers were wrong twitter political polls are bad for elections
for many people which brought the planet the trump election the deaths of bowie and and the brief union that was has not been the greatest of the year has become so maligned that twitter is now awash with scores of posts listing the strange and terrible things that the last months can be compared the suggested metaphors for are a boy being knocked over by an uncooperative wheelie two bald eagles stuck in a drain and the death of the thanksgiving turkey pardoned by in we collate some of the most bald eagle trapped in a sewer pretty much sums up in metaphor for kid battling this trashcan is a metaphor for via this a crab rips its own arm hunter metaphor for a polar bear pats a dog and then eats seems like a metaphor for life lately more animal two moose were found frozen in a locked in is the best metaphor for seen yet the iron man love cats rt my cat has devised the perfect metaphor for the year white perfect metaphor for you have a lot to live up
nails it my wife and i have just returned from across for six weeks we looked for election signs all the way the only trump sign we saw was on the trump tower he once owned in we saw one a damp print in a front yard in the lefty area of the night of the second we saw one sanders same same area we did see two feel the bumper stickers on a car at an surf beach this was the only bumper sticker we began in across the and west to we through to st then through central up into then to across and to where i mailed my absentee ballot yet most significant was what we never the word republican nor the word anywhere on any sign or poster everywhere we saw posters and signs for candidates for the for state senators and and sheriffs all avoided listing their much attention has been focused on the timing of chief letter to congress saying his agency is investigating more emails potentially related to he chose to issue the letter just days before the hotly contested election but it is the scheduling that reveals the letter to be political released as it was on a afternoon that timing guaranteed no new information would be revealed at least until giving speculation and hyperbole a head start on the facts and it teed up the issue for the influential morning political that timing is a colleen burns when was running against for the democratic the popular narrative first female president versus first president excessive personality triggered a different about two maniacs running for president the fact that some of the original narrative has been lost that a week away from potentially seeing the first female president of the united states is a shame i follow politics but seeing the us elect a female president is an important and exciting sign of progress that seems to have been lost in the elections
a wealthy republican whom j trump selected on as the next secretary of has spent her career promoting a privatized vision of public education if she pursues that agenda in her new she is quite likely to face disappointment and frustration school reforms generally come in two vouchers and charter schools they differ in both structure and political orientation charter schools are public open to accountable in varying degrees to public and usually run by nonprofit organizations by allow students to attend any public or including those run by religious organizations and companies while charters enjoy support from most republicans and some vouchers have a narrower political those who tend to favor free markets to replace many government responsibilities working primarily in ms has been a strong advocate of and her charter work has often focused on making charter schools as private as possible the large majority of charters are run by in contrast with most states the family donated more than million to republican lawmakers earlier this year during a successful effort to oppose new oversight of charters that support made ms a natural choice for who proposed a billion federal voucher program on the campaign and has likened the public school system to a monopoly business that needs to be broken up but any effort to promote vouchers from will run up against the basic structures of education the united states spends over billion a year on public schools less than percent of that money comes from the federal and it is almost exclusively dedicated to specific populations of most notably students with disabilities and students in communities there are no existing federal funds that can easily be turned into vouchers large enough to pay for school tuition on the open market billion proposal would by very expensive it may be hard to fit into a budget passed by a republican congress that has pledged to enact large tax cuts for corporations and expand the military and eliminate the budget all at the same time yet billion nearly enough to finance vouchers which is why proposal assumes that states will kick in another billion states have that kind of money lying around the only plausible source is existing school funding but even if ms were to find a willing governor and state not that easy roughly half of all education funding comes from local property taxes raised by over local school districts they and their elected representatives will have a too this is where the intersection of geography and politics makes any national voucher plan much more difficult to enact the practicality of school choice is highly related to population density children need to be able to get from home to school and back again every day in a large metropolis with public there could be dozens of schools within reasonable travel distance of most families in a small town or rural there will be few or none and population as saw in the last is increasingly the dividing line of the politics a significant number of most ardent supporters live in sparsely populated areas where school choice is logistically unlikely at the same many of the municipalities where market reforms are theoretically much easier to put in voted overwhelmingly against the on election voters in liberal rejected a ballot measure by a margin that would have increased the number of charter schools in the despite strong evidence that the charters produce superior results for and minority schoolchildren in information technology offers a way around the population density problem virtual schools can be attended from anywhere with an connection colleges that have pocketed billions of dollars by offering courses are poised to make a comeback under the trump which is likely to roll back president efforts to regulate them but the federal government is a much larger financial contributor to colleges and universities than to and college students need an adult looking after them all day ms will probably be a boon to the relatively growing population of families that their children but most parents will still want their children in a school building during the taught by a not by a computer ms will also be hamstrung by the fact that her deregulated school choice philosophy has not been considered a resounding success in her home choice policies have led to a wild west of cutthroat competition and poor academic results while there is substantial academic literature on school vouchers and while debates continue between opposing camps of safe to say that vouchers have not produced the kind of large improvements in academic achievement that reformers originally promised
appears to have rebounded in popularity according to a new post which shows her leading against trump another poll from the la times shows trump ahead by five percentage so the overall average support for each candidate has remained unchanged since yesterday at a point lead for measures of national opinion are poles figures are but they ignore two groups of the undecideds and those who plan on voting for a third candidate look at the who are planning to vote for someone other than or trump take a look at the in in the midst of primary there were a lot more who seemed to be still making up their minds one in likely voters said they were undecided since that figure has slowly not so declined to about one in likely according to the polling the of voters who claim to be undecided seem capable of swinging the election if they all vote for she would win the popular according to if they went for win although they all swing in the same worth considering the intentions of these a undecideds arouse cynicism could anyone in this election possibly be skepticism they keeping their the where undecided respondents in the seemed to make a decision to leave the has only deepened suspicion of these there are three possibilities the undecideds truly know who to vote the undecideds know whether to vote at and they know exactly who they will vote for but want to disclose it with nosy pollsters briefly examine each of if individuals made up their own pretty difficult for analysts to anticipate their actions some electoral theory suggests that when people they opt for the safer option of preserving the status quo as was the case in the independence referendum that would work in favor as she would preserve her vote share in states like that have been democrat for decades but which now appear to be leaning increasingly voters in might break with history a majority of us adults trust elected officials the media for that the rise of with his suggests that many may now consider the status quo a scenario turnout will be crucial in this election and there is a real chance that many of these undecideds will simply not show up in survey firm changed their respondent group to better understand undecideds of their respondents said they would not vote though did not find a substantial partisan divide among these current campaign strategies would seem to suggest that low turnout will work in favor has been repeatedly trying to boost particularly among minority whom she will need in several swing states campaign advisers have claimed the strategy is now to suppress turnout rather than encouraging potential undecideds to vote trump also mixed evidence when it comes to understanding whether undecideds are actually secret trump voters who are hiding their intentions from pollsters in the primary polling averages matched pretty closely with final results in most states but voting in the primary season and the national election are pretty different partly because the individuals who show up to pick a nominee are more politically engaged voters in respondents who say undecided are some mix of all of these three groups for early voting suggests that some black undecideds might decide not to show up on election day but the geography of being undecided also matters why visited north on where he told a fate of the republic rests on your is worth of the electoral college votes required to win the white house and voters here are deeply split about which way the state should go current polling averages show trump beating by percentage points a meaningless lead because these numbers could be wrong by a few percentage points in either of likely voters in north said they were who they would vote for in a poll conducted on but a pretty crude measure of intention polls often force respondents to pick a side by starting the question with the words the presidential election were held today a later question in the same survey asked voters how certain they were about their choice of said they might still change their minds and said they change their minds early ballots in the state have promising news for though they suggest voters in north are choosing over trump elections
despite a lack of political business magnate trump swept to an improbable victory in the us presidential is clear that despite a series of his message resonated with a huge number of voters in key and revealed deep anger and trump wins us to deliver concession speech live read spoke to six trump voters about why they voted for the republican and why they think make a good want the legacy continued in the white is a man regardless of getting a hefty loan from his he used that money to make a name and legacy for himself i hope that experience as a businessman will enable our country to operate more effectively when it comes to managing our money i want to change to serve the people instead of a political system that wants to serve itself my life change except i will have more hope that my government is trying to make our country strong instead of pandering to its own liberal interests my main hope is that he will help balance our and secondly that he will help our economy to remain want the legacy continued in the white house we impeached one and there is too much scandal that revolves around the other why would i want that legacy in my he may say controversial but at least he tells you what he thinks i certainly disagree with anyone that has behaved in a racist or sexist way i feel like i know where i stand with trump he says what he right or and i know what dealing so tired of the media and democrats bellyaching about trump getting voted in what the people pretty sad when all you hear is gloom and doom on the which i thought was supposed to be a balanced representation of the two sides there is a whole other part to this country outside of your newsroom walls that actually thinks differently from the mostly liberal ideas that most news outlets put out there we are middle we are the hardworking people who are holding this country together with our and we are ready to have a country that keeps its book in balance like we do with our private bank accounts small business owner knows how to make deals that will make prosperous was a democrat for but my children and grandchildren need an that is out of debt all that did was double the debt since he took office i will feel a whole lot safer than i ever would with the biggest question is to ask why he kept sending troops and flooding us with refugees that are not vetted for the proper amount of time with the possibility of terrorists mixing in and coming to our my great nephew is still asking that question as he did two tours in he got out because he felt the president care about him or his comrades we have the greatest veterans in the i am one of them the last two presidents care about what happened to us created but minimum wage jobs you support a family on a minimum wage our manufacturing plants are the coal industry is gone from my area and would just shut it down the rest of the way is a failure thank god i have to use it but there are families that need it and if they afford it they get fined that in itself is the mindset of a dictator was going to expand it and make it available for illegals believe trump will be a good president because he knows how to make deals that will make prosperous again we need to bring our nation together i like the fact that all three branches are controlled by the same now we can get down to the business of straightening out our taking care of our our getting the economy moving again and repealing retired from the federal government twitter how the us election night want conservative cried when i left the polling location because i like trump at all i was deeply saddened to vote for him his his mannerisms and his inexperience repulse me i wish there had been another conservative choice without simply throwing away my vote i know if i travel outside of the us i will be deeply disliked because of him he is only a investment and i am trusting in the checks and balances of our country to prevent him and his from damaging the country too much hopefully trump will not affect my daily personally do not have a gun but i strongly support the right to bear arms it as a right that ensures protection from government tyranny i am also against has the opportunity to elect a supreme court maybe even two or three members considering the current health and age of some justices justices serve for a lifetime and i do not want the justices to be liberal i want conservative laws therefore conservative justices i can deal with a somewhat low four but i deal with a supreme court that swings liberal and i deal with losing gun rights i hope the years fly by and that he will do as little damage as possible i am deeply saddened by these options and i am not proud of our president in the least is exactly what you with you know decide who to vote for until the day before voting it was one the hardest decisions i have ever made i decided on trump for one zones guaranteed full scale war with on day one i mean how do you expect to initiate a zone over a sovereign that would then in turn guarantee a conflict with which will assuredly lead to know would have been business as usual as we ever closer to a nuclear war with four years is a long time but there is always and the next election a risk but one the

is taking trump at his of official is wondering whether trump will implement the agenda that won him the presidency some of like tech investor peter contend that trump should not be taken literally but the democratic senator from shows no signs of interest in that discussion as perhaps the democratic premier civil libertarian on capitol his anticipation of the trump administration starts from the perspective that the will govern as he against against for for surveillance from his perch on the intelligence is preparing for a going to have to make sure now that a political agenda replace a set of constitutional priorities the heart of said in an interview with the guardian this week is one of the few national politicians who can plausibly claim to have fought national security abuses and championed civil liberties with equal vigor in the w bush and administrations he is far more comfortable discussing policies or proposals than he is discussing opting to refer to trump simply as the look at some of what the has to say and it certainly ought to be a call from the standpoint of potential abuse of said a quote sticking in mind these days is one trump issued in after the democratic national committee which us intelligence has blamed on discussing his political i wish i had that power love to have that by it will no longer be hypothetical barely a week after the conceded that early for but he said he has early priorities for racking up in order to provide and advocates with the momentum needed to take on the trump administration one is to block a measure said is alive in the intelligence bill that would provide the with powers to scour browser history without court oversight his approach is the clock on the current congress and all these to see it get added to any other piece of legislation but congressional inertia can cut against him as an impending change to the federal rules of criminal procedure will vastly expand law ability to remotely hack suspect electronic unbound by jurisdiction opponents have few as the known as rule will take effect if congress what it does best which is said understand our backs are against the he and his including democratic senator coons and senator mike are attempting to delay the trump officially takes the stakes will escalate perhaps most urgent is proposal to create a database of which is light years away from what you can debate is will use my opportunities on the intelligence as a member of the democratic the bully pulpit that i to drive that message from one end of the country to another that would be said by the end of will come an epic fight against the intelligence agencies over surveillance they will seek the renewal of an expiring legal known as section of the foreign intelligence surveillance that permits a vast dragnet of data to include international fight to reform also got a lot more important as the result of the said he considers call this year to boycott apple over its encryption battle with the indicative of antipathy to said he fight the trump and democrats and republicans in the who propose weakening telling vice he would filibuster any such effort anticipates the fight against an issue prospectively settled under though anything but when it comes to addressing the history with going to have to deal with that a first step he is planning will be attempting to ensure the landmark torture report destroyed a very real possibility if it escapes legal limbo to return to a panel now controlled by report opponent burr of north allies are signaling that a legal prohibition on torture enacted in is not an immovable obstacle on this a former house intelligence committee be a process have to work through with and probably do it in secret and you probably do it through the public remains to be seen if would have access to such secret even from his perch on the intelligence committee the trump administration could revert to a process of keeping the full committee from learning most intelligence practices good with incoming ranking panel democrat mark warner of will become critical to those efforts yet might have had perch he was next in line to take the ranking membership with a move that would have strengthened opportunities for oversight over the intelligence agencies in the age of trump enormously doing so would have meant he would have had to give up his position on the finance and considered his potential loss of influence over trade enforcement and technology policies too high a price to the consternation of some of his allies outside government this horror show congressional oversight is more important than it has ever been before we would have preferred senator leave his chair on the finance committee and take the ranking chair on the intelligence committee we need his skepticism and diligence right and we need it said human rights john is vigorous and vocal defender of civil liberties and human rights and has often to prevent abuses and overreach by and other agencies in the intelligence he has been able to forge coalitions with republicans on discrete has seen his stable of allies diminish in recent years mark who pushed for accountability on lost his the only senator to have voted against the patriot failed in his comeback bid he can still count rand the as a partner on constraining acknowledged that was a hope we would have some more members in the senate who would be but he has vowed to should trump govern as he are going to both in the congress and in the around core constitutional the sanctity of the
anyone who feared that the leadership contest would get dull following the withdrawal of will be relieved after with john reputation for eccentricity is in safe hands he fared badly this but the clear the most assured media and peter whittle all got through the debate without difficulty there was no clear but equally nothing happened to challenge the view that will be most popular with members was but she sound much like a proper are two of the key news and the two in the disagreed over breaking point poster said she did not like i think it was but i like it i think it was insensitive and defended it the point behind that poster was absolutely correct we do need to get control of our borders and there is a deluge of people coming from the middle east and the idea of a common asylum policy certainly the right route to go down launching controversial breaking point poster during the referendum and whittle both sought to downplay the significance of the rise in hate crime after the vote asked about the if you look at the hate crime they did not go up substantially has been a slight rise but spoken to the police about this that happens after any national event this is nothing out of the ordinary the rise been that whittle said that hate crime had been going up anyway he the only point i would make is that in after the actually a huge amount of hate crime was more related to the terrorist attacks that were happening at the time all from me for for the comments says he would for some like killing children but it is policy to have a referendum on it if enough people call for says she is strongly opposed to one and always has and the case clinched it for says he would back the death penalty for people who kill and convicted for preying on children under the age of it the hustings is will post a summary entry was corrected on to more accurately reflect the views of the candidates says she would work with whoever says if he were he would probably vote for the libertarian candidate he does not like either trump or says one thing in is that he is not in says is with trump he thinks wrong whittle says is a there is an expansionist there but there is in the says says he does not really have an opinion about says is someone who needs careful says he agrees with but is not the biggest threat facing the country it is extremism says the security services have suggested that terrorists could be coming to posing as says she was angry when she saw child refugees coming to the there are children in the who are not being looked after properly she says it is reasonable to check their ages said he recently went to his investigation was on he says many migrants there have sold their homes they spend or there are genuine he says he spoke to refugees but he thinks only three or four of them were genuinely fleeing for their says he has acres there his wife likes organic and they can grow their own food on their land says she would like him to stay involved she would like him to be an elder someone she could consult that is how she used to work with him it would be like and she says she would like to stay if you do not like you can vote for because and both shunting off into the says he has worked with for years should become the honorary president of the party if he wants a he should get be an he points out says he wants to introduce direct democracy into the says that is not the case she wrote the party manifesto you cannot make policy like he says that illustrates the problem she does not trust says the last time something like this was tried was when wrote its manifesto in he implies idea work says is the only party that has a blanket ban on anyone who has been a member of the joining just because you want to control immigration that does not make you a he says says she did not approve of the poster released during the campaign she tells the caller she has a beautiful voice says the media are partly to blame the media accuse of being racist and after the vote to genuine racists thought that people who voted to leave the were also racist the media needs to consider its he says whittle says the assembly has looked at this hate crime has been going up for some time he says and he says that the increase over the summer was linked to terrorist attacks taking place at the same says these people do not make that distinction says he is very sorry for what has happened to the female caller but he is not responsible is a great he says he says the government should repeal the communities says the hate crime figures did not go up after the referendum but both sides pushed the the a week says that poster was correct the does need to get control of its borders but he says nationals should not feel under threat they will not be asked to go says there has been a slight rise in hate crime but this kind of thing happens after every national seeks to downplay significance of rise in hate crime after not says he says he employs and he does not employ them for their says he does not think this is relevant he did not stand for mayor on the basis of being says she does not think gender should also says

among the many asphyxiating gut punches delivered by his denigration of immigrants and pledge to deport them en stand out trump has now signaled that he will move to deport as many as three million immigrants after he takes and roll back executive action protecting more than undocumented immigrants brought to the united states as guesswork under way over the damage trump might from decimating what remains of the social safety net to trashing precarious efforts to curb global is chilling the promised attack on immigrants suggests we will see communities terrorized by what can only be fairly described as a police state received little attention is that trump would probably use tools developed by the bush and administrations to orchestrate mass deportations over the last the federal government has used local police and jails as a key tool to orchestrate mass deportations and precisely what trump plans to do on a more frightening scale than is secure now called the priority enforcement program it links an database comprising fingerprints entered by local law enforcement bodies to immigration and customs enforcement under secure communities made local arrests the key entry point to a deportation pipeline that removed million from the country another is authorized by bill but first implemented under which deputizes local police and jails to search out undocumented immigrants thanks to a strong immigrant rights curbed both to a limited in the case of secure heavily degree after overseeing mass deportations trump has clearly stated he will get rid of restrictions and embrace both programs with open the last two the political tied to wall street and indifferent to working has received a just share of blame for allowing trump to come to power when it comes to that blame is more well deserved than is widely understood for establishment leaders like bush and have attempted to placate rising on the right instead of confronting implementing immigration and border crackdowns instead of sating the hunger for the establishment has lent credence to their paranoiac fears over criminal immigrants rather than fighting their extreme policy the establishment built the right a monstrous deportation machinery that could now be used to utterly monstrous ends is how been used all what sounds so terrifying coming out of mouth today is not so different from what minus the brazen has articulated as policy in recent not families not children gang not a mom working hard to provide for her said in you meet the you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law if a be executive has failure to rein in national security policies hands trump a fully loaded to extend that analogy on has provided trump with fully loaded bullets and a army the immigration debate at the center of this election has at its core been utterly and his track record on immigration has been one that should have made trump proud he has orchestrated mass deportations the border patrol boasted more than agents in up from agents in and in there are miles of fencing along a heavily militarized border where human rights abuses are was a he was susceptible to pressure from an emboldened immigrants rights movement led by young people a movement that trump will be proud to include on his enemies list that movement won historic victories protecting the undocumented brought to this country as and another executive action protecting the parents of citizens the former could very well be overturned by trump the latter is held up in court thanks to an evenly divided supreme court thanks to electoral college win and republican will probably tilt right hard right once something that can do to help thwart trump and do penance for his own immigration sins in the after sending sharply and misleadingly conflicted told states and localities that sharing fingerprints with ice was essentially mandatory immigrant rights activists are campaigning for him to reverse course and make the program voluntary if does trump will have to explicitly make the program mandatory once again in order to implement mass deportations localities and states can sue in court to stop him administration has options to prevent a crisis of its own as the national day laborer organizing network put it in a memo sent to the white house on political bears responsibility for rise and should take action to limit the damage up to the who are now protesting about the coming trump presidency to make him do elections
oliver shadow he reveals the psychiatric association has a set up after psychiatrists told a news magazine that they believed the republican candidate in the presidential had advocated the use of atomic bombs in north was unfit for office went on to lose by to how unfortunate that the prohibition not to diagnose from a distance has prevented what would surely be a far stronger assertion of unfitness for purpose in respect of who has repeatedly asked why the us does not deploy nuclear weapons attention has been drawn to the similarities in mannerism and message between trump and another authoritarian and belligerent with there seems little room for doubt as to how with his dysfunctional would have reacted to the missile crisis and subsequent foreign policy if he is arguably the greatest threat to all our futures that we have for readers of novel the plot against campaign for the white house may sound rather in novel on an alternative history in which aviation hero is nominated as the republican candidate for president in and goes on to defeat franklin d on the back of a strong tide of popular first act is to sign a treaty with and promising that the us will not interfere with expansion in with as families increasingly feel like outsiders in society if you swap for for and for then novel seems frighteningly prophetic scrape away at the surface of society and there is something very nasty lurking you say police fended off trump supporters who attacked a peaceable protester but not whether they arrested the aggressors who had piled on holding him on the ground and grabbing his testicles while he was choked by one man who had him in a headlock those familiar with fascism in will the i cannot help thinking a lot this past year of the pioneering journalist from in who lamented that people ever their dictator in advance when our dictator turns up you can depend on it that he will be one of the and he will stand for everything traditionally and nobody will ever say to nor will they call him or duce but they will greet him with one great bleat of fix it like you oh she say great but you get the may be unduly optimistic to suggest that a victory for will end the nightmare of trump it may be only the beginning trump has indicated that he will not accept the result if it goes against him it is not beyond possibility that with his trump will accuse the of fixing the result and lead an armed insurrection after the extreme right in the us is nothing if not paranoid and certainly such a prospect is a deep concern of many fears that a trump victory would us all hope instead that on remember the motto of noble spirit the smallest i imagine it is the women we will need to rely elections

what is mad about this appointments and possible appointments the most maddening of by says is the naming of white as chief white house strategist the worst recent says came in the form of reports that trump enjoyed a conversation with president v of about plans to build strong and enduring relationship with and the people of not says given that is former officer who has committed crimes against his own people and seems to be guilty of war crimes as well he will never be a friend of and if trump thinks he can make that he will be tragically said the good news jersey gov was finally booted off the national says will perhaps now into the category of gone and is host

corporate profits why share prices have been going can read whole piece here trump will have to temper his global economists too much says chief economist mickey levy in a note to trump will learn quickly that international affairs are very complex and he will quickly come to rely on the various government agencies and experts that understand and influence the approaches on international

we may as well call this what it a nothing else comes close to capturing the political revolt and the chaos that surely follows from stunning victory in were all wrong so badly wrong the the the press the the the business leaders victory makes the upset of look like a quaint tiff over a round of trump wins presidential plunging us into uncertain future read and its relationship to the world has fundamentally changed overnight an era that stretches back to franklin d just came to an abrupt and ugly end instead of being an globalist the united states has definitively turned shutting its borders to and any number of other perceived enemies of demagogic the same itself has been redefined the bond between its president and its constitution will be if trump pursues a fraction of what he so clearly promised through this extraordinary political enemies notably can expect prosecution led by an that previously found no grounds for legal action over her private email server the trump department of justice will seek prison time for and the only barrier to this punishment is the third and independent branch of the promised a deportation force to round up hundreds of if not of undocumented immigrants starting on his inauguration day in his transition to government will surely be dominated by plans to rip through the communities of largest cities there will be no judicial restraint in these immigration the political we can expect massive economic dislocation the financial markets will now be calculating the price of uncertainty in global trade flows as they contemplate promises to impose huge tariffs on restrict international investment by us and force an epic diplomatic breach with over his beloved victory ushers in the most tumultuous period of history since the great depression and the start of world war two it will challenge the core concepts of identity and global security as we have known them for has moved from perennial rival to trusted while future is in peril allies can now expect to pay for their security as the us military effectively turns into a mercenary force many countries may find cheaper options and break with the us assurances of the delicate balance of power and deterrence may well shift decisively in the middle east and far east we can expect a rush to nuclear proliferation as quickly as one major country or japan decides to move ahead with an independent nuclear this kind of independence is a good thing for anyone who grew up during the cold the threat of nuclear annihilation is a distant memory of what was once an ever present nightmare for those born as the cold war came to an the fear of global destruction will be a new and the political establishment in needs to figure out quickly how to respond to this revolution republican leaders who shunned trump will now stampede to his but they are unlikely to be forgiven by a man who harbors long and deep grudges democrats will be tempted to indulge in politics that reflect his populist attacks on foreign diverse communities and personal reactions will be monumental mistakes the trump administration needs to be challenged at every turn if congress is to maintain its independence as a check and balance on executive trump is moving to the white and liberals put him there frank read need to hold true to their principles of inclusion and diversity as an alternative to a presidency that will dominate the public discourse with need to decide if their future lies with the white voters who handed power to or the diverse voters who inexplicably failed to turn out to decide their own future those older voters have shaped the but the younger voters will surely shape the rarely end where they begin they unleash forces that have been hidden or ignored for and perhaps decades they tear apart families and civil society and private commerce in a huge and complex this revolution may have unequal leading to open conflict in some areas and little more than a shoulder shrug in over the trump revolution will be felt in every as the tax base is decimated by a and the deficit balloons out of control there is no escape from an economic policy that will bankrupt the largest in the hands of a businessman with plenty of experience of no no intellectual curiosity and a vengeful the trump white house will make the years seem like the paragon of virtue they never years as the first newspapers landed in the early hours of the the new times proclaimed that was elected the president of the united words seemed so stunningly after so many years of terrorism and wars voters had just elected the first president and his name still sounded like an unelectable of two of greatest enemies of the bush has managed to conjure up a combination of words that is even more elections
models are the statistician box once said this year was no exception on a model built by j campaign gave him an percent chance of has reported at that point in the the model gave him the same chances by election his odds were but trump was still not favored to win near the end of the a model built by the republican national committee showed him losing over all and in states like and according to politico won each of those so did trump simply beat the or were the odds wrong all one of the reasons assessing models is so tricky is that difficult to know for sure only over the long run that a model can be judged to be well calibrated what we can is check to see how fragile our model was to different assumptions what we said on the last day of the based on we said had about an percent chance of winning and trump or slightly less than a shot the final result of far from what we thought was the single most likely and our live forecast was quick to adjust as votes began coming in but final electoral count most likely to once the race in has been called is well within the range of what we said was plausible the chart below shows which outcomes we thought were most likely were we too at various points during the the editor of called the model to react to new polls we preferred analysis suggested that very few voters changed their minds and that the impact of most campaign events was small given the amount of uncertainty in the a model should not overreact to a single poll released three months before election day but in her blamed letters from the b delivered to congress and two days before election day and campaign models moved sharply in the last few as did our own so what if we had used only the final days of would we have given trump higher we would but not by much if we had used only the final days of we would have given about an percent chance of only slightly lower than what we actually said and still far above percent even shorter windows give similar results no window of polls that would have pushed trump to be the favorite what if we had assumed and would all shift in addition to whether older polls are one of the biggest differences between models involved the question of how much the states move together does a polling miss in one state tell you much about a polling miss in other the technical word for this is correlation if the states are more the possible distribution of outcomes gets wider if the states move the distribution gets narrower our model kept this parameter at a middle the states were neither perfectly correlated nor perfectly independent even at its most making the states move together more flattens the distribution and makes a win from trump more but at best he would have been just a percent favorite what if fit our model somehow knowing the results of it probably would not have changed much the state polls missed by larger margins in than they had in recent but the results completely unexpected it feels like an even larger miss because the polls missed by enough in enough swing states to give the election to the trailing candidate via the electoral college national polling performed better than a lot of people is increasing her lead in the popular vote by the day it may take months for analysts to determine why state polls were far off in the and northeast modern polling faces including the decreasing use of landlines and the increasing difficulty in finding people willing to but we can expect the polling industry to work to adapt what would we do what would we think next time about a state like dozens of polls showed with a most above four points none showed trump ahead in our polling database of presidential polls since we found examples in which a candidate led in every poll of a state conducted in the final days of the including where the margin was within points states with only one the trailing candidate won in only two cases three if you count others were north in and south in in each every poll showed the democrat and the republican candidate won the even among races won by less than a win rate of percent about the same as the percent chance we gave in models are box some are was the upshot forecast we think a quantitative forecast can help people to take a step back from obsessing over the latest daily poll release by averaging polls together and arriving at a probabilistic the aim is to help people take a more nuanced view of the one that is less driven by whatever the latest polling number happens to and instead summarizes all of the available with the context of history but we humans are bad at understanding uncertainty reactions to victory suggest despite our we failed at explaining that an percent chance is not a percent chance if we did it all we would probably emphasize uncertainty in a more visceral rather than using a simple statement of an analogy to a event like an field goal or a shaded margin of error by more effectively communicating the uncertainty in the hope to give our readers a more useful indicator of the state of the race one that is built on data rather than anecdote and conjecture
last week the new of all ran an opinion piece in of hereditary monarchy under the consider a argued unlike elected heads of monarchies offer continuity and a focus for national togetherness quoting the historian advantage of monarchy is that the institution the hopes of by rising above the toxic partisanship of competing parties and vying elected as thousands march on trump tower chanting my you can rather see his the crown on as a distraction from the nightmare of the a similar thought struck that there may be considerable advantage in having something beyond the ballot box to appeal something transcendent around which to when the immanent is so hopelessly fraught and i reference the transcendent advisedly as the depiction of coronation makes perfectly the coronation is a theological transaction the queen was anointed in an abbey and not appointed in a government building and anointing has been the manner of conferring divine office at least since the priest and the prophet anointed king in ancient in other we just live in a constitutional monarchy in the united we live in a constitutional theocracy get me i want our monarchy to have zero executive authority but the idea of retaining something like the crown around which to something that stands apart from democratic has rarely seemed so compelling citizenship and immigration website crashed within hours of victory time for us to move to new suggested us supreme court justice only and the new immigration website has experienced an increase of traffic from the us not that thousands of good republicans have finally decided to return to the royal bosom but no coincidence that these places have the queen as their head of the still small voice of calm at the of the many and new want a foreign queen as their head of state either but it is a testament to the political value of monarchy that even in such proudly independent countries they have still found it impossible to dream up a more acceptable alternative and in both places progressive politics flourishes similarly in the idea of an elected head of state has been frequently scotched with just two president who directed the is no fawning courtier and his politics are clearly on the left he and i both worked in the now destroyed camp in he with a that he helped to i with st which the have now bulldozed we had a discussion once that they performed similar roles both being places to come together when produced the opening ceremony of the he was again telling a compelling story about our national togetherness and the same thing again with the own church for is as diverse as it in in social in ethnicity outside of they probably have very little in common not not the food they not their choice of entertainment but they will sing god save the queen with and none more so than those who have emigrated from former commonwealth countries where the queen represents a fixed point of national solidarity when she is prayed for on it is with a sense of genuine affection that could never perhaps should never be directed towards an elected official and before you say the royals represent no threat to progressive reform indeed arguable that without steady presence introduction of radical ideas like the and the welfare would have been hugely more difficult to an age where the money god has now become incarnate in the person of this man we should thank our lucky stars that our head of state worships at a very different elections
come you can admit it i admit it i admit that after election i secretly hoped and even though that his rhetoric was worse than its bite he only said those crazy things during the campaign to get elected he really follow through on his plans to completely gut the us commitment to keeping the earth habitable oh how naive we were plan to fill positions in his administration shows things are worse than we could have ever to recent trump has picked climate denier and spokesperson for the fossil fuel industry to head the environmental protection agency transition this basically means the will either cease to function or cease to exist it also appears that the us will pull out of any agreements to limit greenhouse emissions it means we have missed our last on the road to catastrophic climate change that may sound but i study the rate that climate change is happening the amount of heat accumulating in the system we have any time to waste in implementing aggressive and trump will result in a decade of time who is he is a director at the competitive enterprise institute and chair of the cooler heads coalition where did he get his in nowhere in he a scientist at but he does have a degree in economics there any conflict that competitive enterprise institute is funded by companies such as and groups such as the charitable surely is not new to obstructing action on climate change years it was reported that he favored editing reports on climate change it just trump has other some of who represent fossil fuel working on the this selection also tells us about trump is that he is surrounding himself with people who are not knowledgeable in a topic and will not effectively educate him not that educating trump was ever possible but there was always the outside chance he would take his streak to a new level and be to the we now see that is not going to happen if trump listens to it will be people who think like he does and represent special interests who would be most affected by his policies we have a fox guarding the hen know trump but i have a wager for him i could randomly pull an earth name out of a hat and any name i pulled would be better than i challenge trump and his administration to actually include real scientists in forming legislation and action on environmental issues and i am not talking about scientists that are connected to groups i am talking about independent unaffiliated scientists just go down to the neighborhood pick anyone they will be better than what you have now or trump could attend the largest geophysics which occurs in just a few weeks geophysical union fall he could walk around with a camera and a clipboard ask any random scientists any question on climate change see how their answers compare to the information he is going to get from his handpicked insiders put it on trump likes someday trump will realize that he actually could be the savior of the earth could you imagine the power of a republican president getting the republican party to find solutions to climate it would fit a megalomania frame it would be powerful and inspiring the chances it will happen are about as good as the chance we can avoid our targeted temperature rise not if you surround yourselves with foxes as you go in to raid the hen the risk of losing objectiveness but keeping we are change consensus the

n a retired marine corps will meet the at new jersey country club on to discuss the post of defense according to two people close to the transition team conservatives this spring had wooed general to run for president as an independent as they sought an alternative to trump while he was receptive to the he ultimately decided against running thoughtfulness and patriotism and for that the modesty showed as he reflected on this decision make me more convinced than ever that he would have made a truly admirable and also a good the editor of the conservative weekly wrote at the time general is widely respected in the military community and could bring with him a staff of civilian experts he was the head of the united states central which oversees all military operations in the middle from to but crossed swords with president over his push for a more aggressive presence in the gulf under federal a former military official must be out of uniform for seven years to become defense

still in the hunt k newly appointed chief has maintained a low profile since the but in an interview in the reporter on he pushed back against accusations that intended to divide the country along racial even as he embraced his dark image on the one he not a white a nationalist an economic on the other association with has been widely criticized because of racist conspiracy theories promoted on

leader of the committee tasked with protecting incumbent colleagues and maybe winning a seat or two in senator chuck the incoming minority announced on that van would serve as chairman of the democratic senatorial campaign committee for the cycle van was our first choice for chairman because of his his work ethic and his said in a statement map is tough for but i have no doubt that van is up to the tough democrats gained a mere two senate seats on election day new and and will be defending a daunting seats in as well as two held by independents who caucus with them king of and sanders of and roughly half of those states were won by trump in democrats have one real senator dean heller of and maybe two with flake of if things go south for the new president van knows the highs and

will argues passionately and convincingly that free trade makes for greater wealth creation and protectionism will cause growth to slow down is the lifeblood of obviously the move towards increasing global trade has created especially in and we should be glad that it has raised millions of people out of he acknowledge the problem of distributing the wealth thus created the world is awash with money but it has been very unequally distributed possession of so much money by people and institutions who possibly use it has created serious need to reform institutions in ways that prevent the unhealthy accumulation of wealth by minorities we will see more catastrophes such as as the rich cast around for risky ways to use their wealth and more and more and trump votes as resentful populations seek to find somebody to blame for their diminished share of prosperity proposed one simple the robin hood tax is as is international against tax havens and tax avoidance so the political will to do any of these things is not strong and our government is sturdily in the i would not argue with will assertion that trade is the lifeblood of or that automation and will not be prevented by he fails to present a rational alternative put where are the jobs coming from to pay the living expenses of that section of the population that depends on the misconception made by the proponents of has been that the discarded can be disregarded taking away a before you take away his is every bit as dangerous as taking away both at the same agreements might well have benefited but the notion that more trade agreements will somehow benefit those already by previous is a horse without a jockey it is the failure of and of the of global trade that funded trade which caused the tariffs might have been enacted in but the consequences hit the fan in trump is a willing harbinger of coming rational people would disagree with will assertion that between countries brings prosperity and there a huge difference between unfettered free trade and fair would be wrong for or the us to impose blanket trade tariffs that inhibit innovation in other countries or for us to protect our industries from competition with more efficient foreign cannot be allowed to get away with suggesting has created and for all in most free trade has simply involved a race to the bottom in pay rates across the world that may be free but it certainly fair trade a tiny proportion of the population have got ludicrously while former manufacturing communities have declined into despair we have sacrificed manufacturing jobs for cheap jeans and washing made by people earning pittances with which we cannot fairly racism and misogyny are appalling on the single issue of free he is basically correct what people on the left and should be asking how did two deeply privileged mavericks on either side of the become the ones to benefit from the support for measured trade tariffs that promote genuine while protecting jobs from unfair would be a if belated big income

for his second john a journalist with extensive experience in has taken a microscope to an enormous the relationship between the united states and from to the present with growing stress points in that relationship and the emergence of strongman leaders in both the beautiful country and the middle arrives during a precarious inflection point it is peppered with characters that uses to trace a long historical from a to a prominent and henry m the former united states treasury secretary is scheduled to speak about his book on at the politics and prose bookstore in in an he discussed the history of interactions between the united states and president xi and what china policy might emerge from the trump administration what has been the overarching paradigm of united relations from the century to and have been enchanting each other and disappointing each other since they first met in when the first ship landed in with a cargo of ginseng and silver to trade for tea if a pattern to the it has been rapturous enchantment followed by despair right are in the disenchantment phase of the as are the you tell many colorful anecdotes of and in contact with each other which one do you think best reflects the wider one of the main goals of the book was to bring to light stories of unchronicled influence on both sides the first minister to the court in was a young republican named was a radical abolitionist who was dispatched to by the administration believed that the west needed to give china time to develop and modernize and stop pressuring china to change he believed that the west had no right to for the way china treated and he argued that western officials should tolerate the habit of maintaining that their emperor actually ruled the entire world to encapsulates one side of the view of one that reappeared in the and lasted up through the beginning of the administration the or rather the bet that china would liberalize and become more like us as long as we facilitated its rise in opposition to other believed his views on china as one of his successors in put a that also has formed a key part of the perspective on china your book discusses the way governments in the two nations have interacted with each but you also go into detail on the roles that notable nonpolitical figures have played to what extent does the united relationship depend on the attitudes of each leaders versus those of other whether they are from the elite classes or the grass in many we and the and our elites and those from the grass are captives of our past in the beginning of the individual and created the relationship and imbued it with much of its meaning merchants and missionaries saw china as a vast market for stuff and for souls saw as a place that could save china from the depredations of other imperialist nations with its educational as a model for china to emulate at the same other groups of feared the starting in the late oppressed workers in starting a long history of fearing the industriousness of the had their own prejudices against and ideas as viewing them as sexually deviant and dangerous many of these dreams and fantasies and biases we have about each other have resurfaced in subsequent decades in claim that china has been the united states when it comes to one can hear the populists of the party in late railing on the streets of against heathen in your many years as a journalist in what were the most notable changes you saw in the united with is less willing to bend to will than before and more willing to aggressively pursue its whether they involve trade or the south china sea spent decades arguing that as china strengthened it would become more like a liberal western nation it turned out that and as such the has stopped doing china any favors much more than it is blocking the sales of western companies to firms and strengthening its alliances with nations around periphery the careful balance of containment and engagement that defined policy toward china is now heavily skewed toward containment what are your thoughts on president xi and how the united states fits into xi has said he wants to rule which i think can be translated into a desire to see china rule in this the is an interloper and would do best to retreat to and let china handle the western pacific china benefited greatly from the in the but now xi feels that china does not need the to protect it anymore it wants the out of not next not the year but one day soon with the election of trump as the next united states where do you see the relationship trump is not an when it comes to his views on china they are but so were and those of many of his predecessors during the trump seesawed between accusing china of the united states on threatening to walk away from alliances in east and thereby ceding the western pacific to and mulling the idea of some type of with china where the would accept rise if china did not endanger the status quo in trump will enter office against a backdrop of an facing a dictator in north and a china eager to capitalize on missteps how he juggles and his own competing mix of disappointment and realism about china will help determine the future of the relationship and the future of the globe if i had to i think he is going to be more pragmatic than many initially but prognostication is a tough especially when it comes to china and trump
prime minister of japan is planning to sit down with j trump in new on in what would be the first meeting with a foreign leader since his election wants to find out how serious trump was during his campaign when he repeatedly criticized japan on trade issues and for not paying more of the cost of its own defense and since the establishment was expecting to win the wants to assure trump that he is willing and eager to work with him the prime minister is concerned about commitment to protecting japan the united states is most important and is legally obligated to defend it against attack there are around troops stationed in a powerful deterrent against the rising threat of north and an increasingly assertive china during the trump suggested he might withdraw troops not without resistance from members of officials at the state diplomats and military advisers the united alliance has been in place since the end of world war and has a lot of backing on both sides of the pacific ocean maybe there are signs that japan might be willing to pay or do but many experts contend troops are not only defending japan but the united own interests in the pentagon is budgeted to spend about billion to support troops and bases on and elsewhere around japan this year japan is set to spend billion to support the in addition to at least billion on related including compensation for the communities that host the bases and funds for relocating troops under its which was written by occupying forces after world war japan can keep an army for defensive purposes but has said he wants to revise the constitution and expand the military in his government requested the latest in a series of increases in military spending japan has committed to the nuclear nonproliferation and will probably remind trump of that on the campaign trump decried the cost of providing a nuclear umbrella to allies such as japan and south that do not have their own nuclear arms in trump told the new times that he was open to those countries building their own nuclear but on twitter this week he denied having said so has reaffirmed his commitment not to develop atomic weapons any move to do so would face severe public opposition in the only country that has suffered a nuclear attack he has been one of the biggest enthusiasts for the partnership or as it is known though japan was the last of a dozen pacific rim countries to join the sweeping trade pact trump repeatedly criticized the during the presidential campaign made politically painful concessions on agricultural imports to close the deal and get manufacturers access to export markets in the united states and elsewhere the trade partnership could bolster the limp economic growth rate in his country and serve as a counterweight to the superpower acknowledged after victory that the partnership was in a difficult but his government still plans to have parliament ratify the and he has not given up on selling it to trump may also seek to soften angry campaign in which he accused japan of crushing the united states on and manipulating its currency to gain an economic advantage trump says for free trade in but wants a for the united states what that for remains a mystery
so just when we thought that get any more it with a trump victory i told you last week that strange happenings were afoot in the what with the cubs winning the world series and all i hear that new yorkers are taking it pretty hard are people stocking up on canned greetings from the land of duck and not sure quite sunk in but foods and subterranean real estate are in demand and sounds like a hunting club so where shall we a little weary of the conversations get right to what do you think will happen trump will set up an administration the sun will rise in the east my dog will chase squirrels the world will go on glad to hear taking it well he stayed cautiously neutral in the but a very good boy i think you once made the point to me that there are no permanent victories or defeats in politics so perhaps a good place to start a conversation about the future been since i came to at the collective failure to understand that point it is patently true upon the most cursory inspection of recent history in democrats were popping champagne over the dawn of a permanent era of progressive politics now they see most of their dreams being unraveled and republicans celebrating today will sooner or later be miserable i made a things are looking better already both winners and losers who ignore this reality make silly unforced errors the losers err on the side of excessive like the classic threats to leave the country reader email has informed me way harder to leave the country than one might think we in all that much demand and the winners fail when they convince themselves that since victory is they can set an agenda that attracts no one from the other side looking at a president trump and a house and say we are in for a stretch of dumb things presidents generally get most of their big changes done in the first year or two president did that with health care his agenda was nothing compared to w who did everything from tax cuts to getting authorization for the invasion but was certainly a big lift it was also a central campaign promise i know you think it was a bad idea i think that strategy is enormously shortsighted i remember thinking when the democrats held the white house and both houses of congress in though they have it might be wise to give a little to bring some centrist republicans into some day the republicans might be in a position to reverse everything if they have zero political investment in and sure here we are my point is that of course a president should have a vision that matches his ideology why he got elected but i think it is impractical and imprudent to forgive me for another reference to is spinal turn it up to give on a few things where you have because someday going to need friends to protect the stuff you care about most the trump administration might learn from the outgoing horror at seeing some or all of repealed we part company here my perception of was of a democratic party willing to work on compromise legislation while the republicans just stalled there was no unified republican just a ton of people who wanted to be but kept changing their mind but the bottom line is that left behind the old congress now got guys who sleep in their offices and even talk to the other side at the house gym secretly a lot of them are actually but i take your point and another recommendation i would make to president make friends everyplace that was the magic golf with the same people every week since i have no prepared to look on the bright side for a while the republican hatred of is so great that even if had gotten elected it would have been really hard to get the necessary fixes through congress trump has promised and as of his interview something better that preserves the most popular parts of the program so see what he comes up with i know a big fan his agenda and agenda really do congress is set to have a big influence on the agenda over the next and and trump will figure out how to make their ideas jibe plan includes a health care replacement plan for it will actually do some of the things liberals really like getting more people covered i realize that very disappointing for progressives to see but not like it will be replaced by nothing this is one area where the product usually resemble the recipe i remember presidential candidate saying all health care negotiations could take place in on grab your crystal ball and give me a couple of other predictions seeing a big tax cut and huge spending on infrastructure repair followed by a stupendous rise in the national debt certainly true that neither party has been great at getting the deficit under control in my lifetime nobody calls his or her congressman and just do sit only one side adds to the deficit while simultaneously complaining too big but move on obviously cranky how any other how about the early the republican establishment seems to have as white house chief of staff but is going to be chief strategist which could mean anything to me is the kind of guy democrats should learn to live with they and going to be a republican white house but is a very bad dude who represents all the worst strands of racism and misogyny in the trump crowd who do you think will really have the it looks like both will be influential after watching the i find pair of appointments too surprising they signal that in as during his trump will seek to merge traditional republican politics with his unconventional
somehow trump manages to dumb down everything somehow he manages to lower the bar to the point where he can play by a different set of rules and somehow the media and elected officials just shrug their shoulders and walk his own the is negotiating business deals at a time when his predecessors you filling cabinet positions and transitioning to power he met with his business partners and the trump organization signed a deal last trump tweeted earlier this to the election it was well known that i have interests in properties all over the world only the crooked media makes this a big explained this in more if not entirely in his interview with the new built a very great company and a big company and all over the world people are starting to when they look at all these different like in and other number a job like that builds great relationships with the people of so all all is indeed approach to mixing his business and political affairs law is totally on my he the president have a conflict of be profiting from the presidency would not be a quaint conflict of is not about whether trump favors one country or president over gives a contract to one company or or spends more time making money for himself than he does boning up about policy there are laws on the books about us businesses influencing foreign officials with payments or other inducements the law is called the foreign corrupt practices act and its goal is to stamp out bribery by any us is what the law calls favors and payments given to foreign officials in exchange for business deals not a conflict of and favors going the other way into the pockets of the president are so clearly corrupt that they were forbidden by the founding fathers in the constitution the emoluments clause prohibits gifts and titles from foreign powers as person holding any office of profit or trust under without the consent of the accept of any or of any kind from any or foreign this clause that leads to exceptional red tape around any and all gifts received by the white house and every other from a homemade quilt to a watch everything is declared and surrendered officials can only keep the gifts up to a value of if they repay the us process will be hard within the world of international real where foreign powers can grant gifts ranging from planning permits to investments from sovereign wealth funds the list is almost we know if trump discussed his investment with president of but we do know that his daughter now running the family business was on the call we know if there was any suggestion that president could expect any benefits for himself or his country spokespeople for president and trump have denied reports about the mixing of trump business and politics on the we do know that the project is now moving news that emerged just three days after the call between and trump for a president who has refused to release his tax the need for transparency is not exactly any the fact that even having this discussion tells you something profound about the trump presidency before it officially begins promise to his voters was that he was incorruptible because he was so independently wealthy that nobody could touch him he knew how to drain the swamp because he had lived in it for so buying off begging politicians for so many years that it made him argument was always a but clearly many voters bought into his pitch just two weeks since the obvious that trump has no interest in separating his personal wealth from his political agenda the damage caused is not confined to public confidence in the united states government being leader of the free world is not a casual concept that cold war phrase encapsulates the notion that the united states is a beacon of freedom and democracy for the world as his own transition came to an best summed up the notion in his final address in in have been guided by the standard john set before his shipmates on the flagship years as faced the task of building a new government on a perilous frontier must always he we shall be as a city upon a hill the eyes of all people are upon eyes of the world are on the trump transition right now they see a who lost the popular vote by more than million votes and almost percentage is a difficult notion of democracy to explain to a world struggling against authoritarian regimes where votes are routinely ignored and discounted the work of democracy promotion by the national endowment for established by is immeasurably harder as a result of the work of spreading government has become just as hard as a result of business dealings if a sitting president can enrich himself while in then why a president of a developing country set up his own businesses to do the why should they not do after as trump told the theory i could run my business and then run the country corruption the seeking of personal profit by government officials derived from their roles is a plague that condemns the most vulnerable people in the world to poor or public services if the us talk credibly about the need to stamp out conflict of the world will struggle to eradicate corruption and improve life for the poorest people on the needs to lead by example and that starts with the president not a conflict of interest the national

acres of federal public from the deep seas east of to the volcanic coasts of a new said who ran the interior department under president bill in western where about half of all land is controlled by federal supporters hope the pendulum swings back from what they say are overbearing administration regulations that put sage grouse and owls ahead of economic growth environmental groups are urging president to push through preservation such as naming a new national monument in the bears ears area of southern and they are already preparing for battles over campaign promise to oil and gas production much of it on public land but the unknowns and political variables are too trump while promising to push resource has also at times spoken about preserving public lands for future generations history also suggests that changing lands policy is not so easy president w a tried to change direction with new agency only to be blocked by federal appeals court decisions automation in the timber industry means that even an expanded license to cut trees in the national forests might not restore old mill towns to their glory and the cost of managing federal especially in fighting wildfires billion last a record matched by the most acres burned in at least years continues to threatening communities even as many of them look for new direction from the white house in how those lands are managed have a huge and growing inventory of timber in the and going to decompose or and nobody has addressed said h a professor in the school of public policy at the university of and a former economic analyst for the interior bipartisan consensus that the federal lands system is he said but the and the about how that system might now change are boundless big hope is that people would be able to go back to work in county and these rural said a county commissioner in southern where feelings run as deep as the slot canyons just feel like everything has been stifled with at the western watersheds a conservation group focusing on the rocky mountain legal teams are on deck and ready to fight back getting ready for an onslaught of and arming up to said the executive director trump administration is going to find it very difficult to take away all of the federal laws which have been adopted over the past in the struggle for control of public the years were a flush time for conservation groups the administration imposed moratoriums on uranium drilling near the grand canyon and blocked new coal leases public lands were also adapted for new uses on notably a wave of national monuments based around cultural or historical and a big expansion of solar energy on federal lands in conservatives who loathed those regulations or new uses are now hoping trump shifts the balance decisively in their favor republicans in congress have proposed bills weakening federal laws that protect water endangered species or that allow presidents to unilaterally name new national monuments some conservatives hope trump will support their efforts to hand federal land over to which could sell it off or speed up drilling approvals to see where change may come the look to the edges of glacier national park in at a quilt of rocky peaks and wetlands held sacred by the tribe in the administration capped a fight over oil and gas drilling in the called the by canceling a energy lease on acres the sued a lawyer for the of the mountain states legal said the incoming trump administration could simply decide that canceling the lease had been wrong it would he for the justice department to enter the case and we will lift the suspension and permit the drilling to go this the interior department announced that a separate energy company with oil and gas leases on acres in the same area had voluntarily canceled them tribal leaders called it a victory for cooperation among conservation activists and the government proponents of two major oil pipeline projects are also optimistic trump has said he would move quickly to approve the keystone which blocked the chief executive of the company building the access pipeline near the standing rock reservation in north said he believed that project would sail through under trump to see where things get more head into the damp woods of the cascade range in central and the peninsula of where a long economic decline began

have a clear and easy path to go back to the good old days when natural resource extraction was driving our said the executive director of a conservation group is not as easy as just logging he said logging industry officials said that employment could but that changes at the federal level would have to be profound to make a difference the first they would be to increase the budgets of federal land agencies like the forest service and the bureau of land something that conservative congressional representatives many of them bent on budget cuts might not want to hear going to cost us but in the long term it will save us money because we face a federal forest with millions of acres that are and said the president of the forest resource which represents wood product companies from the northern rockies to have got to educate congress and inform them that

j trump said on that he had no intention of pressing for an investigation into use of a private email server or the financial operations of her dropping the her pledge that became a rallying cry for his campaign for the white house who branded his rival and said she would go to jail if he were said in an interview with reporters and editors at the new times that he was no longer interested in pursuing in part because he wanted to heal the wounds of a divisive campaign want to hurt the i really trump said during the interview went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different and i am not looking to hurt them at all the campaign was his reversal on prosecuting was particularly striking given the outsize role the issue played during the presidential in which her use of a private email server as secretary of state became a prominent and one she has blamed for her loss to trump trump said he wanted to from the subject without he said that have people that do perhaps a reference to the or republicans who might continue to press for prosecutions in the email or foundation cases but the made clear that he would not seek to pursue an investigation himself nor make it a priority after he assumes office the decision angered some of his most fervent who immediately criticized his seeming change of heart blared the headline on a conservative news site that has strongly backed trump not something that i feel very strongly trump said at the unlike health care or immigration has been a very painful period of aides did not respond to a request for comment about remarks during their second trump turned to and i i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your because never been so many so much after turnaround on the conservative commentator one of his staunchest supporters during the suggested on twitter that trump was overstepping his role i thought we elected she wrote we make him the his job is to pick those not do their tom president of judicial a conservative advocacy group that has been a relentless critic of said on that it would be a mistake for trump to drop the threat of appointing a special counsel to look into her email use said that although the had already investigated the matter that inquiry was flawed his group has gained access to thousands of pages of state department emails through lawsuits and is pressing its case in court even after her defeat representative a republican who leads the house oversight and government reform said last week on fox news that his committee would continue to investigate the matter as well because got to get to the office said on he was unavailable for comment about statements although the email investigation is the agency still has an open inquiry into the foundation that inquiry began after the publication of a book by peter that asserted that some foreign entities had given money to the foundation in return for state department favors when was there the have denied the assertions the and justice department conduct their criminal investigations largely independently from the white so trump cannot tell agents to close their cases a president ordering the to stop a politically sensitive case would be a major scandal does seem like an extraordinary breach of protocol for him to get involved in that glen a a former federal prosecutor in new said of the know of no recent circumstances when the president ordered an attorney general not to pursue a criminal as trump were to order the b to close the foundation could choose to rebuff him directors are given terms to insulate them from political but the president still has the power to fire a as president bill did with s sessions in after a justice department investigation uncovered ethical abuses by sessions in an interview last week with trump said he had not yet decided whether to dismiss over his handling of the email saying the director have had very good reasons for doing what he as a practical remarks will probably have little impact the investigation into emails is already closed while the one into her foundation remains senior officials and career justice department officials have said there is little evidence justifying moving forward with a case when the case comes up for senior agents and prosecutors may decide to shut it but it will not be because of remarks while the decision is likely to frustrate investigators at the who are fiercely protective of their independence to follow the facts they some legal experts applauded decision to not pursue investigations into emails or her family foundation k a professor at the university of hastings college of the said he was inclined to support both moves by trump a decision to shut down an he not out of step with constitutional as the constitution gives the president the power to issue pardons for federal crimes
presidential elections do not just determine the fate of the next four years in the united states they shape the fate of the rest of the and the world pays close means you need a special perspective to do justice to the remarkable spectacle of a presidential cycle you need the reporters to cover multiple working on the shortened news cycles of social media you need the specialist writers to dig into both the domestic and international you need the columnists to make sense of it all for readers at home who are about to and for those overseas who sorely wish they columnists are as diverse and spirited as our readers we have traveled with all the immersed ourselves in the and been trolled by all sides i do read the comments and mean the political coverage in the there is so much information at our disposal but so little understanding to separate the signal from the noise requires experience and the kind of context you can only get from being expensive to cover us elections the country is the candidates are and the news never stops but it would be far costlier for us all if our voice were can we understand where the democratic party is heading after what animates and motivates can we make sense of trump when he can barely make sense of his own your we can answer those questions along the you might just understand and appreciate this carnival of an election a little no livelier debate than the one going on between the writers and readers we always but we will all be smarter for the that conversation today by making a contribution or becoming a

as the technology industry came to grips in the last week with the reality of a presidential election that did not go its many in silicon valley landed on the idea that widespread misinformation spread was a primary factor in the outcome on both and altered their advertising policies to explicitly prohibit sites that traffic in fake news from making money off lies very likely a worthwhile even if it comes too late the has loosened our collective grasp on the and efforts to fight that dismaying trend are obviously worth pursuing yet it would be a mistake to end this investigation at fake news in the dangers posed by fake news are just a symptom of a deeper truth now dawning on the with billions of people glued to and other popular social media has become an increasingly powerful cultural and political to the point that its effects are now beginning to alter the course of global events the election of j trump is perhaps the starkest illustration yet that across the social networks are helping to fundamentally rewire human society they have subsumed and gutted mainstream media they have undone traditional political advantages like and access to advertising and they are destabilizing and replacing institutions and established ways of doing including political transnational organizations and unspoken social prohibitions against blatant expressions of racism and xenophobia most because these services allow people to communicate with one another more they are helping to create surprisingly influential social organizations among groups these ad hoc social movements range widely in from white supremacists in the united states to in to in the middle east to the hacker collectives of eastern and but each in its own way is now wielding previously unthinkable resulting in sometimes destabilizing geopolitical spasms now have billions of people on the and most of them are not that happy with the status said the president of the a research firm that forecasts global risks think their local government is authoritarian they think on the wrong side of the establishment aggrieved by identity politics and a middle many factors accounted for economic anxiety in the industrial an inchoate desire for some kind of change in the national and some mix of latent xenophobia and sexism across the electorate but as even trump acknowledged in an interview with aired social media played a determining role in the race in the the concerns of supporters might have been and his candidacy would almost certainly have foundered after he was universally written off by just about every mainstream and he faced disadvantages in organization and access to traditional political expertise yet by putting out a message that resonated with people trump hacked through every established political order this new people are now empowered to express their grievances and to follow people they see as echoing their said it for social i see trump for people who like an predictable this is the scariest thing about not that it may be full of lies problem that could potentially be but that its scope gives it real power to change history in unpredictable ways but where we are time to start recognizing that social networks actually are becoming the forces that their boosters long promised they would be and to be rather than by the huge social changes they could uncork this should come as no surprise in a we are now living through a kind of version of the utopia that some in tech once envisioned would be unleashed by social media over much of the last we have seen progressive social movements powered by the web spring up across the world there was the green revolution in and the spring in the middle east and north in the united we saw the occupy wall street movement and the protests social networks also played a role in electoral politics first in the ultimately unsuccessful candidacy of dean in and then in the election of the first president in yet now those movements look like the prelude to a crackup in the global order in this organizing on played a major role in the push to get the country to leave the union in the a firebrand mayor who was vastly outspent by managed to marshal a huge army of supporters to help him win the presidency the state has used social networks to recruit from around the world to fight in and as well as to inspire terrorist attacks overseas and in the united both a socialist who ran for president as a and who was once reviled by most members of the party he now relied on movements to shatter the political status quo why is this all happening clay a professor at new university who has studied the effects of social suggested a few reasons one is the ubiquity of which has reached a truly epic scale last month the company reported that about billion people now log on to the service every month because social networks feed off the various permutations of interactions among they become strikingly more powerful as they grow with about a quarter of the population now on the possibilities are staggering the technology gets when the crazy social effects get said one of those social effects is what calls the of the a term coined by the researcher p to describe the range of subjects that the mainstream media deems publicly acceptable to discuss from about the early until the very recent it was usually considered unwise for politicians to court views deemed by most of society to be out of the things like overt calls to racial bias were of like the but the shifted that window was kept at bay because of pluralistic said person who was sitting in their basement yelling at the about immigrants or was willing to say white were more than other kinds of they know how many others shared their thanks to the now each person with views can

it is with civility and equanimity that the welcomed the trumps to the white house a smooth transition of where victors are magnanimous in victory and the defeated graciously are the hallmarks of a politics the office of the president of the united states in some ways resembles an elective kingship in a democratic which explains perhaps why it is afforded such a reverence in society it is a good thing that the spirit of shared commitment to the ideals of has led to an outbreak of mutual respect between political who had traded lower and lower blows in the final days of a vicious campaign actions are important president welcomed a man who spent years questioning his birthplace trump accepted an invitation from a man who had declared him unfit for the presidency trump was wise to say he would accept counsel from the current who he described as a good man in setting aside politics gains words carry weight trump cast political opponents as criminals and accused them of treason he threatened to investigate his rivals and sue his female accusers who claimed he had sexually assaulted them as president he finds himself facing a slew of civil law suits he wore his grudges and resentments like badges of one wonders how such a figure will administer neutrally and fairly perhaps he might be tempted not to this would be a grave a nation trump campaigned in mendacity he now needs to govern in work on dictatorships run on fear in a democracy citizens accept the disappointment of defeat because they believe that their rights will be protected in a disinterested and impartial way voters know that they can make mistakes but there is always another chance to engage again in a fair fight for hearts and minds limit this and legitimacy drains away there have been signs of such dissatisfaction in recent decades popular discontent coupled with a deep mistrust of government marched with falling voting turnout and declining party loyalties the state and citizen were prised and a deficit in democracy yawned open bucked this trend like trump he too was an outsider who toppled a party establishment and beat to the presidency unlike trump he campaigned as a uniter not a divider of people his appeal was he would attempt to reach out to his opponents in the end he did not succeed and he left imperfect trump would do well to pick up where left off there is an urgent need in the united states for politicians to the middle ground of common sense this means not resorting to the that turned paranoia into a presidential campaign trump exhorted voters to the read the yet the fake news industry he gave rise to a segregation that and damaged society refashioning social and economic relations to preserve liberty and justice will rely on facts that a country can agree ideological approach of republicans determined to win at all costs must be the stoking of white anger should be consigned to history a nation divided needs to be brought elections

senator sanders of vowed on to hold j trump accountable for the promises he made to the middle class while also insisting that the rescind his appointment of k as his chief white house strategist speaking at university and for a video viewed by urged democrats still reeling from the losses of last week to push forward by embracing the progressive ideals that fueled the bid for the white house in doing he chastised liberals for not talking enough to the working class he said that while he disagreed with trump on many he hoped to work with him to address income increase inadequate wages and negotiate new trade deals personally believe we need major reforms of the democratic sanders explaining that campaign message resonated with millions of people the end of the he was actually using the term that many democrats and he was saying he was going to be the champion of the working class what he said we have a list of everything that you and we are going to hold you to sanders also pointedly criticized trump for giving a critically important job to the former head of news who many fear will bring nationalist and racist views to the west wing the senator said democrats not be involved in the expansion of call upon trump to rescind the appointment that he made of said making a demand that is unlikely to be met president of the united states should not have a racist at his sanders said he would push trump to make wall street to raise the federal minimum wage and to ensure at least six weeks of mandatory maternity leave he also that who has said that climate change may be a hoax made by the would need to a little about and focus on making rely more on renewable energy sources speech came as democrats desperately try to figure out how to regroup and energize the party now that republicans control the white the senate and the house the along with progressives like senator warren of represents one wing of the party that is vying for power as more moderate democrats aligned with consider the future both sanders and ms warren and a growing list of progressives have endorsed representative of who is now hoping to become the next chairman of the democratic national committee on in his sanders also reminded his audience that he had defied the odds and won many states in the democratic primaries by focusing on improving economic realities and by energizing a large number of young people who overwhelmingly preferred him to are living in a nation that has a grotesque level of income and wealth inequality in which the top of percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom sanders said repeating an phrase from his campaign that is the reality that trump perceived to be and he hear that you are hurting and i hear and understand worried about the future for your kids and i alone can do something about and people voted for democrats will be prepared to work with trump if he turns out to be sincere about the promises he made during the sanders said those promises turn out to be if they were nothing more than campaign we will not only oppose his economic we will expose those
a month ago i tried to write a column proposing mean nicknames for on the basis that it would be funny to turn the tables on him for the cruel diminutives he applied to pull it off there is a darkness about trump that negates that sort of a folly so an incompetence so profound that no insult could plumb its has run one of the lousiest presidential campaigns ever in saying so i am not referring to his business practices or his vulgar remarks about women i mean this in a purely technical this man fractured his own party his convention was a fiasco he had no ground game to speak of the list of celebrities and pundits and surrogates taking his side on the campaign trail was extremely short he needlessly offended countless groups of disabled mothers of crying the bush and among others he even lost for now he is going to be president of the united states the woman we were constantly assured was the candidate of all time has lost to the least qualified candidate of all time everyone who was anyone rallied around and it make any difference the man too incompetent to insult is now going to sit in the oval whence he will hand down his verdicts on the grandees and sages of the old there is a bright side to a trump victory after there was a reason that tens of millions of good people voted for him and maybe he will live up to their high regard for him he has pledged to the of and maybe he will sincerely tackle that task he has promised to renegotiate and maybe will finally come to pass maybe win so much for us he once predicted in a campaign that get sick of not deceive ourselves we going to win anything what happened on is a both for liberalism and for the world as president trump goes about settling scores with his former picking fights with other and unleashing his special deportation police on this group and we will all soon have cause to regret his ascension to the presidential throne what we need to focus on now is the obvious what the hell went what species of guided our democratic leaders as they went about losing what they told us was the most important election of our at the top she has an impressive she worked hard on the campaign trail but she was exactly the wrong candidate for this populist moment an insider when the country was screaming for an outsider a technocrat who offered when the country wanted to take a sledgehammer to the machine twitter victory speech in was the democratic candidate because it was her turn and because a victory would have moved every democrat in up a notch whether or not she would win was always a secondary something that was taken for granted had winning been the number one several more suitable candidates were ready to go there was with his powerful plainspoken and there was an inspiring and largely figure each of them would probably have beaten but neither of them would really have served the interests of the party so democratic leaders made their candidate even though they knew about her closeness to the her fondness for and her unique vulnerability on the trade issue each of which trump exploited to the fullest they chose even though they knew about her private email server they chose her even though some of those who studied the foundation suspected it was a sketchy try to put over such a nominee while screaming that the republican is a monster is to court disbelief if trump is a as liberals often democrats should have put in their strongest player to stop not a party hack chosen because it was her turn choosing her indicated either that democrats mean what they said about that their opportunism took precedence over the or maybe supporters among the media help either it always struck me as strange that such an unpopular candidate enjoyed such robust and unanimous endorsements from the editorial and opinion pages of the but it was the quality of the enthusiasm that really harmed her with the same arguments repeated over and two or three times a with nuance and contrary views all the act of opening the newspaper started to feel like tuning in to a cold war propaganda station what it consisted was virtually without flaws she was a peerless leader clad in saintly a a caring benefactor of women and a warrior for social scandals real the economy was doing well was already people supporting if they it was only because they were botched humans racism was the only conceivable reason for lining up with the republican candidate how did the crusade the fourth estate came together in an unprecedented professional consensus they chose insulting the other side over trying to understand what motivated them they transformed opinion writing into a vehicle for high moral boasting what could possibly have gone wrong with such an put this question in slightly more general terms and you are confronting the single great mystery of the class just spent the year rallying around a professional really all that and either insulting or silencing everyone who accept their assessment and then they lost maybe time to consider whether something about shrill shouted from a position of high social that turns people even larger problem is that there is a kind of chronic complacency that has been rotting liberalism for a hubris that tells democrats they need do nothing they need deliver nothing really to anyone except their friends on the jet and those nice people at the rest of us are treated as though we have nowhere else to go and no role to play except to vote enthusiastically on the grounds that these democrats are the thing between us and the end of the world it is a
in trump will become president of the united states of and the most technologically advanced surveillance infrastructure in the world will start reporting directly to revealed the extent of the national security domestic surveillance regime in he warned that a new president could rapidly expand its scope overnight with just a simple change of government new leader will be said flip the say that because of the because of the dangers that we face in the some new and unpredicted we need more we need more and there will be nothing the people can do at that point to oppose it and it will be

the future of financial regulation is murky given the conflicting statements by j congressional republicans and senate democrats some may but looking at the whole there may be some cause for a least when it comes to the big banks and the concept of big to the starting point in all of this is trump himself his campaign rhetoric was hardly bank friendly he called for breaking up the big as well as for enactment of a century the law that separated commercial banking from investment a restriction that was repealed during the administration since big banks have become bigger the four largest banks wells bank of and control more than percent of banking according to the federal and percent of deposits the house led by who is said to be a candidate for treasury have proposed their own financial overhaul in a bill of more than pages the known as the financial choice which was proposed before would substantially change the way banks are regulated under the act established a financial stability oversight board with power over systemic risk and the ability to designate like insurance companies as systemically important it subjects big banks and other financial institutions to heightened regulation if those companies also established an orderly process for liquidating them capital charges were put on big and the rule limited trading by among a host of other requirements house bill does away with much of this regulation there is a chapter inserted into the bankruptcy code to allow these entities to be reorganized in bankruptcy the rule is repealed banks have options to avoid the restrictions these are not unreasonable changes the orderly liquidation authority was criticized because it required multiple approvals for liquidation with one day for a court to consider the making it unlikely to be used and making liquidation anything but orderly the existence of an oversight board seems conceptually fine but also adds a layer of bureaucracy where the government has not proved particularly good at spotting financial crises has anyone of the house bill has lots of other stuff the consumer financial protection bureau would be turned into a normal agency with commissioners appointed by the president its authority would be and it would be barred from limiting consumer arbitration as it is proposing the house bill also cuts a swath through other financial regulation it eliminates rules on fees and the department of fiduciary duty standard it lowers the compensation disclosure requirements for public including cutting the requirement that companies disclose the amount and ratio of chief executive pay to the median employee salary will the trump plan or the house plan win the simple trump plan seems to focus on making banks smaller and taking away the regulatory oversight and safety net on the other the republican plan does not do away with financial it simply makes what the republicans view as reasonable modifications to allow the banks to operate more effectively thrown into this mix are the senate democrats under the senate votes will be needed to bring any legislation revising to a vote the republicans have senators and maybe depending on the results of the runoff on new chuck the leader of the senate has already said that although there are areas of common ground on republican plans for infrastructure there is no such agreement on financial regulation so assuming the democrats hold the any legislative repeal of is unlikely and although some democrats may cross getting eight or nine will be almost impossible so where does that leave very likely there will be a muddle areas where the president can act without congress are likely to see the most change if trump adopts the house republican things like the financial stability oversight board will wither the designation of systemically important financial institutions for insurance companies will also go away the rest will depend on what trump wants and who he picks for treasury secretary all three rumored potential candidates would seem to be more in favor of the republican house bill than the ideas trump put forth they may try a compromise that the democrats can buy into compromise can only go so far dismantling the consumer financial protection bureau is probably a nonstarter given that senate votes are necessary to modify the it is likely to remain in the budget is protected from congress and the president it can continue on its current at least until trump appoints a new director in two years but there may be more common ground on how to deal with the big banks this is because the proposals in the house bill concerning bank regulation are worth and the changes to regulation of the big banks have credible support in reasonable quarters for the bankruptcy option seems more viable than a liquidation authority that will never be used in an article in professors a and mark j roe wrote that core concept behind the bill bankruptcy for banks is noting that there it needed some tweaks to be including allowing regulators to force banks into bankruptcy the exit ramp from may also not be viewed as a watering down of regulations the financial services law firm stated that the standard a high and its utility was because of this even some of the consumer financial protection proposals make despite being unlikely to pass reconstituting the agency into one like the securities and exchange commission or the federal trade with commissioners appointed by the president and split among the would make the agency more responsive to democratic government and better able to enact regulation the ideas to limit public overly burdensome compensation which do not seem to do much but impose substantial would also seem ripe for elimination some of these proposals are complaints about forced arbitration are real and merit discussion the elimination of the rule or the revival of restrictions would mean a fundamental restructuring of the financial system it is something worth thinking despite my whether needs big

travel market he started a company that organizes trips for to legally visit a business made possible because president has broadened travel to the island and expanded licenses for to do business there so what happens wonders on the campaign j trump threatened to roll back the sweeping dtente with lambasting the made to its communist government and raising the possibility that one of signature

allow measures to continue or if he will instead keep a vow he made and scale back everything from diplomatic relations to the unlimited rum and cigars recently allowed from such a move by trump would

election trump grew less equivocal in he told that he would continue having diplomatic relations with but he said he would want better deals than trump took a harder line in this fall of the concessions has granted the regime were done through executive which means the next president can reverse and that i will do unless the regime meets our trump said at a campaign event in my demands our vice mike pence reaffirmed that stance on saying trump would repeal executive orders unless there was political and religious asked by a reporter if his comments meant he would break off diplomatic relations with trump suggested that he and said he probably would not appoint an ambassador to agreement president signed is a very weak he said get nothing the people of get and i would do whatever is necessary to get a good l a lawyer who specializes in united trade said trump seemed to believe that had struck a single deal with when in reality there are several agreements that range from direct mail to managing oil spills trump could pick through them one by one to eliminate the ones he dislikes and keep others but muse said the government could be financially liable if it pulled out the rug from under companies that had acted in good faith enhanced travel that has introduced would be the most tragic thing trump might but i think he muse said has invested a lifetime in resorts

you were to look at our game board of all the possible outcomes of the this one even on the that was how mark t chief executive of the large health insurer described the election of j trump as the next president he was speaking with me last on stage at the new annual playing for the long term started with a fresh piece of paper yesterday we had no idea how to approach said business executives across the nation and the world have been whipping out fresh pieces of paper to map how election and republican control of the white senate and house which may make notorious gridlock a memory will reshape economic policy the stock market has taking many prognosticators by in anticipation of the seismic changes trump has a repeal or refashioning of the affordable care a dismantling of the regulations for wall a substantial haircut for corporate and personal income tax and a major infrastructure spending among other things while the new conventional wisdom may be that the nation is about to see comprehensive the truth is that it is likely to be more incremental than across the board for the wall street reform and consumer protection act while you would think much of the finance industry would salivate at the chance to rid itself of the its view is more nuanced most companies have made large investments and changes in their business practices to comply with the law so hard to see how even the opponents in the industry would press for the full repeal that trump said he would pursue omelet has been that toothpaste is out of the c the chief executive of said at the conference want regulation to be repealed in he added you want to be good for you have to have policies that would be good for economic more likely than a administration will try to eliminate the components he has criticized most a trump administration could try to weaken the consumer financial protection the watchdog agency created by which republicans for example probably be a research analyst at capital alpha partners in wrote in a note to clients would be horrible politics and optics to get rid of an agency that was established to protect the little predicted that the trump administration would be able to push through a switch that critics of the agency have long lobbied a shift in control of the consumer bureau from a single director to a bipartisan commission trump might also focus on changing a rule for small banks that grow to more than billion in assets such growth catapults a bank into a new regulatory one that comes with much stricter scrutiny and more elaborate reporting requirements this rule has been criticized by the banking industry as an impediment to growth and competition as for the return of something trump has talked about bet on it republican call for a return to a division of commercial and investment banking be taken wrote was part of a campaign document big banks are useful as a populist and trump may continue to use them in that way but neither he or his top aides are interested in piecemeal change may also be true of pledge to undo which was one of his bedrock campaign promises of will be a repeal and i think the repeal will be at a minimum in nearly impossible for the law to be replaced with the flip of a switch going to happen in the next he said have people signed we have to honor that through have to work quickly to have something for said that whatever replacement plan might the government was not going to just stop insuring the million or so people who are covered under the affordable care act put them out on the street without he said his expectation is that advantage will be expanded the backpedaling on the pledge has already trump has said in the past several days that he intends to make sure that health insurers will not be able to turn away people with and that people under the age of will still be able to have coverage under their plans about the latter trump said he would much try and keep in an interview with of that aired the said that the measure but very much something going to try and of the biggest question is how trump is going to create a new manufacturing class in he has suggested that he is going to renegotiate trade increase tariffs on goods and deport illegal immigrants both for security he and because they take jobs from how those ambitions ultimately play out is guess one issue that trump has seemingly avoided is that of how new technologies are steadily taking jobs jobs that are routine are going to be replaced by the chairman of the parent company of said at the conference a truth that may be at odds with ambitions had an optimistic outlook about how technology already provides unappreciated benefits jobs are infinitely safer today because robots do the dangerous he said take that for despite all of the among surprised about the outcome of the there was a sense of optimism or at least a sense of hope that pervaded their words all know a lot about trump the campaigner now we have to find out about the trump who needs to get things said will start to think not about getting elected but about what his legacy is going to he continued assume you go into that office and you think about your place in history and things going to see how it goes before i become
the long i have a lifelong republican who voted for am very disappointed about the but i be despondent i am by nature an optimistic person as the evening wore on and it became clear that trump was going to i started thinking about what is actually going to happen after this in the there will be dark and things will happen that are not good for our or for the world sure that the affordable care act for i believe that the republicans will start to realize that they really get what they wanted after a republican he has made that clear he just agrees with them on some or claims to i think the first half of term will go very badly for the voters will become and the midterm elections in will be disastrous for them democrats will probably end up with control of both houses of congress get a new supreme court but not worried about whether be too conservative i would be more worried that they be qualified in the long i have believe in checks and voted for voted shortly after polls open on and i voted for trump no disrespect intended to the third party but a vote for an alternate candidate is in reality a vote either trump or so i was faced with a vote for an incompetent or a crook i chose to vote for the incompetent in the end it the emails that sealed the deal it was the remaining hope that and would modify the impending chaos the system of checks and balances appears to be in position to better counter trump than trump has already lost substantial support among the so he count on either the existing supreme court or congress to ignore there is the press what we see is a press overwhelmingly a vote for means we can not count on the press to honestly and diligently keep the public informed of potential malfeasance nor at this point can we count on the institutions of government to counter in any meaningful way so i voted for the candidate likely to lead us into the weeds without establishment underestimated the voted for i think all astounded instead of predictable fifth facing nobody quite knows what i never thought this was a serious possibility until but the establishment apparently made a misjudgment in underestimating the rage after decades of being impoverished to benefit the since the primary was rigged against the only major this was the next prominent way to give the democrats a heave else refreshing to see their awfulness finally backfire on not exactly shocked at but dismayed that so many of my fellow citizens still refused to look outside the duopoly or help the greens reach federal funding levels the impetus is understandable this is a rejection of the status quo more than an actual endorsement of racism or but the forces unleashing are volatile and damn scary as the bigger struggle starts after voting positive change only comes from public so arguably a better chance for it now than under a democratic president if no actual policy coming from the oval space for saner voices to shape it be but at least the citizenry seems ready to seriously push back the campaign got younger voters surprisingly engaged and proved that candidates have to be owned by corporate money if enough remember the power lies with we may have a fighting chance after am ashamed of how this plays with the rest of the voted for lost this election because sexism enabled voters to perceive the most qualified candidate in the world as someone more reprehensible bar the most despicable person who has ever sought the presidency because the contingent of mostly white overlooked empathy for minority groups due to their own positions of privilege because of voter because we watched happen and refused to heed its am ashamed of how this plays with the rest of the world ashamed of my state in particular and dread what consequences it will bring the fallout of supreme court turnover alone will last long after his term is done it should go without saying that a president should not threaten the wellbeing of certain citizens as a main selling point in his and my heart goes out to any individual who feels unsafe i know the cold fear you are experiencing the only way we can think to proceed is to brace for a prolonged fight ahead of man slated to be president has built his platform on harming the vulnerable and shouting over the voices of the oppressed if you find this rhetoric if you are then seize any opportunity to defy it do not wait to speak out until they come for you to your loss is the loss i am sorry they were too blind to see waking up to today scares voted for my wildest dreams i never would have thought the public would swing so wildly away from reason as to elect someone like trump i grew up in a family a liberal but my father was conservative been a single mom working multiple jobs to keep a roof over my head and struggled to make ends meet as long as i can remember i understand the feeling that represent the but the waking up to today scares me and left with only kind of world will my grandson grow up what will happen to friends and people of color who unlike born here someone once called it my how could it be a good idea to elect a man who treats women so makes promises he has no interest in learning the nuances of and brags about not paying why does the public react so negatively to a woman taking a role of where is the critical decency and respect have gone out the door in this election and just sold our collective soul to the country split in two

if they squint hard they can see hope in the form of an ambitious piece of legislation like a big tax cut then there is the fact that will not be president and mike the faithfully conservative vice is there to keep watch those conservatives who insisted that electing j trump president would be a grievous mistake a group that included radio prominent columnists and some of the most savvy political operators in the country are now saying they see an upside to four years of a trump white house but even as they find small those who counted themselves part of the trump opposition are wondering what their place will be for the next four years in a republican party they can hardly recognize and they have begun to ponder what it all means for a conservative movement they thought they understood better said the radio host who became a vocal opponent of during the republican primaries he was describing how he had arrived at peace with the election he he realized that he had not done so at all kind of have to a lot of what you thought about the shape of he said not just that that you fundamentally misread what what is so disorienting for many conservatives is that the trump victory was the culmination of the unruly populist upwelling in first manifested in the tea party that traditional republicans thought they could eventually absorb those forces have overtaken them one by one first claiming their house majority then their john a and then an entire field of presidential candidates now it may claim their party some on team are already boasting how they plan to break with decades of conservative orthodoxy on government spending and pursue a huge infrastructure spending package that sounds more than conservatives are going to go k senior counselor and chief gleefully told the

as establishment republicans as he has at democrats will be as exciting as the greater than the some conservatives say they could surely live with a few of the proposals of they find like a big spending especially if they come with sweeteners like tax breaks or spending cuts in other areas the easiest way to forge many are is to disassociate the man from the policy will do everything i can to help said senator republican of south who has refused on numerous other occasions to help including voting for him or attending the republican national convention graham told reporters on capitol hill this week that he believed he could work with trump on issues like the military which both men support expanding for the political advocacy group supported by and that decided not to spend any money on the presidential race this year despite spending tens of millions to help mitt in is also cracking the door to trump the declined to say whether it had met or spoken to anyone inside transition team encouraged on several fronts by the possibility of the republican congress working with the new said for citing the prospect of repealing some of president energy policies along with the affordable care act but as with any period of acceptance comes in different ways some find catharsis in writing others console themselves in data that show they really were not all that wrong then there are those who still talk as if they are in they have good days and bad days goes said bill the weekly standard editor and leading who has written columns about his coming to terms with trump any given said in an he feels a range of competing sentiments sort of somewhere between but and but he using modified versions of famous quote about how he approached negotiating with the soviets on the subject of it is hard not to talk to conservatives today about trump and not have them wistfully invoke their said he feared people were drawing parallels to trump that risk setting the wrong standards for success revolution that he beat jimmy carter in he said that i love that the revolution was that he governed successfully for eight years and won the cold others are concerned that the conservative movement missed an opportunity to appeal to a younger and more diverse group of voters and they wonder how it will do so with someone as divisive as trump atop the republican party a conservative radio host in and prominent pointed to the tens of thousands of voters in and states trump barely won who voted in other races but did not cast a vote for evidently because they could not bring themselves to vote for him not lightning in a he making the point that trump repelled so many voters that he almost lost like you showed up for work and they said this is your last paycheck and you and your wife go to las put it all on black and it pays the radio personality in said he at least felt liberated by not supporting trump he does not feel compelled to defend him like so many of

the harvest had just begun when agents from the immigration and naturalization service stormed across the onion fields of in sweeping up immigrants who were trudging behind tractors without legal authorization to work in the united pulling onions out of the ground for cents per bag the fallout was unexpected senator republican of wrote to the immigration complaining of its and inappropriate enforcement against farmers who are simply trying to get their products from the field to the representative blasted the immigration and immigration enforcement shortly after the onion growers in counties were granted a temporary amnesty to keep their workers as long as their paperwork looked legitimate welcome to reality last j trump was elected president based on a straightforward promise to make the united states great again he aimed his message primarily at tens of millions of white who feel left behind in the growing economic undercut by the advancement of minorities and competition from illegal immigrants at home and cheap workers in other countries this trump is being forced to acknowledge that his straightforward solutions in much less straightforward than he promised they would be the big and beautiful wall might look more like a fence most of the estimated million illegal immigrants be summarily he backing off a line from stump speeches earlier in the campaign perhaps only two or three million just the bad guys that number is in the ballpark of deportations in the administration undocumented immigrants who are not he are trump has not yet clarified his promises on but most experts say it will be very hard to simply walk away from and impose a percent tariff against imports from china an age of global supply said of the school of government at cannot take a chain saw to trade agreements and not end up cutting your foot sure but where does that leave to the political scientist at the apparent shift in position is unsurprising politicians follow the interests of average he they hew to the interests of the rich instincts on economic policy seem to have fallen by the wayside over the course of the told me the need to work with republicans in congress will probably reinforce that in his book published this offered a snapshot of voter preferences in before the onset of the financial crisis on the bottom of the income most voters supported policies to provide jobs and equalize incomes but at the most opposed them the picture was reversed when voters were asked about cuts to government spending the rich were much more supportive than the poor and what did voters after a brief flurry of fiscal stimulus to stop the economy from careening into the they got a round of automatic budget cuts called the sequester the transformation of populist agenda into a rather more orthodox list of republican goals may well follow the same script his proposal for huge tax cuts which would reduce federal revenue by as much as trillion over a according to the nonpartisan tax policy center would shower favors mostly on even as he backs away from mass trump is now talking about echoing the house who wants to weave his goal of replacing health care for the elderly with vouchers to buy private insurance into the campaign promise to overhaul the affordable care act is going to happen is said a political scientist what will want to do is quite while trump has pitched deregulation notably the repeal of president clean power plan as an engine for job growth in the rust he is also set to deliver enormous gains to wall street by undoing core provisions of the which was established to hem in the financial sector and prevent a repeat of the crisis of there is definitely a silver lining if trump is really letting go of the most extreme elements of his agenda the economic and social dislocation that would be caused by deporting percent of workers would be immense may not be the best agreement in the china certainly cheats but igniting trade wars with the biggest trading partners would not improve the livelihoods of working class but the only real sliver of good news for is in proposal for infrastructure spending on a yet unspecified but surely huge scale but how will base respond if that program is financed largely by temporarily cutting corporate taxes to percent or so to encourage businesses with profits parked abroad to bring them and would it be enough to restore prosperity to the working for political analysts on the left have been perplexed by who give their vote to a republican party whose motivating principle revolves around delivering tax cuts to the rich this time they delivered their vote to a republican who promised to directly address their plight he has already come up short oxford under its most upbeat assumptions a big tax cut and infrastructure spending delivering a lot of economic stimulus while new trade barriers are limited foresees growth picking up for a while before falling back to the rate of roughly percent a year that the united states has been living with for the last seven years if trump pursues oxford economics predicts the economy will plunge into recession under either the frustrated voters who cast their vote for trump are likely to remain as frustrated as stuck with insufficient education in a world of low growth and diminishing opportunity maybe they will figure out that most of the industrial jobs they lost are gone for that protectionism bring them and that the main driver of their plight is technological change deporting a couple of million in and engaging in a some prominent trade spats may let off some political steam but otherwise it help the critical question then is not so much how supporters will respond politically but how trump will react to their inevitable disappointment who is generally sympathetic to the notion that has gone imposing opaque global rules on democratic
i get it call to shorten our presidential cycle will resonate with just about everyone this year who counting down the days until this is even has been winding the months in crow points out in a petition on as of had more than this extended political circus is a singularly phenomenon election will have lasted nearly days by the time polls close on by had its longest campaign season in recent history last and it lasted just she writes across the globe have limited campaign seasons to as short as weeks with an organized a professional campaign could be suggestion for how we reform our electoral process that we ask the and to reform the process is less compelling in a segment on morning on she threw out five days as the optimal amount of time she and previously floated the notion that all states and the district of should hold their primaries on the same a move that would prove hugely advantageous to the richest candidates by grassroots opening clip for morning segment certainly felt ironic in former prime minister is seen ribbing president about the stupidly long length of elections always look on at the elections in awe of the scale of the process and the length of the says to in a news conference from of adding he marvels that anyone is left standing at the end of it joked back that term limits meant he too would get to sit back and in at the of might have wanted something different two months later be pushed from office over a voter referendum the result of which almost nobody saw moved on to how toxic media discourse has become petition is simply an appeal from a a single working mom who dives for the remote control before my kids can turn the on and see something going to have to the sentiment is but perhaps the problem is less the length of the cycle than the fact our republican nominee for president actively brags about women by the a fact worth come out until more than days into the crow deems the of the election choosing to announce the beginning of his campaign is not something the or can actually control nor is the fact that campaign reporters often start sourcing up to cover the next campaign the moment the current one ends party committees do set the timetable for but even there they are in a constant with state which battle to move up in the primary calendar so their voters get more for entreaties to focus more on we may not have gotten as far into the weeds on the tax code or what we need to do to save the but we have furthered the national conversation around xenophobia sexual and those are things that should not be written off as empty identity politics since audio leaked of trump bragging about it on a dozen different women have spoken about his alleged sexual not something i want kids watching either not something loved covering been emotionally and physically exhausting but more important that voters know who our next president actually is rather than collectively covering their all due i think crow understands the value of what journalists have done this cycle muting the television protect our kids from our reality and reducing the amount of time we have to learn about the people running for the most powerful job in the particularly when so much of what comes out of their mouths is make it harder to fool the it will make it infinitely elections
all eyes are on the race to be the next us but the battle to control congress may be almost as next congress could determine whether the supreme court goes back to having nine whether the makes good on its climate promises and for is should she be elected the senate and the house stay republican and trump wins the he would not necessarily have carte as much as trump may want to build a border wall with he would not be able to spend the estimated it would cost until congress legislated for it assuming does not pay for the wall as trump has sometimes promised it would likewise need help to deport undocumented slap new tariffs on goods or fine us companies for moving manufacturing overseas unclear whether the would back him on these issues but a quick agreement on issues such as repealing the estate tax and law might well be in the is extremely unlikely that the democrats will seize control of the house of representatives on owing to an republican majority in the lower gerrymandering at the state level means there many house races this cycle only out of according to the cook political report democrats could win every single one of the toss ups and still fall around eight seats short of a house majority but the senate is a different with most analysts putting the chances of overcoming the current majority and taking the upper chamber at about even basically harry a polling analyst with told on have in my opinion maybe six or seven seats that are going to really determine democrats controlled the and were the supreme court vacancy could soon be filled although republicans have already hinted at a procedural fight to stop that from happening as with every aspect of the election presence is palpable some republican incumbents appear to have been wounded by associations with the nominee senator in new saw her numbers drop after she was asked at a debate whether trump would be a good role model for and replied representative heck loses his senate analysts will point to the record number of voters who lined up in the state to cast early ballots for against senator burr in north may fall victim to the abandonment of trump by moderate republicans in his other there is no perceivable trump drag and there may be trump coattails in where trump and appear to be republican incumbent rob is polling points ahead of his a former governor and in where trump appears to be crushing republican incumbent blunt is in a seemingly tight race with the democratic state secretary of state in incumbent pat appears to be running behind his but not as far behind as trump is running in the just very difficult to understand exactly going to to congressional big outside money is trying to block progressive star zephyr from making it to a law has strong support from senator but her opponent says a first congressional republican a county dropped out of a congressional race in after an who was also an undocumented outed him as gay and said the sheriff threatened him with deportation if he said anything democrat tom a state appears to have the congressional one of the sweetest of all potential pickups for because it would send incumbent the loathed former chairman of the oversight committee packing he faces retired marine colonel will tar heel voters make incumbent governor pat pay for signing the notorious house bill which allowed discrimination against people in access to public state attorney general cooper looks senate the moment when state attorney general touted as a future national star for could step onto the main stage of politics representative like a is putting up a elections
j trump embarked on one of the rituals of the presidency on meeting in new with the prime minister of as he continued his fitful adjustment to the protocols of diplomacy am convinced trump is a leader in whom i can have great said after the meeting at trump tower he described the encounter as the visit with came after congratulatory phone calls from foreign leaders in the nine days since trump won the election none seem to have adhered to established diplomatic in which the state department choreographs the sequence of the calls and provides policy guidance and translating services on the state department said it was finally in contact with emissaries but until they had not requested any nor had the calls including with president v of and other adversaries of the united states been routed through the state as is according to a department official aides did not respond to questions about whether the had used his own interpreter in the meeting with and calls with other or whether he had relied on interpreters provided by them order that the calls are done in seems like a silly protocol issue but one that people really think said a senior fellow at the center for a new security and a former top aide to the national security e rice are taking messages away from whether you think important or visit first with a foreign leader since the election came on a day when the was steeped in foreign policy he met with former secretary of state henry a to discuss and issues around the ranging from and china to and the according to the transition team he met with ambassador to the united who told reporters afterward that has no doubt that trump is a true friend of said he looked forward to working with of the members of the trump including k chief who has been accused of promoting through his news media news he met s the director of the national security agency and the top officer at the which gave him his first exposure to the surveillance abilities and he met with gen jack a former army vice chief of staff who has been a longtime informal adviser to and a mentor to gen h as well as a prime architect of the troop surge in the w bush administration was for a couple of general said in a telephone interview by how personable he and by his intellectual curiosity about national security events most presidential candidates have an knowledge of national security issues but he asked excellent general declined to discuss the advice he had given trump but he said the new greatest challenge would be to maintain leadership in a world in which radical militancy was threatening to metastasize into a and hostile powers like china and were seeking regional dominance during the trump called into question the network of security alliances that the united states had maintained since world war saying the partners in and were not paying their fair share for the umbrella of protection few allies were as rattled by campaign statements as japan at one he suggested that japan and south consider acquiring nuclear weapons to protect themselves in the days leading to officials from the foreign and trade ministries were urging to take a tough line with trump on the value of the partnership a huge trade deal that trump opposes and the defense which trump has said japan must contribute more money according to j a former official in the bush administration with close ties to japan but appeared to reject that preferring to focus on cultivating a personal relationship with trump some japan experts speculated that was concerned about getting off on the right foot with trump because when the leader traveled to new in for the united nations general assembly he met with who was then the favorite in the presidential but not trump prime minister has done very well with strongmen like and said referring to prime minister of and the president question the side still cannot understand is what a trump administration will actually do on green added dispelling such confusion is one reason for the choreographed nature of the first calls made to leaders in transition team had a plan for the on the morning of election ms who later became ambassador to the united described the plan in an email to two of his other advisers anticipation of the many calls from foreign we have prepared a list of priority calls to return and the briefing ms rice wrote at view is that he should return the calls through the state dpt ops which is comparatively apolitical and has translation capabilities and can assist as desired with the ops center serves as a giant switchboard for the providing interpreters as needed to ensure that officials are confident their words are being translated accurately using government switchboards can also help prevent hoaxes during the two comedians pretending to be the pranked the republican two days before the election that call got through despite the fact that advisers to senator john of the republican presidential had a policy of never letting take a call from a purported foreign leader without first checking out the telephone number with the state according to a person familiar with that operations in it has been prime minister of reached out to trump early in the week after getting his phone number from a professional apparently becoming the second world leader to congratulate him after president of beat the prime minister in the case of brief conversation with the prime it was conducted in though the said to
presidential elections are a form of madness that comes over us once every four years they fit the or narrative of seducing us into forgetting how powerful we are they erase our memory of grassroots direct democracy and civil society leaders beget people pin their hopes on one and with that they seem to shed responsibility for anything beyond getting that one person into office they wash their hands of any further involvement if not their one person we forget our own the innumerable times swayed so it is this time around with the election a matter of days away and the media engrossed in a fight to end all it sometimes seems as though lost sight of the powers that belong to us and not and the responsibilities and possibilities that go with our power the intensely personal nature of this campaign and the particular danger of trump has created a kind of tunnel is not to say that the outcome is unimportant far from it many supporters seem quietly confident of a win i am less complacent had enough surprises this year in in to know that voters have a way of confounding those who observe them a trump presidency would be a terrible thing but a victory would be far from an occasion to sigh with sit back and resume life as though the last few months had been a bad dream a in would be just a starting point for a new kind of campaign a politician is not a given each one is in part what we make by organizing every election season we pretend that one person will have all the power and that whatever they promise up front is exactly who for better or worse we forget our own the innumerable times swayed such as the decision to veto the keystone pipeline we forget the way culture and activism set the norms for political decisions on matters such as marriage seasons erase the memory of movements that worked for years or outside and below and above electoral politics they drown out the histories that how women got the how the civil rights movement how the free trade area of the trade deal withered and how the world trade organization was hobbled and its poorer member nations inspired to revolt by the great shutdown in how got banned in new how rape law has been radically revised in many ways and places thanks to feminist action and discourse in all these the people who we mislabel leaders only followed the will of the it matters who is but what a president does has everything to do with what the people demand or refuse or do and what the house and senate send them or sabotage mitt promised to build the keystone pipeline himself if republicans for the foreseeable future will be puppets of the industry democrats are not necessarily our friends or but they are sometimes politicians who can be pushed wavered on that pipeline for several years when he vetoed it was not because of who he but because of who we we the members of a climate movement that blockaded and demonstrated for building a powerful movement that the president has become so much more engaged with climate is a result what the movement it educated us on the made the case for the urgency and importance of built global shed light on the ways climate is an economic and racial justice started innumerable campaigns to block implement efficiency and good and shift to renewable resources a lot of other changes that matter have happened at the local level as regions and states have done great work on led by community small groups and minor politicians never hear about the administration could have done much more if more of the people who elected him stuck around to push back against the conservatives and interests which is not to even raise the question of that more useful to ask what are our if most of us do little or nothing about policies we deplore or ideals we praise the same will be true of a if the one voters choose on the extent to which it serves the interests of people and our planet depends in part on the extent to which citizens apply pressure to it you may feel exhausted right tired of a bruising cycle which has left no personal stone unturned to the detriment of policy but the truth at the beginning either of a period of sustained resistance against a deranged or a period of sustained action to push the first female president to deliver a genuinely agenda if we end up with a democrat i regret that the best choice we get in this binary a lot is up to us a gift and a responsibility take it i hope join me elections
dozens of major regulations passed recently by the administration including changes on health consumer protections and environmental safety could be undone with the stroke of a pen by j trump and the congress starting in thanks to a law that dates back to and it comes with a if the law is used to strike down a the federal agency that issued it is barred from enacting similar regulation again in the future the obscure law called the congressional review act was passed years ago at the behest of newt then the house speaker and now a member of transition team it gives congress legislative days to review and override major regulations enacted by federal agencies in the the vote would not be subject to filibuster the president can veto the which usually renders the law toothless but when one party controls both the white house and it can be a powerful legislative weapon so far it has only been successfully used in a republican congress invoked it to eliminate workplace safety regulations adopted in the final months of president tenure president w bush signed the repeal two months after his wiping out stricter ergonomics rules that had been years in the making on when trump takes office with a congress one that has indicated its zeal for undoing president doings more than rules adopted since late may are potentially vulnerable to the according to an analysis by the university regulatory studies center allows the election results to be applied almost to snip off activity that happened at the end of the last said a law professor at the regulations at risk many environmental including limits on formaldehyde use and stricter truck fuel efficiency a food and drug administration ban on the sale of antibacterial a requirement that federal contractors provide paid sick leave for their stricter consumer protections on prepaid debit federal loan forgiveness for students at schools that shut a rule that bars nursing homes that receive federal funding from requiring residents to resolve all disputes through rather than in court under speaker d the house has used the law several times to try to reject a number of the policies those challenges were symbolic president vetoed every one that reached his desk but trump can approve any sent to him after he takes office office did not respond to requests for comment think go after every single but i think get eight to that may be said the director of regulatory policy at the action a group that has been tracking which regulations are subject to congressional review the threat posed by the law may slow the usual rush of that administrations typically race to finish in their final days this it will be a game of chicken put out a rule and hope it or hold to preserve the chance to revisit it in the would imagine there will be a serious discussion about regulations that they were planning to said e the director of the university regulatory studies center bluntness of the may be exactly what makes it appealing to the next congress and the labor department has never tried to revive the rule that president bush struck down this has only been done once no litigation said a professor of public policy who previously worked at the office of information and regulatory the unit that coordinates reviews of executive branch regulations wipes the rule out for quite a at the very he said know what would happen if an agency eventually decided to go back and try because congress takes so many legislative days stretches out for many calendar months the congressional research service estimates that the review deadline for the rules will fall at the end of based on the planned schedule for the rest of this year adjourning early would buy congress some extra days when the new congress the clock resets and lawmakers have additional time to review eligible rules some republican lawmakers are eager to slash where they can on the interior department issued a new regulation designed to control emissions of methane a powerful greenhouse gas from oil and natural gas wells on federal and tribal lands it is a relatively small part of a larger set of regulations that the administration has been rolling out to prevent inadvertent leaks from processing plants and pipelines with a few the oil and gas industry has opposed the regulations as unnecessarily costly senator republican of fired off a scathing statement has many tools with which to rescind this and i look forward to working with the incoming trump administration to ensure economic expansion prevails over misguided bureaucratic he said daisy communications said the congressional review act was one of those to which he referred

imagine the world was facing upheaval on a scale not seen during modern a change that would imperil the great cities by the rising seas and snuff out species at at the fastest rate since the dinosaurs disappeared then imagine you were a had repeated chances to ask the next president of the united states about this and decided to not do apparent failure of the media during the presidential election has been multifaceted and fiercely debated but the absence of climate change as a leading topic in the election of trump is perhaps the single greatest rebuke to the idea that power should be held to account for the benefit of this and future failure was most apparent during the presidential where hours of television saw not one moderator question pitched to trump or on climate change it was left to ken he of the red sweater and brief to come closest with a question about coal consequences of unchecked climate which is essentially what trump proposes by denying the problem dwarfed every other issue including emails discussed during the debates and yet it raised it was the equivalent of getting an exclusive interview with and in and not asking them about the change was also missing in broader coverage of the especially on cable where scientific emergencies make good fodder for breathless journalism the public were periodically warned that the seas are eating away east coast and that no not just it really is warm this but climate change was treated as a side issue rather than being central to every energy and foreign policy question the country is grappling with a leading climate is the great issue of our time and we are skirting around it just baffled by to be many also skirt around climate change even if they are concerned about it nearly of say that climate change is at least somewhat important to them according to the program on climate although few people talk about the issue with family or friends are broadly in favor of developing clean sources of energy but a clear political divide about how to approach climate change polling by the pew research center shows half of supporters cared about climate change a great compared with of trump supporters maybe now that the reality of the next four years of president trump is sinking a more considered view of the problems faces will take hold maybe people will realize important that left it to the very last minute to cut greenhouse gas emissions and that failure to do this will probably risk their prosperity and national security maybe the spread of disease and the rising seas will be grasped as something to be urgently remedied before tropical advance further and south is inundated there is much detail to work both on the impacts of climate change and how policies will influence them the has promised to withdraw the us from the climate to scrap the clean power slash funding for renewable energy and somehow attempt to reboot the ailing coal industry how far he will go with this and indeed how invested he personally is in it beyond outlandish tweeted is still unclear exiting the accord will require a notice period but as the agreement is beyond its goal of avoiding dangerous global trump could simply drop any attempt to cut emissions and sit it out as other countries try to suppress their panic as to what to do now that the us a climate leader anymore trump wants to accelerate domestic coal and gas production to achieve energy but this goal is contradictory and barely feasible given the unfavorable economics facing coal and oil in particular the new president also wants to roll back the environmental protection agency while having water and clean air he has spoken admiringly of natural beauty but has surrounded himself with fossil fuel billionaires and lobbyists who want to split open public lands for their enrichment republicans largely support this stance but at the same time they want a public enraged by degraded national parks or another flint water for example untangling these contradictions and what they mean for the and the will arguably form the most important legacy left by a trump presidency up to the media to start helping do

just a week to go the overwhelming sense i get from people here in is that they just want it to be over their impatience just election fatigue feels like a kind of nervous exhaustion brought on by the clear fragility of the whole enterprise formerly known as democracy but the other thing since the email leaks on is that democrat supporters are abandoning the notion that victory will be a formality and are now trying to get their heads around the possibility of a trump victory with all the drama and hoopla possible to lose sight of the fact that after eight years of may now be set for another milestone with the election of its first female president the fact that it has achieved this later than many other western amid a campaign seeped in misogyny and should not detract from the fact that it is happening so this week i asked women in how they felt about the chance that might become president the town is divided racially and by party on the matter but the bottom line seems to be that many will vote for her even if only a few are enthused by her some loathe her but including those who are not with are angry that being judged by a double standard and believe that this speaks to a broader problem in can catch up on the project in full send us your thoughts or recommendations here and get involved on the view from
the mark went on his vast social network to convince an expanding chorus of critics including the departing president of the united states that he wants to combat the that is running wild across his site and and turning our politics into a paranoiac fantasy come to life been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility he wrote made significant but there is more work to be he listing various steps was like making it easier to report bad information and enlisting organizations it was heartening to especially after his earlier assertion that it was to believe that misinformation on had affected the presidential election in any real way despite copious evidence that it was disturbingly in the whether it directly swung the result or not but as went on to say that had to be careful not to mistakenly block he added do not want to be arbiters of truth which was why he said would continue to rely on community and trusted third his statement pointed up how much struggles to find the balance between its mission to be a utopia for its billion users and its responsibility to protect them from all that is dangerous terrorist and untrue but more to the it appeared to buy into the notion that truth is relative at a time when that notion has to finally go away do you really need an outside arbiter to determine whether a video suggesting without basis that was involved in john f fatal plane crash in should be allowed to truth need arbiters it needs defenders and it needs them now more than ever as the democracy staggers into its next uncertain phase with a mainstream news media that works hard to separate fact from fiction under economic and political which has contributed to that economic threat by gobbling up so much of the advertising market is going to have a special responsibility to do its part just imagine what things will look like if the unsavory elements that tore through the election false fake news and aggressive efforts to traditional journalism come back into play as j trump presses to enact his agenda if the past week provided any indication of where politics are the next four years are going to require an effort to keep the national conversation honest the national security adviser trump named last t a retired army lieutenant has subscribed to the conspiracy theory that law is taking root in the united states contributing to his insistence that have every reason to view as he recently used twitter to circulate a fake news item that the federal bureau of investigation was sitting on evidence from laptop that would and her crew away for nominee for attorney senator sessions of has falsely claimed that hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants are successfully crossing the border annually then there was the announcement by the conspiracy theorist that trump had called to thank him and his radio and audience for their support in the campaign add to that the fact that trump was the most prominent promoter of the false notion that president born and hesitate to repeat the outrageous suggestion that the father of senator was linked to the assassination of president john f then consider what it may look like when trump pursues policies regarding immigrants and undocumented immigrants not so outlandish to envision attempts to sell his plans getting a lift from the likes of or a fake site out of perhaps claiming that democrats are working with to use undocumented immigrants to poison local water supplies or some such president seemed to have had something like that in mind when he told reporters in on we are not serious about facts and true and and we discriminate between serious arguments and then we have knows of what he speaks he had to muddle through the first wave of this you might remember how his health care plan was marred by a false accusation that the plan included death panels that would decide who lived and who died based on their of productivity to as former gov put it her the false allegation was partly based on proposals to reimburse doctors for optional consultations with families over care decisions the accusations took on such power that even newt signed on to the falsehood despite the fact that he had previously expressed bullish support for planning explained himself in a letter to the new news including this debunked the myth but the authors stripped out the provision just the same and by then the fiction had negated any shot at a ideological debate as who was the chief communications strategist at the so grimly put it to me last death panels were the canary in the coal mine about the coming death of things have advanced since then fake news is limited only by the imaginations of its inventors and the number of shares it can garner on or twitter the one million shares of the preposterous notion that secretly sold weapons to news which has excelled at illuminating the fake news problem highlighted that example in its alarming analysis showing that during the campaign cycle fake news was shared among users more often than real news why people who care about the truth journalists social media giants like too will have to come up with a solution to this informational fast easier said than done the combination of attacks seeking to serious news organizations and a drop in overall trust in the news media has made many people wary of legitimate as my colleague john noted last politicized voices can easily drown honest journalism all too easily on social media there is growing talk of an ambitious journalistic collaboration to beat back the tide industry thinkers and leaders are coming together to brainstorm as the city university of new journalism and the have done them out and say high time that

j trump has offered the post of national security adviser to gen t potentially putting a retired intelligence officer who believes militancy poses an existential threat in one of the most powerful roles in shaping military and foreign according to a top official on transition team general a registered was main national security adviser during his campaign if he accepts as he will be a critical gatekeeper for a president with little experience in military or foreign policy issues trump and general both see themselves as brash outsiders who hustled their way to the big time they both post on twitter often about their own and they have both at times crossed the line into outright they also both exhibit a loose relationship with general for has said that or is spreading in the united states is his dubious assertions are so common that when he ran the defense intelligence subordinates came up with a name for the they called them as an general has already proved to be a powerful influence on convincing the that the united states is in a with militants and must work with any willing allies in the including president v of during the general has been present when trump has received his daily intelligence briefing as national security he would have the last word on how the president should respond to crises such as a showdown with china over the south china sea or an international health crisis like the epidemic like he would enter the white house with significant baggage the a consulting firm he founded after he was fired by president as head of the defense intelligence has hazy business ties to middle eastern countries and has appeared to lobby for the government general also took a paid speaking engagement last year with a television network funded by the and attended the lavish anniversary party in where he sat at elbow those potential conflicts of interest had led transition team to worry that general might have difficulty winning confirmation for any post unlike the national security adviser requires congressional such as director of the but for he has one overriding he was an early and ardent supporter in a campaign during which most of the national security establishment openly called trump unfit to lead general did not respond to repeated interview requests yet in numerous speeches and interviews before the and in a book published in he laid out a view of the world that sees the united states as facing a overarching threat that can be described in only one all else is secondary for general and any other description of the threat is worst kind of political he said in an interview three weeks before the election militancy poses an existential threat on a global and the faith itself is the source of the he describing it as a political not a religion he has even at times gone so far as to call it a political ideology that has into a for general the election of trump represents an astounding career turnaround once counted among the most respected military officers of his general was fired after serving only two years as chief of the defense intelligence agency he then as a vociferous critic of a elite that he contended could not even properly identify the real enemy radical that is never mind figure out how to defeat it in general found someone who was more than willing to listen he readily signed on to the and quickly emerged as the angry voice of the national security leading chants of her against at rallies and the republican convention and after months of the two men talking to each it can be hard to tell where views end and general begin they both believe that the united states needs to start working with to defeat militants and stop worrying about his suppression of critics at his attempt to dismember or the indiscriminate bombing of cities the same goes for president of who took power in a coup and who was the first world leader to speak with trump after the election trump at people and leaders of countries and i work with this do we have a common threat that we can focus said in the interview before the election knows that when it comes to or any other the common enemy that we all have is radical general and trump also agree that the united states needs to sharply curtail immigration from predominantly and possibly even force to register with the government the similarities run beyond political views like the boy from queens who made it in general came into the military without a west point pedigree he graduated from the reserve officer training program at the university of island and earned a reputation as outspoken and unconventional as he climbed the ranks to the top of military intelligence yet general still nurses the grudge of an believing he never quite got the respect he deserves for he has attributed his dismissal from the defense intelligence agency to a pair of consummate r clapper the director of national and the undersecretary of defense intelligence his like that of his new has been to buck the establishment in his both the republican and the democratic luminaries who have shaped defense and foreign policy through two presidencies have us into mess after mess for the wrong would argue with that crowd all day he said before the election among the republicans who now dominate the general has become something of a cult figure for what they see as his brave stand against the perfidy general insists that he was fired from the intelligence agency because he refused to toe the line that militants were in retreat was in all an analyst who can get deep into the weeds on the issues and a lot of this stuff and then is very good at playing said representative the republican who is chairman of
have often preferred republican presidential candidates because they historically put an emphasis on free but this politicians and commentators are lining up to express doubts about who has alarmed many with his dismissive comments about plans to build a wall on the and his unpredictable a sociologist and prominent voice of said a trump victory would be a geopolitical earthquake is the closest the us has gotten to fascism you would have an president that is nationalist and and we would see mass and a wall being which is likely since he will most likely not deport million predicted this would force to turn more towards and could upset free trade agreements and hurt economic is so unpredictable and politically inexperienced we have no idea what he will but he seems sexist and contemptuous about said of the opposition alliance in is seen as a safe pair of hands who is likely to continue the relatively benign policies of the a senior consultant for the research said us regional policies were unlikely to see a major but election of trump would at least in the short term cause dramatic impacts on the international system if he puts into practice some of the he is advocating come away unscathed for if he makes the entrance of people more builds a wall between and the has members pay for us encourages japan to have a nuclear gets tougher on and other free trade deals all of these ideas would have negative consequences for many said they did not expect a major shift in policy regardless of the knows better than as she has been here before and knows people but there will not be any substantial change in relations either way because external relations with south are a low priority for the said former ambassador to country with most at stake may be which has enjoyed a reconciliation with the us under former president weighed in with an article last month in the newspaper in which he awarded trump medal of but the old revolutionary also had nothing good to

the us has but to send to combat troops to the the from the daily and pollsters said the us should send troops to fight and collaborate closely with on the rest did not want a us presence on the

more balanced stance on climate change and us policy found strong support in the poll but overwhelmingly back stance on abortion ironically border was thrust into an unexpected starring role in this and whatever the it will please the that it has been able to cause so much mischief how much of this was down to direct we will perhaps never although the state bias towards trump has been fairly analysts believe the us is systemically set up to oppose and while there is an understanding that trump is an unusual many believe a trump presidency would not change things much other more sober heads are well aware that for all friendly as president he would be a much more unpredictable quantity than the devil they go on the public rhetoric the casual observer would think the establishment

lurking behind the turmoil and the jockeying for advantage in j effort to assemble a national security team lies the more fundamental question of how he will address the immediate and complex challenges he inherits upon taking office trump has never articulated any detailed foreign policy vision beyond the vague slogan the diverse and shifting cast of potential appointees under consideration for top administration jobs has only highlighted the deep splits among conservatives about how the new administration should confront threats involving north and among and how it should manage relations with allies in and trump said in a march interview with the new describing for the first time what the phrase meant to him have been mocked and ripped off for many years by people that were from his personnel appointments to his first major meeting with a foreign leader it came in new with prime minister of japan trump faces a series of decisions that will begin to flesh out his approach to the world and provide some clue as to how he might respond to whatever crises confront him as commander in chief does mean he will use military and to wipe out emerging from rogue nuclear states to terrorist before they can do harm to the united or does it mean he calls troops back building them into a retaliatory force that can lash out if the nation is at moments during the he suggested both approaches he said he would the from areas of and he criticized president for pulling troops out too soon but he is also the man who rejected and is it always the united states that gets right in the middle of he some we cannot be the policeman of the no one knows what response to expect from a man who said he prided himself on following his instincts and has little patience for careful legalisms of his predecessor but while presidents the challenges do not here are some places and issues where will first take trump called the agreement reached with in intended to constrain from building nuclear of the most incompetent deals of any kind ever and he promised to fix it because the deal is an executive not a the new president has great latitude to alter or scrap it but two can play that the are deeply unhappy with the arguing that they never got the relief from sanctions that they were promised any effort to reopen the bargaining will also give military officers and conservatives a chance to alter the pact or threaten to resume their race for nuclear capability to the deal was not only but also badly negotiated he said of secretary of state john and his negotiating team trump said he would have left the negotiating doubled down on and never agreed to give back billions of money that belonged to and was frozen in financial institutions but when he struggled to name any part of the deal he would have walked out of the negotiations to alter with some he finally settled on a common that after will be free to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium in any quantity in decision about what to do with the deal will be an early test of his willingness to act unilaterally the nations that joined the united states in the negotiations and china not only support the but are rushing to take economic advantage of it by building commercial ties with if trump wanted to abandon the deal or reimpose they would almost certainly refuse to go along the hold a few too in they shipped percent of their nuclear fuel out of the disabled a plutonium reactor and took thousands of which enrich out of service if the deal were to be declared they would be free to their nuclear infrastructure and rebuild their now frozen until by administration it would take about a year for them to produce enough new material for a weapon longer to produce the weapon itself one option for advocated by many is to simply reimpose sanctions on for including its activities in and its continued support of terrorism the would say that violates the spirit of the agreement and leadership has already threatened that such action would nullify it it is hard to say which has sounded more confrontational in recent years about north the which has regularly warned of a to any north use of its expanding nuclear or the who spent much of the bush years plotting ways to make the regime collapse but if there is likely to be an early test of reaction to north is probably it the nation has accelerated its nuclear and its arsenal is it could have to weapons during term in his security trump will be hearing the latest estimates for how long it will take the north to build a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the public figure is five years or though some intelligence officials believe it could happen significantly sooner trump has at various times described north young as even while expressing grudging admiration for toughness so the early choice will be should trump confront the north with more missile defenses and perhaps a naval blockade to stop all trade that does not go across the perhaps that is what trump meant when he said that should use our economic power to have them should he reopen negotiations with a nation that has made clear that its nuclear arsenal is perhaps that is what trump was suggesting when he said he was willing to meet one on one with over a hamburger as yet another should he pull back forces in the pacific and let the and the deal with the he suggested just that in a interview with the new saying that if countries did not pay their fair share for he was prepared to tell you will be defending trump made

what are the economic benefits and drawbacks of global who are the winners and losers in this story of economic these are the questions students will consider as they learn why trade became such an important issue in the election as part of the they will also consider the implications of j related campaign promises background global trade was one of the core issues trump returned to over and over during his presidential campaign in the the states that effectively handed trump his election day victory were the rust belt states of and states that were predicted to vote for yet have been by an exodus of manufacturing jobs why has message that politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of moving our our wealth and our factories to and resonated with so many why has he condemned the north free trade agreement the worst trade deal in and declared that entrance into the world trade organization has enabled the greatest jobs theft in the lesson begins by having students investigate where their possessions are then they use a times video and article to help them better understand the complex consequences of increased trade further we offer opportunities for debate and argument analyzing the effects of global trade and doing additional research warm what countries make the products we this activity can be started for homework the night before or completed entirely during using a computer or their students should find out the minimum wage and the per capita of three or more countries that produced the highest number of goods for the class or their small group they should find the same information for the united assuming the is not included in their list already be sure students understand what these economic terms mean after they have gathered this students should consider any trends they notice about the countries that produce most of the goods they and their classmates identified how do wages and economic activity in these countries compare to the same categories for the united all of this information can be recorded using this handout to better understand how global trade works and the consequences of students should watch this times video here are questions for writing and how is the a product of global how has the economy lost some jobs as well as a as manufacturing has moved how does comparing the united largest employers today with those in tell a story about how the economy has changed over the past how does apple fit into this what groups are the winners and losers in the economy according to the why are our economic problems so hard to an article to annotate and more but not for what fuels the backlash on students should read and annotate peter s more but not for what fuels the backlash on here in an excerpt from the so you can quickly assess its reading level and get to the heart of its below are questions for writing and the article libraries full of economics textbooks have rightly promised that global trade expands national wealth by lowering the price of lifting wages and amplifying what went why was global trade such an important issue in the election for many the article administrations in the united led by democrats and republicans have embraced liberalized trade as a central component of the foreign policy yet only percent of voters said trade with other countries created more jobs in the united according to a new news poll released in why is there a disconnect between government trade policy by both democrats and republicans and what voters the consequences of increasing global trade for workers and the economy are complex who are the who are the how are some groups both winners and the article factories produced more goods last year than by many indications yet they did so while employing about million workers roughly the same number as in when production was roughly what it is how can this be that factories are producing more than ever but while employing fewer what is what is the explain how each has affected workers and the economy a an economist at have a public policy toward trade we have a public policy on what point is he and why is it relevant to this what kind of safety net do government programs provide for workers displaced by increased global how does this safety net fall short in the united discussion or argument writing is increasing global trade a force for positive or negative or should the united states pursue more free trade agreements or trade protectionism as the best solution to the negative consequences of after watching the video and reading the students have enough information to support both sides in an debate or piece they can also suggest policy proposals for supporting workers or businesses hurt by the changing economy for is there anything government policy can do to raise wages and working conditions for service workers now that many manufacturing jobs have if you want students to have more information to bolster their here are additional resources from the times and going further the rise of automation changes to the economy brought on by global trade are happening at the same time as an increase in automated manufacturing peter s students can watch the video above about how china is rushing to develop and deploy a wide variety of robots for use in thousands of factories they can read the article robots grow workers struggle to keep does automation present a bigger threat to jobs than foreign should we try to slow down advances in robots and artificial should we think outside the such as with this proposal to give every adult an automatic paycheck a plan known as basic women trying to join the workforce in article a small band of women risk it all for a chance to tells the story of a group of

for the small bank he runs in la sees in the new administration a chance not just for regulatory but for a reordering of priorities away from the wealthy interests of the big cities and toward the rural and communities where he operates customers are very said the president of bank work in the oil fields and they hear they are and they just got tired of it being slammed in their he your editors that they need to run a headline that says street and in the weeks since surprise wall street has been too the stocks of bank of and chase have been soaring to their highest levels in years a rally of such force that it has caught many bank executives and analysts by surprise the for has more than restored all the value in wells share price that was eroded after the scandal over the rampant creation of unauthorized bank accounts erupted in for banks both large and small are benefiting from expectations that the will roll back regulations on just about every aspect of the including the fees banks can whom they can lend to and how much capital they have to hold banks would also benefit from the higher interest rates that are expected if a trump fiscal stimulus program revives inflation higher rates would increase the value of some of the holdings and would widen margins on loans but like nearly all of policy his plan for banking regulation has not been explained in any great detail feelings on perhaps more so than other are difficult to sort out on one he has called for dismantling the financial overhaul that is credited with reining in risk taking but blamed for crimping profits on the he has railed against wall street elites for keeping down will trump justify policies that bolster bank while also delivering on his promises of economic community bankers see themselves in the sweet spot they say trump can limit regulations particularly on banks with less than billion in assets while still being tough on the wall street banks that were the driver of the financial crisis and so much anger among the general public freeing up community banks from the qualified mortgage rule and rigorous laundering for would allow them to spend less time and resources complying with regulation and more on making loans and lifting the fortunes of the rural trump championed in his campaign several community bankers said they also wanted the trump administration to

it focused on figures but as the stock market the big banks began talking about the upside of a trump presidency two days after the said at the conference sponsored by the new times that he believed policies would be unprepared for a trump executives inside the big banks began drawing up lists of regulations or rules that the new administration and the congress might change for their benefit they

in a justice department prosecutor from stopped by to see the united states attorney in at the time the j said he had heard a shocking a federal judge had called a prominent white lawyer disgrace to his for representing black clients sessions according to he in testimony before congress in and others painted an unflattering portrait of who would go on to become a senator from and according to numerous sources close to j transition is a potential nominee for attorney general or secretary of defense testified that sessions had referred to the civil liberties union and the as for to force civil rights down the throats of one prosecutor testified that sessions had called him and joked that he thought that the until i found out they smoked sessions denied calling the lawyer but acknowledged or did not dispute the substance of the other remarks the bitter testimony sank his nomination by president to be a federal district court judge and foreshadowed the questions that sessions could face at another set of senate confirmation hearings if trump nominates him for a cabinet position after nearly years in the now has more allies and would face a clearer road to confirmation than he did as a young judicial nominee and as the first senator to endorse presidential he has a special status as an early supporter who became an important surrogate and close adviser but for trump a sessions nomination to a critical position at the justice or defense department still presents risks trump faced criticism over his derogatory remarks about and his support from racist groups throughout his and for his appointment of a nationalist media executive to a top white house position since his election a sessions nomination raises the possibility that a trump administration will open with racially charged hearings a spokesman for sessions did not respond to a request for comment but on senator a south republican who opposed enthusiastically endorsed sessions for a major job in the trump administration think sessions has earned the right to serve trump in the highest he told reporters as attorney sessions would be responsible for upholding civil rights laws as secretary of he would oversee one of the most ethnically diverse institutions in the percent of the military is or as one of the most conservative members of the sessions has been a reliable voice for strict immigration reduced spending and measures he is generally well liked among colleagues in both and took a political risk endorsing trump shortly after the south primary his views on immigration and trade are aligned with the message that trump conveyed during the race sessions has frequently traveled with trump and was said at one point to be under consideration as the nominee sessions has long considered it a personal triumph that he was elected to the senate and became a member of the judiciary committee after that same panel rejected his nomination to the bench two republicans joined democrats in opposing his nomination one of those senator specter of later said his vote had been a mistake a fact that sessions likes to point out but hearings were unusually both for the era and for the position he was seeking the sessions stretched for hours as justice department officials were called to testify about their views on race sessions said his comment about the was meant as a joke and said it was so preposterous especially since he was in the middle of prosecuting a case involving the group that he thought nobody could take it seriously he was less clear about his remarks about civil rights groups asked whether he ever said the hates white people or was commie group and a pinko sessions said he could not recall specifically saying that am loose with my tongue on and i may have said something similar to that or could be interpreted to he testified he went on to praise the for its work for racial equality in the south he said he never called the group or the but said that they take positions that are considered they hurt they lose credibility and many people do think that some of those positions they take are against the national interests of the united he said he was referring to liberal immigration policies and support for the socialist government in at the justice department lawyers regard officials as partners in the fight for equal rights alone do not guarantee eradicate hate or advance the top civil rights told the group in do people like you do organizations like the the also played a key role in fighting to integrate the military the percentage of in the military now percent has grown steadily since president harry s signed an order in that ended segregation in the armed forces sessions also did not dispute recollection of their conversation about the white lawyer he said he remembered the but not precisely what he said guess i will not disagree with sessions i do not know why i cannot imagine why i would make that an h testified that sessions referred to him as after an argument with a sessions admonished me to careful what you say to white figures testified sessions denied saying that and was adamant that he had never called figures sessions had his including an d have watched this young man since he started practicing law in judge wrote is fair and compassionate for all his fellow in a phone interview on said it was a

the stock turbulent response to the election of j trump first then up presents an interesting was the election result good or bad for right it appears that they have made peace with the prospect of a trump presidency the a index of stocks closed last week percent higher than its level but this is a striking reversal from the initial judgment throughout the stocks rose whenever campaign developments made it less likely that trump would be elected consider the four events that shifted the race most dramatically stocks rose sharply after the first presidential one that most people thought trump lost stocks rose again after the release of the video of sexually explicit boasts when the announced that it was looking into a new cache of electoral stock but stocks fell and when the clarified that there nothing new in these stocks rose on the increased prospect of a trump loss each of these market responses suggests that investors believed that stocks would be worth much less under president trump i documented this pattern in a and also in a research paper in which a and i studied these data more carefully we concluded that the market was acting as if it were pricing in a substantial perhaps as large as percent if this was then a surprise trump win should have led stocks to and fall sharply just how sharply depends how much markets had already priced in the possibility of a trump and our best guess was that it would lead stocks to fall by to percent markets followed that script at least at first as the votes were tallied through the it became clear that trump was on track to win the election by the live forecast gave him a better than percent chance of as did traders in political prediction markets as traders in overnight markets responded and stocks plummeted when the decline in futures hit it triggered the circuit breakers at the mercantile exchange foreign stock indexes were also cratering while markets had yet to fall by as much as we had they appeared to be on their way but then an unexpected second act began the futures market and traders who by now had had some time to digest the reality of a trump presidency reversed course over the next four stock futures recovered around of their earlier losses by the time major markets in the united states opened the next morning for regular stocks were almost back to levels stocks rose again on each of the following two days what explains this some commentators have suggested that markets rallied in response to relatively conventional victory speech his emphasis on infrastructure in might have boosted growth expectations but the speech began just before three hours after the market turnaround the speech was simply a rehashing of previously announced policies a major infrastructure push might be good for but hard to believe that what was said at changed the odds of its implementation the size of the stimulus which would most likely be partly countered by a fed tightening is not large enough to explain a major market movement another possibility is that markets were responding to news that republicans looked likely to hold the house and senate but according to the live that was clearly a sure thing by while the market turnaround occurred hours later others have suggested that the market rallied because the election reduced and markets hate uncertainty but this is a case where our casual intuitions can be misleading the election did resolve one but in a way that increased overall uncertainty the markets went from facing the mere possibility that the riskier candidate would be to the certainty that he would be that risk and uncertainty which typically leads stock prices to fall perhaps markets were responding to some other source of good news about the scoured news feeds from election night for other events that might have moved and find anything when conventional explanations time to look for something more unorthodox thinks what happened is analogous to polling error overnight futures markets are populated by a relatively small number of traders who are attempting to predict how the broader market will respond the next day just as polling errors arise when pollsters survey more democrats or republicans than there are in the broader overnight markets can send faulty signals when they reflect more bears or bulls than the broader market in his the market turnaround really gathered steam when the financial markets opened for regular trading at around and it continued with greater force as more of the traders awoke to discover that trump had won and stocks were cheap a story suggesting that worth listening to the signals from overnight because they get it right on average but it also suggests interpreting signals with greater caution than we because an imperfect of broader market sentiment my own view is that last stock market gyrations reflect a more fundamental market failure call it a failure of imagination investors simply failed to imagine how they might feel when they woke up to trump psychologists have documented what they call a focusing illusion the behavioral economist who studies the psychology of has described it as the idea that in life is as important as you think it while you are thinking about in one classic subjects who were asked whether people would be happier in than the focused on the salient differences the winter weather which led them to conclude that were happier perhaps investors made a similar mistake when comparing life in with life in focusing on salient differences such as the temperament of each while ignoring the raft of other factors that would shape their portfolios perhaps the reality of waking up to a new president broke this narrow leading investors to look beyond their narrow to

trump won the election for a lot of but one of the most troublesome is that particularly young simply show up for in the same numbers as for have never loved and still love trump he got even fewer votes than that was still ultimately more popular than the thing she bet her entire campaign was it just an election that was supposed to see increased voter fewer democrats supported than did in either or and this despite a larger overall population also saw a dip in support relative to past republican nominee mitt but it as have been so surprising lost after one party has controlled the presidency for two consecutive for any candidate of that same party to do anything other than lose having said easy to imagine that had been allowed to run for a third he won again in other not a sickness with the a sickness specific to she desperately needed young people and and has done plenty of work on policies that would benefit those like parental leave and climate but they buy significantly underperformed among while trump held steady relative to past republican nominees that young people defecting to her opponent but simply staying home suggests a lot of sanders supporters bring themselves to vote for her without their candidate on the young progressives have chafed at the notion that they should support a woman others were sufficiently put off by her ties to wall street or her interventionist foreign policy she was cast as too merely the lesser of two and the label stuck it also for her was bigger than that whatever your opinions about the most progressive democratic platform in history was on the ballot with any sanders supporter worth their salt been able to see that if they cared about progressive policy they would have bothered to show election will leave the party with many newly perceived facts to but one seems to be that many young voters and young sanders in actually voting for him because of where he stands on the if they the platform would have mattered they wanted him for reasons the always choose their political for his aura a defined in terms of a masculinity become synonymous with political a perfect candidate and true not as ideologically liberal as sanders or some other folks young democrats might have liked to have seen get the nomination but she does have more progressive policy outlined than sanders or just about anyone in part because she has so much more policy in the current political ability to do the job of government well is not a but a minus that she could have accomplished work in and maybe even worked across the sewing up the liberal legacy of help her it hurt reason to be angry at the way she was selected to be the democratic the way she was insulated from healthy primary the way it was perceived to be her she was in many ways exactly the wrong fit for the spirit of rebellion in right that only underscores that the forces at work this election had less to do with pushing the democrats to the left than with the mentality found footholds in and other parts of the world they had to do with double and the fact even at this late too many people who call themselves liberals still bring themselves to vote for a woman twitter why elected elections
next week looks fully carry on or a particularly lively night in ballroom i be missing that if you think you can stomach join me here next week at the same time i must my jet ski is waiting good bye and then there were nine did you predict the i certainly i mean i predict departure every week but he just seemed as the weeks went on back at the and waltz back in to screams and shock as a lone voice calls out friend and not coming the hat is from next week something to look forward to i fall for it every like a being a ball how on earth is leaving for knocking a couple of quid off a or whatever it was is it no knows we know a nice guy but we know what happens to those types on this show want to hear anymore and the piano arpeggios of expectant doom rise on the the finger it moves and is let off this time or obviously tells too quiet and softens it with a bit of but basically using her enormous hair to dominate her cowers defend his record on independent first maybe really want a loose cannon or perhaps just throwing shade at first before firing the other two into the sun and are sent back to the house and the other three are told to go outside and think about what done is in the taxi of no saying it should have been funny pronunciation and discuss who to next or maybe just and back they come and it be is asked to choose two colleagues to bring back into the boardroom instead talks up his visual flair but put his finger on where things went wrong oh yes he can makes some dreadful quip about the skipper skipping his duties and then goes all serious i think going to actually chop his head off so is no bringing two team mates gone who is if a straight fight between and bet the farm on staying is embarrassed at her worth of sales and says only for the lack of more those two fish may have cost her the game calls it a horrible day in in an attempt to come up with something as iconic as the says the team should have during the day to ask them if like to buy a jet ski jet skis work oh at the sad is furious to be drinking as well he might early is recalled efficiently from his memory while flails telling him a snake in the grass it worked for trump just rigged until someone lets you win thinks the curse of nebula has now been before getting into the boat and presumably watching it sink beneath the waves we are informed that is absolutely killing after rowing someone get her a drink team wins a trip to the rowing club to meet and presumably try not to crack her entire face in twain with the sheer joy of not being a loser
it would be easy to miss the mosque in a temporary building with a concrete floor and corrugated roof but it is impossible to miss the constellation of six loudspeakers atop a giant metal structure resembling the tower five times a starting well before these loudspeakers broadcast the call to prayer in a city of and near international and therein lies one more friction point in a country full of them one expression of faith is noise and government is planning a crackdown a proposal backed by prime minister and initially endorsed this week by his ministers would authorize the government to ban the use of loudspeakers by mosques and other houses of worship across for many on both sides of the sectarian few questions could prove more provocative than whether the muezzin should be muzzled call to prayer is a symbol of said the imam of the one of several that have been controversial here is something existed for he said that he could hear bells from a church in town and that residents drove around the city every couple of months broadcasting from loudspeakers on their vehicles call of every if you get rid of bother he added and yet it does among those bothered is who is and announced last month that the city would broadcast the a central prayer that begins o to counter the call the first of five daily prayers begins before noted col a member of parliament who introduced the new ban goal of the law is to prevent sleep from being he said have no desire to harm the prayer of the the fight over the muezzin underscores a fundamental societal challenge for beyond its conflict with living in or the occupied west bank about percent of citizens are and cities like where about a third of the nearly residents are perennially struggle to find a comfortable balance the conflict has also grown in which is divided between largely and communities the proposed approved on by ministers and sent to has drawn denunciations from and the authority in a sign of the complexity of the it drew surprise opposition on from health who temporarily blocked parliamentary debate and sent the issue back to the ministers because it might also affect the use of sirens to announce the beginning

communities to reduce gaps in educational and economic opportunities see those two conflicting trends yet which basically tells me that the establishment still made up its mind in regard to its he said do we want from the do we want to really integrate it and include it as an integrated part of the text of the proposed ban on mosque loudspeakers says that of thousands of in parts of habitually and daily from loud and unreasonable noise that is caused by the call of muezzin from colonel said it could be narrowed to apply only to sleeping hours has said he is trying to balance competing interests is committed to freedom for all but is also responsible for protecting citizens from he said this week in which traces its history to the days of frustration over the mosques has grown as more residents have moved in since the evacuation of settlements in a decade ago there is already a noise law on the but advocates of the new legislation said it was not applied to the muezzin someone is having a karaoke party with loudspeakers at night and you call the they will come and take down the said a member of the city council if you call about the they under existing the police must test the level of the call to prayer or of any noise to see if it exceeded the limit the new law would simply ban loudspeakers at the call to prayer was broadcast on at and the tension over the loudspeakers was easy to detect in a visit to a clothes and jewelry market a few blocks away several shoppers and salespeople said that they did not mind the call during daylight but that the earliest one invariably woke them up some described trying to muffle the noise with curtains or often to little effect who moved to about five years said the call made it hard for her and her daughter to sleep through the night say they do but not so she said who was selling was more pointed do it intentionally loud in order to bother he said a few feet a group of vendors said the proposal to limit the muezzin was a slap in the face to them they noted that the call to prayer had been sounded in since long before came to power hate for said are people who are against said the authorities should focus

remember how mainstream lies and distortions were going to be corrected by people using social we have mainstream media trying to cope with fake news distributed through social add to the we have fake claims by digital moguls that they can do something positive to stop the dissemination of fake founder mark having initially denied that fake news was now wants us to believe that been working on this problem for a long so it is a problem after for its chiefs seem to think fake news will be strangled to death by removing advertising tools that enable sites to make money by spreading lies but the fake news phenomenon is not only driven by shysters seeking profit some of it is propagandistic was clear during the us presidential and some of it is simply have no right to complain down the years so many of them have played fast and loose with the truth their spin doctors turned lying into an art elections on either side of the confirmed that we be living in a society have elected a lying president in trump have voted to leave the union in a campaign noted for abundant media has been blindsided by the lying phenomenon cynics will surely say that its chiefs are upset by the rise of competing liars who appear to do the job so much better than them so be it but also consider how difficult it is nowadays for journalists who think they are being fair and balanced in a fox news in their impartiality tools just work any longer for during the the views of the overwhelming majority of scientists were in a discussion by the opinion of a spokesman for a fringe body there was no made a similar observation in a new yorker interview in explanation of climate change from a physicist looks exactly the same on your page as the denial of climate change by somebody on the complaint about is in the new media is true and nothing is in as the instance it happens across all real problem with new media is the speed with which falsehoods are spread and the difficulty of providing countervailing corrective have just faced the consequences of this phenomenon last the union at university of passed a stupid motion banning the daily mail and daily express from the campus none of the or so students currently studying journalism at city voted for the motion only one of them appears to have attended the meeting voted against the on a number of people including current and former journalists misread the stories about the vote and began to journalism students for doing something they had not my unequivocal statement about journalism students having had no responsibility for the and similar forthright denials by my the lie proved difficult to picked up on the story days later unaware of the repeated it so denials had to be ceaselessly reiterated a myth had been created and it surprise me if there are still people who believe not the fault of social media blame the but it is a consequence of because lies can be passed on so swiftly and indiscriminately of it is also about human fallibility lies that play to our prejudices are more easily believed and we pass them on exacerbating the problem quoting he said of new capacity to disseminate wild conspiracy to paint the opposition in wildly negative light without any rebuttal that has accelerated in ways that much more sharply the electorate and make it very difficult to have a common and a further irony there is a adage that lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its trousers is usually attributed to but the website quote which substitutes shoes for trousers suggests it was coined many years before got to even a quote about how lies gain currency could be false and we blame social media for can
j through decades in public has been consistent on one core policy that the united states has gotten a raw deal from its major trading partners in the agreements that bind their economies renegotiating those terms will surely be a top priority for his administration but what will that mean in while the broad thrust of thinking on trade is and he has mentioned a few specific policies he would he and his appointees will have wide latitude in how they pursue more favorable trade arrangements for the united states a video released on reiterated a campaign promise to withdraw from the partnership and more vaguely vowed to bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto since election trade experts have been gaming potential scenarios of what trump administration trade policy might look like in detail some of those possibilities would risk only modest disruptions to the world economy and could very well result in better arrangements for companies others would blow up the underpinnings of the modern global endanger trillions of worth of and stand a good chance of prompting a worldwide recession what those possibilities look from the most benign to the most disruptive there really are some elements of the united existing relationships with major trading partners that are dysfunctional and disadvantageous to the united states by taking more aggressive stands on some of a trump administration may be able to get better deals trump has said repeatedly that he wants to renegotiate the north free trade agreement a lot of things can fit under the rubric of and there is room to update the deal in ways that would prove beneficial to the united states the agreement is years after all and there is plenty of room to adjust terms in ways that preserve the deeply intertwined north economy are too many parts of it that are not said an economist on the trump transition at an event in is supposed to be regular annual review between the parties of to see where not working well and to have kind of a constant process of renewal been dropped away and so something that needs to be looked the trump administration could also pick a variety of industries where it believes trade partners have treated the united states unfairly and bring cases before the world trade organization paired with targeted duties to punish what it sees as unfair the approach could win more favorable deals the bush administration did just that with steel tariffs in as did the administration with a percent tax on tires in trade experts are generally skeptical that these efforts prove worthwhile and of the institute for international economics calculated that consumers paid an extra billion for tires in to safeguard a mere jobs per job saved but administration could bring a series of such and as he his team members prove to be made up of smarter negotiators than their perhaps they could get better results even if they the trillion united states economy will most likely be trump has said he will instruct his treasury secretary to declare china a currency manipulator the w bush and administrations do although they also thought that china artificially depressed the value of its currency to the benefit of exporters they calculated that subtle diplomacy would be more likely than confrontation to get results but who maybe that calculation was and a more confrontational approach would have led china to allow its currency to respond to market forces the government has allowed its currency to rise relative to the dollar over the last few putting it roughly in line with economic fundamentals and reducing the urgency of the issue it could still be in the united interest to put in place agreements to make sure this remains the naming china a currency manipulator merely triggers negotiation over what to do about it such negotiation would most likely be and it might result in a better arrangement for the united states or not but either it need to disrupt trade relations that assumes that trump takes a more aggressive stance using existing channels and and wages the battle with the trading partner over specific cases and industries if it will keep lawyers and lobbyists for those industries busy would be but be working within the relevant legal frameworks and using existing institutions as they were intended by congress and the and our trading said a trade lawyer at white case who has been critical of trump will talk about but it change the global macroeconomic ambiguous language in the statutes grants the president broad authority over trade policy trump could be the kind of president willing to use that authority to its fullest rather than focus on targeted duties on individual products as part of a the government could invoke emergency authority to place tariffs on goods from a given country think of the percent tariff on imports that trump at one point threatened during his or perhaps an escalating tariff set to rise until the trade deficit with a given country declines moves along those lines would get but they would also create enormous ripple effects there would surely be legal challenges by the targeted as well as swift and potentially painful retaliation from trade partners china or take these kinds of measures lying down these blunt there would be a lot of said a resident scholar at the enterprise institute would hit poor the hardest in the sense that a regressive tax that makes things like clothing and consumer electronics more and the retaliation would most likely be fierce if china is the it might cancel orders for airliners and buy from airbus instead united states exported billion worth of aircraft to china last or perhaps the would retaliate against endangering the billion in united states soybean exports to china and endangering farms across the prime trump as the in china will surely be aware and with the economic underpinnings of major
how trump could unify a bitterly divided provide jobs to many of the millions of disaffected workers who voted for and lift the stock market and tax rolls all he needs to do is what he presumably does build something and i mean a few miles of asphalt or a paint job on a rusting bridge build something something can be proud of something that will repay the investment many times over for generations to come build the equivalent of the golden gate the the tunnel or the timberline lodge or given passion for the another state park black course the first public golf course to host the prestigious united states open all of these are public works projects that are still in use can anyone name even one infrastructure project from president billion recovery and reinvestment i think so in fairness to republicans in congress bitterly opposed his public works spending and he lamented there were too few projects that stop franklin his public works administration and works progress using combinations of public and private solicited proposals from states and hired millions of workers and eventually built miles of miles of airport playgrounds and military and civilian including more than schools in most cases to high standards of quality and design the federal government built the la national and international the upper locks and the power project on the the f bridge in new and the keys overseas highway most are still in use today to a large this is the infrastructure that made to borrow catchphrase what accomplished said a sociology professor at state university and author of the books solving the economic crisis through civic and extreme but not so much the numbers people remember today people just know there was an alphabet soup of he said they see and remember are the the bay national airport or the baseball stadium in living on that legacy repealing lowering taxes for businesses and mostly wealthy overhauling the immigration system and privatizing what congressional republicans have cited as their top legislative priorities would be divisive in a nation bitterly split along partisan and geographic lines but nearly everyone agrees that has grossly neglected its infrastructure even as the rest of the notably has raced ahead airports are like from a trump said at university during the first presidential debate land at la you land at you land at you land at and you come in from and and you see these incredible you come in from you see these incredible and you land become a who could also called for a big increase in infrastructure spending single best thing the federal government can do to promote economic growth is to repair and build the transportation the railroads and said roger an emeritus professor of economics at and a senior fellow at the institute for economic policy research been neglected for last author of the book roads that built a history of the interstate highway and a white house adviser on transportation issues for president h w navigated the country in a commodore on a mission to investigate the state of infrastructure was trying to see if this was really a crisis or a media he told me this week from where working on the rail project found out pretty dire in terms of total infrastructure for a nation that leads the world in global our systems are trump has pledged trillion over but no one i spoke to thought that was enough doubling that would be more said and campaign proposal was limited to infrastructure projects that could pay for themselves out of user which seems like a shortsighted approach most economists say the best way to finance a big public works particularly given low interest would be for the government to borrow most of the money from investors pulling off something on the scale of the public works programs would be no small feat recent federal infrastructure including reconstruction after hurricanes and as well as the stimulus hardly inspire confidence a professor of history at said he doubted trump could replicate achievements had a coherent if not always a consistent way to address the depression and the economic said was eclectic in his approach because he was even more was surrounded himself with informed and was prepared on day to begin not sure that policies go beyond his electioneering said afraid a new he referring to the public works stand for promises without but in the spirit of give trump the benefit of the as has suggested need his own versions of l interior who ran the and his close adviser harry l who ran the trump will also need to be asked states and cities for but he made nearly all the final decisions himself was a fanatic about said a commissioner in new he helped lay out the parkway he even helped design the picnic so where should president trump for a sense of what might be i asked to pretend he had just been tapped as new infrastructure czar and to come up with a list of his top infrastructure balanced between red and blue states most are or close to it what he along with estimated the northeast corridor desperately needs another rail link connecting and northern new jersey the current overcrowded tunnel is over years old and was severely damaged by hurricane sandy first modern rail project would connect and about miles in under three hours a rebounding needs another link to the privately owned ambassador which

president legacy looked on not long to include a major push against deeply entrenched housing segregation in his administration rolled out a rule requiring local communities to assess their own patterns of racial and income segregation and make genuine plans to address them the move followed years of debate and came as segregated cities like and faced renewed bouts of racial unrest the federal advocates was finally trying to repair a promise of the fair housing act now that rule is likely to be undermined and possibly erased by a department of housing and urban development headed by on j trump officially offered the cabinet post to a neurosurgeon and a former presidential who grew up poor in but has no experience in housing policy while we know little about what would do at the he has played down the role of government in his own story you his mother taught according to his autobiography have only yourself to and he has specifically criticized the housing rule known as furthering fair the rule has been politically contentious its backers argue that it is essential to remedying the long history of government and discrimination that has resulted in segregated neighborhoods persisting to this day critics say that the rule amounts to government overreach into the decisions and demographic makeup of individual communities and a free housing market republicans in congress have tried to its implementation wrote last year that the new policy followed the history of failed and would redirect housing primarily into white communities that oppose it if he is confirmed by would have wide latitude to shape or slow the of the along with broader enforcement of the fair housing act the president of the national low income housing said interpretation of the rule as a social experiment a fundamental misunderstanding of obligations that have been around since the fair housing act passed that year included two one banning discrimination in the housing and the other requiring local communities to the goal of integration the latter language means that not enough to punish landlords or communities who intentionally deny minorities housing communities also have a responsibility to actively ensure open housing which exist today neither in public housing clusters on segregated south side nor in exclusive new city suburbs that use zoning laws to outlaw multifamily housing and jack past republican acknowledged that second implication of the law but for much of the time since the fair housing act was this mandate has been largely ignored by both local communities and itself the administration rules were an effort to address that oversight and some advocates have spent just as long fighting for it recently told fox news that cannot have a strong nation if we have weak inner is the very insight that motivated senator another republican to include a provision in the fair housing act requiring counties and states to further fair as a condition of receiving federal a lawyer with the law firm wrote in an email the administration rule nothing like the partisan caricatures that have sprung up around said of the poverty and race research action council many advocates wanted the rule to be much tougher than what emerged from several years of debate with local communities in the rule provides those communities with detailed data on factors like racial poverty school quality and housing voucher use to help them determine whether and minority families are isolated from good schools or segregated from opportunity the rule requires communities to use that information to draft plans to reduce segregation where it exists those that habitually defy the requirements risk lose funding from the agency the first round of communities scheduled to complete the process have been at work on assessments due over the coming year before a new administration hostile to the idea could begin writing another rule that would reverse this or it could simply halt implementation or congress could pass a law even as it remains on the books for all the years that went into shaping the a new administration could relatively easily set it aside that would also fundamentally change the conversation in about how segregated communities came to exist in their current incarnation and other critics call efforts to dismantle them but these places were created through policies that can themselves be labeled social redlining that denied blacks policies that concentrated public housing in minority government decisions to locate highways that isolated them further while many of these policies were first put into place decades communities remain shaped by them today the mandate was based on the idea that this history of active government intervention requires an active government too a theme of campaign was that structural forces hinder workers in the rust belt and beyond the decline of the lack of educational the opioid at would have ample opportunity to show whether he believes that structural forces undermine poor urban minorities historic troubled and if government should take an active role in pursuing a remedy

reaching a global agreement on climate change took more than years of tortuous negotiations signed just under a year the insufficient but workable agreement at last constructed a legally binding framework for the principle of cutting carbon emissions it was to be the foundation of a sustained ratcheting up of ambition that would hold global warming below last as one by one from east coast to west the united states went republican that progress was wiped trump is the first climate denier to lead of one of the biggest emitters even president w though he surrounded himself with did not publicly disavow climate science he even managed a few helpful moves but trump has pledged to unpick the agreement in where delegates are meeting for the first time since they are putting a brave face on proceedings but they know the outlook is bleaker than it has been since the collapse of the talks in trump cannot instantly extricate the us from the legal technicalities means withdrawal would take four although he may try to speed up the process is just legal stuff his chilling effect on climate negotiations has already begun that is because these talks rely as much if not more on good faith and political will as they do on law and legal process for that only the framework of the pact is legally not each commitments on greenhouse gas and goodwill can go a long the personal charm offensive that president launched on when he made climate change a legacy issue led to the historic joint statement without which the deal could never have been made the prospect of its success drew the presence of almost all major world leaders to for the launch of the talks last sending an unmistakable signal to their negotiating teams even if the us remains technically a signatory for a while all this is lost from inauguration day in a hostile china may cool on its or at least take a tougher as it has done before was already a reluctant participant and the change in the us position is likely only to make its grumbles of are irresistible at this stage as delegates started to gather in the world appeared on the brink of an unprecedented phase of stability the agreement had come into force within a year of its an astonishing achievement after the discord and mistrust that had threatened all the preceding meetings and even the whole climate process but now that huge achievement may be shattered diplomats are working furiously to reassure countries that the departure of the us would not mean the end of the road and the process can it is not only the global talks in the more actions from a like changes to clean energy are on the while president clean power plan to regulate power stations is under grave threat proposed leader of the environmental protection agency is a prominent climate a man once described by a senior w bush aide as a supreme court may put a brake on future legal challenges from environmental groups taken with support for us emissions may soon be back firmly on their upward track and if he really wants to trump could even pull the us out of the framework convention on climate the foundation treaty under which was signed if he the world would lose its global forum for taking fair and effective action on greenhouse gases and adapting to climate may be a step too far even for for the treaty gives the us a seat at the table that pragmatists would rather even if they try to saw the legs delegates in the only source of optimism may be their years of experience in holding the talks together but they cannot do it on their own in the it may all come down to scientifically literate republicans in congress they must be the voice of the of who understand the link between human activity and global warming and want to break change gas elections

for the last four new democrats have had to contend with an in a state senate with slightly more democrats than there are how do the republicans manage to hold a the answer often lies with one rogue senator who votes with the republicans and whose heavily overwhelmingly orthodox district in voted just as overwhelmingly for j trump to the endless has never once caucused with members of his own defecting to the other side of the aisle within days of being elected in this the long electoral migraine did not lift with absentee ballots in two close races on long island still being counted to settle the final senate the democrats would need to win at least one of lure back the independent democratic conference which has teamed up with the republicans to govern the senate for several years and reclaim in order to form a working majority but declined to come revealing on night that he would remain a republican in senate allegiance if not in telling the political television program that he would to have a compelling reason to the republican caucus the mainstream he had fallen short who ran on the republican as well as the conservative and democratic ballot lines for the first time this said the republicans had not promised him anything as the voter rolls have the district which is dominated by and other orthodox residents in the borough and neighborhoods is heavily the better to register influence in city democratic which often determine the outcome of general elections but party affiliation often bows to parochial concerns many of whom send their children to want the state to provide tuition assistance for religious among other and senate republicans have been far more receptive to taking measures that would benefit religious education than the democrats the district went for a by large margins it was also an easy pickup for mitt four years ago allegiance is to their foundational religious practices and not necessarily party said a political consultant who has worked on several races involving orthodox communities democratic leaders have considered trying to oust in a primary battle but his popularity in the district makes him all but immune to challenges said they primary they could say goodbye to any possible rapprochement in the democrats responded on to decision with overt appeals to party unity a given how important going to be to hold the line at the state level against what we expect to be very draconian efforts out of that likely to have a majority of the senate be elected democratic and still not be able to said senator n of who serves as the chief political strategist a spokesman for the said of look forward to continuing to work with him to move this state without the mainstream democrats would need to win the contested long island races and strike a deal with senator d the leader of the independent democrats emerging from election day without much clarity on which party would end up with a numerical both as so often have hastened to pay court to and before ending the suspense about his met with senator the county democrat who leads the mainstream as well as john j the republican senate majority saying as recently as last week that he would join whichever side offered him the he also got a call from gov m a in his efforts to position new as a liberal foil to may have a greater interest than usual in installing a true democratic majority
if you think back to this presidential campaign and recall a lot of articles mentioning email troubles and j various you be wrong if it seems there were fewer articles about the economy and because there were the temptation to blame news organizations for this imbalance is but there is at least some reason to resist it critics have long assailed campaign coverage as focused too much on candidate campaign strategy and assessments of instead of on policies and ideas but this the candidates share the blame i compared the content of campaign ads with the content of news articles about two specific candidate traits or and the economy or jobs both the candidates and news organizations spent more time discussing the fitness for office lack of than they did the economy and the imbalance grew more lopsided as the election approached using analytic tools provided by crimson i categorized the campaign news coverage of media outlets this consisted of four broadcast three cable news national public radio and on the two news and newspapers i specifically searched for news about campaign and her email server or her campaign and and several controversies connected to campaign things like trump the khan family and the i also looked for news about the campaign appeals on the economy and jobs this list but it gives a sense of the between coverage of these controversies and the economy the controversies received more on than their views on the economy from until election percent of the stories mentioned various and percent mentioned email only percent mentioned trump and jobs or the and only percent cited campaign and the economy closer to the from the numbers got even more lopsided this was an important date just after the release of the video and a few weeks before director b letter to congress from this percent of the campaign articles mentioning either controversies or the economy discuss while only percent mention her alongside jobs or the economy as for percent mention his while percent mention him related to jobs and the economy the imbalance in coverage of the character is as is the lack of coverage about the economy compared with the controversies moving one week past the video between and election roughly half of the stories about scandals and the economy mentioned and only a quarter discussed trump and his imbroglios a mere percent of the stories in these last three weeks mentioned and the economy percent mentioned trump and the these choices have consequences according to the reports of what they heard or read about between and were mainly references to her handling of emails during her time as secretary of state in mentions of trump changed week by tracking what was happening on the campaign trail but before anyone blames the news important to examine what the candidates themselves were talking about over the course of the campaign if media reports reflect candidate discourse then it is not merely the media choosing to report on scandals it might be at least as much the choosing to campaign on them that results in unending coverage of traits and characteristics to figure out if this was the i used data from on all the campaign ads aired between and election day i coded all of the appeals in each ad and weighted the appeals by how many times the ads ran on television made more ads than and she vastly running nearly three times as many ads as he did all over half a million ads were run in during this period the content of the ads is revealing both candidates spent most of their television advertising time attacking the other character in the losing ads did little else more than of the appeals in advertisements nearly half of were about characteristics or dispositions only percent of appeals in her ads were about jobs or the economy by percent of appeals focused on the taxes and trade since the start of presidential campaign television advertising in no campaign has made percent of its television ad appeals about any single topic on traits typically garner about percent of the appeals the economy typically generates about percent of the appeals usually much more balance of this was an unusual election with two very unpopular so the flaws may have simply been too big a story for either them or the media to pass up whatever the the criterion of fitness for office dominated the messaging and made up a good share of the trump messaging as and the news media covered it
the expansion of a central pillar of the affordable care faces immense uncertainty next with j trump and top republicans in congress embracing proposals that could leave millions of poorer without health insurance and jeopardize a major element of president legacy but influential figures in surprising quarters of the new administration might balk at a broad rollback of favoring new conditions for access to the government insurance program for the poor but not wholesale cutbacks mike the vice is proud of the expansion he engineered as governor of one of states that expanded eligibility under the affordable care act the program has conservative features that emphasize and require beneficiaries to make monthly contributions to savings accounts earmarked for health care another trump gov of new hails the expansion of in his saying more than half a million people are receiving and better health the federal government pays the full cost for newly eligible beneficiaries from through and at least percent of the costs in later years under the health law it is hard to overstate the importance of which insures million pays for more than half of all births in some covers about of nursing home residents and provides treatment for many people addicted to spending on by the federal government and states exceeds billion a year of the million people who have gained coverage under the affordable care officials million are insured by with few of the problems that have plagued the new insurance or marketplaces but change is coming in his campaign trump said congress must repeal the affordable care act and give each state a lump sum of federal money a block grant for congress passed legislation in to repeal the health law and roll back its expansion vetoed the but speaker d of has vowed to put similar legislation on a republican desk without even waiting for the trump administration is almost certain to give states more leeway to run their programs as they federal and state officials say a number of states have already proposed and work requirements for people on in an effort to protect the administration has limited the use of and has not allowed work requirements but state officials say that such changes are likely to be allowed in some form in a trump administration the director of the department of human said that with the election of she saw real chance for states to take back a bit of control over and other safety net who stepped down in after years as the director of predicted that will be greater receptivity in the new administration to state proposals that were shut down by the the top federal official from to said it was entirely possible that a trump administration would different about the vehicle for a wide range of state innovations and experiments the federal government has broad discretion to approve state demonstration projects if the secretary of health and human services finds they are to assist in promoting the of the program on the administration rejected a waiver request from new which wanted to impose a work requirement and more stringent standards for beneficiaries to show they were united states citizens and residents of the state the requirements undermine efficiency and quality of the administration said new will have a republican governor for the first time in years and could submit similar proposals to the trump administration in the administration approved a waiver allowing to charge premiums to people with incomes above the poverty level a year for a family of but federal officials refused to allow work requirements or a time limit on and they said the state could not charge premiums to people below the poverty level the administration also rejected request for a waiver to charge premiums and suspend coverage for people who failed to pay a policy it said would jeopardize coverage for more than people in where more than people have gained coverage because of the expansion of gov an outspoken republican critic of the health is seeking federal approval for a waiver allowing work premiums and negotiations over a proposed block grant would need to answer difficult how is the amount of the initial federal allotment will this amount be adjusted to reflect population the effect of an economic or increases in the cost of medical care or in consumer prices will it be adjusted to reflect the advent of costly but effective drugs like those to treat hepatitis will states have to continue spending their own money on will beneficiaries still have a legally enforceable right an entitlement to coverage and care if they meet eligibility criteria set by the federal government and block grants have been a favorite of republicans in proposed in various forms by president in congressional republicans in and president w bush in the house unveiled in would give states a choice of a fixed allotment for each beneficiary or a block grant for either states would get less money than they expect to receive under current law under the proposal for a states that had not expanded eligibility as of would not be able to do so the enhanced federal payments that states now receive for newly eligible beneficiaries would be and many states would have difficulty making up the difference under the affordable care the federal government is scheduled to pay percent of costs for newly eligible beneficiaries in under the house republican the federal share would be pared back to its regular levels for percent in percent in and percent in new jersey the budget bill pushed through congress by republicans but vetoed by in would have repealed the expansion of eligibility appearing on on the program of the said house republicans wanted to replace the expansion of with tax credits for people to buy affordable health care
j trump on tempered some of his most extreme campaign dropping his vow to jail expressing doubt about the value of torturing terrorism suspects and pledging to have an open mind about climate change

traditional ethical and political conventions that have long shaped the presidency he said he had no legal obligation to establish boundaries between his business empire and his white conceding that the trump brand certainly a hotter brand than it was he said he would try to figure out a way to insulate himself from his which would be run by his children he defended k his chief against charges of

financial acts committed by the foundation want to hurt the i really he said on the issue of trump suggested he had changed his mind about the value of after talking with n a retired marine corps who headed the united states central command never found it to be trump said he added that found more value in building trust and rewarding cooperation with terrorism me a pack of cigarettes and a couple

last week with the independence party to raise his opposition to offshore wind farms trump has long complained that wind farms would mar the view from his golf course in might have brought it trump then argued he had done so because of policy concerns about wind farms rather than any personal interest trump rejected the idea that he was bound by federal laws from installing his in a white house

in the to the presidential new city was hardly trump territory and every time put another display of trump campaign signs up on the lawn of his sizable white house on road in last they were stolen or knocked actions that would later set off a series of events as unpredictable as the election itself infuriated by the as well as an obscenity about j trump that had been on the public mailbox in front of his installed a security camera it captured a grainy image of a and a real estate then printed fliers bearing the image and a reward offer for information leading to the arrest of the sign thief he hired some local teenagers to post the signs around the neighborhood with tape when the tape ran he the teenagers used a stapler to post the fliers to trees on the streets the hubbub made the and the stapling method was mentioned in the weeks that a team of enforcement officers from the parks department arrived at he and issued him summonses with fines totaling and citing unauthorized posting and tree to trees to his real transgression was supporting a which he claims annoyed democratic city officials call it said who calls himself a a proud gun owner and a fan of and john a supporter of democratic would never have been cited in this he and said that official parks department signs are often affixed to trees with similar staples in new city like he said wanted to teach me a lesson about being and about who i believe in so they found something to hang their hat said he paid the summonses because want the of fighting nor the expense of hiring a lawyer instead of backing he splurged on a larger trump banner to hang in front of his and he called the prominent civil rights lawyer to see if he had any grounds to sue the city for damages claiming political bias in an said that he thought the summons was wild by the but that a suit by claiming enforcement based on his trump leanings would be difficult case to a parks department spokesman dismissed the claim that the summonses were political and called them a routine penalty for damage to the trees fine had nothing to do with the content of the signs posted and everything to do with the fact that staples can damage and even kill the said in a statement he added that the fine was determined by the administrative court and based on the amount of damage or the cost but rather on the rule the order to cite set off something of a parallel episode within the parks department an enforcement supervisor ordered a sergeant to write the tickets but the arguing that it was improper to write summonses weeks after the signs had been with no witnesses to the violations were bogus said sergeant a veteran with years on the job might as well hit every dog owner who puts up a he said he also consulted a superior he told out of it too a rookie officer wound up writing the said sergeant who has had previous with the agency as an outspoken member of his local of the characterized department officials as using the officers as for their political in this case sergeant said he was included in an email conversation about possibly forcing to pay in damage for the staple a proposition that an agency lawyer replied to in the email chain as for victory is a bit of revenge last he bought and hung a larger banner told you the banner reads trump trump
the presidential election has been an exhausting and bruising spectacle now imagine living through it all as a this election has managed to cram all the sentiments of the last years into the span of and then morph them into one ugly trump is largely to blame he called for total and complete shutdown of entering the country until it became clear that the proposal was embarrassingly only to be replaced by the equally vague he fought publicly with the gold star khan suggesting khan was not to at the democratic convention because of her faith he accused as a group of harboring terrorists but we all know the story by woman was set on fire in new now just going out requires courage read has insulted and defamed many different groups along the but what we may not realize is how different when it comes to over the course of the trump has very publicly reached out to and voters to ask for their support we can question his but the gestures are there he even briefly tempered his tone regarding during a quickly arranged visit to president in city last august his daughter and wife have defended him for his unforgivable behavior toward and also recorded an official campaign television advertisement openly courting women voters for her father trump denies the charge he mocked a disabled and despite a bevy of antisemitic incidents involving trump and his supporters over the past he has also directly sought support such is his style of he may insult but he still wants your vote not so with the a tiny handful of be trump but that diminish the fact while attempting to engage every other campaign has made essentially zero public outreach to the electorate as if citizens already exist in irony is that willful blindness to voters may lead to his defeat may only account for a small part of the but a concerted push by during this season has meant that there are now over a million registered more than double the number in and tend to live in key battleground states such as and but may not be able to count on all of those votes either many have long been uncomfortable with her hawkish foreign policy record and her superficially inclusive rhetoric need to be part of our eyes and ears on our is a standard and with it we hear the suggestion that our communities live on some kind of of warfare this is so not the front line of maybe most are folk also seems to see as separate from her idea of need to be part of and to believe that as a carry some insider knowledge about evildoers that we may or may be willing to trade in exchange for equal treatment in the united states this is offensive to our and must be afforded the same rights and protections as everyone else without precondition but what this campaign has really shown is how contested and precarious the place is for today that change after regardless of who wins even with a trump and his which is how he refers to his will not simply vanish and the suggestion that trump is merely using the election as a platform from which to start a new media empire is hardly as if there has never been a connection between mass media and politics so how prepared are as a to deal with after we learned all the wrong lessons from read any good news to come out of this that the country now recognizes the potent political force that is and are beginning to understand that fighting bigotry is not fundamentally about protecting but about preserving the vision of a pluralistic and democratic society now we must be prepared to do the work necessary to hold our leaders to that standard every and not just once every four elections
face this year our options in the voting booth are historically terrible poll after poll after poll has told the same the majority of some six in by most view both trump and negatively movie was a real waste of more my daughter goes out with him she may not come home way to say that most people either despise or fear both major party which befuddles both presidential contenders and their insular entourages but not the rest of us why this year millions of voters are exploring casting their ballot for and even party candidates but is a year marked by terrible electoral options all around could a third party with actual power be trump next political read desire for another option was evidenced in the early of libertarian candidate who was hovering in the to range in national polls before the political conventions this summer that was before people even knew who he so many voters were elated to find out there was someone on their ballots who trump or put down his marijuana pipe and started to introduce himself to voters he promptly became the butt of every jokes for blanking on the devastated city then he failed to name a single world leader when lobbed a softball question in a town hall now when you type in his name on snaps at pops up no wonder his poll numbers have steadily declined since hit the green party candidate stein an alternative to the alternative will have trouble sleeping at night if trump is stein said earlier this cycle at a town hall will also have trouble sleeping at night if is elected and as despicable as words i find actions and track record is very a cursory look at platform reveals living in an alternative universe from most voters while most voters fear the growth of calling for cutting military spending by along with closing more than us military bases abroad this may be why her bid keeps her hovering at around the mark in national and other voters will see on their ballots the former operative and republican congressional staffer is taking advantage of repugnance to many and is angling to win just one state in order to have his name thrust before the electoral college makes sense for many voters who say their faith prohibits them from supporting either trump or but barring deep religious in other states the notion of casting a protest vote is just too dangerous in this grand party is having a grand food fight for all to see the tea party wing of the party has morphed into a populist movement that trusts conspiracy theories more than facts and data and trump himself has even lashed out at the house and other congressional republicans in recent in a sign of the times for the abandoned trump last month only to cast his vote for him this week that kind of even leadership from the republican party that led to the rise of the misogynistic and racist trump republican leaders have stoked fear in their base since president was elected and now they have lost control of their own narrative and why this the year to mess with a vote since no candidate is going to all those votes might do is prevent a putting the meltdown front and center in global governance do settle for the lesser of two evils in this election vote for the green party stein and read you were a progressive sanders supporter who cares about the soaring be voting against your interests to vote third or fourth party this because that protest vote is just giving trump an opening to transform the nation in his glitzy yet vacuous image a top trump official even reportedly admitted that the campaign is banking on voter suppression efforts to help keep out of the white house let them suppress your vote or ideals on election though the founders avoided setting up a partisan government in the we quickly grew into a system we should have a national after this election about changing that but not until on election crucial to vote your principles within the system we currently elections
the election has resurrected the fiasco of how to fix and mac shares of the two mortgage agencies have rocketed over the last two weeks on hopes that the trump administration might end government oversight big political roadblocks though and which buy or guarantee home needed billion of taxpayer aid in the financial crisis and were placed under government debates about whether to reduce their role went nowhere because they play a large role in the mortgage market allowing them to shake off their government training wheels is a long way off even representative a republican and the house financial services committee reckons his plan to do so is a long shot worries about hurting the housing and in turn angering are strong enough that some republican lawmakers would probably join their democratic rivals in opposing any such attempt there is one relatively easy that could please most allowing and to keep their earnings since they have been forced to hand over all profit as dividends to the treasury so they have sent none of which counts toward repaying the bailout that would allow them to rebuild their capital they currently have just million each set aside against a total of trillion of loans on their and that is scheduled to fall to zero in that raises the embarrassing prospect of one or both of them having to go cap in hand to uncle for another bailout in even a mild housing downturn avoiding that ought to appeal to lawmakers a john and other hedge fund managers who bought and stock after the crash have been pushing for this for some too including in the courts j ascendancy to the white house has emboldened not least because a former partner who is a leading candidate to become treasury was a with in the mortgage lender it after its collapse and selling it last year to cit ending and status as an for the government would still leave their bailout unpaid and their future status unresolved but it would be a smart first step
there has yet to be a more impudent introduction at an awards ceremony than majestic effort for one former couple at the to present the award are and the host attention sure pissed about something primarily about that to see and stony faces as they made their way on to the present where pick for the us presidential election is being treated vastly more reverentially my theory is that coming out for green party candidate stein is definitely the most coveted celebrity endorsement since vote leave managed to get to come out for remain looking that was the i am amused by a headline in endorsement of stein only helps only helps i obviously the major endorsement would want would be for to come out for trump but in the absence of that big is certainly not to be sniffed in elections
mark has said will do more to tackle fake news while continuing to argue that the spread of hoax stories on the social network did not affect the result of the us a post on his profile late on said hoped to announce new measures to tackle fake stories he all the content on more than of what people see is authentic only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes the hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan or even to politics this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the we want any hoaxes on our goal is to show people the content they will find most and people want accurate news we have already launched work enabling our community to flag hoaxes and fake and there is more we can do here we have made and we will continue to work on this to improve fake news problem is not commentators and even outgoing president have raised concerns about its role in spreading false information during the election stories such as a report just days before the election that an agent investigating use of a private email server had killed himself were deliberately designed to tap into debate around the key tailors the its users see to what they and their friends have previously liked and especially partisan stories aimed at supporters of either candidate in the election could spread rapidly and in some cases earn significant amount of advertising revenue for their end of the election has not stopped the spread of false stories the day after trump was declared the false claims that president was planning to give a began circulating on the was already growing on to address its powerful role in shaping the information people consume after it removed images of a girl hit by napalm during the which it said breached its rules on nudity the decision was later but not before a post of the image by the prime minister was taken post goes further in acknowledging the problem than his comments at a conference near last during which he said suggestions the election was influenced by fake news were it also outlines some of the concerns says are behind its cautious approach to becoming more involved in policing content he is an area where i believe we must proceed very carefully though identifying the is complicated while some hoaxes can be completely a greater amount of including from mainstream often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual i am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most but i believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth elections
over the past president v of has received two starkly different messages about hacking into computer networks from the current and future presidents of the united you and not even sure it was you the white house confirmed in a statement on that eight days before the presidential the united states the government directly regarding malicious that was state it sent the message over a rarely used a connecting the nuclear risk reduction centers in both which they had agreed three years ago could also be employed to deal with major the warning only the latest after verbal cautions by president his defense secretary and the director of national intelligence was reported by the post the warnings to against further hacking into polling or registration or any further effort to affect the outcome of the are being hailed by the administration as a success in deterrence after they a year and a half of hacking activity seemed to or and there is no evidence that voting or counting of ballots was disrupted on election day but more than a few experts in deterring take a more skeptical view they say the had already achieved their main to demonstrate how they could disrupt the electoral process with the leak of hacked including from the democratic national committee and campaign john d suffered nothing worse than a they note no no counter no embarrassing revelations engineered by the united states and he now has the satisfaction of dealing with j who during the campaign praised promised to build a more productive relationship with and maintained there was no evidence that the were behind the hacking anything wrong happens they like blame the trump said in an debate with know if the doing the hacking maybe there is no trump contended that the allegations of activity were intended to for advocating a new relationship with he frequently repeated similar sentiments in the last weeks of the suggesting the hacking was a fabrication the leaks of emails worked largely to his embarrassing democratic leaders like representative of who was forced to resign as the chairwoman of the democratic national committee larger strategic message is that the united states and need to cooperate on a range of issues but for now the situation underscores the uncertainty around the world about the direction of foreign policy and gives the opportunity to exploit differences between the current president and his successor until trump is inaugurated on it is also raising the question of whether the white house pushed back hard enough when intelligence agencies concluded on that officials could have authorized these a a computer expert at the center for strategic and international studies in dismissed the claim that it had deterred hacking seems a little bold to claim this is a success for since the deterred from doing he said hacking work was mostly complete the issue now is whether they will be deterred in the and the guessing is they will not strong private warnings enough to constitute in the appear to have paid less of a price for their hacking around the election than north did for its attack on pictures entertainment in that attack melted down about percent of computers and servers at its wreaking considerable and embarrassed many executives it was in response to the release of a that imagined a plot to kill the north leader after the the united states issued more sanctions against north and encouraged china to limit the all of which runs through switching centers many experts had expected the white house to follow a similar path with the white house concluded that the and the unstated suggestion that the united states had the power to reach inside networks and see the origin of might suffice it is not clear if the administration plans any other actions against before departure from but that seems less and less likely the warning did not deal with the hacking of the democratic national committee or which r clapper the director of national had previously said was conducted with the knowledge of the leadership it referred only to the concerns about hacking around the election process and the fear it was originating from though it stopped short of saying it was a attack
barring some unexpected none of the refugees held in detention camps on the pacific islands of and are likely to be resettled in the united states before j trump takes and officials said this week the election of whose harsh talk about immigration and was central to his leaves in doubt the deal the two countries recently struck to move some of the hundreds of people who were banished to the camps by after being intercepted at sea trying to reach its shores many of the detainees are the issue is a contentious and emotional one in whose government has pledged never to accept a migrant who tries to come to the country by boat the stated purpose of the pacific in which such people are housed indefinitely on offshore is to discourage human who often pack migrants into rickety boats for the some of which have ended in mass drownings but conditions on those islands are dire on a united nations envoy visiting said that daily life for detainees on was inhumane and degrading human rights groups have reached similar conclusions about conditions on both islands the government said that it had reached a agreement in which the united states would take in hundreds of the detainees but just days after the announcement of the an secretary of the immigration told an senate panel that it seemed unlikely that any detainees would be resettled by inauguration day in the united states on in a written response to the united states state department said that the screening process to determine whether refugees were eligible to enter the united states was taking as long as to months to complete safety and security of the people is our top the state department said it said refugees were subject to the highest level of security checks of any category of traveler to the united involving the department of homeland the national center and the trump has not commented on the deal as a presidential he called for a temporary ban on all though his campaign later said that the ban would apply only to migrants from one of his mark executive director of the center for immigration which favors more restrictive immigration was quoted in news reports as saying that the deal was likely to be on once trump took office the united nations said on that conditions for detainees on were grim health issues are with stress anxiety and depression being among the most common said at a news conference in the describing what he found on a recent visit to refugees and asylum seekers are on a constant diet of sleeping tablets and children suffered from nightmares and he said said policy was punitive sends a message to the people he said to me this is not a justification to mandatory detention is a violation of human rights the united nations has endorsed the plan to send about detainees to the united states the camps were opened in island is holding men about women and mostly in family are held on and would be given the first option to resettle in the united states under the new agreement about others in seeking some medical treatment must return to or island before applying to go to the united states only those who have been granted refugee status by the united nations will be eligible to go to the united the government has said prime minister of and the state department have said the deal would not affect the total number of refugees accepted by the united states each year said the deal was the result of months of but he offered little reassurance that it would be honored under trump deal with one administration at a said similar concerns were raised during the hearing on one asked the immigration whether the government was sure that the deal would be given negative statements about refugees and about percent of the detainees are from while others are from and have an agreement struck between the two governments should other contingencies or other eventualities that is a matter that the government will have to deal with at that said
senator chuck of new planning on being leader of the senate minority and by extension the democratic opposition as the trump era dawns in the capital i regret what said who was hoping to be president right hand as senate majority leader before both he and came up short of their election day goals moments at do i think what could have i am fully occupied with the job at said in an interview in his senate office on just a few days after being formally chosen by his colleagues to succeed his senator harry of as leader of the senate democrats that in is to serve as the bulwark against a unified republican government led by his former campaign j to use the power of the senate minority to try to force compromise when and to stand in the way of republicans when necessary are the said noting that the rules of the senate at least as they currently exist give democrats there much more power than their house counterparts to hold the line against republican policies they oppose he is going to agree on issues like trade and transportation infrastructure in a very real way with we have an obligation to pursue said about who quickly reached out to by phone after his presidential victory at the same we have an obligation to oppose him on all the places where he tramples on our travels with racism or just dismantles things because the right wing tells him to do so that is where we are it is a delicate balance and talk of cutting deals with trump and senator the republican and majority has already alarmed some democrats who want no cooperation whatsoever with trump or the senate republicans who sat on president supreme court nomination of b garland would be a dereliction of our responsibility if we said who munched casually on a frozen three musketeers bar as he laid out his vision long as we sell we have an obligation to the millions of who are those are at the center of emerging strategy he believes that trump won by appealing to the middle of with what was essentially a democratic economic message on trade and job creation he is convinced he can leverage that with the new president are president you have two work with us and you will have to alienate your republican or break your promises to he said believe that voted for trump mainly because of democratic issues like not for republican issues like tax cuts for the that any legislation that can entice democrats will have to be substantial and not be used to chip away at other or they will not hesitate to oppose it for he noted that he had quickly issued a statement skeptical of the nomination of senator the republican and occasional senate gym workout for attorney and would be giving all nominees thorough scrutiny and he said some issues were simply such as reversing wall street and banking reforms enacted after the economic collapse it comes to repealing any of as they say in said the who also said democrats would not cooperate in any way with overturning the affordable care act democrats did pick up two seats with wins in and new narrowing the republican majority and making it that much more difficult for to round up the votes needed to overcome or perhaps even muster a simple majority though we get the those two votes will be invaluable in stopping republicans from doing bad said does not believe republicans will be eager to eliminate the ability to mount filibusters against preserving a chief minority weapon he hopes that any supreme court nominee can win bipartisan but if republicans threaten to eliminate the ability to filibuster he has an argument ready said to you come before this with clean hands because of what you did with who even get a hearing and who was clearly a mainstream said after an increasingly strained relationship between and believes he can negotiate with the top republican wants to make things work and i want to make things he said we will certainly both stand for our principles and each side will respect the we can get a lot more done than has been done in the but it will definitely be a challenge and it was not the one had hoped to face
victory in the us presidential election was expected to spook investors after a campaign defined by protectionist rhetoric yet on the second day after his election wall street investors were in a bullish with the industrial average hitting a record high the rose as much as points to reach by in new while the other two main us stock market the and also at financial betting firm morning trump was toxic yet now he is the biggest the market has seen in the days before the share indexes rose when it looked like was winning and fell at a hint that trump could catch her on the day before the the had its best day for eight months after the cleared over her private email server and on markets duly plunged in early trading as and investors responded to the shock by the time wall street opened for business trump had made a conciliatory acceptance speech in which he promised to heal divisions and work with other countries after a volatile opening as investors tried to make sense of the rose on the rose partly on relief at tone and the lack of references to erecting trade barriers or a wall across the border trump also rowed back on threats to sack who chairs the federal reserve central then looked for opportunities if trump was going to be more sensible than his campaign pronouncements then what about his trump has pledged to cut corporation a move all businesses would like he has promised to cut back regulation and scrap climate change including abandoning the agreement to reduce emissions oil and gas shares duly that the republicans could ease rules on including scrapping the regulations introduced after the financial crisis to curb risky sent bank shares soaring in his victory trump talked about putting to work to overhaul the creaking infrastructure these promises sent shares of mining and construction companies companies also rose both trump and talked about reining in charges for treatments but was more aggressive and specific tom an analyst at financial advisers said a trump presidency had created opportunities for investors but that they should prepare for a bumpy plans could well increase overall demand in the boost growth and corporate earnings in the near term but result in inflation further down the line a typical boom and bust scenario may elections
be clear about second referendums there are ones and ones a bad one is a desperate attempt by the government of the day and its allies to negate a first referendum it did not like this was by and it which is why the now supported by tony likes the idea such a referendum was at least better than in where a vote against the treaty was simply ignored by the established with consequences that may yet prove good second referendum is quite different it seeks approval for whatever deal is reached as a result of the first one it seeks to take forward the first not negate fury in some quarters that greeted the vote on last swiftly morphed into a demand that voters be immediately as if they would then repent the error of their ways it was the arrogance of the old politics on laughably led by certain members of the house of lords it showed how thin is respect for democracy on the left in comes a different question the referendum said yes to the the and may rightly accepted that as they said they would the divorce would proceed without hope of divorce is a clumsy metaphor countries do not marry and divorce they become more or less hence the shorthand of and there is a world of difference between these two outcomes so much so that pundits vie with each other in claiming the impossibility of world must go on at some point some sort of however will have to be done between and the there is no such thing as a wall in the channel certainly the may government could fail in its negotiation it could seek a general election mandate that could trump the referendum but that is not a second when tempers have a deal will be reached that removes the from the institutions of the but trade and population movement the likelihood is that such a deal would anger the more than the but either way it would be controversial as it would best be authenticated by a second would not be an attempt to reverse the first merely to validate its outcome it would be a second
barely a few hundred yards inside jittery eastern border with a high school teacher asked students in his social studies class this week to address a topic of paramount importance for their the election of j trump as the next president of the united states surprising victory has sent shock waves around the but the possible consequences are particularly acute here in the a region long seen as a potential flash point because of its linguistic and cultural proximity to world war iii we will be the first to know about said one of the students in the class in keeping with school gave only his first odd though it may in view of the threat that a newly aggressive may he and many other students in this town welcomed victory they the billionaire wanted to cut a deal with and calm tensions another student in the described the democratic as a menace because she war with wants friendship in a we would be just in the such widespread in communities in the and contrast starkly with the even at triumph among an political and foreign policy elite in the where v is viewed as a threat who must be not appeased during the trump raised alarms in capitals by calling and questioning why the united states should defend alliance members that fail to shoulder their share of the costs but president has said that trump assured him during their oval office meeting last week that he remained committed to the security guarantees that have underpinned system of collective defense and peace in since but the states remain on trump demonstrated a mercurial streak during the and they are the most at risk if he should change his mind again and decide to back away from adding to their politicians just scored gains in elections in and yet the reaction to victory in and neighboring which also has a large is a reflection of their tangled cultural and political situation even as political leaders in and the are in many ethnic see a silver hoping that a trump presidency can improve relations with the teacher of the class in said that around a third of his students were of a third and a third from mixed but that they defied easy labels all speak which is used in and the dominant language in not all of his students cheered and including one with a said they worried that he might encourage trouble by trying to appease asked what they wanted from trump now that he had been elected leader of the free one student said he must his emotions another said he make great while the class joker advised that trump his to be taken seriously who teaches in and stayed up late on election night to follow the said he never liked much but added that she at least a much clearer and you what to more or by said so many different nobody knows what he really wants to adding to the uncertainty and

senate majority and others who might help influence trump abhor unpredictability and said a former defense minister and foreign minister are a small country and like a lot of adding conditions to as trump has proposed mean a total and profound change in the he added that he doubted that this would as is quite likely that a number of foreign policy proposals will significantly change once he takes

long demanded that get out of will be crimped not only by strong bipartisan support for the military alliance in but also by the fact that his negotiating hand has been weakened by a string of

rogers declined to comment the effort to force out admiral which was first reported by the puts trump in the position of considering whether to as the man who would brief him on intelligence matters each a admiral whom the white house is considering relieving of his posts it also raises the question of why would consider firing one of the top intelligence officers in the last days of his administration admiral replacement would not be confirmed until after trump takes over one senior intelligence official argued that letting word of the effort leak seemed more about politics or vengeance than about effecting any real change representative of the chairman of the house intelligence committee and a member of transition strongly defended admiral rogers in a letter to carter and asked them to testify before his committee to explain why they want to push rogers out not by accident that admiral rogers meets with the and two days later this which is completely built on said in a short interview carter and clapper had submitted a formal recommendation to the white house to split the which conducts foreign surveillance and secures military from the command but there are questions inside the giant complex at fort where the and command are about whether the military is ready to survive on its own it relies heavily on the talent of the which dates back to the early who has begun filling the top echelons of his national security team with met with admiral rogers on at trump tower in new senior defense department and intelligence officials were surprised that admiral while on personal had paid a visit to trump first major disagreement with admiral rogers dates to the fall of when he expressed mounting frustration that which is responsible for offensive action

slowly for the pentagon and carter went to fort several weeks ago to give admiral rogers and his team kick in the one official said top national security officials had also come to see admiral rogers as lacking leadership at a moment of wrenching change for the he took command after the disclosures of widespread surveillance by j the former and the efforts he directed to seal up the agency proved they said that perception was underlined by the disclosure in that the had secretly arrested a former t martin and was investigating whether he had stolen and disclosed highly classified computer code developed by the agency to hack into the networks of foreign governments martin was charged with theft of government property and the unauthorized removal or retention of classified documents administration officials had planned to relieve admiral rogers of his duties after the election and announce a plan to create separate chains of command for the and command but the supported by carter and stalled in part because of opposition from senator john republican of who heads the armed services committee under the command would remain under the armed services but oversight of the would shift to the senate intelligence committee victory complicated the planning on one major trump and admiral rogers disagree quite publicly while trump has insisted that no one knows whether was responsible for the hacking of email accounts of the democratic national committee and a range of prominent formal admiral rogers has said he has no doubt he recently said that was not something that was done this was not something that was done by this was not a target that was selected purely he was a conscious effort by a to attempt to achieve a specific coming into the admiral rogers said one of his top goals was to make sure that on the united states had consequences for the attackers in he proposed a series of possible options to respond to the which intelligence in a public said the

in naming k to a senior white house j trump has elevated the nationalist movement that has nurtured for years from the fringes of politics to its very a remarkable shift that has further intensified concern about the new direction the provocative news and opinion website that has repeatedly published articles linking migrants to the spread of disease its authors have criticized politicians who do not support a religious test for immigrants to screen out potential and it has promoted stories that tried to tie a top aide to who is to militants in an rejected what he called the tendencies of some in the movement his interest in populism and he has to do with curbing what he sees as the corrosive effects of and he believes his enemies are misstating his views and those of many trump followers people are he said love their country they just want their country taken care he not that some people on the as in any bad guys but some of own statements and behavior have drawn the condemnation of faith leaders and which reacted to his appointment with alarm on groups pointed to allegations from that he had made comments about the students at his school critics have resurfaced other episodes from his including a interview in which he mocked liberals who criticize conservative women as bunch of that came from the seven sisters ascent has quickly become the focus of those who broadly condemned the choice as if not on but it was also a victory of dimensions for a man who is relatively new to the inner circle when joined sputtering presidential campaign in he insisted to his friends that even if trump he could at least mitigate any damage to the nationalist which he helped fuel as the head of that nationalist movement which has promoted and enabled and racist sentiments will now have a champion at side in the west wing the place that will occupy in the new as senior counselor and chief also elevates to one of the most powerful roles in government someone whose mission in politics has been to tear down not run them his appointment was intended to be a reassuring signal to the vocal and restive members of base who are suspicious of power and anyone who holds it trump is their but is their check against the establishment and any efforts it makes to soften the new resolve does not come out of the usual political or ideological backgrounds that have shaped the republican party in recent decades he is not a religious conservative who is focused on social issues he is not a traditional economic conservative what especially motivates his friends and colleagues is a sense that the cultural and political elite are contemptuous of ordinary that endeared him to who never felt he received the respect he deserved for building such a large political movement that of the as has explains why most of the media and political class missed the rise of trump disgust with the politics of the mainstream republican party burns just as hot if not hotter his animus toward liberals he sees republicans as the of and has scorned them for denigrating trump supporters as the the and peasants with the he is close to and at one point he urged her to take up the kind of republican versus republican battle he a primary campaign against senator john her running mate he was behind some of the trump most inflammatory like inviting several women who had accused bill of sexual advances to sit in family box during a debate he had never worked on a national campaign until signing on with and has had eclectic taste in careers he served as a navy officer and went into banking for he also helped run biosphere the domed ecosystem in where people lived without contact with the outside world like many leaders of the emerging he became engaged in politics with the rise of the tea party early in president first term he felt that the bailout of the banking system was an egregious misuse of taxpayer dollars that did almost nothing to help ordinary his reason was his a former telephone company had to sell off stock in his retirement account to make ends meet has told people in inner circle that the new administration will have a short window of time to push its agenda through and should focus first on the priorities that are expected to be the most contentious ever hungry for political is expected to be an unrelenting advocate for many of most aggressive plans on immigration that involves stopping the immigration of deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal records and devoting more resources to securing the border who grew up in a neighborhood in earned degrees from and he often compares political rise to that of the military general and populist hero who took on the political and social elite of his day as the seventh president of the united states while trump became the leader of the movement of disaffected who feel lost and disenfranchised in a nation undergoing rapid cultural and demographic has been a student of global populist carefully tracking the rise of the national front in under marine pen and the remarkable victory of the independence party in vote this year to leave the union saw and was a thought leader and a visionary about the issues and the movement that trump eventually caught on to and said the chief executive of like a field very much sees the fight for the soul of this country as a will take his

concludes in response to the crisis that lies behind and what we need is new story of what it is to be a human in the deep story beneath what we actually need is a revolution in our institutions of order to solve the grave global problems we face climate population extinction of inequality and the rest we need governments to act appropriately but governments are unlikely to be much more enlightened than electorates hence we require the public to have a good understanding of what our problems and what we need to do about them that in turn requires that universities are devoted to intelligent public education about our problems and how to solve them at present devoted primarily to the pursuit of fail disastrously to do what is i have spelled out in detail in my from knowledge to wisdom we urgently need to bring about a revolution in academic inquiry so that the basic intellectual aim becomes social wisdom and not just knowledge problems of living need to be put at the heart of the academic the relationship between and the relationship between the university as a whole and all need to change in quite specific and radical ways a new paradigm for academic inquiry is required the outcome would be a kind of inquiry rationally designed and devoted to helping humanity tackle problems of climate change and other global problems intelligently and we had had the kind of institutions of learning that we really need during the past to the election of trump would have been says that tony bill did not possess a narrative of his own with which to combat and preferred merely to triangulate among other narratives yet repeatedly articulated a narrative in contesting both and clause iv socialism this was that people do not thrive as but when they are part of a strong society where people take care of each other and seek the common good he embraced individual meritocratic competition and strong desire for their own families to be successful and but only as part of a society where people could rely on the basics that every person needs if they are to reach their may believe that and his colleagues made misjudgments well as many good about how best to translate this narrative into and about the dubious compromises they made along the way we may agree with scarred by the many dreadful years in the wilderness when failed to attract a progressive they were too timid as time passed about championing explicitly the strong and elements of their for fear of frightening the horses but the reason they won three elections and achieved so many advances for our society is that they conveyed an underlying narrative which combined the merits of a strong commitment to the common good and the efforts and aspirations of families and no narrative that departs too far from that synthesis is likely to attract a progressive coalition in article has reset my political compass with its insight and clarity as well as leaving us all in suspense with the promise of more to come after reading it i went straight to the impressively upgraded central library to take out a copy of the constitution of liberty by the book that instigated the article they had many of books but not that particular one my request to the purchasing officer for the library to acquire a copy was met with a but the book would be in paperback only and there would be a booking fee for a second i wondered how would view this but then thought it would be more enlightening if it went under the belief in the constitution of liberty did not stay with her to the end speaking in the house of commons just after her death in frank field mp reported that she had told cut taxes and i thought we would get a giving society and we repeated demonstrations of its failure to give a fig about

their both the traditional working class and the middle class are losing out romantics miss the the middle class is being wiped out but more complicated than just and heat of the technological that spoke about in has had deep structural ramifications for effects that have been profoundly misunderstood the first is that technology itself has fragmented both society and the economy the buzzword over the key decades was which was to replace the factory system of the second industrial revolution this not only led to the increasing dominance of the service sector and as argued recently by j by in in the work of nations explained how society would be increasingly divided between who would get all the good jobs in the oligopolistic financial and and the huge of others who would increasingly

must remember the richness immigrants have voting for live in a tiny rural town in the daughter of immigrants who overstayed visas back when it took just a few months to get a green worked hard to feel like i belong anywhere i found my way to as a young adult and no other place feels like home i am voting for although my preference would have been sanders approach seems to be informed by her years of experience and what i want in a president someone who is intelligent and informed about both policy and process a trump presidency would be a as so fond of saying i get no sense that he has any knowledge or the desire to learn the issues at all truly frightening trump would further divide our nation his rhetoric alone has deepened existing divides we must remember the richness immigrants have brought to our country the first priority of the next president must be to unify as nothing can be accomplished in the current atmosphere this has been the ugliest campaign i have witnessed in my years campaign has been embarrassing and dangerous and it will take a while for the nation to recover one good thing that has come of this cycle is that it has woken people up from apathy and encouraged them to make their voices heard at the ballot box for better or have become a politically correct society to our new voting for in the first year of the i am a i earned my med and ma teaching and journalism most of my working life was in publishing i have been alone since my divorce some years ago my views do not fit any one and my voting history is mixed i have voted for democrats and and i threw away a vote on in because i could not vote for either of the main candidates i will vote for trump he might not change this country congress can obstruct a as it has been doing since but if he it would be in directions i defeating encouraging businesses to stay or return a much better relationship with and the disestablishment of the politically correct society we to our become a priorities should be protecting the land and and promoting the general welfare stateside i have found the campaign absolutely horrid the only good thing about election day is that it ends the racism and general ignorance astound voting for years a and a retired registered nurse my husband of years is a retired teacher we live in panorama a suburb in the valley this election is the worst ever and i lived through and the war racism and general ignorance astound me worried that attempt to influence the outcome of this election in favor might yet succeed i know who angrier at trump for being a compulsive liar or the press for letting him get away with it supporters chanting her are the worst is not a we face serious problems with no easy solutions over of our children live in poverty climate change is real we have too many guns and not enough good jobs our son is unemployed i want repealed i want it fixed has a plan for that cares about about children and families a feminist who will appoint supreme court justices who will stand up for rights especially if the democrats take back the she can get things done even trump conceded that a fighter this is a historic election excited about it i think a woman president would happen in my lifetime on i hope we will elect as the first woman president of the united states twitter pumpkin portraits of and trump by artist on will remain apprehensive until she is voting for a medical student living in voting by mail as a resident my vote this year is unequivocally going to there is a vocal proportion of voters who make no secret of their reluctant whether grudging sanders or voters of any persuasion who oppose trump only marginally more than they do despite having backed sanders i take a less noncommittal far from being the of two is a remarkably intelligent candidate whose views largely mirror my a stark contrast to the unsympathetic view of her character that is frustratingly widespread her proposed policies demonstrate forward thinking that would enable the united states to stand upright as a respected model among nations i anticipate with hope the improvement of the affordable care act to make universally the push to end gun the increase in police the reform of our prison and a social promotion that advances race rights and gender equity none of these changes can be expected under the influence of who sees the truth as promotes his sexism and narcissism as and in the is excessively volatile and unprincipled embarrassing that whose political competence is nigh holds only an uncertain majority over his farcical campaign while the current poll aggregates are tentatively i will remain apprehensive until she is confirmed as after election is offering no choice besides voting for in that middle class suffering from decades of involuntarily in in a job because of health coverage and few options my household can eat and pay bills most of the so luckier than but doing much more is a rare treat the nation needs living progressive universal renewable an end to us and investment in our future instead of the society should support people over profit the most wretched excuse for a campaign in our lifetimes has only promised the opposite the major parties offer a deranged sociopath provoking global war or a buffoon with no actual both of them hopelessly corrupt and staggeringly incompetent reinforcing corporatism an option libertarianism is suicidally shortsighted we need a progressive administration keep the grassroots engaged in fighting for sustainable goals why voting stein already too late to prevent a president what the establishment wants and what get of course

debate trump almost cited the statistic have an increase in murder within our the biggest in the figure is a national not restricted to hear that from these he gesturing toward the press want to talk about can read our report on from the day of the release and before trump remarked on through the link up in biggest percentage increase since data shows read more i am elected president i am going to keep radical terrorists out of this trump without we will build the wall and will pay for the wall cost of the wall is peanuts compared to what talking trump says nonpartisan analysts estimate the wall would cost at least the us goods trade deficit with is about which is offset by the us surplus in services of not for the open border policies of this trump would be alive us does not have and has deported more than million a record as trump himself noted at final presidential has pledged open trump supports sanctuary does not support open borders but does support sanctuary cities and reform to let people pass background checks and pay back taxes in order to stay in the and she supports executive actions to shield some such as people who were brought to the us as children like she supports deportation for people with criminal are going to have the biggest tax cut since is only true if in the wealthiest bracket of earners half of tax cuts would go to the top of according to the tax policy and most families below the top of earners would have income gains of less than trump linger long on the affordable care act though he leads the crowd in a chant of the his new catchphrase for taking on corruption in percent of children under the age of are in trump says citing outdated the poverty rates in question were as high as trump says they were at the depths of the great but they have since to somewhere between percent and depending on which income threshold you use the rates for children are disproportionately so trump has a point even if his statistics are too old and exaggerate the scale of poverty in that age group on we rate the statement half two million have fallen into poverty under the he also the own fact use of is misleading on two he starts counting from when w bush was still in office and from right before the financial peak and he ignores that the population has grown dramatically in the eight years since then almost million people fell below the poverty line between and census poverty numbers but the number of people in poverty has decreased during the recovery in it fell to down from in will be very hard to leave your farm to your children and your he alluding to the on though the estate tax actually only affects wealthy families and not the majority of trump then moves on to saying that in the and that leading in many of them this is not as election models and poll averages know going to happen trump continues much is at stake in this we win in we are going to have honest government once again destroyed emails destroyed then without that her office up for to corporations and foreign donors hacked emails show concerns within the campaign that was too close with various but no one has found evidence of a favor returned in exchange for donations to the charitable moves on to reminiscing about last he came down an elevator with his wife to announce his presidential campaign he abruptly segues into saying how going to be the smart country once and saying never win correctly says that the white house has admitted premiums will increase by as much as next but then misleadingly says that the true number is twice that premiums will increase by varying amounts according to each some will be quite as trump others will be far then correctly notes that misled about whether they could keep their doctor under the affordable care and replacing is one of the single most important reasons we must win on trump says trump appears on stage in cedar he thanks earlier the after discovering new the crowd cheers reopening their investigation into is not technically correct said the emails are part of a new review the prior her the crowd investigation is the biggest political scandal since and hope that justice at last can be delivered in the very brief remarks tonight tonight tried to politicize this trump attacking and falsely accusing the director of only sending the letter to republicans lie as it turns out it was sent to both republican and democratic says that the never have reopened this case at this time unless it were a most egregious criminal
after days of reports that j trump had requested a security clearance for his people close to said that was not the case no such request has been they said on and he will not sit in on the highly classified daily intelligence briefing but should trump change his former government officials and experts on classified information said he would have wide latitude as president to bring a family member into the most secret circles of the government president can authorize clearance for anyone he said director of the project on government secrecy at the federation of scientists part of his role he has essentially access in this like anyone would be subject to a background check by the but the authority is so that he could override red flags like huge personal debt or ties to foreign governments that would disqualify other applicants trump said in a twitter post on that he was not seeking security clearances for his who he has said will run his businesses while he is in the white house but he did not address the case of who is married to elder an law passed by congress after president john f appointed his brother as attorney general in would make it if not for to take a senior position in the trump according to legal experts but they said there was no prohibition on serving as an unpaid adviser to the president if trump wanted to make the arrangement more he could name to the intelligence advisory a committee that advises the president on intelligence matters and investigates the legality of intelligence operations members of the which dates back to d in include former military officers and other government officials among its current members are a a former under secretary of defense who was considered the to serve as defense secretary if had won the r a former under secretary of state who helped negotiate the nuclear and gen john a top commander during the war know of no limitations on the ability to consult private citizens about sensitive national security said b a former white house counsel to president with the advisory he happens in a more structured and formal noted that private citizens are routinely given clearances to handle like the or legal cases that involve classified as with e the lawyer who represented gen h when he was charged with turning over his confidential diary to his biographer and mistress if trump were to take any of these steps with he would be breaking with decades of practice a security clearance is granted because a job requires access to classified or because of a specific assignment that involves secrets members of a family do not receive even though the president may discuss sensitive topics in their presence is no justification for security clearances for members of the said w the chief white house ethics lawyer from to who now teaches at the university of law school remember laura bush or having a a senior trump brushed aside questions from reporters on about whether it was a conflict of interest for children to play a role in his transition when they were running his businesses presuming that doing certain things that they should not be she said his and been his business colleagues for a very long time they obviously support their father as already occupies a singular position in his orbit he was at side during much of his campaign and has taken a strong role in the transition he was behind the recent that removed gov of new former representative mike rogers and others from the transition team if he took part in the daily would join one of the most rarefied circles in during the only people regularly in the besides have been the vice the chief of the national security the national security the vice national security adviser and the adviser all hold the issued by the director of national top compartmented information closest political and were never in the room and unlike many supposedly secret meetings in the contents of this briefing never according to former officials in the administration
j election victory was powered in part by forceful opposition to what he described as an economic and political system rigged against the people for the benefit of shadowy forces in the news the banks and the government trump and his allies often describe that system with one globalism it is a word that conjures many none of them shuttered unchecked immigration and a distant cabal believers controls the economy and the media analysts who track extremist groups in the united states have expressed alarm at the use of the word by the they say it carries multiple meanings from benign to sinister and often serves as a for and conspiracy theorists is a principle driver for the fears that animate the radical right in the united said the editor of a published by the southern poverty law center is the globalism is often used as a synonym for the system of global economic interconnection that has been critiqued for decades by liberal groups like labor environmental organizations and opponents of the international monetary fund and the world bank but for the far the term encapsulates a conspiratorial based on xenophobia and according to mark a researcher at the league a host on the media site rebel explicitly rejected its use as a synonym for in a video she posted in she said the word meant rule by autocrats such as president former president w bush and the united nations who value false flag of and immigration from the third almost always sneer down their nose at disdain national laugh at religion and generally despise the west while holding a creepy affection for the third she added want open cheap labor and to benefit their business and political and are all too willing to shaft the little people to achieve the website run by k newly appointed chief white house frequently attacked globalism and during tenure there but no one may have done more to popularize the idea of a globalist conspiracy than a radio host who commands an audience of millions through his media empire he has been called most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary by the southern poverty law center among his the sandy hook school massacre in was a hoax and the sept terror attacks were an inside job posted his own definition of globalism to in in his trademark he described it as a digital control engineered by shadowy corporate and political elites he called it total form of the who has enthusiastically supported hailed the republican as a historical figure who appeared on his show last has in turn heaped praise upon reputation is trump said will not let you down you will be very i hope and i think be speaking a so what is trump talking about when he talks about his hope provided a definition in an email before the election last groups in the united states began to refer to globalism at the end of the cold when it replaced communism as an idea that was an danger to the said they have also referred to it as the new world and soon they saw its tentacles everywhere the shape of that conspiracy had distinctly in part because many of foes had historically seen communism as inextricably linked to said members of the far right became fixated on prominent like the businessman and philanthropist those conspiratorial beliefs were bolstered when former president bush celebrated the end of the cold war in a speech by saying it was the dawn of a world his use of the phrase was taken as proof by many that a globalist conspiracy really was afoot was very easy for especially because he was the one who said to take that ball and run with said that point the phrase became the short hand for that kind of globalism conspiracy the multiple meanings have made it a powerful political and and his frequent references to globalism have drawn in a wide and varied audience is a very efficient net to unite disparate parts of the from the mainstream to the said the director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at state professor called globalism defining folklore and narrative for the racist but said it had also a convenient to explain the various declines that the united states is perceived to be globalism was an important theme in the final weeks of for when he told a rally in in that his opponent for the had sat at the heart of a conspiracy with international bankers plot the destruction of the league criticized the speech for classic conspiratorial talk has continued after the election trump referred to a plot against him again last when he complained on twitter that protests were the work of the news media and paid protesters a trump ally and host on fox business later accused of many on the far right have celebrated election victory as a momentous blow against the globalist conspiracy last claimed on that trump had called him personally to thank him and his audience for their support and to offer to appear on his show again soon ms the trump did not reply to an email seeking comment late night then pivoted to what he thought was most the coming destruction of globalists that hijacked the primarily the news media and international business people soon they would be destroyed once and for he suggested is battling back to restore humanity and to break the he said not gonna be any dtente we know and just here to let you know
in for the first the census bureau counted more people living in urbanized than in the countryside this been a rural nation ever since yet the idea of agrarian has receded slowly despite demographic change we still romanticize the family though relatively few of them exist anymore we view even suburbia in pastoral terms the as the historian t put it as the recent electoral college results make we still live with political institutions that have baked in a distinctly by design the democratic candidate for president has now won the popular vote in six of the last seven elections but in part because the system empowers rural for the second time in that the candidate who garnered the most votes will not be president rural even as it laments its economic retains vastly disproportionate electoral strength rural voters were able to nudge j trump to power despite large margins in cities like new in a house of representatives that structurally disadvantages democrats because of their tight urban rural voters helped republicans hold their cushion in the the least populous states are now more overrepresented than ever before and the growing unity of rural as a voting bloc has converted the rural bias in national politics into a potent republican advantage talking about a political system that skews not as important if there a major cleavage between rural and urban voting said a professor of government and politics at the university of urban and rural voting behavior is so starkly different now so that this has major political consequences for who has power not just in terms of policy she continued pervasively advantages republicans in maintaining control of the national the electoral college is just one example of how an increasingly urban country has inherited the political structures of a rural past states containing just percent of the a historic can theoretically elect a senate lee said the bias also shapes the house of representatives it as a in the formulas that determine where highway funds are spent or who gets homeland security dollars it exists in state where bills preferred by urban delegations have been much more likely to be rejected the influence of rural voters also evokes deeply rooted ideals about who have power in and argued that the strength of the nation would always derive from its agrarian soil had this vision of what they called the this person who owed nothing to who receive any payments from the who live by a but who could support himself and his family on a farm growing everything they needed and that these were the people who were going to be the backbone of said a political scientist at the university of describing what could be the forefathers of the rural voters who tilted this election when the framers of the constitution were still debating the shape of institutions we have percent of was as the census classified the population the compromise at the time created the one chamber granting equal voice to every state to counterbalance the where more populous states spoke louder and they made sure the compromise stuck equal state representation in the senate is the only provision in the constitution that remains singled out for protection from the amendment no state can lose its full complement of senators without its permission but even as a deliberately undemocratic the senate has slipped further out of alignment with the population over time the senate simply favored sparsely populated politicians in sparsely populated states to leverage the skewed power we talk about all of that was an intentional policy said a political scientist at the university of republicans in congress passed the homestead offering free land to settlers who would move to territories that would eventually become states creating more senate seats and electoral college votes for a republican party eager to keep government control away from southern democrats they even managed to divide the territory into two worth twice the political power as the plains later depopulated and then the senate became even more unrepresentative suspicion of big cities also appears in the sites of state and not new city and not st and not political scientists at the university of have found that most state capitals were located near what was then the population centroid of each state typically closer to the geographical center of the and not the place where the most people already breaking with how much of the world sited its capitals the state legislatures there also grew significantly less representative as urbanized in when lawyers in brought what would be a seminal case before the supreme court challenging the the state legislature had not reapportioned its districts to reflect population change in years was still using districts drawn in even states that had constitutions requiring equal population districts were ignoring them and new gave small counties times the voting power of the most populous ones decades ago in county had the same representation in the senate as county a population over six justified it because that was a cultural it was just the way things said a professor of government rural legislators had no incentive to change a system that favored them just let it keep getting worse in power why by the no state approximated majority rule at the and m wrote in their book end of had some of the most unequal representation in the world a series of supreme court cases beginning with that complaint upended this system and established the standard that equal representation means one not one one vote or one one senator only the united states protected by the remained unchanged the house retains a rural bias republican voters are more efficiently distributed across the country than who are concentrated in cities that means that even when democrats win percent of voters they invariably hold fewer than percent of house regardless of partisan gerrymandering the electoral college then allocates votes according to a congressional one house
the transition team appeared to hint that senator republican of would be in cabinet in a the team said that sessions had met with trump in his new office on nothing has been finalized and he is still talking with others as he forms his the has been unbelievably impressed with senator sessions and his phenomenal record as attorney general and the statement said is no wonder the people of him without has consulted with lawyers about the possibility of joining the new a move that could run afoul of federal laws and would all but certainly invite lawsuits and ethical challenges has talked to at least one lawyer and believes that by forgoing a salary and putting his business holdings into a blind trust he would not be bound by such according to a person who had been briefed on the talks under federal the president cannot accept voluntary services that are not permitted by and a separate statute bars public officials from employing family members in any capacity the ambassador to the united said that would work with all members of the trump including chief k trump appointed to be his senior counselor on the move has been widely criticized by democrats and minority groups who say that promotes and racist views look forward to working with the trump with all the members of the trump including in making the alliance stronger than said w one of campaign confidants who has been mentioned as a possible secretary of arrived at trump tower in the and left an hour later saying going to get some two candidates for treasury who worked on and representative a republican who is the chairman of the house financial services also paid a visit to trump tower on got a great position in public policy said he wants to talk to obviously about serving somewhere look at serving somewhere

transition team adding that the two men talked about the union and events and issues around the gov of south a possible candidate for secretary of state or another also met with transition officials just happy to have her here for her advice and counsel and to hear about the great success story of south said campaign manager lawyers from both parties and government ethics groups on called on trump to sever all ties with the vast real estate and business empire that bears his name and to place it in a blind warning that failure to do so could result in contentious conflicts and even threats of impeachment in a letter to trump on a group including norm president former ethics and who had the same post under w said the must transfer control of all of his businesses assets and investments to an independent trustee who would sell them and not disclose how the proceeds were invested if he chooses to put his children in charge of the as trump has said he plans to they clear firewall must by barring family members from being involved in policy decisions at the white house and forbidding them from discussing the business with their father or anyone in his administration senator of who battled with trump during the republican primary said that he was and to working with the in an interview on fox said that he met with trump on and that they had a conversation about the challenges facing the country there is speculation that could be a potential nominee for attorney general or the supreme but on he dodged questions about his future eager to work with the president in whatever capacity i can have the greatest impact defending the principles i was elected to said am excited for the opportunity we have to come together and get the job in a renewed sign of turmoil among democrats after their bruising loss last representative of said that he would challenge representative of as leader of the house democrats have spent countless hours meeting and talking to members of our and the consensus is said in a letter to his democratic colleagues we are doing right now is not working under our current democrats have been reduced to our smallest congressional minority since this should indicate to all of us that keeping our leadership team completely unchanged will simply lead to more disappointment in future in a news conference before announced his ms seemed to brush off any noting that she was the architect of the takeover of the house by democrats very proud of and i see that as an opportunity the leadership vote will be held house and senate republicans have agreed to pass a spending measure through kicking the appropriations which leaders in both chambers vowed to do this into the next congress and administration the bill is expected to pass before the current spending measure expires on appropriations bills have been contentious because they are often filled with conservative policy riders that have made those spending bills subject to presidential veto in the administration with trump in the white there will be a fresh test of the appropriations including a new debate on earmarks l the federal reserve was asked by members of congress at a hearing about the economic impact of election markets have rallied on optimism that trump and congressional republicans will stimulate growth by cutting taxes and increasing spending on defense and infrastructure ms struck a more cautious note know going to she said a great deal of uncertainty we will be watching the decisions that congress makes and updating our economic outlook as the policy outlook becomes the work on a new administration will have a brief site change on when trump heads to his golf course in for additional meetings among the possible events being
dominant lead over trump in opinion polls is narrowing slightly as the final week before the us presidential election with independents and undecided voters appearing to gravitate toward the two main few analysts believe the latest numbers will disprove almost universal predictions of a democratic win on even despite the news that the is investigating emails sent by via a personal server they also highlight unusually large spreads between poll results in an election that has broken many of the conventional laws of private email server under investigation by again read rolling average of national opinion polls calculated by real clear politics showed a percentage point lead for over trump on with libertarian and green candidate stein dropping to their lowest levels since polling for the election days after struggling in the first two presidential debates and still fending off damaging allegations of sexual trump was points behind in the same rolling average of national though much of his gain since appears to have been at the expense of rather than tightening of the race has prompted some analysts to somewhat adjust upward their predictions of how likely it is that trump could pull off a surprise win who runs website and correctly predicted the says his modeling of poll numbers and wider historical trends suggests the republican now has around a one in five chance of winning up from the lows seen during the debates but still down sharply from the near even chance he had based just on polls earlier in the signs now of a tighter as trump has inched up to in our forecast in he wrote on silver acknowledged that the wide disparity among pollsters about the size of lead which has ranged from to points in recent days is but argued that that is a healthy reflection of different methodologies analysis at the state level continues to show a difficult path to the required electoral college votes for particularly as the million votes cast already in early voting point to an unusually strong democratic turnout in such as and to turn things around in the barely hours trump would need to hold on to republican states like and where his support has been win the crucial battlegrounds of and north and pull off a surprise in swing state like new or all of which appeared to have slipped out of his grasp in recent both candidates head to next practically unknown territory for a democratic presidential nominee before a frantic final days of there were signs of the strain for continued to call on his supporters to disregard the evidence of poor poll numbers and watch for been saying we win i want to be but the people are getting angry at me so just say we win on he told a rally in also should just cancel the election and give it to after hinting that the opening of his new hotel in was a sign he would get to avenue way or this his running mate mike pence had a narrow escape when his plane skidded off the runway in heavy rain at new airport on meanwhile continues to show much more confidence in her even though democrats are warning supporters not to take anything for granted in the final circulated widely in on that she was considering asking the current to be her secretary of a suggestion that will help both shore up support among the populist base and signal her intention to look beyond also received a welcome boost on from the first who has emerged as one of the most popular political figures of the election cycle she said after a joint appearance in north elections
maybe i have been surprised that trump could be elected but i was i live in and work in two of the most liberal places in the country but even i seeing many signs of support for him how did that blindness social media is my portal into the rest of the world my periscope into the communities next to my into how the rest of the world thinks and feels and it completely failed me in that failure makes sense spent nearly years coaching and and twitter on what kinds of news and photos i want to and they all behaved accordingly each time i liked an or clicked on a or hid the algorithms that curate my streams took notice and showed me only what they thought i wanted to see that meant i realize that most of my family who live in rural were voicing their support for trump and i see any of the that were in heavy circulation before the election i never saw a trump hat or a sign or a shirt in my and the only election day i saw were of people declaring their support for to be not blaming the algorithms for what i assume to be their role in augmenting my they did exactly what i told them to blocking out misogynist and hiding anyone who support black lives all with such deftness that i had no idea that a candidate who ran a campaign on exactly those values had gained enough popularity to win the election but considering that more than percent of our population consumes news on finding alternative perspectives have been that hard i knew about theory on filter or the idea that personalization distorts the type of information we and even i still chose to let algorithms shape how i perceive the world everything i could want to see is available at my and yet i look in mark chief executive of addressed a room of developers about the importance of his social network he has the power to bring people together who might otherwise never have the chance to meet has enabled all of us to access and share more ideas and information than ever he said gone from a world of isolated communities to one global and we are all better off for but not what has happened idealism is belied by his desire to duck responsibility for mediating the content of his site on the political divide has only been entrenched further the dress only for our entire we are two one that sees blue and black and the other that sees white and gold the once offered outlets we could use to understand one another but they are rapidly disappearing most social media like and is curated by software built to manage the high influx of information flowing into but there have still been a few islands of digital a of where culture thrived untouched they included vine closure was announced in and and even which were homes for marginalized theories and lifestyles the vine was the first place i got a glimpse of cultures beyond my including those of the middle east i was able to see how some women there wanted us to see aware a young woman living in who goes by the name used vine to show clips of herself living her life her version of normalcy at the goofing off at home in her most viral she stares into the her face covered in a save for her perfectly outlined eyes called me she snaps the emphasis on the last word becomes the punch line as she whips off one to reveal a second underneath i was thrilled to realize that women living there could have a sense of humor similar to my own vine was born as an and intended to be a social community but vine links could be shared independent of the and people did so with meaning that vines appeared around the defying the sorting mechanism of streams and feeds they could land on your screen via text direct email vine was a riff on one originally posted by a young black named who was miffed that someone thought she needed makeup to be pretty you can draw a straight line from brown women in to black women in a marvel unto a window into the way the flattens space and time a vivid example of its fulfilling its promise to bridge divides at it had more than million monthly users who watched videos billions of and it excelled at showing these sorts of black kids in new lived and looked a lot like white kids in the very they shared a similar humor and taste in which gave me hope that they would share a sense of humanity as and yet which owns vine and is struggling to turn a profit while keeping its main service appealing to could seemingly no longer afford to keep the video feature reportedly costs millions a month to afloat following news about decision to close the there were rumors that outside companies made inquiries about purchasing remains but most likely too late to salvage the community there in its earlier offered its own version of cultural exchange the had an incredible series on that gave users direct windows into different worlds people submitted short video diaries about life in their which the company compiled into a single viewable by anyone using the i remember feeling delighted watching people in and showing off their routines and customs but the company is now prioritizing which feature more mainstream events like the super bowl and music festivals the effect is still but less intimate seems to be betting that people are more interested in the familiar the future of the platform whose endless warren of rabbit holes about gender critical feminist thought and identity politics is unlike any other on the is the most uncertain its parent succumbed to
a man who uses misogynistic language and has been accused of sexual assault is soon to become the president of the united states of for feminists desperate to see the first female the result was how could someone with such disregard for rights become trump boasted about being able to freely grope women because he is and by the end of the race different women had come forward to accuse him of sexual assault he also suggested during his campaign that women should face form of for having before backtracking and saying states and congress should take the lead with lawmaking on this matter after the publication of a video in which he describes women by the experts and many predicted that lost the female vote but this turned out to be incorrect it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their to exit of white women voted for trump those without a college degree supported trump over democrat candidate by nearly two to one white women with a college degree only narrowly voted in of by six percentage points by of black women and of voted for some feminists are finding it difficult to comprehend why women so offended by misogyny that they voted for en mass we interviewed women across to find out why they voted for trump and why they describe themselves as feminists what they a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or she thinks and makes her own worker who lives in the much state of voted for trump she describes herself as socially financially independent and educated female i either friends or except for one voted for trump i want to show it was not only men or educated citizens that voted trump i am an economic conservative who is registered as a affiliate i feel that trump has the best economic polices to create jobs and therefore rebuild the economy truly thought video of as been having two and a i can make an educated guess that all heterosexual men have bragged about their exploits with women to another man at some point believe in equality between the sexes i have the right and capability to make my own and live the life i choose for myself because i am a feminist i know and exercised my right not to be put in a box or voting group and to freely think and make my own judgment as to who i thought would be the best candidate for president it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their actions a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or she thinks and makes her own choices thought the sexual allegations were unsubstantiated and therefore equivalent to and campaign mudslinging if these women had truly been assaulted why wait until one month before the election to come forward to the press not the authorities thought it incredibly hypocritical to him as a sexual predator when we know for a fact that bill is and helped him cover it up through libel and slander of the women who did come forward this change my opinion about except for maybe a more sympathetic attitude and feeling that the media was treating him gender has no bearing whatsoever in their qualifications for a including the presidency was not clear as to what her policies as president would except to maybe continue with the same failed practices her policies would not have helped our depressed and stagnant economy i believe plans for job creation benefits including minority groups i also and have for a long to a more isolationist foreign not going to vote for somebody because of their gender or trump voter a mother of two boys who is currently not calls herself a feminist most but she is fiercely opposed to voting for someone based on gender alone instead she backed who shares her own beliefs including not raising taxes her home state of a mix of farmland and more white and less educated than the national mean voted for trump some things i would be a feminist but it mean i vote for someone because she has a vagina always voted republican and always support the party they pushed a female candidate through to break the glass ceiling of a perceived gender equality the end of the day video of did not affect my support for him what he says and what he does matter in those senses because looking for somebody that has the same beliefs as i do in running a country at the end of the day all sinners and we all say things like this it uncommon we act like the president of united states should be some holy person can go through all the us presidents and you will see sexual dysfunctions in all of their personal even husband had an affair at the end of the my sex life does not involve his work life and my sex life does not involve my life these women that came out about trump could have been hoping for media or maybe just simply paid by to make her criminal issues look not going to vote for somebody because of their gender or race there is nothing other than whether they can run the country or a which naturally lends itself to traditional twitter republican nominee was knocked out of the presidential heather brown backed trump brown believes that under trump the us economy will

top diplomat in lives in an elegant stone house first built by a missionary in a short walk from the historic old city but he is not an ambassador and the mission is a not an embassy for those distinctions have rankled many the united along with the rest of the has kept its primary diplomatic footprint not in but in the commercial and cultural hub of tel to avoid seeming to take sides in the fraught and argument over who really has the right to control this ancient city until now maybe j trump vowed during his campaign that he would relocate the mission after taking office that in itself is nothing for candidates running for president have promised to move the embassy to and for candidates who actually became president have opted against doing so but just as trump broke all the rules of some of his supporters say no amount of by the state department will change his mind an orthodox lawyer who is advising trump on told army radio after the election that the was to do because he was man who keeps his many and are buzzing about the prospect where would the embassy would it straddle the line between west which is predominantly and east which is predominantly would it touch off street protests in cities or a backlash among allies like and is a emotional and real said a former ambassador to the united states and president of the institute matters to many because it would indicate that the united states actually recognizes as which now it effectively does which is why object so strenuously to such a move is a sign that going to side with said a scholar at the gulf research a research organization with offices in and elsewhere he does going to be a wrong start for his relationship with the the status of has always been one of the thorniest issues dividing and in the united nations recommended that the city be declared a meaning an international rather than incorporated into either the or the states then being contemplated on the land between the river and the sea but in the war that followed its declaration of statehood in captured the western portion of the city while seized the east took control of east in its war with its neighbors and annexed declaring that the city would remain whole and unified as its eternal capital later building many settlements there that most of the world considers the united states and most other countries refused to recognize the annexation and kept their embassies in or near tel the last two countries with embassies in and el moved out a decade ago bill and w bush both promised during their presidential campaigns to move the embassy to both later backed away from those convinced by middle east experts that doing so would prejudge negotiations for a final settlement between and in congress passed a law declaring to be capital and requiring the embassy be moved there by or else the state department building budget would be cut in half but the law included a provision allowing presidents to waive its requirement for six months if they determined it was in the national interest so every six bush and eventually president signed such fearing a violent response in the world if the embassy moved president who reversed his campaign promise did so because he decided not to take the said b a longtime middle east envoy who advised multiple including has historically been an issue that provoked great passions often as a result of false claims that did trigger whether such advice might sway trump is unclear despite another trump adviser on the middle told the that trump would move the embassy he later clarified that he meant a at since no one could imagine a consensus including at this point a former middle east adviser to said trump should follow through because even if east is eventually ceded to the as the capital of their own no plausible settlement would deny west to is simply no reason not to put a embassy he said the issue remains so delicate that the administration went all the way to the supreme court to block a law passed by congress allowing parents of children born in to list as their birthplace on their passports when came to in for the funeral of the former president

currently in run by the consul a career deals mainly with the while the embassy in tel run by ambassador b an handles relations with trump could simply declare the consulate to be an embassy and move the home as a but there are other logistical challenges the staff could not fit in the consular offices near the old nor in the building that processes visa requests and is surrounded by stone walls

thank you for being guide to thriving in the age of l pp from trump to to marine one thing that unites the unhappy west is a profound sense of mystification across and north people have an acute feeling that their world is accelerating away from them but they quite understand why there is no narrative hence the attraction of leaders who it like it and identify convenient like immigrants or the union but what most people really crave is an honest explanation as with patients on a the first step is to understand what is going wrong then you can decide on the medication into this darkened room steps tom while other journalists dream of being investigative reporters or news l is a whose goal is to be a from to and he is extremely good at it a talent for explanation has garnered him a column at the new times and a string of books on huge subjects like and climate change snooty critics might grumble about his folksy but it is hard to think of any other journalist who has explained as many complicated subjects to so many people now he has written his most ambitious book part personal part manifesto you for being has two overt aims wants to explain why the world is the way it is why so many things seem to be spinning out of especially for the white middle class he grew up in and then he wants to reassure us that it is basically going to be in general the explanation is more convincing than the reassurance but as a guide for perplexed this book is very hard to beat argues that man is actually a fairly adaptable creature the problem is that our capacity to adapt is being outpaced by a built from three ever faster the market and climate change that sounds like a predictable but digs cleverly into each one for on technology he argues convincingly that which saw the arrival of the android and was the year when software in the words of the he introduces us to vital obscure like and he points out that if law the power of microchips would double about every two had applied to the capabilities of not computer then the modern descendant of the beetle would travel at miles per cost cents and use one tank of gasoline in a lifetime the chapters on climate change and the market are stuffed with similar nuggets but also shows how all three forces complicating and speeding up one another in climate change is wrecking crops even as technology is helping more children so a population of million will reach million hungry people by on trading technology and markets create so a operating out of his flat by can make the index fall percent in a and will keep getting faster there are already at least billion things connected to the but that is still less than percent of the possible total as ever more gadgets and bodies join of man has sped up his own response times it now takes us only years to get used to the sort of technological changes that we used to absorb in a couple of but what good is that when technology becomes obsolete every five to seven the supernova is making a joke of both patent law and education companies and individuals are all struggling to keep up it can be bewildering even for the winners like himself in he was queuing up to phone his stories from telephone now he can email a column from deep in that appears almost instantaneously on the times website and provokes a rapid reaction from china in two and a half years researching this he had to interview all the main technologists at least because things changed so quickly like everybody he has no time to the title comes from an offhand comment to a friend whose tardiness allowed a few welcome minutes of contemplation for the most you for being is a master class in explaining it canters along at a pace that is quick enough to permit learning without getting bogged down inevitably he sometimes gets the balance either allowing his informants to ramble or skating over a thorny for having admitted that productivity numbers have not forward in the same way that technology he asks in to trust they will the folksiness will still irk some the starting point for the book is a chat with a parking with another attendant from waiting near the end but criticizing for humanizing and boiling down big topics is like complaining that used sex to sell it is what he does well there is also a value in bringing things together in putting foreign policy beside climate change and be fooled by the catchy slogans not into and so as usual with it is all backed up by pages of serious reporting from around the world this complaint is that the explaining is too convincing lying on the listening to him in his guise as tom you ever more the reasons the world is spinning so fast it is not all along the way we discover that the created more teller jobs at banks it allowed banks to increase the number of there are inspiring stories of communities rising to the and a memorable paean to the virtues of chickens from bill gates empower keep children healthy and but respite from these there is there is not going to be and attempts to stop it all will do more damage than good this makes it harder to reassure us that it is all going to be fine produces a list of things that the government should from setting up a health system to passing deals and building infrastructure if the politicians in accomplished even a quarter of his the united states would be better at coping with change but is too honest a reporter to argue that will

writes pundits said they do most pollsters insisted they do everyone from the pope to said they do it now indeed one resounding message from the seismic electoral events of and now trump is that democracy has been badly served by pundits and pollsters in the aftermath of many voters said they would have voted differently had they known how finely balanced the referendum was going to while significant numbers of might have acted differently had they known the true strength of support when making their fateful decision to stay away from the polling stations this knowing the true voting voters are blind if provided with inaccurate they think they can see when in fact they cannot people need to be able to make important decisions in an informed manner and political scientists either get considerably better at assessing the voting intentions of the or stop attempting to do so altogether the consequences of getting it wrong are too no one can express an opinion accurately with just a single x experience in northern shows that extremists are less likely to cross the party divides thus voting often gives extremists more success than is their due the trouble with trump was that the vote in binary if the us election had been preferential stein and trump the outcome could have been a more accurate reflection of the general and trump would probably now not be the if democracy is to preferential voting is both in elections and in both in and in the country at frank claims put trump in the white house in the we have heard similar claims that is really the fault of a liberal as someone who grew up in a family on a council far from any liberal i was taught that a vote is a powerful and valuable tool to be wielded responsibly so can we stop all the liberal and grant people enough respect as adults in a democracy to be accountable for their own nobody forced anyone to vote for trump or people made their own choices and should accept responsibility for victory is being explained in terms of the political elite being out of touch and unrepresentative the ordinary people but if those people are homophobic and or are tolerant of those attitudes in their political then it be seen as a good thing they are not it is better that those who make the important decisions share those views and instead work to change those attitudes where they are held by than that they echo them and govern their country in that spirit surely in a democracy an official body the electoral should have power to prevent the serial telling of lies to gain advantage in a poll it is no good prosecuting after the event vote leave leaders may face court for such liars should be made to own up to the error of their ways or barred from further engagement in the proceedings it cannot be right that two vital decisions in two major democracies have been influenced by repeated mendacious argues that the checks and balances that the us could normally have called upon to restrain trump may no longer exist he suggests that we rely on the military to stop trump from getting out of hand i am not so sure the most steadfast modern constitutional guardians probably are the as once they were in turkey what is to prevent them from stepping we might find ourselves welcoming why are people on the left not accepting democracy any having lost the challenges go to the having lost out to trump in the us presidential the challenges are taken to the streets for good or ill the votes have to be respected or else we are all lost the alternative is mob rule or letters on election victory us election result is a sharp lesson from losers and two nations divided by a common must his pledge to close bay crave politicians who actually stand for something the rule of law and a reboot for democracy media and politicians are out of man make grate

world leaders have begun congratulating trump on his election win as people around the world anxiously wait to see how their country will engage with the new us president the order in which trump spoke to leaders around the world has sparked speculation as to how he will shape his foreign policy in the hours after his victory trump spoke to and south the may was on the action planned after second night of protests across us read was the first to have a conversation on how to closer diplomatic with the us prime discussed regional security and how to defeat a key promise in election campaign but although the and the offered they his leadership a of asked people around the world to tell us what the situation looks like from where they how their governments are responding to victory and how they think his leadership will affect their and the us will probably grow closer but as citizens we will suffer from endorsement of our live in a police state where activists and journalists disappear or are jailed the administration had been putting pressure on our government to improve human rights and freedom of but i doubt administration will do the same this is evident from our current eagerness to connect with trump i hope he hires a team that understands the complexities of the middle east it is evident he does have a and trump are heavily disliked in the middle east by and while trump is openly hostile to and clueless about the policy as secretary of state has been very deliberate and damaging to the region despite her more tolerant and inclusive gone through a very similar election scenario in in where both candidates were i was not very surprised by the outcome the democratic party underestimated popularity and the dislike for i feel a lot of votes went to trump out of spite for perhaps if a different candidate had gone against trump the outcome would have been different just like what happened in it looks like the population is now sharply split in with each side the other i think the most dangerous thing that can happen to a intolerant people in power might make it easier to challenge them as they are now out in the but healing the rifts in society is much harder i simply hope trump will become a president for all us as is his and reign in the hateful extremist tendencies displayed by white hope he hires a competent team that understands the complexities of the situation in the middle east and as it is evident that he does not have a trade conflicts but he will use his business wisdom to deal with feel great about the result a tremendous win for the for those who were constantly ignored by political elites in i like trump a lot because he knew the real problems of the country rather than just chanting politically correct us is divided probably more divided than when i worked there for three years that happens when you are obsessed with gay rights and minority rights but forget to promote the most basic right of living a better life for the majority he will be a great president if he improve some of his to plot and the are now dead trump is likely to be a more pragmatic figure than so relations will improve going to be some trade conflicts if trump lives up to his word about but i believe he will use his business wisdom to deal with it china will have an easier situation and a stronger influence in the region a cooperation between these two countries could benefit humankind i wish that trump could be more presidential he will be a great president if he improves some of his rhetoric i hope that he can get along with have a lot of supporters for trump mostly from say the result was shocking would be an understatement victory of an fanatic like in a country known around the world for its liberal virtues and is something that adds to the swerve of the world to the right he adds on to the list of politicians such as in in and of in maybe we are witnessing the gradual transition of the world into a global we have a lot of supporters for trump mostly from parties another moment of jubilation for them maybe the consequences for foreign policy will be beneficial as trump has publicly shown his admiration for and his way of governance but his temperamental nature makes trump truly so we will have to wait and see as long as he turn rhetoric into i think the world will be southern where most of the people have a similar opinion to me but in the northern areas of the stomping ground of the ruling opinions may differ the philosophy of of a mutual peaceful which was even enshrined in our foreign policy until an ideological regime is something i firmly believe and the rise of a person like trump is a question mark on existence itself the hidden silent majority that is supposed to have created this ruckus may not be as silent as they are portrayed to be as in every other some are always bound to feel during the rule of a government they which could be for cultural or economical reasons beyond doubt this result was the result of what they call some sort of racial hate storm against the former policy on terrorism and the domestic election helped me to see what the us truly is under the pop culture disguise they have a huge rising tide of fanatics and a population desperate enough to find hope in them maybe his campaign of rhetoric and hate was a charade to reign in their support as long as he limits himself to rhetoric and dare turn rhetoric into i think the world will be

democratic party outrage at the shock almost on the eve of the us presidential that it is resuming its controversial investigation of after declaring in that the matter was has been chairwoman of the democratic national was one of many to cry foul has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters even the faintest appearance of using the power to influence our election is deeply she the campaign also hinted at is extraordinary that we would see something like this just days out from a presidential said the statement left it unclear whether there was anything remotely new to may well be true in his letter of notification to the said he did not know whether a batch of newly discovered emails bore any relation to previous claims that acted illegally in sending private emails containing classified information when she was secretary of state from said the new emails to be but he and his officials had not yet examined them in a later he admitted know the of the but said he felt obliged to investigate and make his decision public it is not even certain that the emails came from private move is either extremely naive or extremely cynical investigations are routinely conducted behind closed doors only when a decision to prosecute has been based on persuasive is an inquiry made public or suspects a ostensibly independent figure like the director to tip his hand at this extraordinarily sensitive moment amounts to an overtly partisan act since it must be assumed that is no it must also be assumed that he knew what he was less damning explanation is that he was clumsily attempting to save the further criticism from the republican which denounced his earlier investigatory efforts as a but if that is the why did not have a confidential word with the relevant congressional oversight nobody could then subsequently accuse him of a and he would not have triggered the firestorm in which the impartiality is again being and this time from the the damage is done must now try to weather the storm until having previously believed that she was in the clear it will be a rough ride the ugliest and most personally vindictive presidential campaign in modern history is now set for a furious and trump and his supporters have been quick to wade in speaking on the campaign the republican nominee revived jibes that is a corrupt and habitual liar in typically hyperbolic he said that her conduct was biggest scandal since risible exaggeration undermines his case but the genuine anger and alarm expressed by surrogates reflect their fear his attacks may be hitting home and their knowledge of how damaging renewed questions about her honesty and competence could potentially in trump she faces the least qualified for a host of most objectionable republican candidate in living is still only about ahead in the as a national bald figure may be considered misleading in battleground or where the electoral college will be is ahead in all but and but polls across the nation are tightening this latest flurry of negative headlines in national media desperate for a sensational story to keep the race alive in some to dish will not her advantages in name political achievement and spending has evidently failed to knock trump out of the a deeply damaging few weeks for when he was beset by allegations of sexual he still to be in with a more skilled and savvy politician than could and would have buried trump months ago a more popular or democratic could now be awaiting electoral coronation this latest blow may cause some underwhelmed democrats to abstain and best pitch to independent and undecided voters that she is the least worst candidate leaves her vulnerable to a elections

press has turned into the daily trump over the past six coverage of the us has dominated national trump was remarkable across five titles mail on express i counted pages with content about led their front pages with all carried leading articles about and he featured in most of the columns by senior political face stared out from most of the front whether smiling alongside brothers in the daily looking stern during his cannot imagine that a victory would have generated such intense newspaper interest as happened throughout the election campaign in the trump has proved to be a media positive or negative and the majority of the coverage has certainly been the latter the undeniable fact is that he is the a if somewhat lesser also managed still to attract undue attention from newspapers does that suggest some kind of inbuilt at least one i suppose it does because a demagogue would surely not have garnered as many headlines as trump and is no denying that both men have been lampooned in although the criticism has not amounted to they have been portrayed as figures of fun rather than as evil incarnate fate of many politicians think tony ed and now papers have shown an underlying sympathy for the views of trump and notably over their opposition to immigration and their consistent antagonism towards whether in or the same papers with an eye to their readership appeal have appreciated their naked populism with even greater their disdain for liberalism and the liberal elite so trump and even while being dismissed as mavericks and ridiculed for their lack of civility and benefit from the underlying often sympathy towards their central political articulating the prejudices of their readers the common people exercising commonsense the daily the sun and daily express could do no other than find common cause with trump and there is the simple matter of the volume of coverage name recognition is immensely important in and both men have enjoyed that because of widespread media coverage quite they have prospered by having a should we fall into the trap of seeing this as a peculiarly conspiracy the and the supposedly impartial and radio news have devoted a great deal of space and airtime to trump and is true to say they have disparaged both men but they have also been at pains most obviously in news bulletins and current affairs to treat them as serious representatives of people they like to refer to as disenfranchised and so ever careful to maintain as part of the required public service broadcast outlets have unconsciously given them credence in politics is precious we may be encouraged to laugh at trump and even loathe him for being unstable sexual predator and compulsive winning but he has just enough credibility to survive the onslaught it is not so much that the people love him the but that they love him for being willing to take it and ignore named as of the by the times in he has long risen above newspaper sarcasm he revels in aware that is viewed by many of his and as some sort of homogeneous liberal institution it therefore forms part of the trump and have not needed to manipulate the press and in a conscious sense having been within the modern media it has become second nature to them to use it to their advantage

because is entirely governed by two political passage of legislation usually requires bipartisan support in us congress the republican party is the only major political party in the world that denies the need to tackle climate change for several years any hope of passing climate legislation hinged upon breaking through the opposition among republican legislators a number of groups have focused on doing just the wake of the us election i contacted these groups to assess their feelings about the prospects of us government action on climate change in the near future the general sentiment was understandably one of discouraged but each group identified glimmers of climate success and climate lobby is one of the leading grassroots climate organizations in and has also expanded rapidly internationally the group has seen explosive growth in recent now hosting chapters in of congressional districts with a membership approaching the carbon pollution is taxed at the and of the revenue is returned to taxpayers via a regular rebate check a bipartisan solution liberals get their desired carbon pollution while conservatives get a free market policy that grow the size of government modeling projects that the policy will have a net overall positive effect on the climate lobby has also achieved several significant successes the group was involved in spearheading the in which republican members of congress called for action to tackle the risks posed by climate change was also the driving force behind the creation of the house climate solutions caucus a group currently comprised of republican and democratic members of congress exploring bipartisan climate policy solutions and initiated the state resolution urging the federal government to pass a carbon to executive director mark the election change strategy as told because democrats are already on board with climate as an organization with a long history of working with republicans on climate now that the republican party controls us is now more relevant and important than ever told me that since the election traffic to website has increased and attendance of its weekly introductory calls has spiked from an average of about to last week the majority of who are unhappy with the election results have become which bodes well for grassroots support of climate also sees an opportunity for republicans to take control of the climate issue after many liberals rallied against a carbon tax proposal in the state of this opens up a window for the republican party to take ownership of one of the best policies to tackle climate change as trump might put a carbon tax is great because it efficiently addresses the problem while boosting the and the rebate protects wallets from rising energy could replace regulations with carbon republican party has thus far opposed all climate policies in but the supreme court ruled that the must regulate carbon and it began doing so under president some have proposed that the easiest way for the to eliminate those government climate regulations which party leaders but most republican voters support would be to replace them with free market example the center is a free market think tank that supports this type of and has proposed swapping regulations for a carbon tax the president jerry wrote a detailed post about the prospects of a carbon tax under the incoming republican which is well worth reading thinks that republican leaders are now less likely to propose a climate tax than prior to the election for several they will likely devote the next several years to eliminating the rather than replacing them because of the supreme court eliminating the regulations will be but since trump will appoint at least one justice to the it may not fully survive legal challenges if it does the next president could fully restore the regulations if congress declines to replace them with legislation while this offers a glimmer of hope that the could pass a climate doubtful that party leaders will be so the election results made it clear that climate denial will not hurt most republican politicians in elections while many republican members of congress privately accept the reality of climate change and the need to address and has identified several who would be willing to introduce climate legislation if the opportunity were to present believes the election results make such a political opportunity less street institute sees other r street institute is a free market think tank that has likewise made the conservative case for a carbon tax the president believes the chances of carbon tax legislation would have been low regardless of the election outcome as he told r street energy policy director elaborated where she sees opportunities in cutting carbon pollution under the incoming climate future looks but there are glimmers of groups were generally pessimistic about the prospects of a climate bill coming from the next but they did spot glimmers of and the future set in stone in its congressional lobbying reported that republican members of congress were times more likely to be receptive to the message than to be up from a ratio just two years ago many policymakers recognize the threats posed by climate at least in private as jerry they just need the political opportunity for climate legislation to present political opportunity would require something to change for republican climate leadership to be rewarded rather than punished difficult to envision that change happening in the next few but not impossible groups like will continue working behind the scenes to help make it happen in the the r street institute foresees other opportunities to chip away at us carbon pollution not an encouraging landscape for protecting future generations from a climate but at least hope and if the crushes that hope over the next four it seems likely that the democratic party will have a good chance to restore it in consensus the change gas

according to the socialist academic the reason that rich western liberals talk so much about racism and sexism is so they have to talk so much about economic inequality he published the trouble with diversity exactly a decade but it feels like a tract for our perfectly suited as a provocation to thought as we approach the summing up of great western want to challenge the economic structures that produce inequality because that might seriously impact on their own standing and wealth instead they insist on the elite being as diverse as the as a way to justify the very existence of the elite as long as the top class at shows a proportionate distribution of social one can happily ignore the fact that all the students come from money not just that this focus on diversity distracts from the deeper issue of economic inequality because the very diversity of the elite is asserted as justification for the nature of capitalism diversity has become the moral alibi of not that is against diversity per he absolutely but he thinks it misses the bigger picture when the struggle to achieve wage equality between men and women at some warehouse job is touted as a major victory when neither the men nor the women can actually live off what the warehouse is paying them when a battle is won for women at some merchant bank to earn the same as the a victory but both victories leave the most fundamental injustice perfectly the civil rights movement in the the us has become a much fairer society in terms of race and gender no doubt there is a way to in some places a very long way to but the progress has been considerable nonetheless but during this exact same the us has steadily and become more and more the gap between rich and poor widening to a level that now threatens the very stability of these disunited states and in this gap that trump has turned his of is capitalism and that the mainstream of both political parties refused to pull at the thread of its failures democrats and bush republicans subscribed to the view that global was a good with democrats combining this commitment with a civil action tradition and republicans with a socially of the it is the democratic pairing that makes the more natural fit for capitalism may produce winners and but it is nevertheless an economic system that is indifferent to gender or creed which is why capitalism is sometimes held up as a means of affirmative action the pink pound if a woman is better at doing the job than a white the logic of capitalism is entirely she rightly gets the job thus capitalism is applauded as an agent of social progress and yet the poor get poorer and the rich get took two political outsiders to say sanders and trump the former said it respectful of the many moral gains that the era of liberalism brought about the latter saw a gap and viciously exploited turning the resentful white poor against other poor minorities who are themselves as much a victim of the machinery of capitalism a decade the critics of thought he was doing something playing women and people of off against poor white middle why social justice mean a commitment to both social diversity and economic it can and it should but only when wealthy liberals appreciate in and of the struggle for diversity does little to benefit the pay and
j victory could well push the party system toward a clash between an overwhelmingly white ethnic party and a cosmopolitan coalition of minority groups and whites despite the unexpected trump lost the popular vote in an election that in some respects closely resembled victory over mitt in an ordinary end to a very abnormal campaign the power of party identification held approximately percent of republicans in camp campaign may set in motion a process that reorients politics toward the cosmopolitanism versus nationalism divide that he reconfiguring our party system and shaping our politics for decades to come the power of social identity suggests that such a dynamic could be difficult to stop once set in motion in recent the democrats and republicans have battled along a axis of conflict that emphasizes disagreement over the size and scope of government rather than divisive disputes about racial identity during the and presidential for john and ran against domestic policy proposals on issues like health care and the economy after the republican party hoped to continue along this path and expand its appeal to young minorities and women but as the political scientists miller and norm candidates and parties sometimes in flanking moves so as to enlist coalitions of disaffected by changing positions on social issues that cut across party they seek to attract voters who are only loosely attached to the other party trump seems to have pulled off one of these maneuvers in shifting from traditional conservatism to a kind of nationalism though the move cost him votes among he attracted support among the larger group of whites without a college degree substantial minority of whom had backed in pulling in just enough votes in the rust belt to tip the election despite all the attention paid to economic anxiety as the basis for the evidence to date is more consistent with his brand of identity politics being the most important cause of this shift in voting patterns from of course economic anxiety and group animus are not mutually approach has the potential to transform the party system the success of his campaign may encourage other republicans to adopt his model he has shown that the penalty for deviating from orthodox policies is minimal and that an style can have significant electoral advantages though presidents cannot impose their will on most of domestic they can help define the issues on the political agenda in the choices that he trump may play down conflict over the size and scope of government and shift the political debate toward questions of national immigration and culture few republicans are likely to want to cross trump and his energized supporters given the threat of a potential primary challenge in for decision to name as his chief strategist the head of a website described in an article in the conservative national review as catering to small but vocal fringe of white and though the move lacked recent no republicans in congress which made the issue into a partisan dispute with democrats trump has also stirred emotions by promising to deport two to three million undocumented immigrants by the fate of a tax cut normally the top domestic policy priority has received less attention the party will almost certainly pursue success is likely to provoke a response from democrats that could accelerate this shift they face an outraged liberal base that is likely to reject conciliatory messages intended to win back votes among the white working class the party might instead double down on cosmopolitan appeals to the minority voters and white voters who were the main target of campaign the strategy failed in but the incentive to try again is clear democrats came closer to winning several sun belt states where minority and white populations are like and than they did some traditional strongholds with higher numbers of like and a focus on cosmopolitanism might make electoral sense for democrats given the changing demographics of the but it could further weaken their appeal to whites without college dividing the electorate by race and class even more nothing about this process is of course republicans may yet succeed in steering trump toward a traditional agenda of tax cuts and deregulation but the effects he could have on party system could be of far more lasting consequence than almost any policy he might propose
trump has inconsistent and sometimes views on a raft of nuclear weapons their role in national and international the nuclear threats posed by north and the consequences of their the inevitability and desirability of nuclear the necessity of spending over years to the us and the importance of cutting deals with and others to regulate their is as yet largely unformed in this critical but some of his stated positions and views have the potential to wreak havoc on the international security order and put the country and the world in nuclear there is a promising side to fluid views they could offer ways to reduce nuclear risks and indications point to his cold war interest in arms his interest in achieving rapprochement with and his leanings to be some of these leanings are his attachment to reducing the cost of commitments to and allies while also extricating the us from risky entanglements abroad may well reduce the exposure to nuclear conflict but it may equally regional security and encourage allies to build their own nuclear arsenals instability and proliferation would only increase the odds of regional nuclear which could easily spread across the entire how foreign could test trump finger on the trigger read could lower the nuclear especially in relations he clearly wishes to establish a positive relationship with and he should be encouraged to do nuclear arms just as did with his soviet counterpart trump should seek a grand bilateral cuts to total weapons proposal that remains on the table for to pick along with scrapping the missile in and that stand in the way of these bilateral pledging to refrain from using nuclear weapons first against each standing down their nuclear and establishing a joint early warning in order to reduce the risk of accidental nuclear of these especially missile are ingrained in republican a test of party purity but trump is no purist or ideologue he appears to have no fixed and seems willing to question premises hopefully he will resist hardliners populating his administration who may attempt to block him from extending an olive branch to the bear achieving a rapprochement with would go far toward defusing the tensions in that otherwise could too easily escalate to the level of real nuclear also needs to defuse the growing tensions with north over its expanding nuclear weapons which is on the verge of enabling its mercurial leader to lob nuclear missiles at south japan and portions of the united states sanctions have not curtailed this threat withdrawing the us nuclear umbrella from our allies will not help on the trump will need to reassure our anxious allies and engage north and china more deeply than ever to stop it if trump can overcome his leanings with an box approach that goes to the heart of the matter the deep insecurity of the north regime then his penchant for defying premises may yield real progress toward halting and reversing this imminent threat he will have the power to launch a nuclear strike at any time of his choosing with a single phone reduce nuclear danger in the middle trump will have to accept that his campaign pledge to tear up the nuclear deal and renegotiate a better deal would in fact not serve the us national or that of he should listen to the professional nuclear the senior generals and career officials who testify that the deal enhances security and averts the proliferation nightmare of enemies getting nukes in also needs to allay nuclear concerns at home as commander in he will have the power to launch a nuclear strike on his own at any time of his choosing with a single phone call if he gives the within minutes hundreds of us nuclear missiles would blast out of their underground silos ten minutes later hundreds more would leave their submarine tubes there would be no they would reach their target cities on the other side of the earth in minutes or large chunk of the not to mention a large global is deeply concerned that trump will command the nuclear giving him the authority to launch a nuclear strike this responsibility requires extraordinary competence and diplomatic skill it requires the qualities of presidential leadership with the campaign behind the hope is that trump can prove himself a leader with a steady hand whom we can rely on to act with reason and restraint in times of
how did trump launch his presidential during an episode of the apprentice he rode down an escalator into the lobby of a skyscraper bearing his name trump used his to accusing of their worst to

it appears that in the aftermath of a monumental but nonetheless failed presidential sanders remains most comfortable in the spot that made him a trying to separate class and has never been wrong about the damaging roles establishment politics and economics play in the lives of millions of even long struggled with acknowledging that focusing on class alone make this country better for many who are struggling that the revolution cannot be colorblind if it were to truly make this country better for all of the disenfranchised at a speech in on the senator advocated beyond identity working class of this country is being decimated why trump won and what we need now are candidates who stand with those working who understand that real median family income has gone it has but like the others parading this pedestrian punditry in the aftermath of the news that most white people voted for is missing the point while continuing to promote the very ideas that sunk him during the primary he lost many potential voters of color because we know economic policies alone will not change certain realities of racism in they might great but only for people who have always had it pretty when asked in a new republic profile how uncomfortable he appeared talking about he this is an issue not really what i want to do is get into when told that it about him per sanders a complicated answer a good but i prefer not to get into it right sanders did make some efforts toward minority outreach it was too late and not good enough after all this that reality has still failed to reach him in his he demonstrated this blind spot yet when a woman in the audience asked asked sanders how she could become the is not good enough for somebody to a vote for sanders explained not good enough what we need is a woman who has the guts to stand up to wall to the insurance to the drug to the fossil fuel industry in other one of the struggles that going to be seeing in the democratic party is whether we go beyond identity should we pretend always been way that discounting them invalidates the lived experience of the very people that opted against sending him to the general sanders talks about the democratic failure to reach white he manages to somehow forget he lost to a woman who bested him partly because she spoke of the need of criminal justice reform and the overall role racism plays in before he went on to lose to a demagogue who promised to restore the nation to an image that excluded like me and like the woman who dreams of becoming a us sanders owed that woman a better answer he should have mentioned the need to combat voter suppression he should have mentioned how identity politics matter because identity in this country can very much play into economic status sanders went to what makes him comfortable rather than address voters proved they were more willing to let a con man break the country than share it with the rest of us the failure of democrats that they coddle white people it was that they failed to explain how unless you are white and connected like you will fall like every other person screwed over throughout his career that a multicultural coalition rooted in economic plurality for all benefits everyone insistence on moving past is the next step in his may it suffer even more defeat than it did in the income

in late trump sat down for a town interview with the candidate at the time was still crisscrossing himself on abortion rights should planned parenthood be was roe v wade settled and made several attempts to pin him you say abortion is a crime or abortion is you have to deal with it under said abortion be do you believe in punishment for yes or as a several trump answer is that there has to be some form of denunciations came almost as fast as retraction later in the trump issued a statement saying that a woman should never be punished for an abortion only her doctor but before he could reverse a cry went up almost in unison from reproductive rights some women are already being punished for having abortions nearly years after the supreme court ruled that women in the united states have a right to a legal abortions are still a significant phenomenon as the guardian reported on every there are potentially thousands of women in the us who attempt to end their pregnancies by themselves some even or these women are operating in murky legal territory only seven states have some law that makes it explicitly illegal for a woman to attempt her own and in most states and at the federal the law says nothing at all but that stopped individual prosecutors from going after women who or in the united a woman who attempts to induce her own abortion may potentially be running afoul of any one of different laws including those against child or drug or practicing medicine without a license according to the abortion legal a project associated with law and this is not settled law

she ordered an abortion drug for her pregnant daughter states have similar laws requiring abortion drugs to be administered by a licensed very much on individual prosecutors to make these said the head of the national advocates for pregnant women which has intervened in some of these cases on behalf of the women charged does not seem like the national right to life or some other group was encouraging these prosecutions in many of these hospital staff or local police are outraged and want to find a way to hospital workers or social workers may be horrified and feel personally researcher with the head of the reproductive freedom recently encountered a woman whose friend had sent herself to the hospital four times by drinking a home abortion cocktail of turpentine and sugar during her most recent doctors threatened to call the police if she tried this said we zoom out on this i do think that there are a number of things going on hospital workers or social workers may be horrified and feel personally said a researcher with these decisions are made on such a local a trump presidency will not necessarily result in an explosion of prosecutions but some predicted it could represent an expansion of the restrictions that cause women to take matters into their own hands in the first place is something that one could reasonably predict in an environment where abortion becomes even or even more inaccessible than it has said the executive director of the national network of abortion has promised to appoint judges to the supreme court with a potential view toward overturning roe v the supreme court decision that established a right to abortion in an interview shortly after he won the trump acknowledged that if roe v wade were struck some states would ban abortion if the history of abortion before roe is any thousands of women would travel across state lines to obtain an abortion every year but many more women would seek out illegal providers or take matters into their own a

sometimes i think i have never seen anything as strong as that mean that i like and admire everything about her not here to argue about who she just to note what she did i watched her plow through opposition and attacks the like of which no other candidate has ever faced and still win the popular vote to defeat her it took an unholy cabal far beyond what faced when he was the campaign of swimming with the tide of disgust about the bush administration as the new times the time all the ballots are she seems likely to be ahead by more than votes and more than percentage points she will have won by a wider percentage margin than not only gore in but also in and john f in twitter concession know can flip that and see that trump was such a weak candidate it took decades of scheming and an extraordinary international roster of powerful players to lay the groundwork that made his election possible defeating in the electoral college took the gutting of the voting rights act by republican appointees to the supreme court it took vast republican voter suppression laws and tactics set in place over many years it took voter intimidation at many polling places it took the long republican campaign to blow up the boring bureaucratic irregularity of use of a private email server into a scandal that the media obediently picked up and reheated us yet to join ranks of countries with female leaders read took the director of the using that and his power to stage a misleading smear attack on days before the election in flagrant violation of the custom of avoiding such intervention for days before an election it took a compliant mainstream media running after his sabotage like a golden retriever chasing a tennis ball it took decades of conservative attacks on the served as deputy counsel to the senate whitewater that fishing expedition that began with an investigation in a messy real estate deal in before bill presidency and ended with a campaign to impeach him on charges related to completely unrelated sexual activities during his second took a nearly reality the that deified racism and narcissism as essential to success and power as the feminist media critic points trump said and did was framed in a way to flatter and more flatter his the colossal infomercial fictionalized the cheating businessman as an unqualified success and gave him a kind of brand recognition no other candidate had it took the full support of fox whose roger was so committed to him that after leaving the company following allegations of decades of sexual harassment of he joined the trump campaign it took the withdrawal of too many from even that of journalism into the partisan unreliability of sites and bubbles of social took the mainstream of failure to address climate change as the most important issue of our time it took decades of most media outlets letting the propaganda arm create the false framework of two equally valid opinions rather than reporting the overwhelming scientific consensus and tremendous danger of climate change to stop it also took using as a tool of evidently considering his grudge against the democratic nominee important enough to try to aid the campaign of a racist authoritarian now appears to have so close a relationship with that he often appears on the channel and news site rt he tweeted protests when president information was included in the panama papers hack and has been coy about where his leaked information on the democratic national committee came intelligence experts say it came from and made it clear that he favored win the day dropped his the new times ran a story reassuringly titled investigating sees no clear link to with its own underplayed revelation buried the officials have become increasingly based on the evidence they have that direct goal is not to support the election of as many democrats have but rather to disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine standing in the world more beef over loss is with liberal young and old read it took a shortsighted campaign of hatred on the an almost hysterical rage like nothing i have ever seen before about any public figure some uncritically picked up outright and spin to feed their hate and rejected anything that diluted the purity and focus of that including larger questions about the other candidate and the fate of the earth it was so extreme that in recent i was attacked for posting news stories on social media by furious people who took the position that to be overtly was to be covertly if the perfect is the enemy of the whose friend is the greater of two a lot of people seemed to think the primary ended the night trump was elected i saw that from climate and others who you might expect would have turned to face the clear and present danger of a trump presidency i for much about failure to address the pipeline adequately which was and but overshadowed by what we heard so little million dollars or so invested in the pipeline and the guarantee he would use presidential powers to push it and every pipeline like it through impossible to disconnect the irrational emotionality from and the misogyny continues since election been hearing too many men of the left go on and on about how was a weak candidate wondered about that word not only because it is so often associated with but because what calling her weakness was their refusal to support her as if sent a pink lifeboat and we sent it because we wanted a blue and now we are very upset that people are as my brilliant friend put it some point soon we need to discuss whether sanders would have been able to but helpful it just sounds like democrats should have cut into lead in the misogynist
there are only days to go before the us presidential election on what are the latest polls for an election that is generating more passion on both sides than any in recent pollsters and pundits are offering scant comfort to those seeking clarity about result most outlets continue to predict victory for but various models differ greatly in the certainty they award that and various polling averages disagree on the margin model gives a chance of winning to while the new times sticks its neck out with an chance of a presidency to for trump polling average has ahead by percentage while average gives her a percentage point have these indicators changed since announced the was looking into emails amid this dense electoral what is clear is that bombshell last that the is in a sense reviving its probe into use of a private email server when she was us secretary of state has had a profound impact on the race it allowed until then mired in his own controversy over his attitudes towards to swing the spotlight back onto his perceived untrustworthiness probably as a the republican plummeting poll ratings have bringing them within the margin of error both on a national measure and in key states such as and even propelling him into the lead in the bellwether state of happening now about the is there a agents are racing through emails reported to have been found on a laptop shared between of and her estranged husband of the it is not known how many of those emails came to or from nor how many might have related to or might already have been examined by the bureau if there are any new it will take time to work out whether they contain classified material so the search is unlikely to be completed by leaving this sword of dangling over the democratic presidential candidate as go to the polls how is early voting than million have already surpassing the million who cast their ballots early four years ago will this benefit or no easy answer to that given variations both by state and electoral group but there are clues the good news for is that turnout among early voters has increased dramatically over suggesting that the of the vote might actually have been awoken this year by rhetoric the bad news is that the such a vital element in the coalition built by in his two successful presidential is relatively sluggish this time as is turnout for young voters the fall in black turnout could be especially perilous for in swing states such as north which has been identified by both candidates as a key early voters change their as trump has and have they trump is trying to use the furor over the renewed interest in emails to persuade those early voters feeling remorse to switch their preference that you see that was a big change your he said on making the same appeal at a campaign stop this week in one of six states that do actually allow early voters to change their minds in the others are new and some early voters have made use of this though probably not in numbers large enough to make a the latest from and why is the sunshine state so accounts for of the electoral college votes needed to which puts it on a par with new and means it has fewer than only and combine that with the history of squeakily close presidential elections won here in by just out of more than votes and you have the mother of all swing states all modeling suggests trump must win or kiss goodbye to the white although for it may not be quite so crucial true to the race in is looking too close to call is counting on a large turnout of in central while trump is bashing the theme of the investigation into emails in the hope of riling into backing him twitter how does the us electoral college are voters reacting to holding back of his tax is the first presidential nominee of either main party since in to withhold his or her tax returns his only return to have been made courtesy of a new times suggests he may have avoided paying federal income tax for two decades his reluctance is deeply with polls showing that voters overwhelmingly think he should publish the as do of republican voters and almost half of own supporters but whether that translates into actual votes remains a moot point what about other with female seems that crude comments captured on a hot about making uninvited sexual advances to women might not have dissuaded many staunch conservative women voters from supporters him but it has hurt him among white women voters generally who will play an important role in determining the outcome of the election ten recent polls show with an historically high advantage among women plans are there for this everything to play both candidates will be clocking up serious air miles trump will be focusing on north on seeking to repeat mitt victory there in will be with in on where she will also attend a blockbuster rally on night alongside bill and and and voters in key swing states will also be bombarded by and radio with

something is deeply wrong when the reputation and influence can be borrowed by a source that describes itself as fantasy news to claim that he has endorsed a presidential and then be through a million individual shares the attention paid to fake news since the election has focused largely on fabrications and outright because they are easy to identify and extraordinarily viral fake news is created by the kinds of people when might call their work or admit that in it for the money or for the thrill of deception theirs is a behavior that can and should be and that is and maybe to deal with for many and especially opponents of j the attention paid to fake news and its role in the election has provided a small the discovery of the error that explains everything but as the attention has spread widely even president talked passionately about it on it may lead to an unwanted outcome for those who see it not just as an but also as a way to correct the course it misunderstands a new media world in which every and is at risk of being not by argument but by sheer force false news stories posted on websites were prevalent in this election were widely shared political videos some styled as newscasts containing outright image posted by individuals and shared by and endlessly shared quotes and video clips of the candidates themselves repeating falsehoods during the months i spent talking to partisan page operators for a magazine article this it became clear that while the ecosystem contained easily identifiable and intentional it contained much more of something else i recall a conversation with a fact checker about how to describe a posted on a website and promoted on a page copied from another site by overseas contractors it tried to cast suspicion on the father of a slain who had spoken out against j trump the overarching claims of the story were disingenuous and the facts it included had been removed from all useful context and placed in a sinister its insinuating mention of in proximity to mentions of and its misleading and strategic mention of amounted to a repulsive smear it was a story that appealed to bigoted ideas and that would clearly appeal to those who held them this was a story the likes of which was an enormous force in this clearly designed to function well within economy of sharing and it probably would not run afoul of the narrow definition of stories like that one get to the heart of the rhetorical and strategic risk of holding up as a broad media offensive especially after an election cycle characterized by the euphoric inversion of rhetoric by some of and by the candidate himself as the campaign criticism of trump was instantly projected back at his or at the critics themselves puppet no puppet the this tactic was used on the language of social which was appropriated by opponents and redeployed in an open effort to sap its power while simultaneously taking advantage of what power it retained were cast as the real racists progressives were cast as secretly regressive on their own terms this was not a new but it was newly effective it matter that its targets knew that it was a a clear bid for power rather than an attempt to engage or reason the referees called but nobody could hear them over the roar of the crowds or maybe they but realized that nobody could make them listen as shorthand will almost surely be returned upon the media tenfold the fake news as widely understood and has already begun to encompass not just fabricated but a wider swath of traditional media on and elsewhere fox fake news misleading claims about ford keeping jobs in fake news the entirety of fake news this wide formulation of will be applied back to the traditional news which does not yet understand how threatened its ability is to declare things even when they are may try to address the narrow version of the the clearly fabricated posts has plenty of tools at its disposal and has already promised to use to bar sites that have been flagged as promoting falsified content from using its advertising platform but the worst identified defenders make their money outside anyway another narrow response from could be to assert editorial control over external forces tried to a very limited with trending topics members of the editorial staff wrote descriptions of trending news accompanied by links they deemed credible this initiative collapsed in a frenzy of bias accusations and political fear but it is easy to imagine a system in which a upon reaching some high threshold of or a upon reaching some cumulative could be audited and declared unreliable this could resemble experiment to tag satire articles as such a number of narrow measures could stop a fake story about the for example but where would that leave the rest of the answered and and barely better positioned against everything else that remained it would be a news environment in which almost everything there before remained the main difference being that it would have all been not fake is a place where people construct and project identities to family and peers it is a marketplace in which news is valuable mainly to the extent that it serves those identities it is a system built on ranking and vetting and and yet one where negative inputs are scarcely and where conflict is resolved with isolation that provisions for open conflict on a platform present any easy for it has been a source of constant fake news operations are closely aligned with the experienced incentives of the economy more than most of the organizations that are identifying them their removal will be an improvement the outrage at their mere and at their promotion on a platform with the stated goal of connecting the will have been justified
the republican primary was supposed to be an embarrassment of riches for the contrast to the republican party was set to feature a slew of articulate conservative superstars fighting it out for the nomination the only question was whether it would be the year of a governor an inspiring senator an ideological firebrand or perhaps an policy wonk from the bayou governor bobby one of the more seasoned former conservative governors would win the such as bush or rick such hopes were dashed on when one j trump took what he now calls the escalator down trump tower to announce his candidacy the establishment immediately mocked him but he went on to shock the next the ideologically malleable alleged billionaire browbeat his way to the republican nomination he tagged his opponents as too low energy too dishonest and too little and sweaty for the oval office he would allow nothing to stand in his way certainly not the truth in his quest for the republican nomination to the new yorker with a potty mouth that made even stern blush pretended to be a committed even declaring that the reason the was auditing his tax returns was probably because of his religious devotion to immigration he pledged to deport each and every illegal immigrant in the even though he said after the election that the reason mitt lost was because of his harsh stand on immigration but trump win the republican nomination because of his policy positions he won because of his personality and brand for nearly four he painted himself as the greatest businessman lifelong marketing scheme got a boost from in when he was cast as the star of the reality show the where he flaunted his executive authority each week in front of was at his best when he talking specifics he promised to make all problems go to make great if just put their faith in him he was the strongman who was going to make everything if you just trusted him and ask it worked in the republican primary but the nomination fight revealed much more about republican opponents and the republican electorate than it did about trump to those who cared to it was well known before trump ever entered the presidential race that he was a dishonest lout whose business success was far less than claimed but presence in the race revealed that the supposed superstars were too weak to stand up to the charlatan in their midst as for the republican primary we learned that perhaps they care so much about conservative principles after all that the conservative movement may be nothing more than a collection of magazine offices and think tanks in and no true believer in conservative principles could ever get behind trump in winning the republican trump may have destroyed the republican party and drastically set back the conservative movement his his mainstreaming of conspiracy his portrayal of as an arrogant his invective his occasional racism will taint the republican party for the foreseeable it will taint the republican party if it lasts but that remains an open question the odds are will and the question will then what will become of the republican will the wing and the always trump forces come or will a civil war break ultimately tearing the party it the should have been ascendant this election cycle it lies in all thanks to trump the man of the exactly as he would want it to be elections

i love telling people from maybe my defense mechanism for when people accuse me of being a coastal out of touch with real i like fulfilling all the stereotypes i love cheese and cheese of course i love our sports teams out of a vague sense of and my accent hard comes out in full force after ah beers mostly i love my who has called home for years her parents immigrated to from and she started public school without knowing a word of she forgot most of the her parents taught her years but taught me the words to the that we would sometimes hear when my family would go to a night fish fry up until i still believed my moral baseline bent toward empathy the i thought i where i lived for was filled with complex but fundamentally decent people who recognized that everyone is deserving of respect and could disagree without being disagreeable the state did elect walker as governor in and the legislature gutted setting off huge protests in the capitol but i think that state would vote for j turning its electoral votes to a republican for the first time since come we even voted for as much as trump won the election in lost it her which prided itself on employing all the data wizards and ground game gurus money can did not do nearly enough to lock down the upper particularly and and instead treated those states as a given is the mayor of capital in cerulean county he supported senator sanders in the democratic and said he talked at least once a week with a field organizer from the sanders campaign during the primary but once locked up the it was radio silence from the campaign i first held elected office in the early virtually every presidential been either by the candidate or by a he told me not saying this to say important but the point not only she in the but i never got a a anything after the president by made two campaign stops in during the including a huge rally with on the before election day frustration with the campaign was apparent understand the strategy never seen an explanation for other than assuming that they wanted not just a but a smashing victory the kind that trump he said voter turnout in was the lowest been in years roughly fewer democrats voted in county this year than did in the drop in turnout in county might be partially attributed to a voter identification law in the state in a federal judge found that roughly registered voters in lacked the necessary photo id card to vote under the new and a of those voters were low income election watchers have said the voter id law alone could not have flipped the state in favor did not visit once after the democratic national convention in neither did president or sanders made multiple trips to the state on behalf of but that was not enough to gin up enthusiasm like most of the my friends and family in were shocked that trump won the and the election my mom says still in my dad has progressed comfortably to anger my has been coping with the election result with characteristic wit listening to trump speeches about i was convinced to she emailed me i hate throughout the general the surrogates appeared reassured to the point of hubris that they would be able to convert moderate republican voters in suburbs every democrat we lose in western we will pick up two moderate republicans in the suburbs in and you can repeat that in and and new senator chuck said in this line of thinking was not just but disastrously so in won of counties this counties voted for trump republicans successfully built on the map that helped to elect walker to the mansion while the campaign was looking to run up the score in states like and a triumvirate of republicans also helped elect both actively and passively there is who worked his way up from republican politics in to head the republican national and to serve as chief of staff then there is house speaker d who now has a historic opportunity to pass his agenda through congress recovered from his own failed presidential will now oversee the republican governors association is a longtime radio host in who became a voice on the right for the movement after years on the he will retire from his radio show this year along with being a vocal opponent of the trump he has taken on a new role as chief apologizer for media he expressed frustration with his he had gradually grown immune to any inconvenient fact presented to them while he read news from the politico and national review throughout the his audience seemed to glean most of its news from fox talk radio and their feeds on his radio program last played a sound bite of s current head of the national security suggesting the government had made a to sway the election in favor asked his we all agree that this is a big deal and we ought to do something about he opened the phone and the first call was from who believe it i believe any of sighed break through he said is way harder to knock that stuff down than you would he says he is but not to see conservative media falling in line and supporting cabinet picks is the monster he said of the worst elements of the conservative media have now been empowered every one of them has got a strut now has a pipeline to the white house i think about spent half of arguing that conservatism was fundamentally incompatible with what trump was offering his party conservatism has been i in being aggressive but and very and also proving that you can do things and be rewarded by the he said trump
of all the various cabinet hopefuls and assorted who have come to trump tower to get an audience with j perhaps the least congruous might be the visitor who dropped by late bill it after the liberal mayor of new who had described trump during the campaign as a uniquely unqualified candidate for president trump responded in characterizing as the worst mayor in the history and trump and the mayor spent more than an hour in alone and without in according to city hall officials the meeting appeared to be the longest so far between the and a democrat other than president whom he met with for minutes at the white house last week characterized the meeting afterward as a that was substantive and he said he had gone in with a set of issues and concerns to raise with the over policing and taxation and a goal of expressing much fear there among new yorkers about the direction of his presidency why trump granted so much time amid a harried transition to the presidency was less especially given their history of vitriol but unlike perhaps any other local still wields great power over decisions that could affect a large number of properties in the including trump his home and office and the temporary nerve center of the budding trump administration a spokeswoman for trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his view of the meeting the mayor said he had voiced his concerns about numerous including the prospect of and what he characterized as divisive language or policies that have heightened fears among new yorkers he would not describe or characterize comments during the meeting in his said outside trump at a news conference after the meeting in the city and all over the country are looking to see what going to when asked whether he emerged from the meeting more hopeful than he had did not say is too soon to he said have to see how things the meeting had been arranged relatively quickly after the two men spoke by phone on a call that took place days after trump had spoken with other including gov m of new a democrat but it was who would become the first democratic leader to meet with trump at his office since the election agreed to get said during his weekly appearance on adding that while the phone call had been an actual i there has to be a blunter the looking as he left trump said he had raised his concerns over proposals to repeal bank lower taxes on the deport undocumented immigrants from the city and try to revive the widespread use of which a federal judge in new rejected as unconstitutional in the mayor said that the city was going to that approach he said he had also expressed about the appointment of k the former chairman of the news as white house chief strategist thought many people were afraid because of the things they had seen in news and the fear they had that that suggested divisive he referring to headlines criticized by civil rights democrats and some republicans who called of the most incompetent and the worst mayor in the history of new over the was overwhelmingly rejected by new city voters in favor of his democratic and while the defeat of was a blow to the who managed her senate campaign and energetically supported her during this general election it has allowed who said of trump late last month that impossible he could be a good to cast himself in the role of a protector and defender of the just as his own battle gets underway saw his approval ratings rise to percent in the most recent university conducted during the week after the presidential election and released hours after the meeting with trump

from its commitment to pay for medical services and toward a fixed government contribution for each beneficiary the idea rarely came up during march toward the white but a battle over the future of could roil during his first year in whether he wants it or not me say unequivocally to you i have fought to protect for this generation and for future senator of a democrat running for in said this

championed the new denounced by democrats as representative tom price of the house budget committee chairman and a leading candidate to be secretary of health and human has also embraced the known as premium support and democrats are relishing the fight and preparing to defend the which was created in as part of b great society they believe that if trump chooses to do battle over he would squander political as president w bush did with an effort to add private investment accounts to social security after his in democrats will firmly and against if he tries to the sacred guarantee that has protected generations of said representative of the democratic leader republicans have pressed for premium support since first included it in a budget blueprint in as he envisions beneficiaries would buy health insurance from one of a number of competing plans the traditional program would compete directly with plans offered by private insurers like group and blue cross blue shield the federal government would contribute the same basic amount toward coverage of each beneficiary in a region those who choose more costly options would generally have to pay higher those who choose plans that cost less than the federal contribution could receive rebates or extra benefits supporters say this approach could save money by stimulating greater price competition among who would offer plans with lower premiums to attract customers democrats say that premium support would privatize replacing the current government guarantee with skimpy vouchers care for the fear is that the healthiest seniors would choose private lured by offers of free health club memberships and other wellness leaving traditional with more expensive patients and higher premiums would have to pay much more to stay in traditional said john k a former official who is now a consultant to many insurers would become the province of affluent beneficiaries who can buy their way out private plans republicans say their proposal would apply to future not to those in or near retirement but the mere possibility of big changes is causing trepidation among some older am terrified of said who lives in a retirement

plans scared to said who has multiple a type of blood and takes a drug that costs more than a month know exactly how it will but just the fact that they are talking about messing with frightening to senator m republican of north has proposed a version of premium and other republican senators have expressed but the idea has not gained as much traction in the senate as in the house the impact of premium support on beneficiaries depends on details of the plan to be specified by congress a crucial question is how the federal payment would be set the effects would almost surely vary from one market to depending on whether private plans cost more or less than the traditional program said that premium support would be seismic in and could increase costs for many people in the traditional fueling a big increase in enrollment in private advantage plans enrollment in private plans is already on the having increased more than percent since adoption of the affordable care act in it is not just republicans who have expressed interest in the idea m who was the director of the white house office of management and budget under president bill told congress in that she favored a bipartisan proposal for premium support because health plans and providers would then every possible way to provide care at a lower the nonpartisan payment advisory which advises has explored the idea of premium support and endorsed the principle that payments should be financially neutral equal for and advantage in each the congressional budget office analyzed two of the leading options and found that beneficiaries who wished to remain in the program would pay much higher on under either at the same the budget office said the proposal could slow the growth of spending if more beneficiaries enrolled in private plans nearly a third of the million beneficiaries are already in private advantage and the government pays a monthly rate for each of those beneficiaries the budget office several features of current law limit the degree of competition among and the traditional program does not bid against the private plans in a premium support each insurer would submit a bid showing the amount of money

never forget the in one of the republican primary when trump looked into the camera and declared that destroying political correctness was his no campaign issue his fans went both in the crowd oh my i even then courting the troll over the subsequent i watched as wildly disparate groups of men from the slimiest corners of the white gun good old boys coalesced into one frothing hydra behind trump when mainstream news outlets started churning out about the mysterious the wicked green engine of i wanted to and other social justice activists already know what the is a roll call of the angry men been abusing and trying to silence us for years the only thing they have in common is a fixation on the of a vaguely pejorative for king social and in trump they found their the alpha male who was finally going to give these bitches what they deserve adequately convey how sickening it has been to watch groups of men who have posted my home address dug up photos of my husband and and threatened to rape and murder me lie and steamroll their candidate to the excruciating we were expected to entertain the fantasy that a person could vote for trump without voting for for for rape culture when that very slogan vowed to drag us backward to a time when the us was a time before people of and women and had in our few protections into law on a galactic people are terrified of what lies ahead we must look out for one another read know that seems like a shiny new but trump win the election because of new he won because of old ideas call it whatever you like social basic respect and decency but is our our watch keeping those old ideas at our avowal that our humanity matters as much as white our insistence that you cannot simply erase the line between racist actions and our hope for building a more inclusive is planning a in north next month hate crimes are at their highest since more than a dozen women have accused the president elect of sexual i had to listen to supposedly leftist men not trolls this time insist that victory was at least partially a result of and and correctness gone too this is the consequence of one man told me on twitter always a backlash from he admonished as though any movement in history got anywhere by asking politely and taking a seat as though there was some magical moment in the past when reached a perfect stasis no no sexism and white dudes could still have a chill time but those greedy feminists just had to keep is no such thing as a social movement a movement is acquiescence a movement is not a movement at all it is stillness it is the status quo the trump campaign counted on that stillness on the of being a dork to give hate speech and sexual assault the space to grow and what if validated us instead of helped us firm boundaries against oppression instead of letting hierarchies reassert correctness blaming political correctness for president trump is like blaming the civil rights movement for or feminism for rape or stonewall for hate crimes every battered wife who has been murdered by her husband when she tries to leave have to hurt you if just a disingenuous peddled by people who know they did nothing to help when of hate was gathering steam and are suddenly terrified because the stock market is crashing now now welcome late you spent eight years obsessing over college opinions on comedy and now a racist clown is is a man who believes in registering restraining black protesters with building a wall on the border and grabbing women by the genitals and you think he has a vested interest in tamping down the dissent of black immigrants and he is institutional silencing personified are you sure political correctness went too are you sure we were what do you actually want us to do on a shrug at when black churches are accept being when trans women of are murdered at staggering smile at when only of rapists in the us are ever never defend our boundaries until they shrink down and garrote not an option political correctness is not you consider yourself a good but you spent the past eight years parroting the troll party line and tittering at the silly activists mocking baiting treating us like eroding our credibility and now pointing at black rape immigrants and everyone else who is petrified for their lives under a trump and insisting that we brought this on ourselves by fighting too then screw you you fight at all and you will suffer the rights
from what we know so foreign policy as president of the united states will cut back the us in the middle east institution and initiatives will be if not ended entirely the war on will but mostly from the skies through perhaps on targets in and and his administration is likely to negotiate a deal with the regime and its patrons in middle eastern countries will welcome victory why read this could bring an end to the caliphate but will not itself was born from conflict and will survive the barrage of bombs coming its way without us efforts and focus on the rule of law and good governance in with a plethora of other militant groups in the will continue to find the space and resources to threaten us middle east trump faces is very different to the one that confronted his predecessors the order has been undermined states have either collapsed or have been severely it is armed groups and violent actors that are increasingly dominating political and security rather than the conventional armed forces that once existed and reported to the regimes with which the us historically may no longer govern territory in the way it did over the past two but it will almost certainly continue to enjoy the space to rebuild and and what would follow is unclear under the group may splinter into different groups or amalgamate with other movements to present a concerted and unified trump plans to sit down and negotiate with armed groups in the his only viable option is to help establish respected and legitimate political structures in and it is that local economies and brings in foreign investment to help rehabilitate destroyed towns and and ensures that and other militant groups are unable to swell their ranks with the weak and impoverished and the capacity of social media means it is no longer plausible to speak of remote fixes may contain but will not contain the transnational threat and the capacity of social media means it is no longer plausible to speak of remote threats defeating groups like and eliminating the threat of groups requires not just wining the war but also winning the the us has invested heavily in places like and and with disastrous costs while there is no appetite for and no logical reason to deploy tens of thousands of us military personnel that does not mean there has to be a shift to the other are significant interactions between the humanitarian and security components of the war on enables a stronger security environment and political which enables the alleviation of humanitarian crises us engagement in recent for has helped alleviate ethnic and sectarian tensions between rival factions and can be replicated in regime may have to be part of a settlement to the but that does not mean giving that and carte it is and his actions that have enabled to become what it is today it has killed hundreds of thousands in comparison to the several thousand that has with or without a there are at least fighters dedicated to overthrowing the applauds trump win and hails new era of positive ties with us read notion of handing over responsibility for regional and international security to to the despots and authoritarian regimes that trump believes will be at fighting has dangerous security implications for the us and the international community at large it shifts the balance of power in the region further in of and provides them with increased leverage in respect of conflicts and disputes outside of the middle is to prevent from using its increased influence in the middle east against us interests in or in the what is to prevent china on a significantly altered security framework and the uncertainties it trump will need to be far more creative and ambitious it is good governance and alongside a military that will prevent not an inward looking as much it cannot protect itself from transnational threats by disconnecting from the interconnected world we live foreign elections

who gains from a trade war with at the pacific economic cooperation summit meeting in over the one of the biggest questions was whether j as the next would stick to his threat to erect steep trade barriers against dragging the united states into a confrontation with the economy no such war has yet it seems clear that the united states has already lost china has been steadily gaining in the global economic system waging war against is making case a former head of the division at the international monetary argues that the long term china comes out a winner no matter economy would surely suffer if the united states were to impose a percent tariff on nearly billion worth of imports the united states absorbs only percent of but it is healthiest export market fears of protectionism are already stoking capital flight from china but china might be better placed than the united states to take the blow and it would certainly an editorial in global a communist party is probably not far off in its warning that action would batch of orders will be replaced by airbus auto and sales in china will suffer a and soybean and maize imports will be china has several ways to retaliate it could bar companies from doing business with businesses it could limit access to essential as it did in response to a fishing dispute with japan by stopping exports of rare earth minerals essential to the

might deploy against it would remain the victim in the eyes of many a champion for the cause of open trade even if trump is just as many of his allies to gain leverage in some future much of the damage has been done his bluster has changed the perception of the role the united states will play in the world in the face of a turn toward populist nationalism in other rich countries like and china has emerged in the unlikely role of defender of capitalism is the one major power still talking about increased said a china specialist at the institute is the only major country in the world projecting the idea that brings and that is the united loss a great many countries in the developing world still believe prosperity depends on their successful integration into the supply chains that traverse the global economy by turning inward a move already reinforced by the rejection of the partnership the united states appears to have little to offer trade conveyed that point only a few days

support proposed free trade area of the pacific ditto for and according to a senior official in are also now seeking to join the trade initiative certainly every economy in the region sees its future lying more closely linked with the former told me trump talking about withdrawing from trade deals and making allies pay for it will be tough for countries to resist and if actions against china start

with the presidential election less than a week my optimism has given way to panic panic you up until now i had done a somewhat decent job of not allowing myself to imagine the trump winning but as election day looms and the racism and sexism that infects campaign is ratcheted hard not to be the past a newspaper endorsed trump and white supremacists announced their plan for widespread voter intimidation trump shouted antisemitic invective at and a historically black church in was burned and scrawled across the side another woman came forward to accuse trump of sexual and a official called a fear and loathing the us election inspires projectile vomiting read a political divide between left and democrats and an immeasurable moral chasm and so i understand why been easier for many horrified by trump to simply pretend no way that he could actually win the presidency imagining the hatred underlying his campaign and politics being emboldened in this way is just too much to bear if trump wins a even if it is unlikely what will our country look what will happen to not just at a policy but in schools and in how much more afraid will immigrants and people of color have to become that be ripped from their homes or killed on the street by the very people tasked to protect part of the problem is that we already know the answers to these been living election has uncovered something vile about that so many people would support a despicable candidate is not news to those hurt every day by sexism and we know alive and well in our country been dealing with it our whole lives but to see this hatred on such unapologetic display is something else entirely even if trump this simply a bad dream that awaken from on common refrain heard from supporters is that better than this the the harassment but if this race has shown us that not better than this the bigotry and misogyny who we are what this country was built on and even if wins next who we will remain as wonderful as it will be to watch the first woman win the presidential it undo the truth of who we are the deplorable people who feel they no longer need to hide their hatred going anywhere after election no matter what i suppose my panic about the possibility of a trump after all about the reality of the moment win or lose about the slime risen to the the stink we wash off with one election or one president we need to panic about the because the present already contains more horror than we can elections

in the postscript to the us the inability of pollsters to support in key swing from through the rust belt to and is being widely were these trump were they did they hide themselves in plain the same discredited pollsters now say white women carried trump to victory but it was more than that in north with its rapidly changing the polls predicted a tight race the candidates visited the state almost each fishing for the electoral college votes in her final campaign rally on the eve of was on stage there with lady gaga hours she learned she had lost the state to trump by four a loss that did not guarantee his victory but strongly suggested the result last many who kept their trump support private have began to reveal themselves as with the referendum the decision has caused familial rifts north voters explain their was freaked out about because there were emails that never know what was in there to not let the review them after been a huge concern for me i voted for because he wanted to bring change and unity was more talk than walk and more transparency would have been good i have a lot of friends who voted for if kept sanders have been more inclined to go toward but i liked trump on trade because true losing a lot of jobs to china was not my first pick but from a military family and i believe had any respect for the military any military person who destroys emails and lies about it would be buried underneath the jail trump was disgusting because of what he said about but he was the lesser of two evils i think everybody should be deported not not racist and i believe she is we need a strong military because we live in crazy world twitter for the was in the chair too long she knows her way around truth but trump is a man you have to be a politician to be a you just have to know how to better yourself seen those shows and he was good with and we need a very strong man i like to see who someone is you are who you are at least not the kind of person to get in the white house as one thing and then boom who i really am i know who he is up front plus they were not going to treat her right as a they going to treat her fairly a small businessman and never did anything for small business except tie us up in red tape he offered hope and but it change for the at least not for business people the south has traditionally been very poor the democrats offered something for free but i want something for free my granddad was an immigrant from his business is now third generation i think a a fool if he has his own business and a democrat trump appeals to me because i think going to shake things up ready for change worried about speaking his mind sure he a but he was talking about the working man and bringing back jobs not a got his own money so he really be bought seen enough dirt on bill and it seemed like an old story and we needed a change i think going to shake it up i like it when he said it was time for republicans and democrats to work to bring back to where it was before great i make enough from a job to pay for health insurance but i have to admit to you what my grandmother the were in times were but times they are the old bob thing usually vote independent but this time i voted trump because things working the economy bounced back like they wanted it to my wife and we struggle i like business sense he could get rid of the fraud and unnecessary expense had a lot of experience but it all good experience her trustworthy stuff was big for me the investigations and stuff might be normal for a lot of but it normal or appropriate for me a businessman it bother me he went into bankruptcy not every idea can be a great idea and he climbed out of that elections
it is no use pretending presidential election victory is a disaster for the united states and the world it at least in a victory for prejudice and for ignorance and spite it represents the triumph of economic nationalism and introspection over internationalism and the global good it is a victory built on fabrications because of will ultimately confounded by its contradictions and its immorality it will be defeated but correcting this deformation will not be easy it will take time and the damage will be explanations have been offered for defeat last week all have an element of truth for she was an uncharismatic figure the democratic base was uninspired and many stayed at home doubts surrounded her past not least in respect of the foundation in many she represented a discredited political establishment there was about her candidacy an sense of entitlement there was her ambiguous legacy and was a reaching up to a place of power no woman has ever gone a mostly unspoken misogyny undoubtedly played a part in her the complacency of the democratic party and liberal too comfortable after eight safe years of did a great disservice the party and its elected representatives badly misread the mood of the nation for the most did independent pollsters and the us media they initially dismissed trump as a clown and then with to give him too easy a these factors contributed to demise but they are not the whole story trump won because he successfully tapped the alienation and disillusionment of white men and women who comprise of the electorate and turned out for him in large numbers as polling breakdowns the determining factors were not education or not religion or not sexual predations or entanglements they were race and linked to economic distress trump exploited a feeling among whites from all suburban and that inclusive and was not working for were significant numbers of people who felt their grievances were no longer being listened to by a centrist party that had loosed itself from its moorings as frank said in these pages last democrats went from being the party of town in to the party of vineyard of the and they did so at roughly the same time that the republicans were sharpening their deadly image of the of the constituency that switched to trump was railing against a sense of being overlooked during eight years of president race unquestionably played a part when trump shrieked his slogan great what he was really saying was white when he spoke about curbing immigration and building a when he minorities and people from foreign countries he does not know or when he vowed to scrap international trade deals that he claims are destroying jobs in the when he railed against selfish allies who do not pay their the subliminal message was always the fear of the foreigner in conjured the illusion of a return to a society of secure safe and agreed values no wonder and other minorities are frightened no wonder us relations around the globe are in turmoil and populists and hard are celebrating no wonder observers speak of the end of the west and the demise of liberal democracy has stormed the shining city on a betrayed the founding fathers who stood tall for human dignity and universal rights and now presages an isolationist made in image a beacon of discrimination and are the peculiarities of the electoral system to too won a majority of the popular vote but was handsomely beaten in the race for electoral college votes and too little attention was paid to the effect of a decision by the supreme court in when it struck down a key part of the voting rights act of by a five to four vote what this did was allow nine states with long records of voting such as south to no longer seek federal approval to change their laws the effect was seen last week as the what has been happening in north a battleground state with a history of racial discrimination in voting republican lawmakers and officials have gone to remarkable lengths to drive down turnout among black who disproportionately there were numerous other examples across the including stringent voter id rules that the federal government had stated earlier this year had a disproportionate effect on minorities for the leader of the free world to allow voter suppression is beyond supporters and opponents alike are about to discover is that like the billionaire is much of what he promised on the campaign trail will not be delivered or will be so watered down as to make no says he will cut raise public spending and slash the federal deficit impossible all at once trump says he will renegotiate or scrap and other treaties but his conceit that this will help uncompetitive in or in is says he will slap swingeing tariffs on but he knows the geopolitical and commercial realities mean he will not he says he will make strong and its then kowtows to the most formidable strategic and undermines he says he will be best friend but his campaign was not above antisemitic trump voters really believe the border wall they need a reality check the power of us presidents to act unilaterally in or any other domestic is extremely circumscribed trump would face endless legal challenges and he would need agreement and funding from prospect that much of what trump has promised or threatened will not happen is welcome perhaps the responsibilities of office will temper his worst producing a the incoherence and contradictory nature of his economic ideas for boosting growth and jobs and moribund industrial areas suggest his grassroots supporters are destined for disappointment economic performance is what will ultimately define the trump has plenty of other horrors in while volatile personality and inexperience add extreme at home and to a host of other worries trump now has the opportunity to stack the supreme court with conservative reactionaries
by the time b the leading ideologue of the movement and the final speaker of the rose to address a gathering of his followers on the crowd was restless in hours of speeches and panel discussions in a federal building named after a few blocks from the white a succession of speakers had laid out a harsh vision for the but had denounced violence and said that citizens and black had nothing to fear earlier in the himself had urged the group to start acting less like an underground organization and more like the establishment but now his tone changed as he began to tell the audience of more than mostly young what they had been waiting to hear he railed against with a quoted propaganda in the original he belonged to white whom he called the of the a race of conquerors and creators who had been marginalized but in the era of j were to their own as he several audience members had their arms outstretched in a salute called hail our and the translation of the exhortation the room shouted back these are exultant times for the which was little known until this when it embraced campaign and he appeared to embrace it back he chose as his campaign chairman k the media executive who ran the most prominent and then named him as a senior adviser and chief strategist now the leaders hope to if not a seat at the at least the ear of the trump white house while many of its racist views are well known that president or may as well of foreign that the black lives matter movement is another name for black race that even the children of undocumented immigrants should be deported the has been difficult to define is it a name for political provocateurs in the or is it a political movement defined by xenophobia and a dislike for political at the conference on who said he had coined the defined the as a movement with white identity as its core idea crossed the in terms of said at the which was sponsored by his the national policy institute and while much of the discourse at the conference was overtly racist and demeaning toward for much of the day the sentiments were expressed in ways that seemed intended to not sound too menacing the focus was on how whites were marginalized and beleaguered one peter the founder of an asked if had the national council of la and had the whites were reluctant to organize for their rights some speakers made an effort to distance themselves from more notorious white power organizations like the but as the night wore on and most reporters had gone the language changed speech began with a polemic against the before he briefly paused we should refer to them in the original he said the audience immediately screamed reviving a word that means suggested that the news media had been critical of trump throughout the campaign in order to protect interests he mused about the political commentators who gave trump little chance of winning wonders if these people are people at or instead soulless he referring to a fable about the a clay giant that a rabbi brings to life to protect the was victory of a phrase that echoed the title of the most famous propaganda film but then with a the leader who advocated a homeland in quoting his famous we will it is no the united states had been turned into corrupted but it was not supposed to be that way until this last a white country designed for ourselves and our thundered is our it is our and it belongs to but the white he is race that travels forever on an upward be white is to be a an a he said more members of the audience were on their feet as described the choice facing white people as to or of other exploit other we gain anything from their presence they need and not the other way the ties between the movement and the trump team are difficult to even by members of the was the chief executive of an news organization that has fed the lie that is a as recently as last published an article urging that every every picket every telegraph pole in the south should be festooned with the confederate battle told mother this year that was now platform for the but in an interview last week with the wall street said that the was only tiny of the viewpoint represented on definition of the is younger people who are very terribly he told the adding that the had racial and when asked about the speakers said that they might have shaken his hand on but that they did not know him well said that he had met earlier this before he ascended to he said he had told that he was doing great work at recalled to the audience as for said he had met him about years ago at a affinity in but that was it and are not adding that they had opportunistically seized on two issues that the cares most about stopping immigration and fighting political correctness and used them to mobilize white voters said that while he did not think the should be considered do think we have a psychic or you can say a deeper with trump in a way that we simply do not have with most white he is at the core of both the movement and the trump even if most voters for trump willing to articulate it as at various he and other speakers outlined where they differed from trump they see him as too beholden to they do not see any reason to start a trade war with and they are not necessarily opposed to the nuclear deal for immigration is the most potent mobilizing less for economic reasons than

i have spent years pushing against a patriarchy that tries to tell me what to look what to who to demur and that there are many things that i do because female the weaker i gave birth i be balled up on the ground if kicked in the groin tiring and it takes a toll and keep pushing in my own steady way for frank has taken the white house and he has the liberals to to leave sexism out of his response piece wholesale one and to choose to use the word toward the end of his a word which conjures up images of women has a man been called leaves me frustrated and tired whom sure is a wonderful person in many is as sexist as the next and faced his own inner or not you think had the best interest of the lower class and working middle class in for frank to say that she really that her email server was a real issue and that would have been a better choice is just a cloak for his inability to face himself in the his or to the detriment of at least of half of frank is not alone in his unacknowledged sexism even when we pit a woman against the least competent candidate we could for arguably the most important job there our society as a whole stomach voting for her voters literally stayed home from the polls rather than elect a woman throw this frank article in the virtual trash where it and instead read response articles penned by feminists all we have work to amid the negativity and strong words about the result of the presidential it is important that we stay positive and true to our morals and unlike trump as a young feminist and member of the younger i can certainly say that i will not tolerate revolting words against women and those who fit his of a perfect citizen from i am reminded of the standards of how men should behave towards with respect and events of this year have taught and to me the importance of staying positive and not letting morals and standards slip because of the of a leader such as trump has particularly to women and that anything is possible if you truly and that women can be and are champions for this as she said in her is still much work to be and the only way we will aid the work ahead is if we stand together with positive energy and hope against people like fear and in an otherwise searching article falls prey to the same negativism in attitudes toward women politicians that writing about while it is true that staggering of white women voted against it is not true that a female candidate did not carry even the female some of women voted for not all but all is it possible that we are appalled by his have underestimated is it possible that the unpleasant vilification of and ludicrous promises were his carefully calculated pose to woo those voters he as disillusioned with the establishment and longing for that the wall was never going to be that the secretary of state was never going to be sent to that the clampdown on communities could be quietly that would survive and trade treaties would remain is where he wants to be he will have real power he will use it to get what he really wants he is a a negotiator he knows how to choose and use talented people who can deliver his goals let us by all means be fearful of what those goals might but let us also look beyond the smokescreen of his performance in the campaign listen to the change of tone of his carefully emollient victory speech remember how he the other contenders and shrugged off the disdain of the republican hierarchy let us hope that liberals will not write him off as a fool who cannot possibly it is interesting to reflect that while all recent us presidents w have made very public professions of attachment to the trump does not appear to share this none of his frequent utterances over the last year have alluded to and his actions and words during the election campaign were hardly those of a quite the opposite so we may reasonably assume that the tea party religious a key influence in his is now headed up by an amoral infidel that would be one of the weirder outcomes of how come liberals encourage violence while exercising their freedom of speech this is something never understand you always speak of love and understanding when making conservatives knuckle under to your yet when you get your way after a fair election you unhinge like a crazed old property foul language and disrespect for the individual and country this is a liberal who loses your hypocrisy is the protesters in cities all appear to be in the twenties this is the particularly if they are who have been brought up on the shibboleths of political safe spaces and cultural while being protected from viewpoints and literature running counter to their sensibilities all of these are bound to trump democracy they must be at a time of great uncertainty and anxiety following the election of we should seek inspiration from the recent past the say you want a exhibition currently at the museum charts the exhilarating optimism of the late when millions of

victory over have been possible without the support of white evangelical voters for nearly four white evangelicals have been a mainstay of the republican and no small matter by some one in four voters fit that meaning that white evangelicals constitute one of the most reliable voting election was no exception to the rule exit polls suggest that four out of five white evangelicals turned out as usual and cast their lot with trump what seems different this is the candidate for whom they voted since jerry founded the in white evangelicalism has sought to position itself as the moral voice of the nation for the most that has translated into unwavering support for socially conservative politicians and by a strong sense of individual piety hence the designation of white evangelicals as by most deviates sharply from this norm as the has succinctly put trump is and until all of which flies in the face of professed evangelical standards combined with his and trump seems more than a far cry from the whom evangelicals claim to love and his campaign and now the apparent contradiction between trump and evangelical values has been the focus of much of the some prominent evangelicals to their credit sought all along to raise the red urging their flock to think twice about lining up behind trump less sympathetic observers have understandably charged white evangelicals with blatant partisan criticisms make some but they take us very far in understanding white evangelicalism as a social and political phenomenon evangelicals may very well consider themselves but the emphasis has never really been on the perceived moral uprightness or religious bona of the candidate in question always nice when the two appear to line but the heart of contemporary white evangelicalism lies in advocating for a set of social policies more important than individual proclivities is stemming the tide of what they see as widespread cultural promise to great hit the right note in this respect for many white a great is a and a is one whose laws are socially conservative and geared towards evangelical much of the focus has been on politics and issues related to family values and religious and trump sounded all the right notes here he also smartly solidified himself as a friend to evangelicals by choosing mike a socially evangelical as his running racially charged rhetoric played right into the hands of white evangelicals as well although white evangelicals may often express a desire to love their as in reality the commandment is selectively applied anyone considered and deemed a threat to evangelical which includes a narrow vision of what looks is on the other side of the fabled at the end of the that war is based in a particular conception of filtered through the lens of religious identity and social conservatism not that four out of five latched sure most white evangelicals would balk at the charge of racial but the overall motivation in backing trump has never been much of a secret safe to say that for many trump never represented any sort of and most under any illusion about the direction of his moral compass but for white god works even through the and work must and will be involved this time around is as old as the moral about protecting some modicum of evangelical identity and social values against a perceived onslaught of antagonistic liberalism more specifically in regard to this white evangelical support for trump was and is all about appointing judges to the supreme court also about enacting laws that they hope will put a stop to what they consider as threats to religious even if the latter border on discrimination white in other are playing the long and that has nothing to do with who trump is as an may all sound but just what white evangelicalism is in the us although laden with the rhetoric of personal it is primarily a social and political and we would do well to view it in such terms as this election has made white evangelicals will also stop at nothing in their attempt to establish their version of a that includes supporting someone like who told them exactly what they wanted to hear it was a match made in elections

the nightmare truly began when trump threw out of a press conference in august last year some might argue it was when he called immigrants the month but the beast yet yet been given a clear face or back to trump shouted as was escorted out of the room the familiar syntax was not lost on us who have been told to for as long as been in the united whether we were born here or he was forcibly was criticizing trump for effectively saying he would deport million undocumented people and build a border wall trump skirted those but that was the reality of what he was proposing we were put in a familiar place where we are merely numbers or parasites to the seen not for our worth as human beings but for our worth as an old proverb the bad good when i first delved into the world of i used to hold the saying in contempt it seemed to feed into the bottomless humility of the in the face of the immigrant the who want to make a fuss it painted i as a people who merely stood by while bad things happened to the trump being its first i felt we were in that helpless place where our only option was to endure the slogan make great again encapsulated exactly how we are seen in this country we are the unclean our culture dilutes the purity of white citizens who must be protected from us make great again by kicking us out violence against at trump rallies and across the country xenophobia and racism were whipped into a fever pitch by the his constant attacks on our families and our neighbors them was a phrase i heard more in those months than i ever had in my life have to go became a common response to everything i wrote something had was attack on us district court judge p born in and of that saw our worst fears begin to take shape in reality then the presumptive republican accused who was overseeing a class action lawsuit against trump of being biased simply because of his heritage unauthorized immigration in the us about million people live in the us without legal down from a peak of about million in net unauthorized immigration has been roughly even since according to there are about million unauthorized migrants either working or looking for or of the labor force since more have been leaving the us than likely due to a slow economic recovery since the recession and stricter border has deported more than million more than any other president his executive orders protect at least million people from remember watching the debacle unfold and this is how silence us as all of us for it has never been about immigration been about stoking racism against brown against black against the a member of a club or society very strongly trump said of is all fine but i say got it back to this is what he meant when he said he would make great took a dip into the absurd with the infamous mayo taco bowl tweet smiling and without as if he advocated for the mass deportation of our people and called us criminals and love was beyond many hope that the long nightmare is about to draw to a close but trump could still pull off a win and even if he the trump machine will roll with or without him we have on our hands a significant population of angry white citizens who blame us for all their frustrations things are about to get worse for not happens in cycles last mass deportation of and happened during the great depression approximately million and were rounded up and ejected from the country and leading up to xenophobia in the republican party was already the norm trump merely brought the subtext to the it and added several exclamation points a recipe for used to hate the but now i think of it daily it helps me survive the daily inanities of the election the daily ways we are dehumanized not putting on a smile and pretending the bad times happening it is a radical act of survival it is a resolute affirmation in the face of i will make it through this i will live to see the better elections
for restless conservatives were told to wait wait until the republicans controlled the house wait until they had the senate as well wait until they occupied the white house they have all three and one of the biggest unknowns facing j trump is how long they will wait for him as trump begins putting together a the ideological purists of the hard suspicious that his campaign pledge to upend will give way to business as are already watching warily as he makes his initial personnel and policy choices am advising trump to the conservative radio host savage said this week if he loses his base on the first going to happen in the first for even decision to appoint k a champion of the nationalist and populist movement that helped fuel his was not enough they still attacked his choice of a career party as chief of staff some on the right are already publicly pressuring trump to keep republicans they deem too ideologically soft out of his a process evident on in a battle over who will choose and lead the new foreign policy and national security teams as trump adjusts to his role as head of the republican party an institution that he and many of his followers criticized as too disconnected from its base the must reconcile a sprawling and the ideological crosscurrents it with the demands of an impatient group of conservatives in congress and beyond who are less inclined than ever to compromise on their principles going to have to either eat their eat trump or get used to said rich editor of national review and an influential conservative commentator nothing else that ever trump starts with an advantage he is not tainted as a member of the political elite the populist right wants to take down but to achieve his boldest campaign a professed master deal has to find a way to get his agenda past a house speaker he does not fully d and the conservatives in congress who do not share his views on issues including trade and increased government spending on infrastructure trump has to reconcile the conflicting factions of his while giving voters what they said they wanted most from a new change in the way works the tensions are already visible in the transition planning on the departure of mike a former republican congressman aligned with the more traditional conservative signaled how the players within orbit are exerting influence no sci do what your customer said representative a republican himself an insurgent conservative who won a primary two years ago to end the career of the republican majority leader at the said he believed trump could afford to be aggressive because people elected him bring the fight to as someone who displays little ideological consistency and has a long history of backing away from his toughest trump has priorities that remain fuzzy one of his first likely acts as would pit him against many of the conservatives in his a trillion infrastructure plan and he is already sowing confusion about his commitment to dismantling the affordable care act after saying late last week that he would like to retain certain like the provision that lets young adults stay on their plan going to be the problem said the former republican national committee chairman who has helped informally advise trump the people who pulled him over the finish watching to you empower us to help you drain the or are you just going to add more swamp the conservatives who found a hero in trump through his brand of populism are not likely to be placated by and conciliations are and we need to make sure that there are qualified people around said chief executive of heritage action for a conservative policy group said he was encouraged by what he had heard so far from trump republican party is a party gotten by repeating said it speaking to where a lot of are trump he know in short order how that all works what could be especially dangerous for trump is the combustible nature of the populist politics he inflamed and its especially in its tea to turn on its own it is a movement that always seems in search of a fight is the and this is the laura a conservative radio told her audience the other day is your victory take a little time to savor and then got to gear up because there are a lot of battles to fight whether those battles are the same as those trump wants is another issue altogether how trump meets the expectations of his base on the subject of illegal immigration will be one of his biggest tests no other issue animated it more but trump has sent conflicting signals about whether he intends to follow through on the great he vowed to erect along the border with backing away from that perhaps the promise of his would no doubt induce anger and anxiety among some though others seem willing to grant him some leeway he talked about technology and how we need a barrier between the two said representative r republican of who campaigned across the country for trump and speaks to his team regularly of it is virtual some of it is trump will also have to contend with public opinion in determining how hard to push he is poised to enter office with the dubious distinction of being seen as the and chief executive ever research exit polls of tens of thousands of voters found that nearly four in said they would be if he was more than six in said he had the wrong and about the same amount said he was unqualified to do the job weakening his hand trump did not win the presidency in an electoral wave that swept into congress conservatives devoted to following the trump agenda in

say what you like about past presidents and their international but hard to dispute the caliber of their national security henry to from to sandy from rice to the list is a long line in seasoned and strategic now decision to pick gen as his most senior national security aide is a rupture with the past and with sane foreign is a conspiracy theorist and who hangs around the darker corners of the white nationalist he also lost his last job in the intelligence i suspect because he manage his way out of a paper of which would be mildly amusing if about to take on a job that will determine the immediate fate of large parts of the national security adviser plays a unique role inside the west wing unlike almost every other corner of the national security is unquestionably controlled exclusively by the trump and make bush and look like tenured professors of military of declaring war and obtaining a defense the president needs nobody to unleash the most powerful intelligence services and diplomatic is why the national security adviser is normally a wise character who can sift through mountains of maintain a clear sense of strategic priorities in the national and wrangle the sprawling are all qualities that are hardly obvious in has falsely claimed that law is spreading across the united states and that the nation is in the midst of a world war with radical of is he tweeted earlier this previously ran the defense intelligence agency but lost his job after two years because of clashes with officials for his claims he was fired because he opposed the view that terrorists were a fading his new appears very comfortable with the current working with the propaganda network he apparently received classified intelligence briefings while running a lobbying firm for foreign clients he seems to favor working with to combat terrorists while turning a blind eye to designs on and its support for the regime in trusted sitting in on his daily intelligence early record on advising the is shockingly haphazard at best and unethical at the brief time since he won the first call with a world leader was not with a trusted us ally but with the dictator president he sat with prime minister of japan this but his aides told the not to believe every word trump said he met with the populist right wing politician before meeting the prime minister may but he somehow found time to meet with several real estate developers to discuss his property interests with and the trump organization signed a deal on his many interactions with foreign trump is speaking without briefing papers from the state department because his transition team is in such chaos that they have yet to establish meaningful contact with the foreign policy of a are condemned to repeat history if we choose to forget it and voters have chosen to forget the lessons of the last republican eight years of recovery from the catastrophe of w national security we are now staring at the prospect of an even more impetuous set of trump and make bush and look like tenured professors of military history never mind that trump spent most of the presidential campaign pretending he opposed war in when in fact he supported it so far as anyone can fathom his it was to pick the winning position after the outcome was a leader is both boastful and the leadership vacuum is filled by aides who feed into the posturing but compensate for the indecision fills that hole we know where this leads manipulated intelligence reports to build a case for the war in that was the single worst us national security decision in a generation we are still living with its consequences with and a global refugee crisis that is unthinkable without the national security was unable to control the hawks inside the even as she leaned towards the doves need to control any because he is leading the opportunity for to cherry pick intelligence is almost limitless with his public hatred of and his desire to wage a war of the case for military action will be simple inside the trump west may be time to concede that one of the biggest winners of this election is the twisted and murderous distilled by bin laden unlike bush and trump and believe we are engaged in a war with just as and believe they are engaged in a war with and the have infected their enemies with their own sickness to be this infection had been growing for many years before trump started running for office it broke out when congress democrats and republicans voted against the closure of bay it is obvious in much of the refusal to deal with the refugee crisis but now the sickness has given us trump and to escalate a war that is picking as his most powerful national security trump has confirmed what was obvious all along he will govern as he no matter what his aides say to reassure the anxious national

one of first tweets in the days after winning the election was in reference to his controversial comments on nuclear states today that believes countries should acquire nuclear how dishonest are they i never said watching nuclear assurance occur on twitter is a new the of is that he said this in he said it multiple different times during the campaign in the world of nuclear deterrence and where often the role of the united states has been to assure its allies that it remains committed to their as well as to the goal of nuclear words how foreign could test trump finger on the trigger read in south with one eye on a pugnacious and have very likely been paying close attention and if under a trump presidency policy towards the of nuclear weapons it would have deep and wide ramifications for our region and a town hall earlier this year in then republican candidate trump was asked for his thoughts on nuclear have so many countries already you have so many you have so many countries right now that have them you in a certain have japan have nuclear weapons when north has nuclear that trump called into question what has been a bipartisan policy in the united states for the better part of the last the of nuclear when numerous comments on nuclear deterrence and proliferation over the course of the difficult to assemble much from the in the same interview trump also said not proliferation i hate nuclear more than any i want more nuclear a week later when pressed to clarify whether he believes there is a nuclear arms race on the trump doubled they in be better off if they defend themselves from north including with including with has raised the question of commitment to the nuclear which came into force in and has undoubtedly been a pillar of geopolitical stability the treaty has provided international civilian nuclear energy and verification for the vast majority of countries in the world that have signed on yet the treaty does have its problems it been able to prevent all proliferation and north all sit outside the treaty and all have been able to develop their own nuclear weapons there is also growing frustration about the slow disarmament efforts of nuclear armed states like the united states and countries voted at the united nations to begin negotiations on a global treaty to ban nuclear weapons along with many of those under their nuclear umbrella like voted against being said we are a long way from when john f during another us said that because of the spread of nuclear technology that or will have a nuclear capacity by the end of the presidential office in however the balance achieved by the treaty has always been including in a combination of us military forces in the region and the extension of the us nuclear umbrella to allies like south and has given ample reason for those countries not to pursue their own is particularly true for with north steady march towards a more capable nuclear popular opinion in south has grown in of a domestic deterrent earlier this polls ranged from to in of south acquiring its own nuclear in have also begun to air this possibility cannot borrow an umbrella from a whenever it said won a senior south parliamentarian in must be prepared and wear our own ways in which a trump presidency could affect read also has one of the most advanced nuclear energy sectors in the world and certainly has enough plutonium on hand to construct an arsenal rather quickly if it chose to less likely than south due to cultural and political factors but the potential is comments during the election will have already emboldened voices across the region that are in of relying on nuclear weapons for their own security regardless if trump walks back his stance on the the ability of to assure its allies has been damaged in the nuclear importance of this issue to security is clear a region where the united states steps away from its role in maintaining the nuclear would be fundamentally insecure for us the coming months when diplomats are attempting to focus the new trump administration on and lining up our own needs to be at the top of the
when j trump emerged from the haze of his surprise victory in the presidential one of his first calls was apparently to an early a controversial radio host and conspiracy theorist with a large following the the host of and the operator of the website says he fielded a phone call on from the thanking for his support the call served as a reminder that who has been repeatedly denounced in the mainstream news will remain someone whose support trump wants was just thanking me for fighting so hard for and for and thanking my listeners and supporters and to let me know that he was working really hard around the said in a telephone interview this week said he urged trump to hold to his pledges to after the corruption in the and at least remove a lot of the aides to trump declined to respond to an email seeking comment on the phone call as a trump generated headlines when he appeared on radio show during the republican primary contests for a nearly interview thanked him at the informing the candidate that he would be for the appearance on what is considered a fringe despite its large audience among more suspect stances are his insistence that the shooting at sandy hook elementary school in was a hoax and that the government is creating chaos by manipulating weather systems he has been loudly and roundly denounced by democrats and some republicans he is also a vocal opponent of trade and two issues that dovetailed with positions during the primaries think emerged as the single most powerful voice on the roger j stone a longtime informal adviser to said of it was stone who connected trump with months ago may laugh at his stone is reaching millions of and they are the foot soldiers in the trump said trump had promised to come on his radio show in the next few weeks and the radio host is positioning himself as someone who will hold trump accountable to the most voices in his party said he planned to hold the incoming president to his campaign promises that includes appointing cabinet members who will pursue investigations of he said if that does not people will be it will be an indication of a return to politics as he added who railed against the establishment news media throughout the also warned trump to keep listening to the voters who helped elect him among the interviews since his victory has been a traditional with the news program one of the most establishment venues in journalism he starts acting like divorced from us and care about turn against said of followers trump needs to complete only a portion of his he said he gets percent people will be he said
there was a moment where it seemed like the prophecy would come true reports came out of in turning out in droves to vote against trump we are the sprang up as a alongside people shared their inspiring pictures of the demographic that would stop it evaporated showed up for early and the majority did throw their support behind but no sleeping giant awoke one but it was whites in the rust and they voted overwhelmingly for did not behave as an unified front against a xenophobic candidate who called immigrants a chunk of them cast their votes for him in according to exit does not detract from the passionate opposition many feel for but it does give us reason to pause and consider why the popular narratives about this voting never pan particularly narratives the democratic party vote is a conservative bogeyman conspiracy theories abound about democrats letting into the country to boost their numbers a ridiculously view that reflect reality but the rote script democrats read from when talking about proving to be realistic either being able to speak seem to get amped as the democrats thought it and the idea that voters are automatic gets more cheap dates for the seem to hold water either in light of the exit missing on both fronts is a more critical look at the the and how internal politics in our communities create a more complex group of people than either party begin there is a definite current of conservatism present among some immigrant families a strong got so forget ideology that helps explain a more robust turnout for trump among than pundits expected reports also show a growing number of evangelical protestant who are abandoning also worth noting within marginalized groups including and black men were much more likely to vote for trump than even if support for in those communities ultimately outweighed it some of black male voters went for compared to just of black female voters we pretend trump appeal to some men of and that hints at misogyny in our we divorce any of this from voter restriction laws that target communities of or the way have been historically disenfranchised in our or the fact that the supreme court dismantled voter protection in v ultimately this election blindsided us on many fronts white women rebuke trump for his lewd the majority voted for him reject him and across the board men from all groups were more likely to support him all this is to there probably a sleeping giant waiting to propel democrats to power if the rise of a xenophobic demagogue who called us out by name enough to jolt it hard to imagine that outside of a presidential candidate from our would do so what we have on our hands instead is a complicated demographic comprising the conservatives and progressives that is consistently thrown under the single umbrella of in a way that simply happen for white people that was the old and it ought to be considered obsolete after this election the rules have the polls proved and a left that is not ready to adapt to these changes and will ultimately prove too weak to combat and whatever comes after
the election of j trump gives the republicans in congress a chance to act on their desire to get rid of a wish that trump mostly says he shares e and the health policy analysts for the then i think safe to say few in congress thought they would have this opportunity but like the proverbial dog who has finally caught the after untold futile republicans have finally come within reach of repealing the affordable care act now comes the essential will they actually do been promising it but i am still skeptical that it will happen i believe you disagree going to let you go first why do you think do i think do it because they so thoroughly own the idea of having passed bills to partly delay or the in the house something like times just the other day senator endorsed repeal the house and senate also agreed to do in large in a budget reconciliation bill earlier this year the only thing that prevented it was that president vetoed it i doubt trump would do the same if given a similar opportunity i know that a budget reconciliation dismantling of the law is not a full because according to the rules it can only touch provisions this excludes things like requiring insurers to take all comers for premiums that vary only by age and smoking status or preventing them from imposing coverage caps and lifetime among other measures i also must add that much less confident of a repeal partial without agreement on a replacement but turn it back to do you think the has to offer a full replacement to get its members to sign on to or can it offer something that would cover fewer people and with fewer i think they can get away with slightly fewer people and somewhat skimpier but not too much a part of me that thinks many in congress were always so willing to vote for a because they knew it had no chance of being signed into law they got credit for the vote without ever having to face the downside actually repealing without replacing would mean effectively stripping more than million people of their health without anything in return this would be an unmitigated political disaster the stories of people with diabetes and more who were suddenly stripped of their insurance and left out in the cold would very likely dominate our discussion for months that leaves more than enough time to lead to significant repercussions in the midterm elections with no democratic leaders in any branch of government to i think this would be akin to what happened in the but in reverse if they can coalesce around a plan that leave too many people then i think they could move forward but in all the years since the was republicans been able to do that do you think they what do you think that plan would look one way to get from repeal to replace that minimizes immediate political risk is to pass a plan that call for repeal for several at least after the though possibly after the election between now and there would need to be some kind of transition to whatever replaces that just dump people off coverage with no alternative but the alternatives could just be not as comprehensive or costly absolutely there will be bad stories but keep in there will be bad stories under too rocketing huge cost sharing and markets with few choices is not a recipe for political success republicans now own the task of fixing those things and doing so in a way that does not look as if making better actually in a tough policy spot get the blame if they fix or repeal the and get the blame if they replace it with something people like better health policy is a very difficult and thankless task i think opt for something they can call repeal and but they could also just let struggle and die neither looks good one other way to get out from under the issue is to kick it to the states do you think a trump working with a will offer greater flexibility to states to design their own coverage plans that could diverge from if what are some ideas states might i think very likely those in congress could punt to the states for been trying to change funding to a block grant that they can then constrain over time this will be enticing for them because it will allow them to reduce spending in the while forcing states to make the tough decisions and take the blame for cuts in either beneficiaries or services fixing the markets for those who are getting health insurance through the is a different story without some sort of market which generally been opposed the same problems that existed with respect to conditions and individual ratings will exist many people will become uninsured annual and lifetime limits could reappear lots of people will have problems getting insured i have yet to be convinced that a significant number of republicans in the house might coalesce around such a plan maybe for but not sure about the exchanges even if they likely the democrats in the senate would try to filibuster either of these plans you i think democrats would filibuster anything they could the filibuster is not set in stone a senate majority can change and some are already calling for the to do so but that appear to be what the senate will do retain the filibuster this could play to their since they can propose things they let the democrats filibuster them and take the blame when repeal kicks in with no replacement perhaps another way for republicans to get out of their political bind sure have more to discuss as president administration comes into power
earlier through his has said he does not have the experience to run a major federal yet there he cozying up to be the next secretary of housing and urban development what a neurosurgeon knows about housing policy is not but is clearly in the running you know our inner cities are in terrible and they definitely need some real he told fox news on there have been so many promises made over the last several decades and nothing has done the housing post was of the offers on the confirmed another name surfacing for a domestic cabinet former representative ford a moderate as possible transportation secretary why he is a frequent guest on and the has the ear a democrat who has been willing to ruffle feathers on exactly take herself out of the running to be education but she did push back at critics who do not approve of her visits to trump tower as it turns care all that much about private email server but there are consequences when his senior announced that the incoming administration would not pursue the investigation of private email the response from the right was swift blared the conservative website that promoted candidacy and gave him the mastermind of his k the conservative provocateur was no more subtle judicial the conservative legal organization that has doggedly pursued and former president bill also chimed ms said that it was now intention to move beyond the issues of the campaign and focus on the task of running the country instead trump can help her then perhaps a good ms said on the of the attorney general is supposed to be but things may not work the usual way with president trump think when the also the head of your tells you before even inaugurated that he wish to pursue these it sends a very strong tone and to fellow ms said w the former new city mayor who is expected to serve somewhere in the new told the news media at trump tower that the was making a tough call a tradition in politics that after you win an you sort of put things behind said if the decision he perfectly consistent with sort of a historical pattern of things come you say a lot of even some bad things might and then you can sort of put it behind you in order to unite the nation so if he made that i would be supportive of it also be supportive of continuing the but trump has lofty ambitions a former marine corps is no fan of which could present problems if he becomes secretary of defense because the is a really big fan as recently as trump said in a video that he would scuttle president energy and environmental regulations put in place to fight climate change to unleash coal and hydraulic fracturing yet in his meeting with times reporters and he seemed to soften on climate which he used to call a hoax the interim chairwoman of the democratic national took to medium to make the case that democrats need not but they do need to get back to work on the one she on the with republican gains in state the party is working off a structural disadvantage she as a trump proposed ramping up surveillance of mosques and a moratorium on compelling to a surge in registering to vote a lot of them actually voted for trump according to an exit poll of voters conducted by the council on or percent backed while percent supported that is nearly twice as much support as mitt the republican received from voters four years ago a spokesman for said strength with was somewhat but that about percent of do identify themselves as republicans and that did little direct outreach to were aspects of candidacy that either appealed to them or it was a vote against said might not necessarily have been as much a vote of confidence for trump as an expression of no confidence in the votes may have been since trump won which has one of the largest populations in the country by barely more than votes some of descent voted for believing he would support president of more there may have been a split in the rust where more generally favored trump of the post continues his dogged pursuit of the trump reporting that the charitable organization has apparently admitted that it violated the legal prohibition against that prohibition prohibits nonprofit leaders from using their money to help their or their families the news came in a tax filing for that was posted on the nonprofit tracking service on less than two weeks after election day trump famously told the world and during a presidential debate that he would appoint a special prosecutor if elected with the express purpose of putting his political opponent in jail there may be a practical reason the new president would pull back the latest tally shows leading trump in the popular vote by votes pursuing her might not prove very popular her leadership is being challenged the complaints about an aging slate of commanders are growing louder so representative of the house minority has issued a plan in a letter to house democrats on she promised to create no posts on each house committee to be

city ever since the election of j trump to the a has been thinking back to his childhood the cold war when his days as a young boy were filled with a anxiety that the might incite a nuclear war that could devastate north the same feeling of said a graduate of the school of economics whose work on legislation has been roundly praised in feeling that politics has become a source of anguish and uncertainty is really clouds have descended over miring it in a state of anguish and paralysis after the election of trump to the highest office in the world they are clouds of uncertainty and of and insecurity there were even actual storm clouds hanging over the capital in recent a literal echo of the state of mind may not affect people on the top of our but it can only mean bad news for us merchants and people in said a street vendor who owns a food cart in city outside of concerns about the violence has been soaring to levels not seen since the start of the drug war a decade ago and corruption and a loss of faith in the political leadership had already plunged the nation into a state of gloom the loss for many is too lot of people see the as a beacon of as something to aspire said who works on legislation and economic competitiveness what happens when you lose a role the role model of a now all of us who admired the are having second for most the election has been a grim exercise in a candidate who called immigrants and vowing to deport millions and build a wall to keep others has stoked insecurities in over sovereignty and respect from its northern neighbor and his victory was seen by some as validating the perception that or at least half of see through a knot of stereotypes never mind that rich culture and its art and are having a global say or that a wall between the two countries these days might actually keep more in the united states than given the recent research showing more are returning home than leaving to seek opportunity in are really in need of some said echoing the sentiment of dozens interviewed in the wake of election you need political leadership for and we are short on those president and his administration have adopted a diplomatic and hopeful posture toward presidency in a statement after the said the results a new chapter in the relationship between and the united which will imply a a but necessary to a big he was he that the relationship would be one of and mutual that would for both countries he also recounted that he had congratulated trump by phone earlier and that the men had discussed the possibility of meeting again in the coming months with total the course that the relationship between the two countries will have to behind the there was a deep worry regarding the most immediately the possibility of mass deportations of living in the united states the foreign ministry called back all the consuls general serving in the united states for meetings to discuss how to respond to the incoming administration other consular offices issued requests for to report harassment or as anger stirred by has turned into racial threats and violence in parts of the government has already expressed a willingness to renegotiate parts of the north free trade agreement but to statement seemed a missed opportunity to address the injury that many still feel by stance and the broad concerns about his threats regarding trade between the two nations an opposition senator representing the state of said that after enduring hostile discourse for a year and a deserved a more robust response from their president was a very light response to a very dangerous he said as trump prepared to take he needs to establish its position regarding the united states wall with clarity and are left with a politically light position that say he said settle for a statement that spoke with in in anticipation of a possible trump submitted bills that would strengthen hand the which have languished in the would allow the government to penalize investments in should trump follow through on his promises to tax or block remittances by in the united states to finance his proposed border wall the legislation would also make it explicitly illegal for the federal government to finance anything that could be interpreted as a border and it stipulated that if the united states decided to pull out of as trump has the legislature would review the dozens of agreements and treaties that govern the bilateral relationship in the government is in a difficult place some say their leaders must be careful not to antagonize the new president of the united states with their own incendiary given the economic importance holds in is worrying and frightening to know that the loud guy holding a stick in his saying he is coming to get to beat you is actually in power to do so said a lawyer business have begun the process of normalizing presidency though most executives have adopted a they are continuing with business as usual the rhetoric is very different from the actual business of said the head of the largest business consortium in and the chief executive of which runs movie theaters across the you have to face the reality of governing you have to look much deeper into the to see whether what you are proposing makes buys million worth of goods from the united states every year to run his from popcorn and nacho cheese to audio equipment if free trade were those purchases might be made from other he said few thought a trump presidency was possible now most are banking on a stark difference between candidate trump and president meaning that he will not be as harsh on as promised business

j trump sat down on with editors and columnists of the new times for an exclusive interview times reporters have annotated portions of the interview the full transcript is available here the personal interactions between president and trump have so far been but not clear that the moment will last has already indicated that he may weigh in against trump once the new administration takes especially if the new president attacks legacy achievements here is our story on the cordial meeting between trump and in the oval office trump is working to reset his mercurial relationship with the media as he looks toward assuming starting with this meeting at what he branded the new during his presidential campaign but he still nurses intense grievances toward news outlets in general and the times in particular here is more about relationships with the news media and the times trump is hinting that even though federal law does not require him to do anything specific to separate himself from his vast business he is inclined to submit to some sort of voluntary standard of ethics that would avoid conflicts of interest or their appearance but he leaves open the possibility that there may not be a way to accomplish it this story has more about business ties trump is correct that federal for the most exempts the president from conflict of interest meaning he is allowed to take actions that could benefit his financial holdings but in modern most presidents have voluntarily put their financial assets into blind trusts trump has said he does not intend to take such a instead will turn his companies over to his children read this story for more on potential conflicts of interest the wall street journal editorial among has suggested that the only solution to potential conflicts of interest is to sell off all of his and then have a blind trust reinvest the proceeds trump suggests that this is not practical crowds at rallies frequently targeted chanting her and referring to her as a criminal in trump himself encouraged a crowd in telling them starting to agree with as they chanted her in despite remarks the and the justice which have investigated email server and the conduct criminal inquiries largely independently of the white house a president attempting to intervene in those kinds of in any would be a major scandal here is our full story about reversal on prosecuting trump has been criticized for not specifically denouncing bigotry and groups that spread bigoted views his statements about such conduct tend to be including when he says disavow the that nonspecific language has been comforting to leaders of the a white nationalist including b who led a gathering at a federal building near the white house last weekend that included some audience members offering a salute trump here perhaps for the first that being president will perhaps help enrich his family he also concedes that the arrangement might fairly be called a conflict of interest back in when he was still a trump said definitively that torture was effective tell me it work torture he told an audience in south you half these believe it works so answer on offered a revealing insight into his willingness to shift or rethink a especially after talking with someone he respects gen n may well be secretary of and his rejection of torture clearly had an effect on the the reality is more complicated the number of factories and the number of who work in factories both have declined sharply in recent decades but the manufacturing output is at the highest level in history the production of like has been replaced by the largely automated production of like circuits in president signed a landmark law that prohibited the hiring of illegal provided new resources for enforcement along the border and offered legal status to several million illegal immigrants experts say the law did little to slow migration to the united but made crossing the border more difficult and dangerous premiums for many health plans under the affordable care act are increasing percent to percent or but increases of percent are extremely rare deductibles for many plans are but not for a family plan in the maximum including the is comments about his fellow republicans had a sharp edge and an implicit they owe their congressional majority to and he expects to be treated accordingly whether this is and to what will be one of the pivotal stories of the new trump and crucial to figuring out how much or how little he can get done he needs congress to achieve many of the campaign promises he including the deep tax cut and large infrastructure spending not to mention and it is an open question how with his policies republicans will prove to be read these stories for background on relationships with republican leaders in and the stalwarts who are pondering the future of the conservative movement trump suggests here that he may name his as a special envoy to the middle charged with making peace between the and the buried in this answer is an assertion by trump that the federal law does not apply to him as but he also says he would want to avoid the appearance of conflict installing as a special envoy could have that essentially giving him an important task that would allow him to be involved in national security deliberations without hiring him outright this is a role that was often discussed as a potential landing spot for bill if had won the white house
if trump actually cared about he would stop complaining about the demonstrably false myth he keeps peddling and instead focus on the real gerrymandering the changing of electoral boundaries for political gain of course never do since gerrymandering is a republican party and the only thing keeping the from losing the house of representatives this lies trump told this voter fraud and the election read signs point to trump suffering a rout in two with chances of victory north of or according to statistical analysis from both the new times and trump is the most unpopular candidate in modern and in elections be dragging the rest of the party to a historic defeat in congress as despite all almost no chance the republicans will lose control of the house of representatives this election or in the one after it since republicans in statehouses across the country have fixed the election process by redrawing the congressional district maps in several key states in they can retain a majority even when democrats received far more total votes post has a helpful graphic that explains exactly how gerrymandering salon editor in chief has a new book out on the subject and described how the republicans accomplished this feat in a recent it was a plan in they had to take control of all of the chambers in they sat down with some of the most skilled mapmakers in the and they drew lines with the express intent of using redistricting as a partisan hammer to lock in control of the house for the next results were dramatic as explained this voted for the house in democratic candidates won million more votes than republicans yet after the dust the ended up with a majority in the the liberal daily conducted a comprehensive study of gerrymandering in the house election and concluding that it cost democrats a net of seats in more than the they needed to claim a majority that and far more than the eight they actually did for which is generally a battleground state in presidential elections and is pretty evenly split between republicans and democrats because of the radical redistricting republicans implemented in they were able to carve up the map so that they have of house seats so a recent study showed you can predict the results of any race in with a virtual certainty just by knowing the political makeup of a particular can see how gerrymandering can manipulate election results in the excellent look at most gerrymandered in north which was so narrow at one point state representative mickey a democrat from once you drove down the interstate with both car doors kill most of the people in the united states district map would look radically different if rather than partisan drew the maps based on us census data why encouraging that president will reportedly make redistricting reform a central part of his plans given the extent to which it affects our an underreported problem and until it becomes a national it will has several effects beyond just making it easier for one party to control the majority of seats in the house it drives down voter since so many elections are lopsided and unopposed it increases polarization and deadlock in congress since a lot of congressional members have to worry about a serious challenger from the other party it also deprives minority groups of political a new the practice is almost as old as the country and democrats have engaged in it as well but no one has perfected it as well as republicans did in and until the practice is done away with once and for democracy will

week to go before voting unexpected and very public revelation that it is recommencing its investigation into conduct may not be politically but its timing certainly makes it appear that way the row represents yet another hammer blow to a democratic process whose credibility has been repeatedly principally by the unscrupulous republican this new stoked by republicans and it remains likely that voters will deliver a possibly rejection of trump on although opinion polls show the race tightening nationally and nothing is certain as a febrile campaign is ahead almost everywhere that matters and she is the sane and if choice a trump defeat will be richly deserved as we have noted he is not a fit and proper person to serve in the white house his during a raucous and often embarrassingly vulgar

j trump ran for president boasting that he knew more about fighting terrorists than generals but now that trump is the he is spending a great deal of his time with retired and those of a particular commanders when they were often at odds with president one has been named as national security and several others are candidates for coveted positions in his cabinet or are advising him on how to confront the greatest threats they would give his foreign policy a far more aggressive cast than turning to the retired officers reflects preference for having even men around him but it worries national security experts and even other retired who say that if trump stacks critical jobs purely with it could lead to an undue emphasis on military force in foreign policy you have too many generals in the the dish is likely to be baked with even more military instruments said john a a retired army lieutenant colonel and an expert in counterinsurgency strategy not sure the recipe the united states needs for every foreign policy inclination toward generals in top jobs also runs counter to the credo of civilian control of the military a constitutionally enshrined principle that some say safeguards the united states from becoming another or where the military is a political player in the last trump has met with n a retired marine corps who has emerged as a leading candidate for

history of these generals with his predecessor is less a liability than a credential is sticking his tongue out at the prior said h a professor emeritus of history at the university of north at chapel hill who has written about civilian control of the military is inherently distrustful of the military people that the system throws up at him he thinks not strong people they are trump might also view generals in his administration as a political asset at a time when trust in institutions like congress and the news media is the military remains enduringly popular general in commands wide respect from uniformed men and women especially who revere him as one of their own on trump wrote on twitter that general was a k the chief said the incoming administration was looking at potential cabinet

aides to j trump announced night that his transition team would not include lobbyists and that members of the administration would be barred from lobbying for five years after they left government service the made in the first transition conference call with was an attempt to make good on promise to the in it was also a reaction to criticism that some of the original transition team members were lobbyists from interests they were being assigned to oversee under the announced by a transition lobbyists joining the trump team would have to terminate their formal registration to lobby aides to trump said several of the firings in recent days were part of an effort to enforce the new though they declined to reveal any names others have described the firings as part of an effort by to rid the transition of connections to gov of new who was ousted last week as the head of the transition aides have denied those reports lobbying ban will require administration members to agree that they will not lobby the federal government for five years after they leave service federal lobbying bans now last generally for one or two depending on the office t a government ethics compliance lawyer who has worked on several republican presidential said plan would expand restrictions devil is in the he said if it is as they described a ban on becoming a federal lobbyist would constitute a real and significant measure to fight the revolving door that happens in president sought to carry out similar restrictions aimed at limiting the influence of lobbyists but his imposed as an executive order at the start of his first required that officials agree to not lobby the executive branch of government until the end of the administration those rules had little effect on revolving door since the rules only applied to officially registered many former administration officials declined to register as lobbyists but still effectively performed as advisers or consultants in his administration may not be able to prohibit former administration officials from lobbying house and senate members unless congress itself passes legislation imposing a ban for all federal employees that move is given that hundreds of capitol hill staff members and some members of congress leave their jobs every year to become lobbyists the current congressional ban is no more than two and in some cases there is no ban at all it was not clear whether the lobbying ban would apply to committee that is raising money for the inauguration and the rule could discourage some otherwise qualified people from working in the administration because their financial prospects would be limited later but told reporters that trump was committed to the idea going out of government be able to use that service to enrich themselves for a said during the briefing on ethics advocates welcomed the move although they were unsure if the ban would remain in effect is incredibly needed to try to change the said who works at the campaign legal a nonprofit and is a registered lobbyist a signal that needs to be sent to
on the night trump was elected the next us one of his fellow nationalist populist politicians chose to implement chaos in a land not famed for order in a surprise address the prime announced that all and notes would be withdrawn immediately from circulation at a stroke rendered of currency worthless outside a bank branch old notes would have to be exchanged for limited supplies of new currency it was justified as a move designed to fight corruption and target people who have been dodging taxes by holding stockpiles of known in as initially saw the withdrawal of banknotes as a price worth paying to eliminate graft the impact of has been the trillion economy will shrink the rich will not as corruptly acquired fortunes have almost all been converted to gold and real estate but the who make up the bulk of the billion will lose out they generally have bank accounts and are often paid in cash for getting to a bank and for hours will cost money and time they have in less than a week the policy has reportedly claimed more than a dozen lives the government says that it will take weeks to sort out the is not new in which last tried it in a smaller way in the result then was higher bank deposits and a bump in the tax take yet the scale and speed of scheme has more in common with the failed experiments of dictatorships which led to runaway currency collapse and mass protests while campaigned to end it would have been better if the government had updated its antiquated tax system to such a incremental reforms do not make headlines they do not instantly hit the war chests of political rivals in upcoming state polls a was for a decade an international pariah over his alleged role in the mass murder of in a region he once administered he wants to be known for something else trump offers an opportunity to recast himself two years ago described victory as part of a but a looming cash crunch and an administrative crisis makes it look like the revolt might start at comments will remain closed on this and central

trump is coming to the end of one of the most dramatic and unpredictable us presidential campaigns in living scouring swing states for the undecided voters who might make a difference and who might be persuaded by his inflammatory message and swingeing assaults on his democratic as he campaigned in new and on a new side of the republican candidate emerged he was doing something he was being vote rallies are still raucous and he still fills them with wild accusations against a recent is that she ever gets into the oval and her corrupt friends would rob this country but his words have become more scripted and resembling less a guitar full of more a jazz musician riffing off a standard tune from the enthusiasm of crowds has not diminished thousands swarm at every stop on they came to new and the home of the chocolate in when the candidate asked is going to pay for the they shouted deliriously dressed in trump they were ready at the slightest provocation to chant her or trump seemed to sense something had changed when trotting out his newest the both a jibe at what he describes as a corrupt establishment in and a description of his willingness to clean it the candidate seemed almost unenthusiastic he has taken to when the line comes up in hated the he said on so often notes how frank hated singing my before he how much his audience loved it for trump the which could come from almost any insurgent political mounted by either is the same thing if his crowds chant he will go he is by no means hostage to his crowds on he guided them ensuring they booed the correct villain at the right be it the media or nondescript globalists intent on taking away us jobs and of the press corps have become his unwitting accessories they are penned while trump falsely insists that cameras are not showing the size of his rallies that claim goads the crowd into booing the who he insists are most dishonest at he will even call out reporters by has not provoked any incidents of physical violence yet the sensation is more like that of being an animal on display at the zoo trump supporters stand on the other side of the making faces and occasionally shouting tend to intensify as the hour gets later and who has rarely been punctual in recent falls further behind schedule by then the subjected to a loop of the same five songs for several are ready to let for all the passion and rage that trump there is a lack of the bizarre creativity that defined his early campaigning the candidate who compared the acclaimed neurosurgeon to a child molester and falsely said senator father was involved in the assassination of john f has been left that is the subject of multiple criminal investigations while he has made a epithet to rival his of former governor bush as or his nicknaming senator and it has not had the same issue is perhaps the lack of any new villains to accompany one of the most famous women in the world veering away from president trump rails against nameless special who he says ship jobs overseas and leave us borders open but these attacks are not delivered with the gusto he uses for individuals he is far more animated when calling for to fire her campaign john because described his candidate as having in a hacked than he is when reading a scripted attack on overall effect is of an rock living off the glory of past hits trump still takes time to recall when he came down famous at trump tower in new city to announce his campaign he will often relive moments of glory in his bid for the republican nomination ardent fans show up and buy the merchandise and the star is able to put on a show but it is an increasingly mechanical has always been an awkward somewhere between entertainer and politician after the best shows and the most lines always poll the best at least for the next few he is willing to repeat his intent to the in order to maintain his shot at winning the white elections

sharks are circling as the us prepares to on the lookout for signs of weakness and indecision around the world during the transition period until the next president is firmly established in the white house call it a window of matter whether or trump wins on bequeaths a world fraught with danger from to the middle east and eastern governments and forces hostile to us and the west may try to exploit power vacuum the problem is not new unlike in the us constitution does not allow a quick handover or trump will be sworn in at noon on until then remains in but as a president his wishes are increasingly it can still take months for the new incumbent to establish his or her authority and complete thousands of appointments the most such as national security adviser and the secretaries of and must be confirmed by congress this can be a lengthy most disastrous transition was probably in between and his during the seven states seceded from the union when came to he found the civil war already under way threats are mostly external some trump supporters warn of domestic insurrection if he north is one of the most pressing the dictatorship in has recklessly escalated its nuclear weapons in recent months north latest provocations include the testing of a ballistic missile in of attacking the western us the isolated regime has ignored sanctions and is hardening its determined to prove it is a force to be reckoned with political upheavals in south where the president faces pressure to a tougher military posture adopted by government in and the reluctance of china to crack down on its renegade ally add to a sense of growing instability if north unpredictable senses uncertainty in he may be tempted to fire a literally or across the greenhorn bows with incalculable consequences china faces similar temptations it has been sparring with the us navy in the south china where its expansionist maritime claims and have been ruled illegal by a court is also squeezing whose new government its dislikes and whose facto independence is underwritten by the us does xi calculate he can use distraction to his some analysts suggest xi would welcome a trump because he and trump think alike about national interest or he takes trump for a fool he can bamboozle such considerations also loom large in the middle where seems intent on helping the regime of win the civil war before the next president has a chance to change policy or impose peace terms in lawless where efforts to foster a unity government are more nasty surprises may be in store if state is evicted from and may become its new of operations the involving and is another powder keg could also use the us power vacuum to consolidate or advance as defined by the in and the where tensions are already high how would for to increased military activity and warfare along the border with or the alliance as look to for a lead but one might not be forthcoming trump regularly disparages suggesting he may cut us and like other macho men such as actor appears to admire for her would be to begin her new presidency with an superpower confrontation on top of all as the us transition there as the if an unforeseen international crisis suddenly the security safety net will be more full of holes than elections
wounds and propensity for public meltdowns had pushed the needle toward according to recent polls that may have changed a little in the aftermath of the renewing of its email probe last week but even the fears of many voters that a trump presidency might become a reality have fears are not unfounded failings as a candidate and a person are and he would be in a position to wreak considerable havoc if elected especially true at the agency with the judiciary and in other arenas where the president can wield executive power the aspect of his personality poses risks that be nor can anyone know the degree to which congress would be inclined to obstruct or approve his most damaging has been lost in the salacious and obsessive media coverage of the republican outrageous bigoted remarks and appeal to the worst instincts of the is a critical examination of what a administration will mean for the nation the information on tangled interests within the evidence of influence peddling and revelations detailing manipulation of media and the democratic signal a plutocratic style of governance that is all too familiar and increasingly dominant at the federal content of what has been revealed in these as well as her lengthy track record in government and policy statements as a candidate yield an inescapable represents the entrenched interests of the status quo her election will expand the excesses of global interventionism and corporate welfare that have characterized us policies for several decades at almost incalculable cost both domestically and the has engaged in the type of one expects of presidential especially democrats who seek to counter the image as weak on defense she has agitated against president on and and reiterated her belief in responsibility to the rationale used to selectively promote the elitist economic agenda that she has so faithfully pursued over the years even as the exercise of that dubious mission has resulted in widespread devastation in the middle south and elsewhere a muddled and hypocritical foreign policy has created bitter enemies across the globe and angered us yet supports the rudderless and demonstrably ineffective efforts of president without a hint of and tragic wars in and continue to extract a heavy and though opposition to those wars helped propel into the focus on ending them and preventing new ones has been blurred by the ongoing the war on terror in reality little more than an extension of other armed conflicts the us has waged around the the deadly manifestations of the war on terror have largely been met with silence approval from much of what passes for the progressive movement self destruction has provided a smoke screen for those on the left and the more moderate elements on the right who might ordinarily question unabashed for a continuation of these modified strategies beyond the historical enthusiasm for but not fair trade even while waffling on the gives credence to the belief that she will sacrifice the welfare of workers here and abroad for the unfettered profits of the business elites whom she has always served in the face of documented inhumane labor practices and other related human rights abuses around the the administration and those preceding it have steadfastly refused to demand changes as conditions of honoring trade agreements as secretary of had an opportunity to honor and promote the rights of working people around the world but failed to do so why would anyone expect her to change the inflammatory rhetoric and actions of both and trump stand in sharp contrast to the platform and orientation of the green which offers the only alternative in this election that will move decisively to draw down us military interventions abroad and reduce the military budget to a sane level while redirecting increasingly scarce resources to rebuild the frayed social safety net and help those most in need here at home this election is about far more than our collective distaste for a and trading the noxious buffoonery and personal insults of trump for the clear and present danger of corporatist logic is no at all elections

deteriorating as the threaten cities and consolidate control of rural and has joined the forces are not officially in a combat have died there this making it a deadlier of operations for the us military than or responded to the us election result by calling on trump to withdraw but advisers will warn him that without the backing of foreign and other military expertise the country is likely to fall to the strong stance on fighting and means he is unlikely to hand control of a country where thousands of troops died to a scarcely less group he has also expressed concerns about nuclear weapons in has repeatedly called for us allies to pay more towards their own but there is almost no cash to be had in which is already largely dependent on foreign aid for its budget and is one of the poorest nations in the world he is likely to be stuck then with the dollar bill for the us presence and support of afghan troops states are nervous about whether a trump administration would defend

exercises in the in response to what it sees as a growing threat in the us airborne unit is due to train with troops at a former soviet military base but it is unclear if such exercises will continue

without lack of credibility among traditional allies of the us led some to think that his victory would be unlikely to cause much trouble for leaders insist that the nuclear accord is an international treaty whose fate also rests in the hands of as well as and china but knows that while trump may not be able to tear up the he can certainly stifle access to the global cosiness with makes fearful of

another big week for me and my cancer they but so and things are really hotting up before the us election got a good show managed to persuade piers as one of the few journalists who actually knows trump to speak to us from his car while filming in for and really interesting about what the media have understood about the piers is also one of the people from the worlds of journalism and broadcasting many of whom if honest i really claim to know especially well come forward to make my life easier they know this or by offering good wishes and positive thoughts and if my experience is anything to go if you know anyone with a cancer diagnosis hesitate just drop them a line to let them know thinking of them genuinely appreciated show went i but still suffering from occasionally quite acute fatigue i blame the as i get anything like this in the course of seven cycles of also since the really only able to sleep on my back my kingdom for a pair of can i hear despairing partners the doctors reckon this might be because of the impact of the radiotherapy on my which been by the well with the malarkey except that at around five on morning i get the first signs of an unmistakable and potentially very painful condition kidney i was first diagnosed with them more than years ago and every now and again since a new one would get stuck in my kidney and kick off a bout of the name given to the excruciating pain that can come with them this time a couple of painkillers see it off but stand if you can face for what happened a few days first day on the new treatment and one having to pay and my first visit to what one of the nurses laughingly described as otherwise known as the patients medical day so at there i am being shown into the discreetly hidden from the regular day unit be visiting later for my infusion and guess it looked very similar to its and while on the subject of business the seats were actually staff were of and i got my first dose of the very expensive plus per which the currently treatment was first class as previously no problem with the principle that i should pay for as the should be protected from additional unfunded treatment costs i choose to avail myself of but i still struggle with the royal taking a markup simply to supply an already very expensive drug by the is already standard treatment as part of chemotherapy for my cancer in the us and charging a private day rate as a whole day for a treatment that takes just over an hour taken to calling it my very own for scandal i hope putting the money to good which is perhaps something worth looking having received my i was escorted back downstairs to rejoin the rest of the human race in the and do you aside from having identical seats to i think there might actually be more space down but time to get reacquainted with the as its name is a rubber cap attached to a refrigeration system that rapidly cools the thus reducing the risk of hair loss that some chemotherapy drugs otherwise more or less guarantee it work for but it really worked for me over seven cycles of to be a few quizzical looks from other patients more used to seeing women using it and the endurance test that is the first minutes of wearing it as it literally freezes your scalp brain freeze and multiply by was a very small price to pay of course forgotten how hard it would be and very nearly took it off but in the end the name of the new machines they now have at the and a from the staff got me though it so i still have hair on my would turn out to be one of the most difficult since i was diagnosed back in march and none of it to do with my cancer or its metastases directly for a i have been suffering with constipation of cancer patients once it gets to or days as it has for me can become almost painfully uncomfortable then there was the discomfort under my right ribs put down to my liver playing up more another hangover from the radiotherapy and to cap it all was the recurring renal colic from my kidney stones and their appalling sense of timing and the twist the painkillers a mixture of paracetamol and codeine tend to work less effectively over time make you more cut a long story was a bit of a perfect in increasing discomfort and waiting until enough time had elapsed to allow me to take more painkillers which no longer quite do the and make the worse as a i leave the house and have no desire to eat or drink and the latter set to provide the biggest twist of all at for blood tests preparatory to the next dose of new due by after such a dreadful i can add extreme fatigue to my list of ailments dress and have to sit slightly for a rest blood tests show sharply declining level of which means no for me unless they recover doctor also spots that my blood pressure is pretty low and i get when standing up and so prescribes intravenous fluids to at looking forward to radio today same thing happens extreme fatigue and dizzy when i stand up decide might not be possible the by the have been nothing but support itself over the course of my cancer travails return to hospital for more iv fluids i think these are probably the consequences of the radiotherapy taking my appetite for and drink and my simply not drinking enough for far too to to see whether platelet levels
my with whom i have a is becoming increasingly he was not like this when we met he voted to leave the voted for and is a fan of trump he consumes news including and is passionate about political affairs i want my daughter to grow up in a house where we argue about politics all the but we both feel so strongly he is increasingly pleased about the changing state of world politics and it is really upsetting me does anyone have any advice on how to manage this domestic political and and
contrary to the boasts of vote to leave the union did not beget the result of the us presidential election there are analogous dynamics driving support for and for just as there are comparable weaknesses in the remain proposition and candidacy but the relationship is more metaphorical than causal in any is the sense in which commentary has appropriated the term shorthand for the punishment administered by angry voters to what they perceive as a metropolitan is not a metaphor in the it is government policy the election of trump does very little to make its passage smoother it adds new layers of diplomatic complexity and economic uncertainty the existence of an eager trade partner in the us was axiomatic to the case for quitting the when publicly warned that its seat at various tables in was integral to the strategic power in the he was dismissed by as a meddlesome stooge of interests with spiteful motive informed by his did not anticipate that successor might be a man with no discernible capability in whose dominant trade policy during the campaign was protectionism the foreign secretary once said trump was of his now he invites people to overwhelmingly about the possibilities offered by the like many is subordinating his prior concern about character to the commercial prospects of a bilateral trade deal find encouragement in reported from his first conversation with that is a very special place for he invited the prime minister to visit as soon as possible but if the us election campaign teaches anything it is that the winner wields phrases like this indiscriminately and without any basis in for the alarming turn of politics in the us increases the premium on continental solidarity and collaboration on the basis of shared democratic values the basis that cited as an explicit condition of partnership in her chilly statement of congratulation to trump to and many other governments across the looks much more like a threat to the task of shoring up a stable international order than an this it would be reassuring to believe that may has a understanding of role in the world and a capability for swimming in turbulent geopolitical currents it would be helpful if she gave at least the impression of possessing a strategic plan there is little in her record before entering downing street to indicate an interest in foreign except insofar as it affected her job as home secretary a necessarily parochial view dominated by immigration control and domestic becoming prime her handling of international diplomacy has exuded verging on discomfort she has survived summits without igniting controversy but not stamped any authority on the proceedings her trip to this week was underwhelming it was meant to demonstrate global previewing independent capacity to build trade relations with powerful nations may was rebuked by the prime minister for denying visas to students and skilled migrants the visit did nothing to support the claim that departure from the is economically liberating it instead a future of supplication an isolated country asking for from governments that present of their degree of hesitancy is inevitable given that may is learning the practice and idiom of international relations on the job her style is not to swagger or throw the weight of her office around and that is to her credit it is not surprising that the prime minister chose to play the opening moves in diplomacy with trump by the observing the usual though her liberal audience at home wishes she would show more awareness of the reasons for their alarm politicians have a history of vastly overstating their influence on us presidents and a habit of projecting trends on to domestic contexts in our destiny and security are tied to our geographic and neither trump nor can change that more they will underline the navigate through newly turbulent international may needs an account of ambition that goes beyond the tactics of bilateral deals she must as that successful alliances combine mutual commercial interest and shared values requires the nurturing of trade relations beyond but that imperative must not be the only lens through which the prime minister looks out on the world it is worrying to observe that she appears not to have any
congressional republicans are settling in for what they hope is a long run in the but j trump want them to get too comfortable going to put on term which a lot of people happy but putting on term trump said in an interview with that aired on doing a lot of things to clean up the if one thing could put trump on a collision course with his new allies on capitol it is his embrace of proposals such as term limits and tougher restrictions on allowing lawmakers and top aides to become lobbyists in the lucrative world of influence peddling members of congress like to talk about returning power to the but many would prefer not to vote to limit their own tenure or future employment opportunities bringing up term limits is seen by some as raining on their parade senator republican of and the majority made that quite clear last week when he said the senate outlook for term limits was severely limited would say we have term limits told reporters called elections and it will not be on the agenda in the highlighting of his call for term limits it is no on his list of priorities to up the corruption and special interest collusion in revives an initiative that has been dormant in for years after republicans rode it to the house takeover in but then failed to make it happen trump found a surprising kindred spirit on term limits on when president seemed to endorse the concept think we want to see new voices and new ideas said at a news conference part of the reason why i think term limits are a really useful aides said later that might have been referring more to the limit on presidential and his view that set the right precedent by leaving after two terms but his words could certainly be extended to congress proponents of term limits say position has put new energy behind the campaign to adopt a constitutional amendment restricting house members to three terms and senators to two terms other part of the pressure is going to come from the said nick the executive director of the group term limits they know term limits is an issue on the they will make it very difficult for congress to ignore i think congress is going to be forced to vote on term limits have always been popular with voters and got a surge of momentum in the the bums political atmosphere of the early leading multiple states to adopt them for their legislatures through ballot initiatives and other means as part of the with in republicans led by representative newt of promised the legislature and a vote on term limits to replace career politicians with citizen the mantra helped them topple speaker s of a staunch opponent of term via a who promised to serve just six years he later violated that that term limits vote did come in march and won a majority but fell more than votes short of the majority necessary to advance a constitutional amendment forty many of them committee and subcommittee joined democratic opponents in defeating the proposal the amendment again fell short a year later opponents argued and argue that arbitrary term limits would rob congress of the institutional knowledge and expertise needed to conduct business and that voters had regular opportunities to end the service of their lawmakers they talk about how gerrymandering and the advantages of incumbency make it hard to defeat sitting lawmakers whether the proposal can go anywhere this year will depend on how serious trump and his advisers are about pushing it against the wishes of congressional or whether it was just part of his message to stir up frustrated voters at this it is impossible to but it was a primary element of his call to the that appeared to resonate with the public and term limits are just one issue conservatives also are raising the alarm about a move by house republicans to restore congressional earmarks special spending as long as they are directed to a government agency rather than a private a source of corruption in the past some lawmakers have argued that restoring the ability of individual lawmakers to earmark money would make it easier to pass spending but critics are moving quickly to quash any effort to bring them back with the earmark proposal on the verge of being adopted by republicans on speaker d called off the fearing it would send a bad signal so soon after the election he promised a review of the idea and a vote early next year like other outsiders before trump will discover that draining the swamp is much easier said than done
the election of trump has been welcomed by autocrats and demagogues across the from to the the reaction of democratic especially in has on the contrary been a mixture of anxiety and an effort to put a brave face on an event that might threaten a world order this is the first daunting question raised by choice of a man whose only experience in international relations has been as a real estate and whose presidential campaign was marked by utterances which reflected either ignorance or disdain for what the us has traditionally stood for in the has called he wants to upend free he has fawned over he has suggested japan and south should develop nuclear he has the nuclear he wants a wall on the border with he believes the fight against terrorism can include torture and he cares not one bit about climate change and that is only what is known about foreign policy that if he actually has the very fact that the survival of the international order in which the us has historically played such a key role now seems in speaks volumes about the dimensions of his election the world is stunned because trump has said so little that was coherent on foreign so much that was and because he has kept silent on so many of the complexities of what a us president may be confronted many are now reduced to mere speculation about the future policies of the victory of trump shatters the notion that the us can be counted on by its allies not just for guarantees and economic but even as a defender of liberal rather than a threat to it it calls into question the traditional us role as a protector of a global architecture of no one knows who will be appointed to his although the names of sessions and general have circulated in no reassuring way all these risks are reflected in global reactions those countries and leaders who want to continue to play an essential role in underwriting the international principles and alliances that stand at the heart of global governance are now aghast and scrambling for any reassurances that may be on offer those who want to challenge a global order or see it as well as those who expect that a new dawn of us isolationism will best serve their are rejoicing so the news of the election outcome was greeted with a round of applause in the parliament the will no doubt be hoping that frequent overtures to including his expressions of admiration for the will offer areas of negotiation to benefit this could apply to a move likely to further empower to which could lead to the lifting of or to the wider question of security architecture and the reactions pointed as much to the difficult state of the politics as they do to attitudes towards the us while contemplating a the suggested her cooperation with trump would be conditional on respect for democratic values in and officials scrambled to underscore the importance of transatlantic links but among there was an outflow of glee and celebration in marine pen cheered the the dutch leader gloated that will never be the and news democracy is still across the world there are leaders eagerly anticipating the chance of on an entirely new version of us leadership or absence of in the far right believes the state is over china has been hedging for the perhaps concerned about the risk of a trade politics like business is about he thinks talk with dictators can instantly dissolve and approaches foreign affairs as zero sum game in which making great can mean demeaning its traditional friends his election makes the world a more dangerous place and also a more uncertain for it is too early to say precisely how those dangers will nor how the next us president will face up to elections
no election has a global impact to match a us presidential contest few white house races have been more bitter than the current one between trump and so any public official who intervenes in days before needs to be very sure what they are doing such interventions come bigger than the director announcement that the bureau is reopening its probe of private emails the potential impact is huge until last was looking on course to hand trump a decisive beating it may still happen but that is now all up in the appears to be that justice must be done and that he would be damned if he made the announcement and damned if he it is certainly true that us politics has become so and so riddled with paranoia that the director faced an unenviable choice if he had carried out the new investigation behind closed doors and it had only become public after the whatever the one or both sides would be certain to cry foul conspiracy theorists would have had a field day yet by making it public he makes the investigation itself into a issue in a contest that will shape not just but the world and is precisely why the us justice with which the has an established framework of rules designed to protect its impartiality from allegations of political bias the department puts strict limits on disclosures about ongoing investigations and especially on anything that might be seen as influencing an election a memorandum to this effect has been issued by a succession of us attorneys general every four including in has broken with this former justice department officials from both political parties have denounced him for this over the weekend the current attorney general is believed to have advised against has also compounded the potential abuse of power in two important ways the investigation is at an embryonic stage it may go no further in his announcement he spoke of emails appear to be to the previous investigation he completed concluding then that there was no case to answer in the summer but the emails come from a separate may not even be from at all and the chief has not read them his phrasing was extraordinarily vague has thus launched his missile with minimum facts and maximum innuendo there are echoes of police blunders over child sex allegations even louder are the echoes of fanatics like judicial watch this strikes at the democratic not just should not have deferred to as he did last week the investigation and prosecution processes should be kept rigorously apart from politics especially true at election time and even more necessary in such a and acrimonious polity as the us congress has become one of the recipients of announced even before the move that he intends to begin oversight hearings into as soon as she is if she is incredible though it may seem to the outside world and many impeachment efforts by republicans against are already a serious possibility law enforcement officials have to be completely scrupulous in such a world has not been it is a step towards a lawless is in many respects the author of her own problems on the email row but took exactly the wrong decision if the emails needed he should have one behind closed carried it out reported it to prosecutors and made an if one was in the fullness of time this is called due process and it is a bulwark of the rule of not rule by politicians least of all rule by a potential tyrant like has a venomous contest just when trump was desperate for a just when republican candidates in other races were craving something to their voters and just when some media were becoming bored with the predictability of the white house contest his action was at best naive and at worst an abuse of office it have rather less effect on the election outcome than some suppose yet it is no consolation that has also guaranteed if no charges are he will inevitably be accused of rigging the elections
it was evident from the beginning that the establishment had no idea what was coming this election year the who had vowed to block president at every turn in were so deep into their own echo chamber that they thought their strategy had been a success the democrats seemed just as blind that by the popularity and strength of campaign i was a sanders supporter from the and i have to admit that it was with increasing glee that i watched the collapse of order of not rick mike and it was with increasing dismay that i watched my newspapers overlook and even demean him there was a fleeting moment when i thought sanders might or at least be the choice but as and sanders continued to spar and i saw something positive happening he was easing her to the introducing her to the possibility of getting rid of wall street of the trade of the lethal deregulation of or at weapons in the hands of thought the important issues for were climate racist profiling and police infrastructure the supreme chaos in the middle east and migrants in the unpredictable and shifting the us away from its embrace of war as the answer to everything or not in but runaway military did not expect the election to be about issues stupid me but then along came the trump is hiding a lot of embarrassing allegations of unpaid workers and avoided unreconciled uncontrolled impulse sexual and so these had to be the issues for the and the issues for the trump supporters were whatever must be must have been could be hiding in order to cover up her criminal have a criminal past but now the election is it is evident that she does have a and that her whatever it was unbearable to the because the right has been smearing her for years twitter smooth and former president bill in was not my but i understood where he was coming from he was smooth and he was and he decided when he was in the white house not exactly to edge but to accommodate and manipulate he enraged the remnants gave them practice in snapping at his trying to bring him down when w bush entered the white what had the democrats to accommodate gore conceding the though not to the the thin end of the wedge was deeply inserted the wedge of the that is and in power was to be exercised over threatening anyone else who might shake a fist at the and money was to be made in doing so that was too practice for to feel both heroic and because war is hell and those who suffer get nothing and those who profit keep practice for the people to become crazed with beliefs about who should support who was in who caused the and who had to years of and then along came president younger than or bush by years or thoughtful and naive having honed their weapons during the the rattled them constantly during the administration shut let him do shrink state department then blame on dive deep into the history of racist violence and drag it to the surface the more successful has the more violent the the cooler he the more determined the the more virtuous he the hotter the conspiracy theories thank and roger what is trump in it maybe for the but clearly for the vanity this is a man who evidently does not think for one moment about anything other than his own status he will say do threaten anyone just to feel that he has won not to feel that he is a better but to feel that he is a more important person on the day of the trump said that if he all the money and effort he spent running would have turned out to be a waste of time he means not ours trump was the shallowest presidential candidate in the history of the us twitter thoughtful and naive president and his wife dance at an inauguration ball in we have what we have the has been and fired up until they just take it any more once director stuck his nose into the all hope of a peaceful outcome was even though a few days he pulled his nose now out of out again trump has not and will not prevent or condemn violence on the part of his supporters he has empowered them all along as the he will sit by while they wreak their am reminded of the election of the secession of south the feeling that the southerners had of reaching the breaking point but the us the power then that it is now it was a partially settled landscape where the native population could fool themselves into thinking that they had a chance are democracies doomed to it would appear that they but only after they become imperialist war because once a country starts trying to rule the or at least trying to tell the world what to that country starts making moral compromises for the sake of control at these compromises seem small and justified in scientists because otherwise they might go to the then they come to seem automatic then going after we are in the midst of international chaos because a supremely vain and selfish man decided to his hollow and rotten commercial the us has dived into a wreck of its own making like all this one has been a long time coming say since and every so often we thought we could fix it but the hillside got the drivers got and the acceleration toward the bottom got elections

a question has been posed in a puzzled whisper in many of the living rooms and newsrooms ever since j triumph in this presidential is white white nationalists have happily embraced victory his choice of k as chief as a win for their agenda a barrage of groups that fight discrimination and hate speech in criticized warning that his embrace of the movement was little more than an attempt to racism and white nationalism into something palatable enough for mass consumption and much of the rest of the country has been left to wonder what this unfamiliar term actually means while white nationalism certainly overlaps with white supremacy and many political scientists say it is a distinct phenomenon one that was a powerful but force during the presidential election and will most likely remain a potent factor in and politics in coming years a professor of politics at university in has spent years studying the ways that ethnicity intersects with politics while most researchers in that field focus on ethnic professor does the he studies the behavior of ethnic particularly whites in the united states and white he is the belief that national identity should be built around white and that white people should therefore maintain both a demographic majority and dominance of the culture and public life like white white nationalism places the interests of white people over those of other racial groups white supremacists and white nationalists both believe that racial discrimination should be incorporated into law and policy some will see the distinction between white nationalism and white supremacy as a semantic sleight of hand but although many white supremacists are also white and vice professor says the terms are not white supremacy is based on a racist belief that white people are innately superior to people of other white nationalism is about maintaining political and economic not just a numerical majority or cultural hegemony for a long he white nationalism was less an ideology than the default presumption of life until quite white could easily see the nation as essentially an extension of their own ethnic group but the changing the civil rights movement and a push for multiculturalism in many quarters mean that white are now confronting the prospect of a nation that is no longer built solely around their own identity for many white of the growing diversity is something to celebrate but for others it is a source of stress the white nationalist movement has drawn support from that latter group its supporters argue that the united states should protect its white majority by sharply limiting and perhaps even by compelling nonwhite citizens to leave appointment of as his senior counselor and chief west wing strategist more than brought white nationalism to the forefront of conversation he is the former editor of a site he described in august to mother as platform of the although the is ideologically broader than white nationalism it also includes and trolls white nationalism makes up a significant part of its appeal for b who runs the website is also the director of the national policy an organization that says it is devoted to protecting the and future of people of descent in the united and around the argues that immigration and multiculturalism are threats to white and has said his ideal is a white he has avoided discussing the details of how this might be saying it is still just a but has called for ethnic to remove nonwhite people from soil the trump told the new times upon his appointment that he does not share those views but under his news has gone to considerable lengths to cater to an audience that does and in a radio interview that was resurfaced this week by the opposed even highly skilled implying he believed it was a threat to culture or of the in silicon valley are from south or from i think he trailing off before continuing a moment country is more than an economy a civic white including have rejoiced at appointment to such a senior position in the trump white house but focusing on figures like may obscure the more significant way that white nationalist ideas are affecting politics and fueling the rise of politicians like trump in the united states as well as populist movements in and continental several studies of other countries have found that a desire to protect traditional values and culture is the strongest predictor of support for the sort of populism that propelled trump to power in the united states many of those voters would not think of themselves as white and the cultural values and traditions they seek to protect are not necessarily explicitly racial those traditions formed when national identity and culture were essentially synonymous with whiteness so the impulse to protect them from social and demographic change is essentially an attempt to turn back the clock to a time a recent working paper by a political scientist at school of and a political scientist at the university of based on an analysis of survey that populists have succeeded by appealing to the cultural anxiety of groups like older white who once formed the cultural majority in western societies have recently seen their predominance and privilege a professor of politics at the university of bergen in came to a similar conclusion after studying policies in their she were motivated by a desire to protect their national culture suggesting they believed that immigrants posed a threat to it criticism of immigrants and promise to great may have tapped into those same cultural fueling his success with older and white voters he won white voters by percentage professor argues that anxiety over white identity and populist politicians can have a symbiotic each

from the the central enigma was j trump how did this celebrity tycoon with no political experience get so who were the supporting him and when i started my unusual assignment of covering the presidential campaign from the perspective of a foreign correspondent for an news organization one of the first things i did was to invite questions from international readers the bulk of them revolved around whose unorthodox romp through the republican primaries propelled him to the nomination and ultimately to the presidency going back through my journey across there were many clues to rising although not all were easy to read i drank with trump supporters in bars and casinos i approached them at rodeos i chatted with them at gun clubs and diners and roaring political rallies the broad topography of trump country in many easy to trace it is a place of anger and gripped by a feverish sentiment people wanted change and a chance to raise a throbbing finger to the forces they blame for their lot in life yet other factors were at in this unruly factors that sometimes made it hard to see talk social media bubbles and a simmering culture war separating thriving coastal areas and the wounded interior of the country it always clear which elements were powering the as the movement called and which were being buoyed along one of my first stops was a decimated coal town in west it had a sports which offered beer for on and a biker bar it was patrons sometimes squealed tires inside until the room filled with smoke both were filled with trump little surprise since he had promised to reopen coal mines shuttered by the environmental regulations and cheap natural gas in i also saw how message about change was overshadowing other issues that many analysts thought would have disqualified him from winning over the social conservatives who have long been a core republican constituency in conversations after church on many glossed over the three marriages and boasts of his battle with sexually transmitted disease like trump told stern in it was hard to but perhaps that was the that a mysterious alchemy was at work in this one in which outrageous might offer a route to success around that apple released its seventh iteration of the that glossy black totem of progress inscribed on the back of every are the words in assembled in as if is a separate country and how many in trump country saw it that instead of being part of the they were living in a land that sent jobs overseas one thing that like many and other had long seen as distinguishing the united states was its restless optimism and innate traded on pessimism his great embodied a vision that aimed to restore pride in the military and but also scapegoated minorities and at most of the faces in the crowd were white people flew confederate flags they spoke impatiently about prejudice toward was openly a factory owner in told me that children in which has the largest percentage of had stayed home from school in droves on sept because they had secretly received advanced warnings of the attacks the atmosphere at trump rallies was permissive if someone said something offensive or there was little fear of being hushed or contradicted yet in another confounding a significant minority of trump supporters were minorities themselves i met people who defied neat a black woman in her who worked at a record label in a driver in las a doorman in at a rally in the final week in a rust belt state that would prove central to i saw how the candidate connected with crowd when he it was if he held an invisible tuning fork held to his listening for the smallest murmur of which he would seize upon and amplify it reminded me of powerful preachers and populist politicians seen during my years based in what was hard to know was how far the electric energy inside this hall was radiating maybe these were just the loyalists polls suggested that trump was behind in many places critical to electoral college victory political including dismissed the notion that trump could win mainly by consolidating the support of white voters like the hunt for the lost tribes of the was how a consultant who had worked for the republican mitt put it early on you paddle your canoe far enough up the and bang your drum hard they will come to the riverbank but just not but when i mentioned the polls showing trump lagging to his they snorted derisively everyone they knew was voting trump children some were former democrats others were people who voted for decades the they were either asking the wrong questions or were being manipulated by the news media the polls themselves were part of the system these people were trying to overthrow at the i discounted the conspiratorial talk as a product of the echo chamber that became so powerful in this election but in broad the trump supporters were right in key their votes were by pollsters the winning margin in many like was and the failure of democrats to mobilize turnout was also a major factor the driver who took me from a trump rally to the was a case in he was an a registered and he did not intend to vote of them look any good to he said benefited also from the antipathy so many people felt toward his this was another theme in the questions that poured in from international why did so many seem to hate her so the answer had many fatigue from her decades in public unfinished business from her time in power in the distaste for how she had handled his sexual outrage over her use of a private email server while secretary of state and her taking in huge sums for speeches to wall street unfiltered sexism and simply
it may well be the greatest test of whether the cold reality of office dampens the campaign rhetoric of the next occupant of the white house out on the there was no doubt which country trump held most guilty for the loss of jobs and saw as the major obstacle to making great again but going head to head with china would involve a nexus of problems that a chief executive should wish to avoid so will natural combativeness and the feelings of his core supporters or will reason force itself on going with china would involve a nexus of problems that a savvy chief executive should wish to china conundrum is emblematic of the huge uncertainty surrounding the we know the campaign rhetoric about slapping a tariff on goods we know that he accuses of being a currency manipulator and using as a know the person he endorses as about university professor peter sees war with the republic as argues that sold down the shanghai and urges the us to fight by being tough on trade and taxing president trump would be well advised to steer away from the rhetoric of candidate trump in dealing with the second biggest economy and the rising accepting the nuances of the single most important perceived at the end of the that the way to make china great again and to save the communist party from implosion was to pursue economic he turned to exports the bargain that emerged suited and led to the entry of the republic of china into the world trade in china got its growth from selling cheap goods and attracted foreign investment and led by the got cheap imports that kept down inflation and satisfied consumers the deal got even better when recycled its earnings into us government providing capital to help fuel a credit changed in the aftermath of the global financial crisis skirted round the china question as best he could now trump has to decide how to proceed it is no longer simply an economic advice to keep a low international xi aspires to walk tall beside any president from across the pacific though far behind in terms of overall military the has been building up its forces and asserting its presence in the south china sea forecasts that it will rule the world are confounded by a host of social and strategic factors for a president who aspires to make the unchallenged world the presence of a country intent on becoming equal geopolitical number one can only be is no shortage of issues on which to confront stretching from trade through intellectual property rights to the in the south china sea and its unwillingness or incapacity to bring north to heel one might even add human if they seemed a matter of concern to any of the presidential candidates but if comes under pressure on one it is likely to react on another the economic story is slapping tariffs on products made in china may play well in depressed manufacturing but there would be a big negative effect on us firms with plants on the or which assemble goods there and retaliation would hit their important mainland is making the most of the electoral its media warning that this is what democracy brings it will seek to exploit doubts about a trump engagement in the fraught situation in east not only over and the south china but also with animosity between china and the unresolved matter of and growing the way the us urged governments to participate in the partnership and then repudiated the trade talk of changing the relationship with allies adds to the discomfort the prime quickly booked himself a meeting with the who is said to regard treaties as akin to contracts open to decades on from economic there is little mutual trust between it and the but each knows it needs the other a grand deal between and remains highly elusive if trump were to aspire to seek it in a realpolitik framework he would have to turn his back on core voters and manage a multifaceted strategy at odds with the simplicity of his campaign and his isolationist tendencies hence the importance of the test and the probability that each side will continue to prefer to rub along with the elections economic growth and

another day closer to the presidential another slew of surveys most of them showing that is in the lead but the size of the democratic advantage varies considerably from poll to partly because some questionnaires ask voters to consider the fact that there are more than two presidential nominees green party candidate stein is on the ballot in states and voters in another three states can choose to write her name in and the libertarian candidate is on the ballot in who are feeling turned off by the two most unpopular candidates in might be considering a protest vote for one of these other parties in the sense that candidates have a less than chance of with just four days to go until the they might be wondering who will be hindered more by a protest vote democrat or republican with all of the articles i have written so far about polling the answer is a very the impact of protest votes varies throughout the country in states can probably be viewed as states based on the fact that one of the candidates is leading by at least seven percentage points numbers are polling averages collected by real clear when analysts talk about the electoral map working in they are referring to the fact that of these states the district of look like vote democratic and together worth of the electoral college votes needed to win the presidency based on the same threshold of trump can only count on college votes more there are states in the us that can be viewed as competitive based on the fact that six percentage points or less separate and trump some of these states are unlikely to swing the entire because they have many electoral college votes is one such although trump has a narrow the state is only worth three electoral college votes so has little power in changing the national result twitter how does the us electoral college a quick guide to where voting for a third party could affect which of the two main candidates wins based on a close race places where and trump are close in the and state influence electoral college votes or more but if the race ends up being very the reality will be that every electoral college vote will matter to trump and and states like and new will become for voters who consider a trump win their these are states where choosing a candidate could help secure a republican of electoral college is ahead by percentage trump stein early ballots suggest that turnout has which is good news for nearly one in five eligible voters in is and they typically lean heavily democrat with such razor thin votes in this state for and stein that could have gone to will do real damage to the democrats nationally of electoral college is ahead by three percentage trump stein of electoral college is ahead by percentage trump stein of electoral college is ahead by percentage trump stein of electoral college trump is ahead by percentage trump the black vote is crucial for in this state while of the total us population is black or in that share is according to the census bureau it looks like will lose this not least because early ballots suggest black turnout has fallen considerably in of electoral college is ahead by two percentage trump stein of electoral college is ahead by percentage trump stein of electoral college trump is ahead by four percentage trump stein of electoral college is ahead by percentage trump stein of electoral college is ahead by six percentage trump stein elections
appearing on that most revered of presidential forums called trump released a video this week describing his plans to great again for and i mean learned not to believe magnanimous but others really want told on that we should give trump opportunity to develop the positive objectives that he may and told an audience in that he wants be respectful of the office and give the an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every forgive because about to pop off have you lost all sense of you and talk as if we have no idea who trump is or what he has been saying for months on end but trump has made it abundantly clear opportunistic words of inclusion notwithstanding that his administration will be loyal to the fringes of the united leaving even the republican establishment running behind announced cabinet choices simply leave no room for imagining a gentler at the helm of the those of us concerned about the fate of the undocumented or the environment or reproductive rights see much reason to worry with the selection of mike and general t to inner circle list reads like a roll call to the dick fan among many other troubling all these men also share a deep antipathy to views are as scary and they are well known pick for national security adviser has called a and stated that is a political that behind this notion of it being a that is not talking about the that republicans frequently invoke but about asked about current republican national committee chair and designated chief of staff told news that are some aspects of the faith that are very i realize that was a scholar of or perhaps even a a renewer of the faith according to popular comes to revive the practice of for following generations or maybe he just said an ignorant thing that would sound bigoted if it were about another religion but today sounds like comments are troubling rather than enabling establishment republicans as a moderating influence on the the trump administration is pulling the traditional down its own giving less extreme republicans about as much voice in this new administration as chair actually worse at least the chair had the good sense to stay quiet my worry extends beyond the realm of what this administration says and reaches into what it will do building a wall on the border is a near physical impossibility the immediate deportation of millions of people is much harder to execute than it sounds but the that can and most likely will secretary of state another hardliner who is in the running for homeland security recently met with trump and was photographed holding his strategic plan for first openly in his hands nobody give this man the nuclear plain for the world to see was the of an useless program of the bush administration officially called and more commonly known as i remember vividly the panic and confusion among the of new city when special registration was first enacted in this which required visa holding men from countries and north to register with the was a massive failure even the own auditor found the program to be ineffective and a huge waste of resources the cost to taxpayers was more than a year and the program alienated around the world from the united states families were torn apart because of special and the brilliant program netted a grand total of zero terrorism registration was useful only as a tool to disrupt average lives and to spend a lot of money needlessly it served no security function and trump is considering reviving it we can assume because it will make this government like doing on the backs of ordinary then this justifying a registry on fox trump surrogate positively invoked internment as a legal precedent for the program that heinous comparison led the new times to publish an by a law professor reassuring us even if the legal decision authorizing internment has never been we be worried because the judiciary now sees the legal justification for internment as constitutional that whole exercise is nuts the question is not about the constitutionality of internment the question is why the hell are we talking about internment are we seriously working through the legal likelihood or unlikelihood of holding large numbers of completely innocent people in detention racial hysteria led us down that road once to say that panic lead us down a similarly treacherous with or without a legal precedent beginning to feel like one major terrorist attack from martial law in this and the new administration even taken office yet a fiction in the us that is frequently promoted by the likes of fox news and that had a major impact on this election the notion is that in our multicultural white get theirs while every minority and special interest group gets extra privileges the idea cultivates a mood of bitterness and even if fundamentally untrue many honestly believe that are getting special privileges that some accept will lead to the imposition of sharia law in this country but this is ludicrous want special privileges we just want to be treated the same way that everyone else is treated going to get special registration hardly a fair need more than assurances from trump that thinking about the whole country when he invokes we need to know that equality under the law will be guaranteed under his administration in what we really need to be doing is proving to all that everyone deserves to be treated equally while acknowledging all of our and that the kind of equality that makes for a stronger until that day every one of us needs to be popping off while we because if we there may come a time when popping off is not just useless but illegal pop everywhere you whenever you can pop all afternoon and evening pop all
j trio of selections on served notice that he intends not only to reverse eight years of liberal domestic policies but also to overturn decades of bipartisan consensus on the united proper role in world affairs trump is moving quickly to realize his promise of a nation that relentlessly enforces immigration and drug views with deep war ii and sends suspected terrorists to bay or secret prisons to be interrogated with methods that have been banned as torture at a time when cities have been inflamed by racial police shootings and fears over homegrown trump made no conciliatory gestures toward or residents of all of whom he disparaged during his campaign in his first major national security selections so far senator republican of for attorney representative mike republican of for and gen t for national security adviser trump sent a clear message that he does not intend to use these personnel choices to build bridges to democrats or the moderate and traditionally conservative republicans who opposed the nationalist overtones of his presidential campaign the reaction from democrats was swift and sulfurous senator warren of demanded that trump withdraw while senator booker of new jersey charged that some of choices had and demeaned has created a white house leadership that embodies the most divisive rhetoric of his senator of said trump swept into office promising to dispense with the political correctness of and his choices reflect that president w bush assembled a republican cabinet with a variety of shades of conservative including some members who challenged the president early decisions suggest he favors a cabinet that will echo his opinions the choices also suggest that on the perennially vexing question of how the government should balance security and civil trump will throw his weight firmly behind in matters of both and traditional law enforcement one of the most conservative defended authority to conduct wiretapping without a warrant after the sept attacks he has been a vocal supporter of military detention at bay and sharply criticized the administration for assigning lawyers to suspected terrorists and giving them the right to remain even when arrested on soil he has said the united states should keep a banned technique that the administration considered to be torture as an interrogation option because it works a former prosecutor with a history of racially tinged sessions has voted against laws that protect gay people and guarantee equal pay for women he has also supported efforts to roll back the voting rights act he has shown over two decades in the senate that he believes the justice department should do more to crack down on illegal immigration and he has supported strict enforcement of drug laws and opposed the dtente that

has described as a political ideology that has turned into a like general favors an immigration ban and has expressed support for the idea of forcing in the united states to register with the government he once erroneously wrote on twitter that or was in danger of taking over the country both bush and president believed that such assertions inflamed served as a recruiting tool for terrorists and antagonized countries in the middle east that the united states needed as allies in the fight against violent extremism since sept there has been bipartisan consensus that the best way to combat terrorism was to dismantle and other networks while avoiding being seen as attacking trump has shown no such qualms has said leaders contribute to the threat of terrorism by refusing to repudiate although leaders and advocacy groups have done so and often has made these leaders across potentially complicit in these acts more importantly in those that may well said in a senior fellow at the institution and the author of said and other trump allies operating on the assumption that something going on in the religion is a sea he it really changes the terms of the discussion about what to should the trump administration shape its strategy and broader foreign policy around these predicted the united states would find itself at odds with its allies in and the middle which have

in his first televised interview as trump gave a glimpse into his plans for deportations he suggested his administration would initially target million undocumented immigrants for people who he branded drugs but even a cursory analysis of target number of deportations shows that he will have to deport far more than undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes the incoming trump administration will try to implement the harshest immigration regime in presidential with his closest advisers making clear they will seek to expedite these deportations and those deported are likely to include a far greater number of those who have lived in the us for years experts even those who are in the us on temporary visas or green us already deports vast numbers of undocumented immigrants during the first six years of his deported two and a half million under the guise of ridding the us of gang people who are hurting the rhetoric was somewhat misleading a new times investigation found that of those deported by the administration by had only minor criminal convictions or none at all this underlies the impossibility of there simply are not enough people who match his description as serious criminals to and many speculate the targets he wants to reach will mean not only dramatically broadening the scope of deportations to meet but also seriously curtail any oversight within the system important to point out that was actively trying to deport a record number of and even he hit two and a half million over two said grace a senior immigration researcher at human rights us program the idea of to whether or even within a couple of would require a system that really defies our imagination of what a fair system might in the absence of official the migration policy institute estimates about of the roughly million undocumented migrants living in are likely to have a criminal with only projected to hold a felony conviction since the administration has actively targeted this cohort of individuals they have drastically reduced the number of interior deportations those involving apprehensions that occur away from the border and usually involve individuals who have lived in the us for years by activating a enforcement this program sees immigration and customs enforcement agents undocumented arrestees picked up by state or local law enforcement who are found to have serious gang affiliations or terror suspicions but even under this new ice data obtained under the freedom of information act by researchers at the university of and reported here for the first highlights that a tiny fraction of total deportations in involved individuals convicted of a violent while were deported with no recorded criminal history at all to get to to million will mean a dramatic rewriting of who or what is a get to to million will mean a dramatic rewriting of who or what is a and rewriting that definition in a way that involves acts most would not consider to be a said professor an immigration researcher at the university of riverside and author of framing immigrants would also mean considering not just undocumented but people here who are on temporary visas or green cards that have committed minor crimes like shoplifting or advisers have now acknowledged their net will need to widen and have started explaining that the administration will seek to deport not just convicted criminals but also those accused of a crime or gang affiliation as well as those charged with minor immigration such as illegal some have argued that new immigration regime could simply use the tools left over from the deportation machines created by both the bush and administrations but the sheer scale of project and the perceived desire to act quickly will probably require legislative action through congress to enhance and expand the effectiveness of these devices in trump pledged to restore the secure communities the precursor to the priority enforcement which was by both the bush and administration until the program allowed federal authorities to conduct less targeted sweeps of undocumented arrestees held by local and allowed ice agents to request that local jails detain suspects past their release date in order to allow more time to transfer them to federal detention facilities in the same trump also pledged to expand agreements between ice and local law which allow local police officers to carry out certain functions of immigration law enforcement directly ice reportedly credited these partnerships with identifying more than removable between and according to but local law enforcement most notably the county office in were routinely criticized for discriminatory and as a result the administration substantially rolled back their use in promise to expand or reinstate both these programs is a strong indication the new administration will significantly intensify interior deportations but these removals have markedly declined since entered from in to last as the outgoing administration particularly in its second term focused on deportations at the many of which occur through an expedited removal process that requires no hearing in court this sharpening of the interior deportation machine will leave a number of institutions in the for said conservative analysts close to transition team the trump administration will probably focus on civil immigration proceedings in said president of the federation for immigration reform different kinds of changes that would be made in the court system will include dramatically adding to the number of immigration curtailing review hopefully making some changes to the board of immigration and really suggesting to congress that they limit the definition of said whose is listed as an extremist group by the southern poverty law center there is already a backlog of over half a million cases before the immigration making this task nothing short of and leaving advocates concerned that due process could simply fly out of the window stein also predicted the trump administration will seek to expand the ice detention due to the rising rate of interior apprehensions the network already detains more than people and relies heavily on substandard
trump has won science and scientists played almost no part in the campaign scientists must consider how they fit into a trump future this be easy many scientists are scared in the tribal world of us many now find themselves on the outside looking in most university scientists are and the house and senate will all be republican for this nothing portends disaster more than the elevation of a opponent to national and international of the competitive enterprise to oversee the transformation of the environmental protection those academics who lean republican of whom are since you would despise rejection of what a w bush adviser once dismissed as the anyone interested in evidence over speculating on details like who trump will ask to replace john as his science scientists should not just be asking what trump will do for them they should face up to the difficult question of what they should be doing for trump some scientists will have to join the white house itself when w bush was his administration had a hard time finding a scientist willing to serve as his science advisor when jack a highly respected administrator and physicist who was also a took the job he was excoriated by his peers and excommunicated from some scientific circles we see hints of similar responses to election already earlier this week the physical society issued a press release congratulating trump on his victory and encouraging him to sustained and robust funding of scientific research a top the received so many complaints that it felt compelled to retract it and issue an apology some have already written off science advisor for of state university not sure science would because there be any science get much except when it gets in the way or bolsters support for a political was called a upon taking the position under bush there are thousands of political including many science that will need to be expert advisory bodies constituted and and experts put into staff positions under the white house any scientist who agrees to hold their nose and work with the trump administration should expect much of the same criticism received by such as government will not have much choice but to engage that is their job the rest of the scientific community must still ask itself some difficult questions we suggest money all that the late stages of the presidential prize winners endorsed and pushed for more funding for research and policies that support the scientific workforce they suggested that there were other reasons for their but focused on what the next president might do for the interests of the scientific incoming president of the geophysical union expressed a similar a fear that the scientific infrastructure in the is going to be on its everything from funding to being able to attract the global leaders we need to do basic science trump imagines that the scientific community could cause him one option would be to do what did to reactionary doctors in setting up the and their mouths with trump could echo promising to science to its rightful by increasing funding it would be the art of the and it would put critical scientists in a difficult position no one knows what trump will do on science or much else the history of us science funding shows that republican presidents more eager to spend on than their democratic priorities have with democrats spending more through the environmental protection agency and commerce while republicans spend more on the national science foundation and national institutes of health overall spending on is not with party mainly because science funding has long been a bipartisan priority other than the massive injections of cash through the and smaller stimulus package more science funding has remained pretty stable as a proportion of government discretionary spending since the end of world war two without much discussion of the fiscal trump has announced grand plans for increases in us infrastructure investment for this could mean funding for perhaps newt will revive his vision of a moon base and a mission to mars the demoted since the end of the cold could receive a boost that advocate for more science funding have already sought to tie in funding with calls for greater investment scientists need to consider how to react to possible increases in funding as well as express fears of decreases in doing they
