for his second book john pomfret a journalist with extensive experience in china has taken a microscope to an enormous subject the relationship between the united states and china from to the present with growing stress points in that relationship and the emergence of strongman leaders in both nations the book the beautiful country and the middle kingdom arrives during a precarious inflection point it is peppered with characters that mr pomfret uses to trace a long historical arc from howqua a cantonese tycoon to herbert yardley a prominent american cryptographer and henry m paulson jr the former united states treasury secretary mr pomfret is scheduled to speak about his book on tuesday at the politics and prose bookstore in washington in an interview he discussed the history of interactions between the united states and china president xi jinpings worldview and what china policy might emerge from the trump administration what has been the overarching paradigm of united states china relations from the century to now americans and chinese have been enchanting each other and disappointing each other since they first met in when the first u s ship landed in guangzhou with a cargo of american grown ginseng and silver to trade for tea if theres a pattern to the relationship it has been rapturous enchantment followed by despair right now americans are in the disenchantment phase of the cycle as are the chinese you tell many colorful anecdotes of americans and chinese in contact with each other which one do you think best reflects the wider story one of the main goals of the book was to bring to light stories of unchronicled influence on both sides the first american minister to the qing court in beijing was a young republican named anson burlingame burlingame was a radical abolitionist who was dispatched to beijing by the lincoln administration burlingame believed that the west needed to give china time to develop and modernize and stop pressuring china to change he believed that the west had no right to criticize for example the way china treated chinese christians and he argued that western officials should tolerate the chinese habit of maintaining that their emperor actually ruled the entire world to me burlingame encapsulates one side of the american view of china one that reappeared in the and lasted up through the beginning of the obama administration the idea or rather the bet that china would liberalize and become more like us as long as we facilitated its rise in opposition to burlingame other americans believed his views on china were as one of his successors in beijing put it a hallucination that also has formed a key part of the american perspective on china your book discusses the way governments in the two nations have interacted with each other but you also go into detail on the roles that notable nonpolitical figures have played to what extent does the united states china relationship depend on the attitudes of each countries leaders versus those of other citizens whether they are from the elite classes or the grass roots in many ways we and the chinese and our governments elites and those from the grass roots are captives of our past in the beginning of the relationship individual americans and chinese created the relationship and imbued it with much of its meaning american merchants and missionaries saw china as a vast market for stuff and for souls chinese saw america as a place that could save china from the depredations of other imperialist nations and with its world class educational system as a model for china to emulate at the same time other groups of americans feared the chinese and starting in the late oppressed chinese workers in america starting a long history of fearing the industriousness of the chinese chinese had their own prejudices against americans and american ideas as well viewing them as immoral sexually deviant and dangerous many of these dreams and nightmares fantasies and biases we have about each other have resurfaced in subsequent decades in donald trumps claim that china has been raping the united states when it comes to trade one can hear the populists of the california workingmens party in late century california railing on the streets of san francisco against the heathen chinese in your many years as a journalist in china what were the most notable changes you saw in the united states china relationship with chinas rise beijing is less willing to bend to washingtons will than before and more willing to aggressively pursue its interests whether they involve trade or the south china sea washington spent decades arguing that as china strengthened it would become more like a liberal western nation it hasnt turned out that way and as such the u s has stopped doing china any favors much more than before it is blocking the sales of western companies to chinese firms and strengthening its alliances with nations around chinas periphery the careful balance of containment and engagement that defined americas policy toward china is now heavily skewed toward containment what are your thoughts on president xi jinpings worldview and how the united states fits into that xi jinping has said he wants asians to rule asia which i think can be translated into a desire to see china rule asia in this view the u s is an interloper and would do best to retreat to hawaii and let china handle the western pacific china benefited greatly from the pax americana in the pacific but now xi feels that china does not need the u s to protect it anymore it wants the u s out of asia not next year not the year after but one day soon with the election of donald trump as the next united states president where do you see the relationship going trump is not an outlier when it comes to his views on china they are contradictory but so were obamas

hillary clintons lead in the popular vote is growing she is roughly votes behind donald j trump in the key swing states of michigan and wisconsin a combined gap that is narrowing her impassioned supporters are now urging her to challenge the results in those two states and pennsylvania grasping at the last straws to reverse mr trumps decisive majority in the electoral college in recent days they have seized on a report by a respected computer scientist and other experts suggesting that michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin the keys to mr trumps electoral college victory need to manually review paper ballots to assure the election was not hacked were this years deviations from pre election polls the results of a cyberattack j alex halderman a computer science professor at the university of michigan who has studied the vulnerabilities of election systems at length wrote on medium on wednesday as the calls based on his conclusions mounted probably not more likely he wrote pre election polls were systematically wrong but the only way to resolve the lingering questions would be to examine paper ballots and voting equipment in critical states he wrote tellingly the pleas for recounts have gained no support from the clinton campaign which has concluded along with outside experts that it is highly unlikely the outcome would change even after an expensive and time consuming review of ballots but that has not quieted mrs clintons supporters who see the inequity of her growing lead in the national popular vote which is now more than two million votes or percent of all ballots cast according to the nonpartisan cook political report which regularly updates its count as states continue to tally and to certify votes since there is currently no effort to review the paper ballots which exist in michigan and wisconsin but only in parts of pennsylvania conspiracy theories about the election may live on for years after united states intelligence agencies accused russia of trying to influence the election by stealing and publishing emails from the democratic national committee and a range of other institutions and prominent individuals the united states went on high alert to determine if there was any attempt to sabotage the vote count so far no one in the obama administration has indicated that there is any such evidence in the three battleground states mrs clinton is behind by percent or less and the final results have not yet been certified uniting around the social media hashtag auditthevote the campaign after the campaign has picked up momentum among grass roots activists still mourning mr trumps victory and who echo paradoxically his pre election complaint that the vote was rigged based on the information of the intelligence community that russia was actively trying to screw around with our election i thought why not take the time and question this said michelle zuckerman parker an engineer in pittsburgh who on wednesday planned to petition her county election board for a recount of the nov vote that view spread quickly on social media on tuesday evening when new york magazine published an article about professor halderman and others who had contacted the remnants of the clinton campaign it also generated pushback by experts who said that even though it was theoretically possible to hack voting machines it would be enormously difficult because it would have to be highly targeted in key precincts and conducted on a scale required to assure mr trumps victory left wing conspiracy theories of vote rigging are pathetic dave wasserman of the cook political report said on twitter time may have already run out pennsylvania allows individual voters to petition for a recount but the deadline was sunday said wanda murren a spokeswoman for the pennsylvania department of state a candidate can also contest an election in court and the deadline is monday michigan and wisconsin have not reached their deadlines for seeking a recount but they will in days so far mrs clinton has not requested any action said reid magney a spokesman for the wisconsin elections commission until the publication of professor haldermans work clinton supporters had few reasons to hope he did not offer them much he noted that while the voting machines used in those states are not connected to the internet during the election they are programmed before the election the data is usually transferred on a usb stick or other data card if attackers can modify that software by infecting the machines with malware they can cause the machines to give any answer whatsoever professor halderman wrote the problem as bruce schneier a security expert who has written often on the issue noted in an interview is that the usual triggers for a recount a very close margin between two candidates make little sense in a world of state sponsored computer hackings a truly sophisticated hacking would result in a wider margin of victory that would not set off an automatic recount mrs clinton would have to triumph in all three states to win the electoral college the electors will meet in december to formally choose the president and there mr trump is ahead by votes to mrs clintons with michigan still officially uncalled as of wednesday mr trumps lead in michigan had shrunk to votes or percent according to the national popular vote tracker maintained by the cook political report mr trumps lead in wisconsin has narrowed to votes or percent in pennsylvania his lead slightly grew on wednesday to or percent the clinton campaign did not respond to requests for comment other democrats said it was time to move on im not sure its possible to undo the results and all the people are focusing their energy on opposing the worst ideas of this administration at this point not the legitimacy of the results said daniel doubet an organizer for keystone progress a liberal group in pennsylvania those pushing for a recount say they are trying to pick up the fight for a tired

if you are a close observer of the new york times as alison harvey is you might have noticed a headline about megyn kelly the fox news anchor it suggested that she had died at age leaving us without americas favorite news reporter this wasnt a news story written by a times reporter and it isnt true kelly is alive and prosperous exceptionally so but it has appeared with some regularity on the times website as an advertisement pretending to be a news story in other words its fake news or at least a version of it harvey a times reader from reno nev has been noticing the ad awhile now and wrote me this week to complain this ad or clickbait keeps popping up on various new york times pages online she said this is unacceptable please stop these ads which frankly make me feel like the ny times is no better an outlet than the horrifying facebook feeds with all of their fake news clickbait items how could such fraudulent content wind up on the times website through something called programmatic advertising which essentially means that computers and algorithms conduct the transactions between advertisers and publishers rather than people its machine to machine like a stock market matching buyers with sellers both the timess newsroom and its advertising department have rules that forbid false misleading or otherwise worrisome ads from appearing on the site but it is difficult to apply those rules when computers are serving up the ads automatically without a sales rep on the other end of the transaction screening out the misfits sebastian tomich a senior vice president in advertising says the times works aggressively to squash ads like the one that made the false megyn kelly claim but the nature of the mechanized system means that most of the policing is done after the fact once the ad has already appeared thus the kelly ad has now been reported and taken down tomich says another ad that fell into the same category was also removed recently tomich says the times has one of the cleanest ad experiences in the publishing business i agree relative to the size of the site and the volume of advertising the times doesnt have many ads that tout the premature demise of newscasters or make false claims about weight loss remedies still when fraudulent ads do pop up theyre jarring and thats especially true now that the firing squads are out trying to punish those responsible for publishing fake news during the election facebook and google are the prime targets because critics say they recklessly let their platforms be used by the scammers who create fake news facebooks mark zuckerberg hoping to hose down the fire says his company is taking steps to curtail the flow of fabricated content onto its users newsfeeds in an editorial this week the times piled on warning facebook that its proposed changes dont go far enough and warning of the danger that awaits if zuckerberg continues to let liars and con artists hijack his platform as measured by sheer impact there is no comparison between a handful of fake news ads on the times website and an endless gush of fake news stories that get shared by millions on facebook one is a brook the other is an ocean but there are similarities too both organizations find themselves in the position of unwittingly publishing fake content that misleads and annoys readers and that can diminish a brand fake news ads like the megyn kelly one may not be rampant at the times but its still worth taking a good look at whether the times is really doing everything it can to eliminate them thats particularly true at a moment when fake news is such a flash point and when the times is dispensing advice to another publisher on how to solve its problems
at thanksgiving many of us will be subject to or subjecting our hosts to a wide range of opinions about the election but some aspects of it are rooted in fact not open to interpretation below we present a compendium of sorts about the election to help guide you in your discussions some of these may seem basic but they are by no means obvious to everyone dont let them get in the way of a good holiday argument hillary clinton definitely won the popular vote and that lead is only going to grow the new york times called the election for donald j trump at about a m on nov at that time he had about million votes almost a million more than hillary clinton even before then the signs pointed to her edge in the national popular vote most of the votes that remain uncounted are in heavily democratic places like california even roughly two weeks later the state estimated that it had about two million ballots yet to be counted including about in los angeles county where voters have preferred mrs clinton by around percentage points as the votes have trickled in the popular vote has tilted toward mrs clinton as of wednesday morning that lead surpassed two million votes or percentage points better than mr trump this lead is still growing but its already a larger margin than in popular vote victories by al gore in richard nixon in and john f kennedy in turnout in the election was not low it is about the same as it was in and comparable to most century presidential elections turnout is simple to calculate take the total number of votes cast and divide it by the total number of adults who are eligible to vote and presto you have a turnout rate when the race was called this math problem yielded a rate that was indeed historically low it was also wrong for the same reason mrs clinton trailed in the popular vote at that time not all the ballots had been counted because the denominator in this math problem the number of voting eligible adults on election day does not change the turnout rate goes up every time ballots are counted as they have come in the turnout rate has risen to about percent michael mcdonald at the united states elections project estimates that it will ultimately be closer to percent a bit lower than it was in and roughly comparable to most presidential elections in the last years yes the polls were off but not in extraordinary ways mrs clinton held a modest but steady lead in nearly every national poll for months and led most state polls in florida north carolina pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin yet she lost in each of these states so how wrong were the polls on average by about percentage points in the closest states thats higher than in any election in decades but comparable to polling misses in and the polling miss much larger because the places where mrs clinton fared worse than polls suggested were concentrated in a few battleground states the places where she fared better than expected were in big liberal states where she had almost no chance of losing nationally these effects nearly canceled out which is why her national polling lead before the election three to four points ended up being close to the result third party candidates like gary johnson and jill stein may have cost mrs clinton michigan but they almost certainly did not cost her the presidency the total vote tally says about percent of all voters about million people voted for mr johnson or ms stein in four battleground states that mrs clinton lost florida pennsylvania wisconsin and michigan the votes for these third party candidates exceeded mr trumps margin of victory if those states had flipped mrs clinton would be president are third party voters responsible for the trump presidency almost certainly not with the exception of michigan third party voters would have had to overwhelmingly favor mrs clinton to flip the state that notion also rests on a significant number of third party voters coming to the polls but many of them told pollsters that they would have stayed home if they could not have voted for their third party candidate if we look at mr trumps margin of victory in these four states and the number of votes cast for mr johnson or ms stein were left with a simple math problem if those candidates did not exist what share of those votes would mrs clinton have needed to pick up to overtake mr trumps vote lead the answer a substantial share might these voters really have preferred mrs clinton to mr trump to this degree and showed up to the polls at higher rates than they told pollsters they would its possible but for that vote to be decisive pennsylvania or florida and at least one other state would have had to flip the evidence we have suggests such an outcome would have been highly unlikely if anything the johnson vote could have easily leaned toward mr trump exit polls are useful but dont give them too much credence as my colleague nate cohn has written exit polls are helpful but using them to come to conclusions about the precise composition of the electorate is risky and frequently wrong in they painted a picture of the electorate that was younger and more diverse than it really was many important questions remain about precisely who voted and why did poor democratic turnout doom mrs clinton or were swing voters the key to mr trumps win did mr trump really do better among hispanic voters than mitt romney further analysis of the voter files which show who voted and who didnt will provide more clarity in the months ahead exit polls alone are not a definitive way to answer these questions but a few things as weve tried to

if you think back to this years presidential campaign and recall a lot of articles mentioning hillary clintons email troubles and donald j trumps various controversies you wouldnt be wrong if it seems there were fewer articles about jobs the economy and taxes thats because there were the temptation to blame news organizations for this imbalance is strong but there is at least some reason to resist it critics have long assailed campaign coverage as focused too much on candidate personality campaign strategy and assessments of whos winning instead of on policies and ideas but this year the candidates share the blame i compared the content of campaign ads with the content of news articles about two specific topics candidate traits or characteristics and the economy or jobs both the candidates and news organizations spent more time discussing the candidates fitness for office than they did the nations economy and the imbalance grew more lopsided as the election approached using analytic tools provided by crimson hexagon i categorized the campaign news coverage of media outlets this consisted of four broadcast networks three cable news networks national public radio and hugh hewitt on the radio two online news sites and newspapers i specifically searched for news about mrs clintons campaign and her email server or her campaign and wikileaks and several controversies connected to mr trumps campaign i also looked for news about the candidates campaign appeals on the economy and jobs this list isnt exhaustive but it gives a sense of the trade off between coverage of these controversies and the economy the candidates controversies received more coverage on average than their views on the economy from june until election day percent of the stories mentioned mr trumps various missteps and percent mentioned mrs clintons email only percent mentioned mr trump and jobs or the economy and only percent cited mrs clintons campaign and the economy closer to the election from oct on the numbers got even more lopsided this was an important date just after the release of the access hollywood video and a few weeks before f b i director james b comeys letter to congress from this point percent of the campaign articles mentioning either controversies or the economy discuss mrs clintons email while only percent mention her alongside jobs or the economy as for mr trump percent mention his entanglements while percent mention him related to jobs and the economy the imbalance in coverage of the candidates character is striking as is the lack of coverage about the economy compared with the controversies moving one week past the video release between oct and election day roughly half of the stories about scandals and the economy mentioned mrs clintons emails and only a quarter discussed mr trump and his imbroglios a mere percent of the stories in these last three weeks mentioned mrs clinton and the economy these choices have consequences according to the gallup organization americans reports of what they heard or read about mrs clinton between june and september were mainly references to her handling of emails during her time as secretary of state in contrast mentions of mr trump changed week by week tracking what was happening on the campaign trail but before anyone blames the news media its important to examine what the candidates themselves were talking about over the course of the campaign if media reports reflect candidate discourse accurately then it is not merely the media choosing to report on scandals it might be at least as much the candidates choosing to campaign on them that results in unending coverage of traits and characteristics to figure out if this was the case i used data from kantar media cmag on all the candidates campaign ads aired between june and election day i coded all of the appeals in each ad and weighted the appeals by how many times the ads ran on television mrs clinton made more ads than mr trump and she vastly out advertised him running nearly three times as many ads as he did all told over half a million ads were run in during this period the content of the ads is revealing both candidates spent most of their television advertising time attacking the other persons character in fact the losing candidates ads did little else more than three quarters of the appeals in mrs clintons advertisements were about traits characteristics or dispositions only percent of mrs clintons appeals in her ads were about jobs or the economy by contrast percent of mr trumps appeals focused on the economy jobs taxes and trade since the start of presidential campaign television advertising in no campaign has made percent of its television ad appeals about any single topic on average traits typically garner about percent of the appeals the economy typically generates about percent of the appeals theres usually much more balance of course this was an unusual election year with two very unpopular candidates so the candidates flaws may have simply been too big a story for either them or the media to pass up whatever the reason the criterion of fitness for office dominated the clinton campaigns messaging and made up a good share of the trump messaging as well and the news media covered it
a federal judge in texas issued a nationwide injunction on tuesday against an obama administration regulation expanding by millions the number of workers who would be eligible for time and a half overtime pay the regulation was scheduled to take effect on dec it would raise the salary limit below which workers automatically qualified for overtime pay to from the judge amos l mazzant iii of the eastern district of texas ruled that the obama administration had exceeded its authority by raising the overtime salary limit so significantly the ruling was hailed by business groups who argued the new rules would be costly and result in fewer hours for workers the labor department said it strongly disagreed with the decision and was considering all of our legal options raising the possibility of an appeal in the waning days of the obama administration ross eisenbrey of the economic policy institute whose writings on the subject helped shape the administrations regulation called the ruling a disappointment to millions of workers who are forced to work long hours with no extra compensation while the injunction is only a temporary measure that suspends the regulation until the judge can issue a ruling on the merits many said the judges language indicated he was likely to strike down the regulation we are assuming that this preliminary injunction holds and there isnt an appeal or some other thing that disrupts it done with this regulation said marc freedman executive director of labor law policy at the u s chamber of commerce which had challenged the rule the fate of the regulation had already been thrown into question by the election of donald j trump as president two weeks ago mr trump has promised to reverse many regulations approved during the obama administration and the republican congress has generally criticized the scope of the expansion of overtime eligibility still because undoing the regulation could have required a months or yearslong rule making process similar to the one that produced it the new overtime limit appeared likely to survive in some form some business lobbyists had anticipated a legislative compromise that phased in the new limit over a longer period of time and eliminated an automatic increase in the limit every three years the injunction would appear to make such a reprieve far less likely although the question remains whether the trump administration will seek a legislative deal that would raise the salary limit above the that has prevailed since but below the obama administrations preferred level theres no question that this decision changes a number of different points of leverage over the future of the rule said david french senior vice president for government relations at the national retail federation which opposed the new rule mr french added however that his group and many other business organizations were open to some increase in the limit were years past the last update he said supporters of the regulation have observed that the politics of essentially withdrawing a planned salary increase from many workers could prove complicated for an incoming president elected on a message of improving workers economic circumstances further complicating the picture is the fact that many large employers have already raised the pay of some employees over the new limit concluding that it would be more cost effective than paying them overtime it is rare for employers to reverse such pay increases making large employers potentially sympathetic to an overtime compromise that would effectively extend the salary increase to some of their smaller rivals tuesdays ruling arose from a case filed by a coalition of states who argued that the administration had exceeded its statutory authority in raising the overtime salary limit so significantly a large number of business groups filed a similar lawsuit and the suits were later consolidated in his ruling judge mazzant whom president obama appointed agreed with that logic and appeared to go even further suggesting that the administration lacked the authority even to establish a salary limit which the labor department has raised repeatedly since congress enacted the underlying legislation in the courts decision suggests that the department of labor has no authority whatsoever to regulate a salary minimum said allan s bloom of the law firm proskauer rose in a statement the labor department defended how the rule was created the departments overtime rule is the result of a comprehensive inclusive rule making process and we remain confident in the legality of all aspects of the rule the statement said
houston before the election gun rights activists were so worried hillary clinton would win the presidency that some of them bought extra ammunition and guns fearing a crackdown on certain weapons bullets and magazines theyre not worried now instead since the election of donald j trump gun advocates have been rejoicing crowing about their political clout and plotting ways to eliminate many remaining curbs on gun ownership and use as they await one of the most vocal pro gun presidential candidates ever to enter the white house weve been threatened weve been bullied weve been ridiculed for eight years said alice tripp legislative director of the texas state rifle association the state affiliate of the national rifle association i expect the tone to change if tone sets policy then weve got it made it was more than just the outcome of the presidential race gun advocates played a role in flipping the state senate in iowa from blue to red and helped defeat a ballot initiative in maine that would have required universal background checks for gun sales the national rifle association spent million in seven races this year by supporting mr trump and six republican senate candidates and it lost only one race in nevada according to an analysis by the center for responsive politics and the trace a nonprofit news outlet that covers gun violence smart politicians all across the country are realizing that if we dont play ball with the second amendment we will find ourselves unemployed said aaron dorr executive director of iowa gun owners whose members distributed information about candidates perceived as hostile to the second amendment in five state senate districts in each the democratic incumbent lost in kansas and indiana voters approved amendments enshrining the right to hunt and fish in their constitutions and in maine david trahan executive director of the sportsmans alliance of maine which opposed the ballot question on universal background checks there said concerns about restricting lawful gun transfers and a sense that outsiders were dictating maines political process had led to a backlash the measure was backed by everytown for gun safety a group founded in part by michael r bloomberg a former mayor of new york supporters of gun control said the national situation was more nuanced than the gun activists jubilation suggested they said it was impossible to say what role gun issues had played in mr trumps victory and disputed that the election was a national referendum on gun rights of the four high profile state ballot measures gun control advocates won three and lost one in maine in washington state voters passed an initiative allowing for emergency court orders to temporarily block the right to possess a gun for people perceived as being at a higher risk of harming themselves or another person californians passed a measure requiring background checks to buy ammunition and nevada voters approved a ballot measure requiring background checks for almost all gun transfers beyond what is required by federal law jennifer crowe who campaigned for the background check measure in nevada known as question said concerns about homicides and unchecked online gun sales had helped her side win despite opposition the more we spoke about the online marketplace and how robust it is the more people seemed to understand the importance of question as a public safety measure ms crowe said erika soto lamb a spokeswoman for everytown for gun safety which supported the ballot items in maine washington state and nevada said the only true referendums on how americans view the issue of gun safety are the ballot measures she said the open discussion of gun control in the campaign and the state level wins suggested that what has long been considered a third rail issue was in fact a winning issue gun rights advocates say just the opposite calling mrs clintons defeat a sign that gun control is an untouchable issue and anticipating an expansion of gun rights with a trump administration and a republican majority congress one of the policies being discussed would lift the restrictions that prohibit service members on military bases and at recruiting centers from being armed weapons rules at most military bases and centers prohibit service members who are not police or security personnel from carrying firearms and mr trump has said he supports banning so called gun free zones on military bases the issue gained new attention after shootings at military sites including at fort hood tex and in chattanooga tenn if nidal hasan had had somebody shoot him back he might have hurt and even killed a few people but he wouldnt have killed as many as he did said valente gonzalez an administrator for the advocacy group open carry texas in the houston area referring to the gunman who killed people at fort hood in disarming law abiding people invites chaos other policies include a national right to carry which would allow those with concealed handgun permits in one state to have their permits honored in the other states such a move known as national reciprocity also has the backing of mr trump there is also a push to make silencers easier and less costly to purchase by removing them from the national firearms act we want broad deregulation of firearms said dudley brown the president of the national association for gun rights its high time republican majorities in the executive and legislative branches come in and make some broad broad changes as the saying goes dance with the ones who brung ya some gun owners were as surprised as anyone by mr trumps upset victory c j grisham a retired army sergeant and the president of open carry texas bought two ar rifles and an ammunition making kit shortly before the election out of concern about a possible clinton victory a lot of people in the gun rights community can breathe again he said i dont think anybody is complaining that they went and bought extra guns mr
the election has resurrected the fiasco of how to fix fannie mae and freddie mac shares of the two bailed out mortgage agencies have rocketed over the last two weeks on hopes that the trump administration might end government oversight big political roadblocks remain though fannie and freddie which buy or guarantee home loans needed billion of taxpayer aid in the financial crisis and were placed under government conservatorship debates about whether to reduce their role went nowhere because they play a large role in the year mortgage market allowing them to shake off their government training wheels is a long way off even representative jeb hensarling a republican and the house financial services committee chairman reckons his plan to do so is a long shot worries about hurting the housing market and in turn angering voters are strong enough that some republican lawmakers would probably join their democratic rivals in opposing any such attempt there is one relatively easy tweak though that could please most sides allowing fannie and freddie to keep their earnings since they have been forced to hand over all profit as dividends to the treasury so far they have sent billion none of which counts toward repaying the bailout that would allow them to rebuild their capital they currently have just million each set aside against a total of trillion of loans on their books and that is scheduled to fall to zero in that raises the embarrassing prospect of one or both of them having to go cap in hand to uncle sam for another bailout in even a mild housing downturn avoiding that ought to appeal to lawmakers william a ackman john paulson and other hedge fund managers who bought fannie and freddie stock after the crash have been pushing for this for some time too including in the courts donald j trumps ascendancy to the white house has emboldened them not least because steven mnuchin a former goldman sachs partner who is a leading candidate to become treasury secretary was a co investor with mr paulson in the mortgage lender indymac recapitalizing it after its collapse and selling it last year to cit ending fannie and freddies status as an a t m for the government would still leave their bailout unpaid and their future status unresolved but it would be a smart first step
the proliferation of fake news online has roiled the american presidential election politicians around the world and internet companies including facebook and google so what happens when the fake news juggernaut also sweeps up ordinary citizens cecilia kang saw the fallout up close when she interviewed james alefantis owner of the comet ping pong pizzeria in washington mr alefantis and his employees have gotten caught up in a storm of fake news recently a barrage of false articles on social media and fake news sites said their pizzeria was a front for a child trafficking ring led by hillary clinton and her campaign chief john d podesta the stories collected under the hashtag pizzagate have surprised mr alefantis he was a supporter of mrs clintons and has prominent democratic friends in washington but has never met the former democratic presidential candidate nor peddled children nor abused them the repercussions have been far reaching mr alefantis his friends and employees are now dealing with a flood of nasty comments on social media threatening phone calls and even visits to their restaurant from people who say they believe the fake news articles mr alefantis has gotten in touch with the federal bureau of investigation the local police and many social media companies to try to take down the fake items he has had little success its endless mr alefantis said of the strange digital turn his life has taken
donald j trump through decades in public life has been consistent on one core policy idea that the united states has gotten a raw deal from its major trading partners in the agreements that bind their economies renegotiating those terms will surely be a top priority for his administration but what will that mean in practice while the broad thrust of mr trumps thinking on trade is clear and he has mentioned a few specific policies he would embrace he and his appointees will have wide latitude in how they pursue more favorable trade arrangements for the united states a youtube video released on monday reiterated a campaign promise to withdraw from the trans pacific partnership and more vaguely vowed to negotiate fair bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto american shores since election day trade experts have been gaming potential scenarios of what trump administration trade policy might look like in detail some of those possibilities would risk only modest disruptions to the world economy and could very well result in better long term arrangements for american companies others would blow up the underpinnings of the modern global economy endanger trillions of dollars worth of cross border commerce and stand a good chance of prompting a worldwide recession heres what those possibilities look like from the most benign to the most disruptive there really are some elements of the united states existing relationships with major trading partners that are dysfunctional and disadvantageous to the united states by taking more aggressive stands on some of them a trump administration may be able to get better deals mr trump has said repeatedly that he wants to renegotiate the north american free trade agreement a lot of things can fit under the rubric of renegotiate though and there is room to update the deal in ways that would prove beneficial to the united states the agreement is years old after all and there is plenty of room to adjust terms in ways that preserve the deeply intertwined north american economy there are too many parts of it that are not working said david malpass an economist on the trump transition team at an event in october there is supposed to be regular annual review between the parties of nafta to see where its not working well and to have kind of a constant process of renewal thats been dropped away and so thats something that needs to be looked at the trump administration could also pick a variety of industries where it believes trade partners have treated the united states unfairly and bring cases before the world trade organization paired with targeted duties to punish what it sees as unfair behavior the approach could win more favorable deals the bush administration did just that with steel tariffs in as did the obama administration with a percent tax on chinese tires in trade experts are generally skeptical that these efforts prove worthwhile gary clyde hufbauer and sean lowry of the peterson institute for international economics calculated that american consumers paid an extra billion for tires in to safeguard a mere american tire making jobs thats per job saved but mr trumps administration could bring a series of such cases and if as he promises his team members prove to be made up of tougher smarter negotiators than their predecessors perhaps they could get better results even if they dont the trillion united states economy will most likely be o k mr trump has said he will instruct his treasury secretary to declare china a currency manipulator the george w bush and obama administrations didnt do this although they also thought that china artificially depressed the value of its currency to the benefit of chinese exporters however they calculated that subtle diplomacy would be more likely than head on confrontation to get results but who knows maybe that calculation was wrong and a more confrontational approach would have led china to allow its currency to respond to market forces the chinese government has allowed its currency to rise relative to the dollar over the last few years putting it roughly in line with economic fundamentals and reducing the urgency of the issue naming china a currency manipulator merely triggers negotiation over what to do about it such negotiation would most likely be hard fought and it might result in a better long term arrangement for the united states or not but either way it wouldnt need to disrupt day to day trade relations that assumes that mr trump takes a more aggressive stance using existing channels and authorities and wages the battle with the trading partner over specific cases and industries if so it will keep lawyers and lobbyists for those industries busy there would be pushback but youd be working within the relevant legal frameworks and using existing institutions as they were intended by congress and the w t o and our trading partners said scott lincicome a trade lawyer at white case who has been critical of mr trump everybody will talk about it but it wont change the global macroeconomic outlook ambiguous language in the statutes grants the president broad authority over trade policy mr trump could be the kind of president willing to use that authority to its fullest rather than focus on targeted duties on individual products as part of a w t o case the government could invoke emergency authority to place broad based tariffs on goods from a given country think of the percent tariff on chinese imports that mr trump at one point threatened during his campaign or perhaps an escalating tariff set to rise until the trade deficit with a given country declines moves along those lines would get everyones attention but they would also create enormous ripple effects there would surely be legal challenges by the targeted countrys industries as well as swift and potentially painful retaliation from trade partners china wouldnt take these kinds of measures lying down with these
in an office building in suburban las vegas an n h l franchise is taking shape it has been five months since the n h l awarded las vegas an expansion team on june it will be about more months before the team plays its first regular season game but as the n h ls other teams settle into the rhythms of a long season the las vegas franchise the n h ls first expansion team since the columbus blue

knights and its gray black and gold logo in a ceremony outside the new t mobile arena on the las vegas strip where the team will play the knight never gives up never gives in always advances never retreats said bill foley the teams majority owner and thats what our team is going to be foley a graduate of the united states military academy had hoped to call the team the black knights but encountered resistance including some from west point in an interview this month foley said he settled on a name by the end of august and team representatives have been working with adidas on a logo since mid july it was not ready until late october everyone has an opinion i can tell you that foley said i was trying to do consensus building for a while then i stopped if people do not like the name he added its going to be on me foley at least has some company in decision making now after the las vegas ownership group which includes the maloof family the former owners of the sacramento kings received permission from the n h l to conduct a season ticket drive in december to gauge interest foley worked with a small group of advisers and ticket representatives now foley has cleared out a floor in an office building in summerlin a suburb miles from the strip for his growing staff which he described as around poor people living in little cubes he said he had not wanted to spend money or risk capital before the team was awarded so the past five months have been a sprint the first major hire was that of general manager george mcphee who was the washington capitals general manager

centers to invite themselves over to sell residents on the team pollock said foley said that sometimes only to people would show up at a bar but when deposits were made on the first day of the drive foley said he thought wow people really want this the team converted a strong majority of deposits into season tickets selling about foley said las vegas is so ready to have its own thing other than the strip he said while he acknowledged that his team may have to share the city with the oakland raiders after they recently reached a stadium deal with the state foley noted that the raiders are not owned by local residents and come with an existing fan base while others try to build a fan base mcphee is trying to build a team with the expansion draft scheduled for june to and the amateur draft

pouring over statistics of every professional team and every minor league team to rate players and build a database his crew of scouts is watching games a night canvassing all the n h l teams and determining the best prospects in the amateur ranks we do feel like we are in a good rhythm right now mcphee said mcphee and his staff plan to do a mock expansion draft each month after doing their first in november which produced questions for the league about the rules with no franchise players expected to be available in
this years election has forced americans to take notice of class divisions between workers and while these divisions may at first ring of lazy stereotypes the rural rust belt worker without a college degree and the coastal urban college educated worker theyre rooted in a real dynamic many of the most skilled workers young people with college degrees are leaving struggling regions of america for cities specifically for cities in southern and coastal states there are clear economic reasons for their choice dense metro areas tend to produce more jobs and make workers more productive wages for all kinds of workers are also higher in theory these incentives should prompt workers of all levels of education to move to metro areas but moving outside ones region is relatively rare these days and even more rare for someone without a college degree moving is actually quite uncommon in advanced economies the united states has been one of the exceptions it has one of the highest rates of internal migration among advanced economies and it has since at least the middle of the century a study comparing thousands of american and british census records between and showed that nearly two thirds of american men moved across county lines while only a quarter of british men did for americas first century internal migration was largely driven by farming moving west to new land but toward the end of the and in the early century migration began to be driven by people moving to american cities small and large this pattern added a twist after world war ii when more people began moving outside their local region particularly to the sunbelt before the roughly percent of americans lived outside a census division in which they were born and by that had jumped to percent but in the people started moving less internal migration has been in gradual decline ever since across all demographic groups in the percent of men moved across state lines each year over the last decade that figure has dropped to percent the decline is similar for women between and the demographic groups with the lowest rate of interstate migration were people with less than a high school diploma or nothing beyond a high school diploma migration rates for college educated people were roughly twice that in the regional competition for the most skilled and most mobile workers in america many noncoastal states are at a disadvantage although they have some large cities they tend to be farther from other large cities than is the case in the coastal areas the economists stuart rosenthal and william strange looked at the benefits of density and found that they tend to dissipate over distances greater than five miles this advantage provided by clusters of cities is helpful for coastal states which tend to contain many big metro areas like san diego los angeles san jose and san francisco in california or the so called acela corridor stretching from washington to boston but it can be bad news for inland areas with one or two large cities that are farther apart omaha and kansas city mo say or cleveland and columbus ohio the flows of young college graduates out of a state can often be replaced by flows of young college graduates moving in the problem that many interior states face is that young college graduates moving into the state arent keeping up with those that are leaving lots of talented young people all over the country are eager to see new sights what is different and a problem for michigan is that we have an unusually low rate of immigration said charley ballard a regional economist at michigan state university in an email keeping young college graduates would help alleviate the effects of globalization and technological change on these local economies its not surprising that many states with net losses in their young and college educated populations also showed some big gains for donald j trump relative to mitt romneys performance in the map shows the total net migration figures for those with a college degree under between and generally rust belt and midwest states like ohio michigan and iowa and plains states like south dakota and nebraska have seen the largest net losses in younger college educated people the places that are gaining college graduates tend to be coastal and southern states like california maryland texas and south carolina two exceptions to this trend are new york and massachusetts states that also produce a large number of college graduates to begin with one reason that inland states have a reasonable case for disappointment at not keeping their young college graduates theyre helping to pay to educate them a majority of college graduates get their degrees from public universities which are partly funded by state governments of course this doesnt diminish the other important benefits that public universities bring to each states economy but if states are losing more college graduates than they are holding or bringing in theyre effectively subsidizing other states skilled labor forces cities in these states do have some advantages the cost of living is lower mostly because housing is cheaper outdoor recreation is often more accessible still these areas are in a bind without jobs to offer luring young college educated people is hard at the same time its hard to create jobs without a college educated labor force to mr ballard its not clear that one policy proposal exists that could jump start the process it really is a chicken and egg problem he said i dont think theres anybody out there that thinks theres some quick easy solution in the days when cities competed for manufacturing advertising low wages and reliable utilities was often enough to draw businesses mr ballard pins his hopes of attracting more young college educated workers to michigan on efforts to market cultural amenities and natural beauty he points to the grand rapids artprize an arts festival that awards half a million
throughout this bitter election campaign liberal celebrities like lady gaga jennifer lawrence lena dunham and lin manuel miranda used their powerful media platforms to sing hillary clintons praises now theyve invited their online followers to join them in processing her loss and protesting the impending administration of donald j trump i want to live in a countryofkindness where lovetrumpshate lady gaga wrote on twitter the day after the election she added a photo of herself at a protest outside trump tower in manhattan where she had climbed onto a truck in a strapless black jumpsuit and raised a pro clinton sign while the angry tweets therapeutic instagram testimonials and fiery speeches may comfort their fans these left leaning celebrities are also inadvertently energizing the opposition conservative news outlets most notably breitbart news network the right wing populist enclave are perfecting the art of sapping democratic stars name recognition and repurposing their words and actions into pro trump material the enormous reach that celebrities enjoy and the privileged bubble they live in is wielded against them here refashioned as evidence of the outsize control that the rich and famous have over regular americans this new battle in the culture wars is being waged not by bombastic big name right wing commentators like rush limbaugh but by nimble often nameless online aggregators who quickly churn through popular culture and throw the most evocative stories to their readers often without much commentary all it takes is a pointed headline an unflattering photo and a few well chosen quotes like this lady gaga protests on sanitation truck outside trump tower read breitbarts headline for its article on her tweet america is divided by its politics its media and as this election made even clearer by its celebrity influencers in the weeks before the election the avengers director joss whedon booted up his own online public service announcement factory save the day and recruited stars like robert downey jr don cheadle and scarlett johansson to churn out web videos for mrs clinton katy perry america ferrera lebron james and beyonc joined democratic candidate at rallies and when vice president elect mike pence caught a performance of the broadway hit hamilton on friday one of the shows stars addressed him on behalf of the diverse america who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us no offense to paris hilton and pat boone but the president elect doesnt have the biggest stars on his side instead breitbart mostly uses its culture pages to aim spitballs at hollywood lefties as part of its coverage of what it calls big hollywood the glamour of celebrities becomes grist for the sites overarching narrative about the corrosive influence of the cultural elite the image ms dunham posted to instagram of a restorative trip to sedona ariz may have played as soothingly aspirational for an audience concentrated with young coastal women but to breitbarts demo under the headline grieving lena dunham seeks answers in arizona wilderness after trump win it looks like a damning shot of a celebrity who decided to jet into a red state for a quirky vacation retreat as the hamilton controversy raged prodded by mr trumps demand that the cast apologize to mr pence breitbart pointedly reminded readers of the private fund raiser mr miranda hosted for mrs clinton during the campaign where ticket prices ranged from to and just like that a celebrity speaking out against mr trump becomes a point in his defense breitbarts postelection hollywood coverage appears largely to be a cool cataloging of aggrieved celebrities including rick ross beneath the surface of these articles though is subtle signaling at work a piece about a postelection vice essay by jennifer lawrence in which she railed against the barriers still facing women in the workplace includes an underhanded accolade about her she was recently named the highest paid actress in hollywood for the second straight year this recent headline depressed robert de niro trump election makes me feel like i did after packs a one two punch pairing the image of a pathetic weepy liberal with a flip attitude toward terrorism breitbarts article on the hamilton dust up titled tolerance hamilton cast lectures mike pence from broadway stage is threaded with buzzwords that cast liberals as elite pedantic hypocrites while breitbart produces its share of original content it ran an essay by ann coulter ridiculing whining celebrities last week most of the conservative media outlets doing this work are scrappy spammy and surprisingly banal on regated a bare bones conservative aggregator the hamilton incident was inflated into a full blown class war just like clockwork the rich elitist liberals come out to mock the poor hamilton cast members along with other liberals took to twitter to mock and bully the less fortunate people in america but much of the text generated by these sites is barely politicized the conservative online outlet patriotic folks recently aggregated quotes from a lady gaga essay published in harpers bazaar about how she was depressed and hurt about mr trumps remarks about women and worked in just a whiff of commentary women are fighting for their lives because of the leaked access hollywood tape where donald trump makes lewd comments or at least thats what lady gaga thinks highlighting words like hurt and depressed works like a low frequency conservative dog whistle signaling to readers who want to revel in liberals pain or ridicule them as emotional children postelection breitbart may appear little different from any celebrity news aggregator but the sites greater political context as a breeding ground for extremists adds another layer breitbart is the site that boosted stephen k bannon to a thought leader with that in mind an article calling attention to ms dunhams jewish faith feels like a bone thrown to the sites white nationalist readers and the catalog of slighted celebrities starts to read like something of a star studded enemies list the real ideological action is undertaken by the
who gains from a trade war with china at the asia pacific economic cooperation summit meeting in peru over the weekend one of the biggest questions was whether donald j trump as the next president would stick to his threat to erect steep trade barriers against beijing dragging the united states into a tit for tat confrontation with the worlds second largest economy no such war has begun yet it seems clear that the united states has already lost china has been steadily gaining in the global economic system waging war against globalization america is making chinas case eswar prasad a former head of the chinese division at the international monetary fund argues that over the long term china comes out a winner no matter what chinas economy would surely suffer if the united states were to impose a percent tariff on nearly billion worth of chinese imports the united states absorbs only percent of chinese exports but it is chinas healthiest export market fears of american protectionism are already stoking capital flight from china but china might be better placed than the united states to take the blow and it would certainly counterpunch an editorial in chinas global times a communist party mouthpiece is probably not far off in its warning that american action would mean a batch of boeing orders will be replaced by airbus u s auto and iphone sales in china will suffer a setback and u s soybean and maize imports will be halted china has several ways to retaliate it could bar state owned companies from doing business with american businesses it could limit access to essential commodities as it did in response to a fishing dispute with japan by stopping exports of so called rare earth minerals essential to the electronics industry it could soft pedal efforts to combat the piracy of american patents and copyrights some of the united states most successful companies would be in for a rough ride most of apples iphones for example are assembled in china the assembly costs though account for less than percent of the value added of the device that means china could force a halt in iphone production at little cost to itself while apple would face a deeply disruptive expensive effort to shift production elsewhere building it from scratch in the united states is nearly impossible how long could american resolve hold an analysis by the pro trade peterson institute for international economics concluded that a full blown trade war with china and mexico would push unemployment in the united states to nearly percent in from percent today that would not improve the economic outlook for millions of working class americans in whose name mr trump proposed this fight and that may not even be the worst part circling the wagons around the american border plays directly into chinas hands in other ways washington would be cast as the villain in the fight no matter how many tricks the chinese government might deploy against american interests it would remain the victim in the eyes of many nations a champion for the cause of open rules based trade even if mr trump is just bluffing as many of his allies say to gain leverage in some future negotiation much of the damage has been done his bluster has changed the perception of the role the united states will play in the world in the face of a turn toward populist nationalism in other rich countries like britain and france china has emerged in the unlikely role of defender of globalized capitalism china is the one major power still talking about increased integration said nicholas lardy a china specialist at the peterson institute china is the only major country in the world projecting the idea that globalization brings benefits and that is the united states loss a great many countries in the developing world still believe prosperity depends on their successful integration into the supply chains that traverse the global economy by turning inward a move already reinforced by the rejection of the trans pacific partnership the united states appears to have little to offer steven ciobo australias trade minister conveyed that point only a few days after the american election by saying that his nation would work to conclude the regional comprehensive economic partnership a chinese initiative among asian and pacific countries that excludes the united states and would support beijings proposed free trade area of the asia pacific ditto for peru and chile which according to a senior chinese official in lima are also now seeking to join the chinese trade initiative almost certainly every economy in the asian region sees its future lying more closely linked with china mr prasad the former i m f official told me with trump talking about withdrawing from trade deals and making allies pay for protection it will be tough for asian countries to resist chinas embrace and if washingtons actions against china start to disrupt asias supply chains the united states could quickly become the regions economic pariah the question is to what purpose it cant simply be about stopping currency manipulation thats an outdated fear instead of working to lower the value of its currency to improve its exports china has spent about trillion lately to prop up the value of the renminbi in the face of capital flight if it stopped the currency would drop like a stone enhancing chinas trade competitiveness moreover slapping trade barriers against china would do little to narrow the american trade deficit american companies building things in china wouldnt bring much manufacturing home in most cases they would go to some other country with cheap labor and to the extent they did reshore production most of it would be highly automated employing few additional americans it does not make economic sense for trump to want to balance trade with china said derek scissors a china specialist at the conservative american enterprise institute balanced trade doesnt bring back jobs
maybe i shouldnt have been surprised that donald trump could be elected president but i was i live in brooklyn and work in manhattan two of the most liberal places in the country but even online i wasnt seeing many signs of support for him how did that blindness occur social media is my portal into the rest of the world my periscope into the communities next to my community into how the rest of the world thinks and feels and it completely failed me in hindsight that failure makes sense ive spent nearly years coaching facebook and instagram and twitter on what kinds of news and photos i dont want to see and they all behaved accordingly each time i liked an article or clicked on a link or hid another the algorithms that curate my streams took notice and showed me only what they thought i wanted to see that meant i didnt realize that most of my family members who live in rural virginia were voicing their support for trump online and i didnt see any of the pro trump memes that were in heavy circulation before the election i never saw a trump hat or a sign or a shirt in my feeds and the only election day selfies i saw were of people declaring their support for hillary clinton to be clear im not blaming the algorithms for what i assume to be their role in augmenting my worldview they did exactly what i told them to do blocking out racist misogynist and anti immigrant comments hiding anyone who didnt support black lives matter all with such deftness that i had no idea that a candidate who ran a campaign on exactly those values had gained enough popularity to win the election but considering that more than percent of our countrys population consumes news on facebook finding alternative perspectives shouldnt have been that hard i knew about eli parisers theory on filter bubbles or the idea that online personalization distorts the type of information we see and even so i still chose to let algorithms shape how i perceive the world everything i could want to see is available at my fingertips and yet i didnt look in april mark zuckerberg chief executive of facebook addressed a room of developers about the importance of his social network facebook he said has the power to bring people together who might otherwise never have the chance to meet the internet has enabled all of us to access and share more ideas and information than ever before he said weve gone from a world of isolated communities to one global community and we are all better off for it but thats not what has happened zuckerbergs idealism is belied by his desire to duck responsibility for mediating the content of his site on facebook the political divide has only been entrenched further its the buzzfeed dress debate only for our entire lives we are two countries one that sees blue and black and the other that sees white and gold the internet once offered outlets we could use to understand one another but they are rapidly disappearing most social media like facebook and instagram is curated by software built to manage the high influx of information flowing into it but there have still been a few islands of digital wilderness a galpagos of sorts where culture thrived untouched they included vine and snapchat and even tumblr which were homes for marginalized ideas theories and lifestyles the video sharing app vine was the first place i got a glimpse of cultures beyond my own including those of the middle east i was able to see how some women there wanted us to see them prospering aware a young woman living in saudi arabia who goes by the name amy roko used vine to show clips of herself living her life her version of normalcy at the mall goofing off at home in her most viral video she stares into the camera her face covered in a niqab save for her perfectly outlined eyes expletive called me ugly she snaps i said expletive where the emphasis on the last word becomes the punch line as she whips off one niqab to reveal a second underneath i was thrilled to realize that women living there could have a sense of humor similar to my own vine was born as an app and intended to be a social community but vine links could be shared independent of the network and people did so with abandon meaning that vines appeared scattershot around the web defying the sorting mechanism of streams and feeds they could land on your screen via text message direct message email rokos vine was a riff on one originally posted by a young black american named brionna london who was miffed that someone thought she needed makeup to be pretty you can draw a straight line from brown women in saudi arabia to black women in america a marvel unto itself a window into the way the internet flattens space and time a vivid example of its fulfilling its promise to bridge divides at vines peak it had more than million monthly users who watched videos billions of times and it excelled at showing these sorts of commonalities that say black kids in new orleans lived and looked a lot like white kids in florida and yet twitter which owns vine and is struggling to turn a profit while keeping its main service appealing to advertisers could seemingly no longer afford to keep the video feature afloat following news about twitters decision to close the service there were rumors that outside companies made inquiries about purchasing vines remains but its most likely too late to salvage the community there in its earlier days snapchat offered its own version of cultural exchange the app had an incredible series on city life that gave users direct windows into different worlds people submitted
in tim obrien then a financial reporter at the new york times published the book trumpnation the art of being the donald talked to sources with an up close view of donald j trumps finances who concluded that the real estate developers net worth was million to million rather than the billion to billion trump had variously claimed trump who had courted obrien by taking him for rides in his ferrari and private jet sued obrien for libel in new jersey in trump called obrien a wack job on the today show while obrien says continuing to curry favor with him privately obriens publisher warner books was also named in the suit and hired top lawyers who put trump through an unsparing two day deposition asked about his finances trump was caught lying or exaggerating times he thought hed get a friendly judge and we would roll over says obrien who is now the executive editor of bloomberg view we didnt the case went through four judges and was dismissed in trumps suit against obrien is one of seven forays president elect trump and his companies have made as libel plaintiffs he won only once when a defendant failed to appear but the standard measure defending his reputation and achieving victory in court isnt how trump says he thinks about his investment i spent a couple of bucks on legal fees and they spent a whole lot more he told the washington post in march about the hefty sum he spent on the case against obrien i did it to make his life miserable which im happy about trump was wrong warner books spent less than he did and obrien paid nothing but that doesnt make trumps central idea any less jarring that libel law can be a tool of revenge its disconcerting for a superrich plaintiff to treat the legal system as a weapon to be deployed against critics once installed in the white house trump will have a wider array of tools at his disposal and his record suggests that more than his predecessors he will try to use the press and also control and subdue it as a candidate trump blustered vaguely that he wanted to open up our libel laws i asked his spokeswoman hope hicks by email what he meant by that but she didnt answer the question its not within the presidents direct powers to change the rules for libel suits but our legal safeguards for writers and publishers arent foolproof in the last few years trump has been joined by at least two billionaires who are determined to exploit cracks in the wall of defense around the press the members of this club are innovators they have sued or funded suits to defend reputations or protect privacy but an underlying aim appears to be to punish critics like obrien or even destroy entire media outlets this kind of manipulation of the law is unfolding at a keen moment of weakness for the press which has already been buffeted by falling revenue and mounting public disaffection only percent of the public the lowest rate since at least the trusts the media to report the news fully accurately and fairly according to a gallup survey conducted in september this mistrust has been growing for a long time but it was stoked by trump during the campaign he called the reporters who covered him scum and whipped up yelling and booing crowds there is no consensus among his supporters that the press should hold those in power accountable a recent pew survey found that only half of trump backers agreed that it was important in a strong democracy that news organizations are free to criticize political leaders media outlets have won many cases by persuading a judge to dismiss them but since they have succeeded in only percent of the libel and privacy suits that have gone to trial a dip from percent in the previous decade according to the media law resource center the median damage award has increased fivefold since the to million the figure includes three big verdicts over the last eight months against gawker rolling stone and the news observer in raleigh n c these include run of the mill libel suits and its too early to say that the sky is falling on the press but its darkening the high bar for winning a libel case in the united states was set in when the supreme court decided new york times v sullivan in that case widely hailed as one of the courts strongest stands for free speech l b sullivan a city commissioner who supervised the police in montgomery ala sued the times over an ad in the newspaper signed by civil rights supporters the ad turned out to include minor factual errors sullivan said its depiction of how the montgomery police responded to civil rights protests made him look bad under the rules at the time a libel plaintiff was entitled to victory if he could show that the content that harmed his reputation was false the alabama jury agreed with sullivan on that point and awarded him in damages with similar cases pending the times pulled its reporters out of alabama but when the newspaper appealed to the supreme court the justices threw out the sullivan verdict and set a far stiffer standard for proving libel the court wrote that a public figure has to prove that a false and damaging statement about him was published with actual malice translated as knowing or reckless disregard for the truth by the the number of libel suits decreased and if suits did go to trial they frequently ended in defeat for the plaintiff in two examples from that era gen william westmoreland sued cbs and ariel sharon the israeli defense minister sued time magazine neither man won damages those outcomes as well as losses in other high profile cases were a major deterrent for plaintiffs and their lawyers says george
milwaukee i love telling people im from wisconsin maybe its my defense mechanism for when people accuse me of being a coastal elite out of touch with real america i like fulfilling all the wisconsin stereotypes i love cheese and cheese curds of course i love our sports teams out of a vague sense of homerism and my accent comes out in full force after ah couplah beers mostly i love my grandma who has called wisconsin home for years her parents immigrated to wisconsin from germany and she started public school without knowing a word of english she forgot most of the german her parents taught her years ago but taught me the words to the liechtensteiner polka that we would sometimes hear when my family would go to a friday night fish fry up until nov i still believed my states moral baseline bent toward empathy the wisconsin i thought i knew where i lived for years was filled with complex but fundamentally decent people who recognized that everyone is deserving of respect and could disagree without being disagreeable the state did elect scott walker as governor in and the republican led legislature gutted public sector unions setting off huge protests in the capitol but i didnt think that state would vote for donald j trump turning its electoral votes to a republican for the first time since as much as mr trump won the election in wisconsin hillary clinton lost it her campaign which prided itself on employing all the data wizards and ground game gurus money can buy did not do nearly enough to lock down the upper midwest particularly wisconsin and michigan and instead treated those states as a given paul soglin is the mayor of madison wisconsins capital city in cerulean dane county he supported senator bernie sanders in the democratic primary and said he talked at least once a week with a field organizer from the sanders campaign during the primary but once mrs clinton locked up the nomination it was radio silence from the clinton campaign since i first held elected office in the early virtually every presidential election ive been contacted either by the candidate or by a staffer he told me im not saying this to say im important but the point is not only wasnt she in the state but i never got a call a contact anything after the primary president obama by contrast made two campaign stops in madison during the election including a huge rally with bruce springsteen on the monday before election day mr soglins frustration with the clinton campaign was apparent i dont understand the strategy ive never seen an explanation for it other than assuming that they wanted not just a victory but a smashing victory actually the kind that donald trump had he said wisconsins voter turnout in was the lowest its been in years roughly fewer democrats voted in milwaukee county this year than did in the drop in turnout in milwaukee county might be partially attributed to a voter identification law in the state in a federal judge found that roughly registered voters in wisconsin lacked the necessary photo id card to vote under the new law and a substantial number of those voters were low income however election watchers have said the voter id law alone could not have flipped the state in mr trumps favor mrs clinton did not visit wisconsin once after the democratic national convention in july neither did president obama or michelle obama mr sanders made multiple trips to the state on behalf of mrs clinton but that was not enough to gin up voters enthusiasm like most of the country my friends and family in wisconsin were shocked that mr trump won the state and the election my mom says shes still in denial my dad has progressed comfortably to anger my grandma though has been coping with the election result with characteristic wit after listening to donald trump speeches about hate i was convinced its o k to hate she emailed me therefore i hate donald trump throughout the general election the clinton campaigns surrogates appeared reassured to the point of hubris that they would be able to convert moderate republican voters in midwestern suburbs for every blue collar democrat we lose in western pennsylvania we will pick up two moderate republicans in the suburbs in philadelphia and you can repeat that in ohio and illinois and wisconsin new york senator chuck schumer said in july this line of thinking was not just wrong but disastrously so in barack obama won of wisconsins counties this year counties voted for donald trump republicans successfully built on the map that helped to elect mr walker to the governors mansion while the clinton campaign was looking to run up the score in states like arizona and georgia a triumvirate of wisconsin republicans also helped elect mr trump both actively and passively first there is reince priebus who worked his way up from republican politics in wisconsin to head the republican national committee and now to serve as mr trumps chief of staff then there is house speaker paul d ryan who now has a historic opportunity to pass his agenda through congress finally mr walker recovered from his own failed presidential campaign will now oversee the republican governors association charlie sykes is a longtime radio host in milwaukee who became a voice on the right for the nevertrump movement after years on the air he will retire from his radio show this year along with being a vocal opponent of the trump campaign he has taken on a new role as chief apologizer for right wing media he expressed frustration with his listenership who he said had gradually grown immune to any inconvenient fact presented to them while he read news from the washington post politico and national review throughout the election his audience seemed to glean most of its news from fox news talk radio
a student in malegaon in indias western state of maharashtra said he had to stand in line for six hours to exchange rupee notes banned by the government this month by the time he got to the front junaid ahmed said the bank had run out of new bills milan odedara a software engineer in gandhinagar the capital of gujarat said he too had to stand in line but he felt it was worth it at least for some years black money holders will live in fear for whats coming next for them he wrote prime minister narendra modis move to ban and rupee notes was an effort to crack down on corruption and tax avoidance but it caught the country by surprise and forced many indians to scramble to exchange their bills and secure enough cash for their daily needs some affluent indians who had stockpiled large amounts of cash have resorted to creative methods to quickly spend their money we asked indians to tell us how the move affected them and their families more than people responded here is a selection of the responses which have been edited i run an ad agency and my clients have stopped all work there is an air of uncertainty and desperation i had to pull my staff away from other important work in order to make them stand in queues day in and day out just to be able to get some cash to manage day to day activities most of my transactions are online or using my debit card so in terms of that theres been little change dealing with street vendors for vegetables fish meat however is a whole different story we now have to buy online where prices are far higher and quality is not necessarily better this move was a rude shock to those who were comfortably sitting on their pile of black money paying for essentials has become a nightmare my husbands parents are both above the age of and do not own credit or debit cards they withdraw large sums of money at a time and use them for household expenses so as to limit the multiple trips to the bank they both are not physically able to even stand in a queue but they did it we cannot buy things from nearby shops anymore because they dont have bills of higher denomination so we head to malls or supermarket where we can pay using credit card and debit cards small businesses have taken a hit we at least are able to manage some emergencies by making payments online but to think of the plight of all the farmers laborers and workers is highly disturbing for my parents it was bit of a discomfort my father had to take one full day off from his work to deposit and exchange old bills that he had same goes for my grandparents local vegetable vendors stopped setting up stalls as they dont have cash to buy from farmers even though they have new bills of rupees they cant use them unless the other person has enough cash to return the change personally my family has not been affected much yet we managed to deposit the or so we had in cash into our local post office account as the bank queue had already grown large we live in a rural area with a small town about four miles away where everyone goes to do most of their weekly shopping as of now the shopkeepers are still accepting the old notes as a favor and we have done most of our shopping either through those or on credit the problems probably start coming some time later though as we near the deadline of dec shops will stop accepting the old notes my cash usage has always been minimal i was barely affected my parents who live in a smaller city faced very few problems the lines outside banks disappeared within a couple of days and things are back to normal most small shops have started accepting digital wallets or credit cards i am not a very big fan of mr modi but i totally support this move as indian citizens we see everyday how corruption cripples our nation the main goal of this move is to bring the shadow economy inside the mainstream economy india needs to expand its gross domestic product to lift people out of poverty the shadow economy doesnt yield taxes but any transaction done online leaves an audit trail and it becomes impossible to hide illicit wealth india is moving to the future where payments will be made online i agree with prime minister modi and this move is such a decisive act of leadership considering all the political risks and economic variables i voted him in to take tough decisions and he is doing just that the cost of doing illegal business will increase while i agree with the motive behind the move i really question whether the government was prepared to implement the new scheme the government seems to be changing the policy every day which feels like therere making it up as they go along better preparation would have made this so much easier the worst affected are those who dont even have bank accounts making it so much harder to change their notes no money to get day to day groceries hardly any grocer has electrical payment methods why are we middle class people bearing this burden we are not keeping stashes of money under our bed no planning bad planning i deposited all my old notes into my account at a private bank and then withdrew an amount for meeting my daily cash expenses the process was relatively hassle free and quick the move seems unlikely to change the practice of relying on cash the systems and sources that give rise to untaxed wealth remain the same as before once the immediate cash liquidity situation is resolved things will
a panel of three federal judges said on monday that the wisconsin legislatures redrawing of state assembly districts to favor republicans was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander the first such ruling in three decades of pitched legal battles over the issue federal courts have struck down gerrymanders on racial grounds but not on grounds that they unfairly give advantage to a political party the more common form of gerrymandering the case could now go directly to the supreme court where its fate may rest with a single justice anthony m kennedy who has expressed a willingness to strike down partisan gerrymanders but has yet to accept a rationale for it should the court affirm the ruling it could upend the next round of state redistricting in for congressional and state elections nationwide most of which is likely to be conducted by republican controlled legislatures that have swept into power in recent years it is a huge deal said heather gerken a yale law school professor and an expert on election law for years everyone has waited for the supreme court to do something on this front now one of the lower courts has jump started the debate if this were to be a nationwide standard would look quite different she said especially for the democrats several election law scholars said the ruling was especially significant because it offered for the first time a clear mathematical formula for measuring partisanship in a district something that had been missing in previous assaults on gerrymandering the to ruling by the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin said that the legislatures remapping violated both the first amendment and the equal protection clause of the amendment because it aimed to deprive democratic voters of their right to be represented although wisconsins natural political geography plays some role in the apportionment process the court wrote it simply does not explain adequately the sizable disparate effect of republican gains in the state assembly after the boundaries were redrawn the judges who ruled in favor of the plaintiffs kenneth ripple and barbara crabb were nominated to the bench by presidents ronald reagan and jimmy carter judge william griesbach nominated by president george w bush dissented the boundaries of both federal and state legislative districts are redrawn every years after the census to ensure that each district contains roughly the same number of people a standard the supreme court set with its one person one vote ruling in but both republican and democratic majorities in statehouses often remap districts to favor themselves either by cramming opposition voters into a single district or by dividing them so they are the majority in fewer districts tactics called packing and cracking courts have generally agreed that some partisan advantage in redistricting is tolerable in part because voters themselves are not spread equally across a state or district by party but the plaintiffs in the case state democrats represented by the campaign legal center had argued that the wisconsin remapping was among the most sharply partisan in the nation their lawsuit said that in the elections for the assembly wisconsin republicans won percent of the two party vote but took percent of the assemblys seats a key question in mondays ruling as in past challenges to redistricting was whether that division was unacceptably partisan a question that previous courts have stumbled over nobody has come up with a standard to measure constitutionality how to distinguish between malevolent evil partisanship thats manipulative versus the natural advantage one party might have as a result of where voters happened to live said edward foley the director of the election law project at ohio state universitys moritz college of law in mondays ruling the court was swayed by a new and simple mathematical formula to measure the extent of partisan gerrymandering called the efficiency gap the formula divides the difference between the two parties wasted votes votes beyond those needed by a winning side and votes cast by a losing side by the total number of votes cast when both parties waste the same number of votes the result is zero an ideal solution but as a winning party wastes fewer and fewer votes than its opponent its score rises a truly efficient gerrymander spreads a winning partys votes so evenly over districts that very few votes are wasted a review of four decades of state redistricting plans concluded that any party with an efficiency gap of percent or more was likely to keep its majority during the years before new districts were drawn in wisconsin experts testified republicans scored an efficiency gap rating of percent to percent in the first election after the maps were redrawn in some experts said the efficiency gap gives gerrymandering opponents their most promising chance yet to persuade a majority of the supreme court to limit partisan redistricting it does almost exactly what justice kennedy said he was looking for back in the a clear threshold for deciding what is acceptable said barry c burden the director of the elections research center at the university of wisconsin madison under procedural rules cases like redistricting lawsuits that are heard by three judge panels in district court are appealed directly to the supreme court skipping the federal court of appeals but it remains unclear whether wisconsin will file an appeal or accept the ruling and limit its impact to a single state were the supreme court to hear the case the effect could be profound regardless of the decision republicans have more than doubled their control of state legislatures since and with gains from this months election they now control both legislative chambers in a record states if nebraska which has a nominally nonpartisan unicameral legislature is included nicholas stephanopoulos a university of chicago law professor and the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs said on monday that a number of state redistricting plans including those in virginia north carolina and michigan have efficiency gap scores rivaling those of wisconsin
paris seven men who french authorities say were planning a terrorist attack have been arrested in france the government announced on monday sounding an alert about the continuing threat from terrorism barely a year after the attacks that killed people in and around paris the arrests followed an eight month long investigation led by frances domestic intelligence service according to interior minister bernard cazeneuve who said investigators were looking into the possibility that the plot involved a coordinated attack aimed to hit several sites simultaneously in the country the seven men were arrested in the eastern city of strasbourg and the mediterranean port city of marseille on sunday mr cazeneuve said at a news conference adding that the operation had thwarted a terrorist attack that had been envisaged on our soil for a long time mr cazeneuve said that the seven men arrested who ranged in age from to were a mix of french moroccan and afghan citizens but he did not provide a detailed breakdown six of them were unknown to french intelligence before the investigation began he said and the seventh a moroccan citizen had been flagged to the french authorities by what he called a partner country the arrests occurred a few days before the opening of the popular christmas market in strasbourg which attracts over two million visitors every year in islamist militants who had trained in afghanistan and were active in france and germany planned to bomb the market but the plot was averted the mayor of strasbourg roland ries said at a news conference on monday that the market was not the target of the latest plot he said the market would go on unless there were a direct and proven threat five people suspected of having links to the same network as the seven men were arrested on june a few days into the euro soccer tournament being held in france and two of them were kept in custody mr cazeneuve said the arrests were not made public at the time only a day earlier a year old islamic state sympathizer killed a police captain and his companion in the town of magnanville outside paris but the soccer tournament which stretched over a month occurred without incident france has been under a state of emergency since the november attacks in the capital region that gives the authorities broad powers to conduct raids and detain people under house arrest among other powers president franois hollande has said the government will seek to extend the state of emergency until the presidential election next spring islamic state militants carried out the november attacks and men inspired by the group carried out an assault in nice that claimed lives on july the bastille day holiday and the killing of a priest in the northern town of st tienne du rouvray days later france is wary that it may be hit again security and migration are among the main issues in the presidential campaign mr cazeneuve said on monday that people had been arrested in relation to terrorist networks since the beginning of the year including this month alone the challenge is huge and zero risk cant be guaranteed those who guarantee it are lying to the french people mr cazeneuve said taking an implicit swipe at the right wing critics of mr hollande who is expected to face a tough battle if he decides to seek re election

californias trees are dying at an alarming rate late last week the u s forest service said an aerial survey revealed that million additional trees had died while in the grip of persistent drought bringing the total since to more than million those numbers have startled california officials and scientists while adding urgency to a long simmering debate over what should be done about it the tree deaths have been concentrated in the southern and central sierra nevada but experts warn of increasing deaths in forests all the way up to the oregon border as a result forestry officials have asked for more funding to thwart wildfire risks through prescribed burning and the removal of millions of dead trees we must fund wildfire suppression like other natural disasters in the country tom vilsack the agriculture secretary said in a statement but some ecologists say the emphasis on fire danger and its attendant demand for increased logging are misplaced do everything necessary to eliminate risks to humans these experts argue but otherwise leave dead trees alone to decompose or go up in flames and create new habitats far from being disasters wildfires can be an adrenaline shot for biodiversity they say a lot of the hype seems to me a lack of understanding of the naturalness of disturbance in ecology said richard hutto an ecologist at the university of montana the tree die off may ultimately signal a transformation of californias forest ecosystems as a result of climate change many scientists say in some places woodlands would simply give way to grasslands max a moritz a wildfire specialist at the university of california berkeley said the focus on wildfire prevention has taken attention away from addressing what that shift is going to mean for california the question is what are we going to do dr moritz said can we guide these systems as they change can we help push them in directions so that theres not just going to be weeds everywhere kern county at the southern

to alcatraz set up camp and demanded that the former prison outpost be deeded back to them by the federal government the occupiers calling themselves indians of all tribes argued that an treaty gave american indians the right to claim unused federal land alcatraz they said would be developed as a cultural and education center we the native americans reclaim the land known as alcatraz island in the name of all american indians by right of discovery their proclamation read the government refused but took an approach of noninterference a rotating group of american indians stayed in the former prison buildings without fresh water or phone service for months before being removed by federal marshals on june the takeover generated wide news media attention and awakened many americans for the first time to the plight of native americans in the decade that followed american indian activists occupied dozens of other locations including the bureau of indian affairs headquarters in washington more recently historians have characterized the protests on the standing rock indian reservation against the dakota access oil pipeline as an echo of that heyday of activism that was ushered in by the occupation of alcatraz
the election of donald j trump gives the republicans in congress a chance to act on their often stated desire to get rid of obamacare a wish that mr trump mostly says he shares aaron e carroll and austin frakt the health policy analysts for the upshot discuss then what aaron i think its safe to say few in congress thought they would have this opportunity but like the proverbial dog who has finally caught the car after untold futile attempts republicans have finally come within reach of repealing the affordable care act now comes the essential question will they actually do it theyve been promising it forever but i am still skeptical that it will happen i believe you disagree im going to let you go first why do you think theyll do it austin i think theyll do it because they so thoroughly own the idea of repeal having passed bills to repeal partly repeal delay or defund the a c a in the house something like times just the other day senator mitch mcconnell endorsed repeal the house and senate also agreed to do so in large part in a budget reconciliation bill earlier this year the only thing that prevented it was that president obama vetoed it i doubt mr trump would do the same if given a similar opportunity now i know that a budget reconciliation dismantling of the law is not a full repeal because according to the rules it can only touch budget related provisions this excludes things like requiring insurers to take all comers for premiums that vary only by age and smoking status or preventing them from imposing coverage caps and lifetime limits among other measures i also must add that im much less confident of a repeal without agreement on a replacement but ill turn it back to you aaron do you think the g o p has to offer a full replacement to get its members to sign on to repeal or can it offer something that would cover fewer people and with fewer benefits aaron i think they can get away with slightly fewer people and somewhat skimpier benefits but not too much theres a part of me that thinks many in congress were always so willing to vote for a repeal because they knew it had no chance of being signed into law they got credit for the vote without ever having to face the downside actually repealing without replacing would mean effectively stripping more than million people of their health insurance without anything in return this would be an unmitigated political disaster the stories of people with cancer diabetes and more who were suddenly stripped of their insurance and left out in the cold would very likely dominate our discussion for months that leaves more than enough time to lead to significant repercussions in the midterm elections with no democratic leaders in any branch of government to blame i think this would be akin to what happened in the elections but in reverse now if they can coalesce around a replace plan that doesnt leave too many people out then i think they could move forward but in all the years since the a c a was passed republicans havent been able to do that do you think they can what do you think that plan would look like austin one way to get from repeal to replace that minimizes immediate political risk is to pass a plan that doesnt call for repeal for several years at least after the midterms though possibly after the election between now and then there would need to be some kind of transition to whatever replaces obamacare that didnt just dump people off coverage with no alternative but the alternatives could just be not as comprehensive or costly absolutely there will be bad stories but keep in mind there will be bad stories under obamacare too rocketing premiums huge cost sharing and markets with few choices is not a recipe for political success republicans now own the task of fixing those things and doing so in a way that does not look as if theyre making obamacare better theyre actually in a tough policy spot theyll get the blame if they dont fix or repeal the a c a and theyll get the blame if they dont replace it with something people like better health policy is a very difficult and thankless task i think theyll opt for something they can call repeal and replace but they could also just let obamacare struggle and die neither looks good one other way to get out from under the issue is to kick it to the states do you think a trump administration working with a g o p congress will offer greater flexibility to states to design their own coverage plans that could diverge from obamacare if so what are some ideas states might try aaron i think its very likely those in congress could punt medicaid to the states for years theyve been trying to change medicaid funding to a block grant that they can then constrain over time this will be enticing for them because it will allow them to reduce medicaid spending in the future while forcing states to make the tough decisions and take the blame for cuts in either beneficiaries or services fixing the markets for those who are getting health insurance through the obamacare exchanges though is a different story without some sort of market regulation which theyve generally been opposed to the same problems that existed pre a c a with respect to pre existing conditions and individual ratings will exist many people will become uninsured annual and lifetime limits could reappear lots of people will have problems getting insured moreover i have yet to be convinced that a significant number of republicans in the house might coalesce around such a plan maybe for medicaid but im not sure about the

the scenario elected officials promising workers nice pensions based on wishful thinking sound familiar it is a problem faced across the united states and the next victim could be dallas the citys mayor said it appeared to be walking into the fan blades of municipal bankruptcy its pension fund for police officers and firefighters is near collapse and is seeking an immense bailout how can this be when dallas has the fastest economic growth of the largest cities in the country panicked local retirees have pulled million from the fund in the last six weeks after a recommendation that they no longer be allowed to take out big blocks of money even before that there were reports that the funds investments were worth less than stated senator john whitmire a democrat who has been in the statehouse since recalled enthusiastically voting in for the plan that sent the pension fund on its ill fated quest for investment returns of percent we all know some of the benefits guaranteed were just probably never realistic he said it was good while it lasted but weve got some serious financial problems because of it heres a puzzle for you europe may never regain economic vigor if italys banks are in a state of perpetual emergency italys banks cannot get healthy without economic growth italys economy cant grow without healthy banks whats the solution the countrys banks have muddled through for years but with the economy so weak bad loans have festered and good loans have deteriorated nearly a fifth of loans in the system worth nearly billion are classified as troubled by the international monetary fund if this also sounds like a familiar theme thats because its a longstanding problem and one that affects the rest of europe italys troubled loans represent about percent of all the bad loans within the eurozone but banking is a symptom not the cause says ignazio visco the governor of the bank of italy he argues that the bulk of italys bad debt is backed by collateral and most of the remainder has a solid chance of turning into collectible debt economists however are unconvinced they say banks prop up zombie companies that will never repay their loans extending just enough credit to keep them current on their debts this years presidential election could be remembered as a pivotal moment for the markets which have been given the impetus to solidify deeper trends that were already underway a revaluation of a wide range of assets and securities has been taking place but traders are making educated guesses and if they turn out to be wrong the market could turn upside down again what does this mean for most long term investors broad diversification jeff sommer writes simple balanced portfolios of stocks and bonds have barely moved since the election against the backdrop of the swerves and shifts happening in markets that may count as an achievement genny lopez a contractor handling tech support calls for apple the company is unlikely to produce iphones in the united states but it is providing employment for working class americans who lack college degrees the billion mega merger between anthem and cigna goes to trial the justice department is challenging the deal and the drama has been heightened as the companies have accused each other of breaching the merger agreement decisions about this case and the deal between aetna and humana are expected before president elect donald j trump takes office but his administration could have a major say if either side decided to appeal the decision mario draghi president of the european central bank will answer questions at the european parliament he is likely to be asked about the effect of mr trumps presidency on the eurozone
ten days removed from the still fresh shock of donald trumps election around lunchtime on a friday i navigated the jagged lines of steel barriers police officers and secret service battalions with big dogs and big guns surrounding trump tower the glass and marble shopping mall tourist trap and tv set had been transformed into the unlikely plotting ground for the nations immediate future it was anybodys guess what was taking shape inside the gilded bunkers clots of media people passers by and protesters crowded the lobby and nearby streets for the occasional clue or at least glimpses of marla maples and prime minister shinzo abe of japan kellyanne conway posed for a selfie with a few lucky cops the locus of the scene was a bank of elevators ferrying staff cabinet candidates and the competing maestros of the trump transition to and from various nerve centers over several floors every time a bell sounded announcing the opening of an elevator door lobby heads would bob expectantly is that what jeff sessions looks like i heard a photographer ask no doubt a host of key trump orchestrators and luminary actors were making ample use of auxiliary entrances and exits sneaking in and out new rumors predictions and potential firestorms seemed to materialize every hour the kremlinology of the incoming white house is shaping up as knotty to say the least not one of trumps initial high level hires has any experience working in a white house how will they work with the volatile real estate and reality show maven in the oval office with his proclivity to make decisions based on the last person he speaks to with his children playing an uncertain role his son in law a possibly ever present whisperer how will it all work with trumps senior adviser steve bannon former head of breitbart news who has a long rap sheet of racial ethnic and sexist affronts and a long running war on washington republicans i had gone to trump tower to see reince priebus the republican national committee chairman whom trump named as his chief of staff five days after his election in the same release in which bannon was named chief strategist and senior counselor bannon was mentioned first for kremlinologists scoring at home and his appointment has consumed the bulk of the attention given his hyperprovocative ways but priebus in a sense filled a more exotic role he would be the chief establishment ambassador for a president whose brief and meteoric political career has been predicated on blowing that establishment up a generous reading is that trump is trying to foster a yin yang tension between his top deputies who will represent his own diametrically opposed impulses the simpler reading is that trump hasnt thought that much about this and is simply trying to reward and surround himself with people he feels served him well in the campaign its almost like a puzzle mystery priebus told me last summer i dont recall what we were talking about but priebus had a knack for homespun wisconsin logic and particularly throwaway lines that would stick with me i kept thinking of the puzzle mysteries that were playing out up and down trump tower even though i showed up friday without an appointment with priebus and was confined to the lobby watching tourists ride up and down its now famous escalators priebus and i started talking last spring as i was undertaking an article for this magazine about the seemingly fracturing state of the republican party we kept in touch during the campaign drank the occasional miller high life in his office and exchanged the sporadic email priebus was constantly going on tv saying he was certain trump would win even though he could read polls and precedents like everyone else still he carried on as the chief carrier of trumps choppy water because thats what a party chairman does he smiles and spins and swallows his best laid plans and audibles in the name of getting his nominee to the finish line in a sense priebus who squired his future wife to a local g o p banquet on their first date was the purest form of political hack that trump would rail against as he bulldozed the g o p for his efforts during the campaign priebus gained the respect and gratitude of trump loyalists especially the fiercest loyalist donald j trump himself he also won derision and ridicule he was the subject of multiple stories in the onion his spirited tv defenses of trumps indefensible behavior drew him comparisons to baghdad bob saddam husseins chief propagandist during the early months of the iraq war whose dubious predictions of imminent victory despite growing devastation all around made him an international laughingstock long before trumps victory back when it seemed like a long shot i asked priebus whether he would consider taking a job in a trump administration maybe a plum ambassadorship to somewhere yes he said wisconsin it was a throwaway answer to a throwaway question which was laughably hypothetical anyway but i never had a sense he had thought that much about a trump administration job besides possibly staying on as r n c chairman whether or not the donald prevailed for all his well honed sheepishness priebuss just a kid from kenosha wisc shtick belies a penchant for main stages big ticket rooms and high level company no shortage of reince priebus photos hang on the walls of the r n c s headquarters on capitol hill he can be a little star struck he travels far and often to appear with candidates and party dignitaries at events where his presence is not necessarily required priebus was giddy when i spoke to him last spring as he prepared to attend a party for times most influential people at lincoln center we were on the phone him walking through the lobby of the j w marriott after a packed day of fund raising
three years ago i read adventures of huckleberry finn to my daughter she smiled as she heard about hucks mischief his jokes his dress up games but it was his relationship with the runaway slave jim that intrigued her most huck and jim travel together as jim seeks his freedom at times huck wrestles with his decision to help in the end tom sawyer concocts an elaborate scheme for jims release when we finished the book my daughter had a question why didnt tom just tell jim the truth that miss watson had already freed him in her will she is not alone in asking scholars have long debated this issue one answer lies in white identity which needs black identity in order to define itself and therefore cannot exist without it identity is a vexing word it is racial or sexual or national or religious or all those things at once sometimes it is proudly claimed other times hidden or denied but the word is almost never applied to whiteness racial identity is taken to be exclusive to people of color when we speak about race it is in connection with african americans or latinos or asians or native people or some other group that has been designated a minority white is seen as the default the absence of race in school curriculums one month is reserved for the study of black history while the rest of the year is just plain history people will tell you they are fans of black or latin music but few will claim they love white music this years election has disturbed that silence the president elect earned the votes of a majority of white people while running a campaign that explicitly and consistently appealed to white identity and anxiety at the heart of this anxiety is white peoples increasing awareness that they will become a statistical minority in this country within a generation the paradox is that they have no language to speak about their own identity white is a category that has afforded them an evasion from race rather than an opportunity to confront it in his campaign for the presidency donald trump regularly tied americas problems to others immigration must be reformed he told us to stop the rapists and drug dealers coming here from mexico terrorism could be stopped by banning muslims from entering the country the big banks would not be held in check by his opponent whose picture he tweeted alongside a star of david the only people that the president elect never faulted for anything were whites these people he spoke of not as an indistinguishable mass but as a multitude of individuals victims of a system that was increasingly rigged against them a common refrain in the days after the election was not all his voters are racist but this will not do because those voters chose a candidate who promised them relief from their problems at the expense of other races they may claim innocence now but it seems to me that when a leading chapter of the ku klux klan announces plans to hold a victory parade for the president elect the time for innocence is long past racism is a necessary explanation for what happened on nov but it is not a sufficient one last february when the subject of racial identity came up at the democratic primary debate in milwaukee the moderator gwen ifill surprised many viewers by asking about white voters by the middle of this century the nation is going to be majority nonwhite she said our public schools are already there if working class white americans are about to be outnumbered are already underemployed in many cases and one study found they are dying sooner dont they have a reason to be resentful hillary clinton said she was concerned about every community including white communities where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism addiction earlier deaths she said she planned to revitalize what she called coal country and explore spending more in communities with persistent generational poverty senator bernie sanders took a different view we can talk about it as a racial issue he said but it is a general economic issue workers of all races he said have been hurt by trade deals like nafta we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country this resonated with me i too come from the working class and from the significant portion of it that is not white neither of my parents went to college still they managed to put their children through school and buy a home a life that for many in the working class is impossible now nine months after that debate we have found out exactly how much attention we should have been paying such families the same white working class voters who re elected obama four years ago did not cast their ballots for clinton this year these voters suffer from economic disadvantages even as they enjoy racial advantages but it is impossible for them to notice these racial advantages if they live in rural areas where everyone around them is white what they perceive instead is the cruel sense of being forgotten by the political class and condescended to by the cultural one while poor white voters are being scrutinized now less attention has been paid to voters who are white and rich white voters flocked to trump by a wide margin and he won a majority of voters who earn more than a year despite their relative economic safety a majority of white women chose him too even though more than a dozen women have accused him of sexual assault no the top issue that drove trumps voters to the polls was not the economy more voters concerned about that went to clinton it was immigration an issue on which weve abandoned serious debate and become engulfed in sensational stories about rapists crossing the southern border
friday night the facebook co founder mark zuckerberg went on his vast social network to convince an expanding chorus of critics including the departing president of the united states that he honest to goodness wants to combat the fake news that is running wild across his site and others and turning our politics into a paranoiac fantasy come to life weve been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility seriously he wrote weve made significant progress but there is more work to be done he continued listing various steps facebook was taking like making it easier to report bad information and enlisting fact checking organizations it was heartening to hear especially after his earlier assertion that it was crazy to believe that misinformation on facebook had affected the presidential election in any real way despite copious evidence that it was disturbingly in the mix whether it directly swung the result or not but as mr zuckerberg went on to say that facebook had to be careful not to mistakenly block accurate content he added this we do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves which was why he said facebook would continue to rely on our community and trusted third parties his statement pointed up how much facebook struggles to find the balance between its mission to be a free expression utopia for its billion users and its responsibility to protect them from all that is defamatory dangerous and untrue but more to the point it appeared to buy into the notion that truth is relative at a time when that notion has to finally go away do you really need an outside arbiter to determine whether a video suggesting without basis that hillary clinton was involved in john f kennedy jr s fatal plane crash in should be allowed to stand truth doesnt need arbiters it needs defenders and it needs them now more than ever as the american democracy staggers into its next uncertain phase with a mainstream news media that works hard to separate fact from fiction under economic and political threat facebook which has contributed to that economic threat by gobbling up so much of the online advertising market is going to have a special responsibility to do its part just imagine what things will look like if the unsavory elements that tore through the election false narratives fake news and aggressive efforts to delegitimize traditional journalism come back into play as donald j trump presses to enact his agenda if the past week provided any indication of where politics are going the next four years are going to require an all hands on deck effort to keep the national conversation honest the national security adviser mr trump named last week michael t flynn a retired army lieutenant general has subscribed to the conspiracy theory that shariah law is taking root in the united states contributing to his insistence that americans have every reason to view islam as a threat he recently used twitter to circulate a fake news item that the federal bureau of investigation was sitting on evidence from anthony weiners laptop that would put hillary and her crew away for life mr trumps nominee for attorney general senator jeff sessions of alabama has falsely claimed that hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants are successfully crossing the border annually then there was the announcement by the conspiracy theorist alex jones that mr trump had called to thank him and his radio and internet audience for their support in the campaign add to that the fact that mr trump was the most prominent promoter of the false notion that president obama wasnt born here and didnt hesitate to repeat the outrageous suggestion that the father of senator ted cruz was linked to the assassination of president john f kennedy then consider what it may look like when mr trump pursues policies regarding muslim immigrants and undocumented immigrants its not so outlandish to envision mr trumps attempts to sell his plans getting a lift from the likes of mr jones or a fake site out of macedonia perhaps claiming that democrats are working with isis to use undocumented immigrants to poison local water supplies or some such president obama seemed to have had something like that in mind when he told reporters in germany on thursday if we are not serious about facts and whats true and whats not and if we cant discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda then we have problems mr obama knows of what he speaks he had to muddle through the first wave of this you might remember how his health care plan was marred by a false accusation that the plan included so called death panels that would decide who lived and who died based on their level of productivity to society as former gov sarah palin put it the false death panel allegation was partly based on proposals to reimburse doctors for optional consultations with families over end of life care decisions the accusations took on such power that even newt gingrich signed on to the falsehood despite the fact that he had previously expressed bullish support for end of life planning news organizations including this one debunked the myth but the bills authors stripped out the provision just the same and by then the death panel fiction had negated any shot at a reasoned ideological debate as dan pfeiffer who was the presidents chief communications strategist at the time so grimly put it to me last week the faux death panels were the canary in the coal mine about the coming death of truth things have advanced since then todays fake news is limited only by the imaginations of its inventors and the number of shares it can garner on facebook or twitter thats why people who care about the truth citizens journalists and lets hope social media giants like facebook too will have to come up with a solution to
tehran at first blush the election of donald j trump would seem to be bad news for iran but there is a chance that on balance things could work out surprisingly well for the clerics publicly irans leaders stress that they pay little heed to what happens in the united states that they pride themselves on their independence it makes no difference for iran who the next u s president is the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said in a speech last week yet he could hardly miss mr trumps promises on the campaign trail to tear up the landmark nuclear agreement reached last year which he frequently described as the worst deal ever in response ayatollah khamenei said recently that if mr trump tore it up we will set fire to it but mr trump also presents new opportunities for iran many analysts say while he has criticized the nuclear deal he has also said that the united states should stop backing rebels in syria and focus on the islamic state militant group effectively shifting its support to irans ally in syria president bashar al assad if that happens said mohammad marandi an associate professor of north american studies at the university of tehran it will be good for iran the region and the world with its lebanese ally hezbollah tehran has supported mr assad throughout the uprising which started in morally and later financially and militarily over iranian and shiite afghan soldiers have died in the conflict according to official statistics if such a change would come from trump of all people it would be remarkable professor marandi said in the larger context iran is waiting and hoping for the day the united states packs up and leaves the middle east closing its military bases in the region and moving its aircraft carriers out of the persian gulf while that seems far fetched mr trump has demonstrated an isolationist streak in questioning the value of nato and the nuclear umbrella over south korea and japan they should stop threatening us professor marandi said if the united states under trump is more constructive he will find that iran will respond in kind even with the nuclear deal things could ultimately break irans way last week national security experts signed a report urging mr trump to keep the deal and lately even some republicans in congress and groups that had opposed the deal urged mr trump to go slowly and consider other ways to pressure iran on tuesday the house of representatives did just that voting overwhelmingly to extend some iran sanctions for an additional years even if the agreement is eventually ripped up iran might still stand to gain it has already received tens of billions of dollars in frozen funds is selling oil on the world market and is cutting deals with european businesses if washington were to reimpose sanctions on iran moreover it is doubtful that the other world powers that are signatories to the deal would go along the one area where both iran and the united states stand to lose ground is in personal diplomacy something that was virtually nonexistent after the islamic revolution during the two years of negotiations on the nuclear deal secretary of state john kerry and the iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif developed a strong personal relationship in front of the cameras at least they slapped each others backs joked and seemed to get along very well a breakthrough for two countries that do not even have embassies in each others capitals mr trump has not yet decided on his secretary of state but with people like rudolph w giuliani a former mayor of new york and john r bolton a former united nations ambassador being mentioned it seems unlikely that the same level of personal rapport will be matched lets face it the honeymoon is over said saeed laylaz an economist close to president hassan rouhani these two guys and their teams have talked for hundreds of hours in a period of two years who can replace that nader karimi joni an analyst close to the reformist movement of mr rouhani said mr kerry and mr zarif knew each other for years mr kerrys son in law is of iranian descent mr zarif has hosted mr kerry in his home in new york when he was an ambassador to the united nations you can be sure such relations are now a thing of the past with the names that are being mentioned out there of course iran does stand to lose a lot if the nuclear deal is rescinded since the january signing iran has returned to world oil markets providing much needed income for irans leaders who also have gotten access to some of their frozen funds abroad business delegations are pouring in and iran is even planning to purchase boeing aircraft american planes that will also bring american business culture to iran at the same time large international banks are still not providing any line of credit to iran related projects nor are they allowing bank transfers out of fear of trespassing unilateral american sanctions on iran although the obama administration is working to clear up ambiguities that are holding back financing a republican administration is likely to halt those efforts some analysts adhere to the traditional view saying that americas enmity toward iran has never diminished only the conditions surrounding the relationship the difference is now that because of all the regional crisis there are chances for both of us for cooperation in syria iraq afghanistan and yemen for instance said hossein royvaran a political analyst this means that because of our influence any u s president has to keep dealing with iran be it obama clinton or now trump normal iranians have their own ideas about mr trump many seeing him as a harbinger of chaos the worldview of countries that have suffered at the machinations of colonialism and western power plays is conducive to

in for the first time the census bureau counted more people living in urbanized america than in the countryside this hasnt been a rural nation ever since yet the idea of thomas jeffersons agrarian america has receded slowly despite demographic change we still romanticize the family farm though relatively few of them exist anymore we view even suburbia in pastoral terms the crabgrass frontier as the historian kenneth t jackson put it and as the recent electoral college results make clear we still live with political institutions that have baked in a distinctly pro rural bias by design the democratic candidate for president has now won the popular vote in six of the last seven elections but in part because the system empowers rural states for the second time in that span the candidate who garnered the most votes will not be president rural america even as it laments its economic weakness retains vastly disproportionate electoral strength rural voters were able to nudge donald j trump to power despite hillary clintons large margins in cities like new york in a house of representatives that structurally disadvantages democrats because of their tight urban clustering rural voters helped republicans hold their cushion in the senate the least populous states are now more overrepresented than ever before and the growing unity of rural americans as a voting bloc has converted the rural bias in national politics into a potent republican advantage if youre talking about a political system that skews rural thats not as important if there isnt a major cleavage between rural and urban voting behavior said frances lee a professor of government and politics at the university of maryland but urban and rural voting behavior is so starkly different now so that this has major political consequences for who has power and its not just in terms of policy outcomes she continued this pervasively advantages republicans in maintaining control of the u s national government the electoral college is just one example of how an increasingly urban country has inherited the political structures of a rural past today states containing just percent of the american population a historic low can theoretically elect a senate majority dr lee said the bias also shapes the house of representatives it exists as a result in the formulas that determine where highway funds are spent or who gets homeland security dollars it exists in state capitols where bills preferred by urban delegations have been much more likely to be rejected today the influence of rural voters also evokes deeply rooted ideals about who have power in america jefferson and james madison argued that the strength of the nation would always derive from its agrarian soil they had this vision of what they called the yeoman farmer this independent free standing person who owed nothing to anybody who didnt receive any payments from the government who didnt live by a wage but who could support himself and his family on a farm growing everything they needed and that these were the people who were going to be the backbone of democracy said gerald gamm a political scientist at the university of rochester describing what could be the forefathers of the rural voters who tilted this years election when the framers of the constitution were still debating the shape of institutions we have today percent of america was rural as the census classified the population the connecticut compromise at the time created the senate one chamber granting equal voice to every state to counterbalance the house where more populous states spoke louder and they made sure the compromise stuck today equal state representation in the senate is the only provision in the constitution that remains singled out for protection from the amendment process no state can lose its full complement of senators without its permission but even as a deliberately undemocratic body the senate has slipped further out of alignment with the american population over time the senate hasnt simply favored sparsely populated states politicians in washington sparsely populated states to leverage the senates skewed power when we talk about small state bias all of that was an intentional policy choice said jowei chen a political scientist at the university of michigan republicans in congress passed the homestead act offering free land to settlers who would move to territories that would eventually become states creating more senate seats and electoral college votes for a republican party eager to keep government control away from southern democrats they even managed to divide the dakota territory into two states worth twice the political power as the plains later depopulated and american cities then suburbs swelled the senate became even more unrepresentative jeffersonian suspicion of big cities also appears in the sites of state capitals albany and not new york jefferson city and not st louis springfield and not chicago political scientists at the university of california davis have found that most state capitals were located near what was then the population centroid of each state typically closer to the geographical center of the state and not the place where the most people already lived breaking with how much of the world sited its capitals the state legislatures there also grew significantly less representative as america urbanized in when lawyers in tennessee brought what would be a seminal case before the supreme court challenging the practice the state legislature had not reapportioned its districts to reflect population change in years maryland was still using districts drawn in even states that had constitutions requiring equal population districts were ignoring them florida georgia and new mexico gave small counties times the voting power of the most populous ones decades ago in california amador county had the same representation in the states senate as los angeles county they justified it because that was a cultural norm it was just the way things were said stephen ansolabehere a harvard professor of government rural legislators had no incentive to change a system that favored them they
its a different environment now i feel very upset and afraid for my friends people are using the election as an excuse to discriminate against each other openly jade merriwether at student a west high school in iowa city on the aftermath of the presidential election
there is a group of friends in charlotte n c all women all in their all white theyre college educated with successful careers and they have a message for the new york times come visit us they voted for donald trump and dont consider themselves homophobic racist or anti muslim but now they say thanks to the times and its fixation on trumps most extreme supporters most people think they are they would like a chance to show otherwise and one of them cindy capwell wrote my office to extend the invitation since the election i have been on the phone with many times readers around the country including capwell to discuss their concerns about the timess coverage of the presidential election the number of complaints coming into the public editors office is five times the normal level and the pace has only just recently tapered off my colleague thomas feyer who oversees the letters to the editor says the influx from readers is one of the largest since sept many people are commenting on the election but many are venting about the timess coverage readers are also taking to the comments section of times articles to talk about it says the community editor bassey etim others are calling into customer care at multiple times the usual rate they have a variety of concerns including the election coverage last week president elect donald j trump jumped in tweeting that the times had lost thousands of subscribers since the election the paper says quite the opposite is the case it reports having the largest one week subscription increase since the first week of the digital pay model in i assume that the times has more accurate data than trump but i hope any chest thumping about the impressive subscriber bump wont obscure a hard eyed look at coverage because from my conversations with readers and from the emails that have come into my office i can tell you there is a searing level of dissatisfaction out there with many aspects of the coverage readers complain heatedly and repeatedly about the forecasting odometer from the upshot that was anchored on the home page and predicted that hillary clinton had an percent chance or better of winning they complain that the timess attempt to tap the sentiments of trump supporters was lacking and they complain about the liberal tint the times applies to its coverage without awareness that it does few could deny that if trumps more moderate supporters are feeling bruised right now the blame lies partly with their candidate and his penchant for inflammatory rhetoric but the media is at fault too for turning his remarks into a grim caricature that it applied to those who backed him what struck me is how many liberal voters i spoke with felt so too they were clinton backers but they want a news source that fairly covers people across the spectrum horst gudemann of jackson wyo says he doesnt want to be spoon fed opinions that the times thinks he should have and he doesnt want his primary news source to stereotype half the country as racists we shouldnt judge black lives matters by its most extremist members and we shouldnt judge trump followers by theirs gudemann told me the national desk of the times has correspondents around the country and they filed a steady stream of compelling stories from voters between coastal america and yet between the horse race and the campaign drama much of their work was simply drowned out that left many of the readers i spoke with feeling like the times was a swirl of like mindedness gudemann and other readers said the timess liberalism sounds the loudest the closer you get to the opinion section perhaps not surprisingly still too many of the voices of both the regular columnists and even guest writers are from people with similar views ive read the times for years and im tired of the old guard said james harris of great barrington mass he said hed welcome some fresher voices judy barlas of silver spring md raises a different issue she supported bernie sanders in the primary but she told me she saw evidence early on that the times believed clinton would win the nomination and kept pushing that scenario it anticipated an outcome and it stuck with it when sanders would have a victory they would cast it in terms of what it meant for clinton barlas said it was the same approach through the election in her view editors and reporters developed a story line and thats the only perspective they presented i expect more from the times she said the timess executive editor dean baquet and its publisher arthur sulzberger jr sent an extraordinary post election letter to subscribers that was in part an attempt to assure readers there was some self reflection going on in the newsroom about its coverage it included a vow to rededicate ourselves to the fundamental mission of times journalism that is to report america and the world honestly without fear or favor striving always to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences but they also used the occasion to congratulate themselves on their swift agile and creative coverage on election night and they praised their journalism as fair to both candidates and unflinching in its scrutiny i suspect that gesture soothed some readers but many others were expecting more of an apology and some were repelled by what they described as a self congratulatory tone and what several viewed as a lack of sincerity chavi eve karkowsky an obstetrician in new york city saw the letter through the lens of her own profession in medicine when something goes wrong we ask where did we get this information why what should we do differently we break it down to its very basic level she said karkowsky would have preferred a real apology she said and some sense that the times was looking
the markets are always fickle but since the presidential election the tastes of traders in stocks bonds and commodities have conspicuously changed in the first hours of donald j trumps victory stock futures plunged only to reverse themselves and surge upward bonds at first strengthened and then fell sharply in price as yields leapt higher specific sectors reversed themselves too financial stocks which were earthbound began levitating utility stocks which were in high demand fell out of favor we havent seen changes like these in ages said dave mazza head of exchange traded funds and mutual fund research for state street global advisors the question now is whether the markets preferences will change abruptly again some rollback toward pre trump market preferences can be expected of course some of what we saw initially was just animal spirits and momentum said james w paulsen chief investment strategist at wells fargo asset management the market often overreacts and then corrects itself and that has been happening yet it is possible that the election could be remembered as a pivotal moment in the markets and in politics and not just because a new republican controlled government is likely to enact some very different policies it is at least arguable that the election has given the markets the impetus and the excuse to solidify deeper trends that were already underway the election shock has accelerated some changes that were already beginning to be evident in a much smaller way mr paulsen said i think that some of those trends are likely to stick there is no denying that the elections outcome took the markets by surprise the overwhelming assumption in financial circles and in the polls was that hillary clinton would win and that mr trump would lose the further expectation was that in the unlikely event of a trump victory there would be a major stock market decline but that occurred for only several hours and then there was a powerful stock market rally which has slowed but not stopped thats only part of the story a revaluation of a wide range of assets and securities has been taking place recent stars have faded in the markets transitory judgment new investments are in vogue traders have been voting with their dollars using state street sector exchange traded funds as a proxy for the broader market mr mazza reported unusually high inflows into the sector e t f s for financial services health care and industrials and lesser inflows into materials and energy stocks traders stampeded away from utilities technology and consumer staples shares they were neutral or slightly negative about consumer discretionary and real estate shares take financial stocks and utilities until recently investors shunned banks while celebrating utilities for their steady eddie dividend payouts that shifted radically in the five days after the election jpmorgan chase goldman sachs morgan stanley and bank of america gained at least percent four leading utilities exelon firstenergy nextera energy and entergy lost at least percent before the election utility shares were ahead of financials for the year five days later they were trailing the nearly billion inflow into the financial select sector spdr fund for example was the biggest of any week since the e t f s inception in mr mazza said such cash flows generally correlate with market price trends the biggest weekly outflow was billion and it occurred in the week of jan during the financial crisis investors found bank stocks as scary as they now find them attractive utilities on the other hand moved on election week to the avoidance list with net outflows of million in the utilities select sector spdr fund mr mazza said while traders may have shifted gears hastily there is at least a rational basis for their movements the problem lies in the assumptions behind these market shifts predictions about politics are risky those based on underlying economics may be a bit more reliable for example the bond market shift appears at least partly based on a judgment that inflation will rise because of mr trumps policies inchoate though they may be he has called for tax cuts and spending increases in the nations infrastructure and military that could be inflationary if they widen a budget deficit but conservatives in congress may not go along with an increase in deficit spending its not clear what the trump administration will try to accomplish all of these assumptions may not be borne out in fact similarly technology shares have fallen sharply at least partly out of concern for the possibly negative effects of some of mr trumps policies said larry puglia a portfolio manager for t rowe price it is possible he said that mr trumps approach to immigration will make it more difficult for highly skilled foreigners to receive visas for work at american tech companies or that his trade policies will make the logistics of global tech manufacturing more cumbersome and expensive people shouldnt jump to conclusions mr puglia said we dont know what will happen he said he had made few changes to his investment portfolios preferring to wait and see on the other hand some sea changes may be underway in the economy mr paulsen said the election could be giving traders an excuse to act on them recent data indicates that economic growth has been accelerating the election aside he said it makes sense that bond yields will rise under these circumstances and that the federal reserve will increase short term interest rates janet l yellen the fed chairwoman says a rate increase is relatively likely to occur soon perhaps at the central banks next meeting in december rising interest rates generally help bank stocks and hurt utilities whose dividends no longer seem as appealing furthermore rising rates support a stronger dollar justifying a decline in the price of gold which has been out of favor since the election in addition the labor market has been improving for a long time the american economy
warsaw europes right wing populists have scrambled to outdo one another in celebrating donald j trump as an american president who shares many of their nationalistic anti immigrant attitudes less thrilled are the hard liners in poland and the problem is vladimir v putin poland already has one of europes most conservative governments which took office a year ago and top leaders have eagerly cast mr trumps election as the latest and most crucial chapter in a global shift away from western style liberal democracy but they also see a worrisome problem the chummy noises mr trump has made toward mr putin the russian president even as the government may share many of mr putins conservative attitudes and nationalist impulses polish leaders are restrained by a deep almost visceral distrust of him memories of russian domination during the soviet era are still raw here and poland has been one of the most hawkish members of the european union on taking a hard line toward mr putin the polish predicament is yet another reminder of how thoroughly the trump victory has scrambled the geopolitics of europe his campaign remarks undercutting nato and suggesting that the united states could possibly walk away from the trans atlantic alliance alarmed leaders in the baltics and in poland even after mr trump softened his remarks most of all poland and the rest of europe will now wait and see whether the victory of mr trump who apparently has an affinity for mr putin is an opportunity for europe or an existential threat prime minister viktor orban of hungary who had already made friendly gestures toward moscow sees opportunity many poles still see risks what poland can do is keep increasing its military capabilities keep a low profile and just wait for putin to show his true colors said jerzy targalski a right wing political analyst and historian who supports the governing law and justice party and it wont take too long for now polish leaders have a dual track strategy to praise mr trumps victory as a continuation of their own victories focus on areas of agreement with the new american president and play down as much as possible disagreements over things like how to deal with moscow polands prime minister beata szydlo joined other right wing leaders in declaring mr trumps victory a validation of the rise of a more nationalistic and muscular form of government with a strong executive and resurgent patriotism a certain era in world politics ends an era when politics focused on elites and dealing with issues of the elites she said democracy won despite the liberal propaganda but at the same time polands president andrzej duda was quick to add that his country still expected the united states to abide by its nato commitments and to proceed with plans to deploy nato troops including thousands of americans this spring along the european unions eastern flank of course even some members of mr trumps own republican party do not agree on the best way to approach mr putin whether to continue international pressure as poland wishes or to seize the moment to develop a closer relationship that ends russias isolation as poland fears poland and the baltic states geographically closer to moscow have insisted on maintaining pressure on thursday lithuanias parliament voted almost unanimously with just one abstention to maintain economic sanctions as punishment for russias annexation of crimea and aggression in eastern ukraine for instance on friday key european leaders along with president obama pledged to renew those sanctions but other more putin friendly leaders have indicated they might agree to end the sanctions presidents who were elected just this month in bulgaria and moldova had talked during their campaigns about doing just that while political leaders and analysts in poland and elsewhere expect mr trump to move quickly to negotiate a new grand bargain with mr putin they suspect mr putin also wants to move swiftly not only to end the sanctions that are squeezing his countrys economy but also perhaps to head off that planned spring deployment of nato troops polish officials have preferred to express confidence that despite the troubling signs the new president in the end will abide by americas nato and european union commitments i think we can be confident that u s policy toward poland and thus also our relations will not deteriorate that at least they will not become weaker mr duda said after a brief phone conversation with mr trump this past week and maybe we will be able to strengthen them even further polish leaders have focused on the more welcome statements mr trump has made like his promise to try to change rules that force poles to get visas to visit the united states long a sore point and they have steadfastly defended mr trump from criticism in more liberal corners of europe as a result the right wing government which has chafed under international criticism that its moves to marginalize the countrys constitutional court amounted to an undemocratic attack on the rule of law hopes that mr trumps victory will create an atmosphere in which it can resolve that crisis more to warsaws liking the problem is not that there is a perception that poland is under immediate threat from russia said marek menkiszak head of the russian section at the center for eastern studies in warsaw an independent but government funded research group the problem is rather this uncertainty caused by the mixed signals that have come out of the trump team rudolph w giuliani assured a gathering of polish american voters that the trump administration would abide by its treaty obligations including going to the military aid of any nato member state that is attacked but then newt gingrich also acting as a trump surrogate remarked that if he were president he would not necessarily go to the aid of estonia which he described as essentially a suburb of st petersburg sending a shiver down the
farhad hello there mike i was just reading that bob dylan decided to skip the ceremony for his nobel prize he says hes busy what a power move im going to take a cue from dylan the next time dean baquet our executive editor asks to see me in his office mike i tried that once with dean then mysteriously i had a bunch of late duty weeknight shifts to cover for the rest of the month good luck with that farhad o k lets talk tech it was a busy week for social networks facebook and twitter continued to face fallout from the ways they had been used during the election for facebook the story was fake news although mark zuckerberg the chief executive played down the role that misinformation spreading through his site might have had in the election some employees at facebook have been more skeptical as you reported mike yeah maybe if he took a break from eating all that dolphin mark would realize that he has a real fake news problem farhad mike im pretty sure that was a fake news story mark doesnt eat dolphin hes partial to lion cubs anyway on monday both google and facebook changed their advertising policies to explicitly prohibit fake news sites from making money from their lies and then president obama who was long the subject of a fake news campaign regarding his birthplace though that wasnt pushed by facebook as much as it was by the new president elect weighed in against fake news this story doesnt seem over does it mike not by a long shot i think this is truly one of facebooks existential threats and something it is now forced to take seriously mark tried shrugging it off at a conference last week but thats clearly not going to work the problem is once youve optimized your entire site for the spread of viral news and engagement its sort of hard to put the brakes on just one part of that in short i wouldnt want to be in their shoes right now farhad twitter also made some news the short message social network that we all love to hate has long been a haven for racists sexists and various other kinds of trolls on tuesday it rolled out new tools for users to fight abuse and it also suspended several accounts run by people in the white supremacist alt right jack dorsey twitters chief executive also apologized for an ad placed by a neo nazi group that appeared on twitter anyway do you have anything to say about this i vowed to quit twitter i didnt quit but i did delete the app from my phone and have thus been looking at it a lot less its liberating mike i give you a week before you reinstall the app on your phone i did take a few breaks from twitter for a few days after the election and in the run up over the last months of the race sometimes the vitriol and blaming and arguing is just too much especially when im not in a good head space but i truly believe it still provides a net positive for the world through the most optimistic lens it gives a voice to the voiceless which has done more good than harm after all i think as a writer im more on board the free speech train and all the costs that come with it than others might be farhad o k but theres one more social network to talk about snapchat or as it now wants to be known to folks on wall street snap inc snap inc is the parent company to snapchat which is an app that millions of people who dont read this newsletter probably use you use it to send pictures of funny faces its really great mike i like how weve moved from world changing app based largely upon first amendment practices in action to app that makes your face look like a dog farhad anyway two things about snap first the company finally released the photo glasses that it showed off earlier this year it did so in a predictably goofy way the glasses called spectacles are available only through special vending machines that move around the country if you happen to be near one you line up for a long time and then get your glasses mike the vending machines look like large and terrifying minions a meme i thought had died out and sadly has yet to do so thanks snapchat farhad yeah i asked the company to send me some and did not hear back but others whove tried them seem to love them also snap filed papers to take itself public what do you think is this the next facebook mike nah not really i see a limited market cap for snap unless it can find a way to break out of targeting only younger demographics granted getting em while theyre young and then having that generation grow up to be mainstream users is kind of what facebook did but what snap does seems fundamentally different from social networks of the past i find it hard to see where those major sources of growth are going to come from in the future of course maybe these spectacles actually take off maybe this is the wearable that makes the behavior recording video directly from your face a mainstream activity we saw what happened with the huge embarrassing failure that was google glass so i think everyone is more skeptical these days as they should be but spectacles look a lot cooler than glass did maybe that will be the product that makes snap a hit farhad yeah it could happen after all i think spectacles look really cool and im a pretty good barometer for upcoming fashion trends o k thats it for this week
here are the top comments of the week on our digital platforms as selected by our readers and the journalists who moderate nearly every comment this is what unqualified looks like trump never expected to win and never planned to govern he just loved the adulation he got from spreading his brand of hate now we have a completely unprepared administration trying desperately to do in weeks what it should have been preparing for over the last months the disaster begins it seems that billy bush has been one of the few to be held accountable for his words and participation in the onslaught of racism and misogyny in the campaign and now post election appointments all others are ascending to the highest offices in the land as a teacher i am already seeing the repercussions of having teflon individuals in high office have no consequences for their bigoted remarks when a student in my diverse classroom does not understand why it is hurtful to yell build the wall in the middle of class i can blame our leaders the anti semitism racism misogyny will continue if we do not hold people accountable bravo someone who understands the threat that islam poses to the west lets avoid the mistakes of france belgium and other countries where the dominating instincts of the worlds most dangerous religion have been allowed to flourish hey i find it really ironic that all the groups that think they have a god given mandate to enforce tolerance are so intolerant of controversial views and people that run counter to their own maybe the moral and ethical standards of mr bannon are not that repugnant in the end like trump who has said some unfortunate things as has everyone that he regrets if political correctness gets pushed to the maximum business and progress grinds to a halt in fear of legal accusations that become paralyzing how many lives have to be ruined by such enforced correctness and what about the controversial manipulators on the other side like george soros who will hold them to account infrastructure spending child tax credits paid maternity leave and dismantling trade agreements hmm sounds a bit like some of bernies platform slice and dice identity politics are all well and good but in the end it is all about the economy and too many of our fellow citizens are hurting wake up dems and return to the partys fdr roots or continue to lose this sad news hurts like the loss of a family member gwen ifills clarity and moderate tone brought so much to the frantic washington scene this is the worst possible moment to lose her special gift for analyzing politics and bringing contending parties together in a civil conversation i am considering many grad schools in the u s for my master course next fall before the election i only looked at the ranking the alumnis feedback the requirements and the fee and campus life now i really have to think about the safety as an asian woman i dont expect anyone to stop me in the street and tell me to get back to china so now although i was so sure about some schools in texas and wisconsin i have to sit down once again and closely look at the cities and hope that they are not too red this election changed my mind about america imagine for a moment you are a white male somewhere in america who just lost his job at a factory your mortgage is in default your car is being repossessed and you wonder whether youll be able to find a job much less one that pays a decent wage you have no particular animosity towards blacks gays women but you constantly hear the message that as a white straight male you are the paragon of privilege and that the hardships in your life are irrelevant or made up you dont feel so privileged are your struggles and fears really so different from those of the minority groups its easy to see why that person voted for the candidate who acknowledged his fears and against the candidate who dismissed his concerns because he was not a minority im less patient with sexism and talking down and more likely to stand up for others gesture wise the day after the election all of the young women in my office dressed in head to toe black no one coordinated no one knew that the other women would be dressed similarly but we all were sending a conscious message of mourning and it was comforting to see and feel that kind of solidarity this is a what locker room talk should be
anyone who has spent time with lt gen michael t flynn president elect donald j trumps choice for national security adviser knows he is nothing if not blunt especially when it comes to his near obsessive focus on radical islamic terrorism he has said on twitter that fear of muslims is rational written that islamic law is spreading in the united states and said that islam itself is more like a political ideology than a religion the united states he wrote in field of fight a book about radical islam published in august is in a world war but very few americans recognize it general flynn a retired military intelligence officer and registered democrat will be the person mr trump turns to when confronted with a crisis abroad whether it is a renewed bloodletting in ukraine a russian cyberattack on the united states or a hurricane hitting haiti the national security adviser is supposed to be a steady hand and honest broker who can provide measured and unbiased guidance to the president about how the united states should respond these are not qualities readily apparent in observing general flynn over the last few years said representative adam b schiff of california the top democrat on the house intelligence committee general flynn was once counted among the most respected military officers of his generation he spent years in the army becoming known as an outspoken and unconventional thinker as he climbed the ranks of military intelligence he seemed to have cemented a stellar reputation during tours overseeing intelligence for special operations troops in iraq and running military intelligence in afghanistan in both wars he proved unusually good at unraveling terrorist networks but general flynns career unraveled after he was named by president obama to run the defense intelligence agency in james r clapper jr the director of national intelligence fired him after his attempts to change the sprawling agency left subordinates squabbling and his superiors alarmed general flynn though has said he was forced out for refusing to toe the administrations line that islamist militants were in retreat a position that was in fact correct in his speeches and writing since his retirement general flynn has veered far from the mainstream in his views of islam and has insisted that islamist militants pose a threat to the very existence of the united states in mr trump general flynn found someone eager to hear his opinions he backed mr trumps campaign early and loudly and the two appeared to reinforce each others views mr flynn railed at a washington elite that he saw as too cowardly to call the enemy by the name radical islamic terrorism he continued to make comments that crossed the line into outright islamophobia and he led the raucous lock her up taunts of hillary clinton drawing the ire of former colleagues in the military most of whom see it as their duty to stay out of politics even in retirement general flynn has made few public statements since the election but in an interview in october he bristled at the criticism saying he got involved in the trump campaign out of the same patriotic duty that led him to join the military the two men have much in common there is a shared fondness for twitter and they both see themselves as outsiders whose successes have never earned them the respect of the elite for mr trump it is the kid from queens versus the swells from manhattan for mr flynn it is the armys reserve officer training program at the university of rhode island his alma mater versus the overachievers from west point he was one of nine children from an irish catholic family from rhode island definitely lower middle class he said in the interview his father was an enlisted soldier who after retiring worked his way up from bank teller to vice president of the bank his mother earned a law degree at age his brother charlie is currently a major general in the army among the hard line republicans who now dominate the party mr flynn has become something of a cult figure for what is seen as his brave stand against the obama administrations perfidy the favorable view of mr flynn is not shared by many in the republican national security establishment most of whom opposed mr trump or many current and former military officers they say he lacks the temperament and broader worldview needed at the white house where he will have to contend with more than just islamist militants they also fear general flynns apparent willingness to work with president vladimir v putin of russia who he has said should be courted as an ally in the fight against islamist militants last year he even sat next to mr putin at a lavish anniversary dinner hosted by russia today a television network funded by the kremlin which also paid general flynn to speak then there is general flynns habit of saying things that are simply not accurate with complete conviction at the defense intelligence agency his subordinates called them flynn facts there are also concerns that the consulting firm he founded after leaving the military the flynn intel group poses potential conflicts of interest the firm has business ties to middle eastern countries and has appeared to lobby for the turkish government representative elijah e cummings democrat of maryland released a letter on friday that he had sent to vice president elect mike pence seeking more information about general flynns apparent conflicts and questioning why he has been allowed to sit in on intelligence briefings with mr trump
something is deeply wrong when the popes voice reputation and influence can be borrowed by a source that describes itself as a fantasy news site to claim that he has endorsed a presidential candidate and then be amplified unchallenged through a million individual shares the attention paid to fake news since the election has focused largely on fabrications and outright lies because they are indefensible easy to identify and extraordinarily viral fake news is created by the kinds of people who when asked might call their work satire or admit that theyre in it for the money or for the thrill of deception theirs is a behavior that can and should be shunned and that facebook is equipped and maybe willing to deal with for many people and especially opponents of president elect donald j trump the attention paid to fake news and its role in the election has provided a small relief the discovery of the error that explains everything but as the attention has spread widely even president obama talked passionately about it on thursday it may lead to an unwanted outcome for those who see it not just as an explanation but also as a way to correct the course it misunderstands a new media world in which every story and source is at risk of being discredited not by argument but by sheer force false news stories posted on fly by night websites were prevalent in this election so too were widely shared political videos some styled as newscasts containing outright falsehoods newslike image memes posted by individuals and shared by millions and endlessly shared quotes and video clips of the candidates themselves repeating falsehoods during the months i spent talking to partisan facebook page operators for a magazine article this year it became clear that while the ecosystem contained easily identifiable and intentional fabrication it contained much much more of something else i recall a conversation with a fact checker about how to describe a story posted on a pro trump website and promoted on a pro trump facebook page and incidentally copied from another pro trump site by overseas contractors it tried to cast suspicion on khizr khan the father of a slain american soldier who had spoken out against donald j trump the overarching claims of the story were disingenuous and horrifying the facts it included had been removed from all useful context and placed in a new sinister one its insinuating mention of muslim martyrs in proximity to mentions of mr khans son and its misleading and strategic mention of shariah law amounted to a repulsive smear it was a story that appealed to bigoted ideas and that would clearly appeal to those who held them this was a story the likes of which was an enormous force in this election clearly designed to function well within facebooks economy of sharing and it probably would not run afoul of the narrow definition of fake news stories like that one get to the heart of the rhetorical and strategic risk of holding up fake news as a broad media offensive position especially after an election cycle characterized by the euphoric inversion of rhetoric by some of mr trumps supporters and by the candidate himself as the campaign progressed criticism of mr trump was instantly projected back at his opponent or at the critics themselves no puppet no puppet youre the puppet this tactic was used on the language of social justice which was appropriated by opponents and redeployed nihilistically in an open effort to sap its power while simultaneously taking advantage of what power it retained anti racists were cast as the real racists progressives were cast as secretly regressive on their own terms this was not a new tactic but it was newly effective it didnt matter that its targets knew that it was a bad faith maneuver a clear bid for power rather than an attempt to engage or reason the referees called foul but nobody could hear them over the roar of the crowds or maybe they could but realized that nobody could make them listen fake news as shorthand will almost surely be returned upon the media tenfold the fake news narrative as widely understood and deployed has already begun to encompass not just falsified fabricated stories but a wider swath of traditional media on facebook and elsewhere fox news fake news mr trumps misleading claims about ford keeping jobs in america fake news the entirety of hyperpartisan facebook fake news this wide formulation of fake news will be applied back to the traditional news media which does not yet understand how threatened its ability is to declare things true even when they are facebook may try to address the narrow version of the problem the clearly fabricated posts facebook has plenty of tools at its disposal and has already promised to use one to bar sites that have been flagged as promoting falsified content from using its advertising platform but the worst identified defenders make their money outside facebook anyway another narrow response from facebook could be to assert editorial control over external forces facebook tried this to a very limited extent with trending topics members of the companys editorial staff wrote descriptions of trending news stories accompanied by links they deemed credible this initiative collapsed in a frenzy of bias accusations and political fear but it is easy to imagine a system in which a story upon reaching some high threshold of shares or a source upon reaching some cumulative audience could be audited and declared unreliable this could resemble facebooks short lived experiment to tag satire articles as such a number of narrow measures could stop a fake story about the pope for example but where would that leave the rest of the media answered and rebutted and barely better positioned against everything else that remained it would be a still dominant news environment in which almost everything there before remained intact the main difference being

jerusalem americas top diplomat in jerusalem lives in an elegant three story stone house first built by a german lutheran missionary in a short walk from the historic old city but he is not an ambassador and the mission is a consulate not an embassy for decades those distinctions have rankled many israeli jews the united states along with the rest of the world has kept its primary diplomatic footprint not in israels self declared capital jerusalem but in the commercial and cultural hub of tel aviv to avoid seeming to take sides in the fraught and never ending argument over who really has the right to control this ancient city until now maybe president elect donald j trump vowed during his campaign that he would relocate the mission fairly quickly after taking office that in itself is nothing new for years candidates running for president have promised to move the embassy to jerusalem and for years candidates who actually became president have opted against doing so but just as mr trump broke all the rules of campaigning some of his supporters say no amount of hand wringing by the state department will change his mind jason greenblatt an orthodox lawyer who is advising mr trump on israel told army radio after the election that the president elect was going to do it because he was a man who keeps his word already many israelis and palestinians are buzzing about the prospect where would the embassy go would it straddle the line between west jerusalem which is predominantly jewish and east jerusalem which is predominantly arab would it touch off street protests in palestinian cities or a backlash among arab allies like egypt and saudi arabia jerusalem is a symbolic emotional and real issue said itamar rabinovich a former israeli ambassador to the united states and president of the israel institute it matters to many israeli jews because it would indicate that the united states actually recognizes jerusalem as israels capital which now it effectively does not which is why arabs object so strenuously to such a move this is a sign that hes going to side with israel said mustafa alani a scholar at the gulf research center a research organization with offices in saudi arabia and elsewhere if he does it its going to be a wrong start for his relationship with the arab world the status of jerusalem has always been one of the thorniest issues dividing jews and arabs in the united nations recommended that the city be declared a corpus separatum meaning an international city rather than incorporated into either the arab or the jewish states then being contemplated on the land between the jordan river and the mediterranean sea but in the war that followed its declaration of statehood in israel captured the western portion of the city while jordan seized the east israel took control of east jerusalem in its war with its arab neighbors and annexed it declaring that the city would remain whole and unified as its eternal capital the united states and most other countries refused to recognize the annexation and kept their embassies in or near tel aviv the last two countries with embassies in jerusalem costa rica and el salvador moved out a decade ago bill clinton and george w bush both promised during their presidential campaigns to move the embassy to jerusalem both later backed away from those promises convinced by middle east experts that doing so would prejudge negotiations for a final settlement between israelis and palestinians in congress passed a law declaring jerusalem to be israels capital and requiring the embassy be moved there by or else the state department building budget would be cut in half but the law included a provision allowing presidents to waive its requirement for six months if they determined it was in the national interest so every six months mr clinton mr bush and eventually president obama signed such waivers fearing a violent response in the arab world if the embassy moved every president who reversed his campaign promise did so because he decided not to take the risk said dennis b ross a longtime middle east envoy who advised multiple presidents including mr obama jerusalem has historically been an issue that provoked great passions often as a result of false claims that did trigger violence whether such advice might sway mr trump is unclear despite mr greenblatts declaration another trump adviser on the middle east walid phares told the bbc that mr trump would move the embassy under consensus he later clarified that he meant a consensus at home since no one could imagine a consensus including arabs at this point elliott abrams a former middle east adviser to mr bush said mr trump should follow through because even if east jerusalem is eventually ceded to the palestinians as the capital of their own state no plausible settlement would deny west jerusalem to israel there is simply no reason not to put a u s embassy there he said the issue remains so delicate that the obama administration went all the way to the supreme court to block a law passed by congress allowing american parents of children born in jerusalem to list israel as their birthplace on their passports when mr obama came to jerusalem in september for the funeral of shimon peres the former israeli president and prime minister the white house initially released a transcript of his eulogy that listed jerusalem israel as the location of his remarks a few hours later it issued a corrected transcript that literally crossed out the word israel the consulate currently in jerusalem run by the consul general donald blome a career diplomat deals mainly with the palestinians while the embassy in tel aviv run by ambassador daniel b shapiro an obama appointee handles relations with israel mr trump could simply declare the consulate to be an embassy and move the ambassadors home as a stopgap but there are
it hasnt been a good couple of years for for profit colleges many of them usually offering vocational training have had to close outlets as the federal government cracked down on their advertising and student loan practices two of the largest itt technical institute and corinthian colleges shut down then came the election of donald j trump as president stock prices of the companies still running for profit colleges rose sharply devry university shares rose percent in the days after the election the shares of the company that owns university of phoenix apollo education group the largest for profit increased percent both are at a week high the broad s p index by contrast rose percent in the days after the election why are investors bullish on for profits under mr trump profits could be coming back the industry has faced high profile federal and state investigations for their recruitment and student financial aid practices investors may expect that mr trump will end the restrictions that slowed enrollments and checked the most lucrative practices the obama administration has been tough on the industry the federal trade commission sued devry university for deceptive advertising the consumer financial protection bureau sued itt technical institutes for predatory lending itt also the subject of a justice department probe has filed for bankruptcy corinthian which filed for bankruptcy protection last year was recently ordered by a federal court to pay its students a restitution of million and pay civil penalties of more than million for illegal advertising practices this fall the education department moved to revoke the status of the accrediting council for independent colleges and schools the largest accreditor of for profit colleges colleges have to be accredited for their students to get federal aid such as loans and pell grants acics was accused of insufficiently policing its colleges in part because it raised no red flags about corinthian colleges which lost access to federal aid amid accusations of false marketing pulling the plug on the accreditor was a clear signal from the obama administration that accreditors should play their gatekeeper role more forcefully acics has appealed the decision the obama administrations move against for profits was in part intended to close the worst colleges and keep the rest on their toes students at these for profit colleges borrowed heavily and defaulted frequently on their loans at the depths of the recession for profits accounted for nearly half of student loan defaults even though they enrolled a minority of students the administration took its action using its regulatory powers no new laws were passed that led to the heightened attention to for profits investors may be expecting that a trump administration will use a lighter touch in overseeing for profits giving them greater latitude to maximize profits for example recent rules dismiss the loans of students defrauded by for profits and put the colleges on the hook for repaying part of their balances the new administration could choose to put few resources into enforcing these rules mr trumps decision on who will lead the education department could provide a glimpse of his priorities ben carson who ran against mr trump in the republican primaries was a prominent candidate but he has said he is not interested in serving in the trump administration recently floated names include michelle rhee a former superintendent of washingtons public schools and eva moskowitz founder of a network of new york charter schools those two reflect a focus on school choice and accountability for elementary and secondary schools almost all the other people said to be under consideration have little to no background in postsecondary policy investors have little to go on in predicting mr trumps policy he has released few concrete proposals about postsecondary education during the campaign but his name is linked to education because he ran trump university and lent his name to another education business trump institute both businesses now closed are in a different category from devry or university of phoenix his sold real estate training sessions the seminars often held in hotel ballrooms neither school was accredited and their students were ineligible for federal aid on friday afternoon mr trump agreed to pay million to settle a series of lawsuits stemming from the for profit trump university after fraud allegations by former students a trial based on those allegations was to begin later this month
the united states is a leader in internet technology but it may well be a laggard when it comes to using internet technology for political mischief the role that fake news stories on internet sites facebook in particular played in last weeks presidential election continues to be a hot button issue did fake news tip the balance in the election can facebook do more to prevent fake news should it facebook executives dispute the notion that fake news on the social network might have swayed voters but political analysts say the warning signs of this debate could be seen in other countries years ago take the philippines where a spokesman for its president rodrigo duterte shared on facebook an image of a girl believed to have been raped and killed by a drug dealer fact checkers later revealed that the photo had come from brazil paul mozur and mark scott write the role of fake news posted to facebook in the recent presidential election is likely to be debated for months even years but there is little doubt that the social media network has had plenty of influence in october a word reminder to register to vote contributed to significant increases in online voter registration across the country according to officials in nine states in that case facebook did not dispute their conclusion
for a brief moment after a white supremacist carried out a massacre of black churchgoers in charleston s c it seemed as though the confederate battle flag that most divisive of symbols might soon be on its way out of the american political arena but now that explosive and complicated vestige of the old south is back in a new and to some americans newly disturbing context during president elect donald j trumps campaign followers drawn to his rallies occasionally displayed the flag and other confederate iconography since the election his supporters and others have displayed the flag as a kind of rejoinder to anti trump protesters in places such as durango colo st petersburg fla hampton va fort worth and traverse city mich on election day in silverton ore the flag appeared at a high school trump rally where students reportedly told hispanic classmates pack your bags youre leaving tomorrow the day after at kenyon college in ohio the colleges president sean m decatur spoke to a worried campus describing his discomfort at seeing confederate flags on display in the nearby city of mount vernon dorothy robinson said that seeing the battle flag flying at a traditional postelection unity parade in her hometown georgetown del felt like someone had punched me in the gut those who have publicly embraced the flag are a small minority of the more than million americans who voted for mr trump in the nov election but these incidents and hundreds of reports of insults and threats directed at minorities and others are forcing americans to confront vexing questions about the future of race relations under mr trump and the extent to which his campaign has animated white resentment and even a budding white nationalism the emergence of the flag in a postelection context also comes as liberals and others have harshly criticized mr trump for appointing as his chief white house strategist stephen k bannon the former head of breitbart news a website they accuse of trafficking in anti semitic misogynist and anti muslim ideas shortly after the june charleston massacre an article posted on breitbart argued that the confederacy was a patriotic and idealistic cause and that its flag proclaims a glorious heritage every tree every rooftop every picket fence every telegraph pole in the south should be festooned with the confederate battle flag the author gerald warner wrote hoist it high and fly it with pride how much the flags resurgence reflects anything more than the sentiments of those who fly it remains unclear mr trump a native new yorker declared shortly after announcing his candidacy that he supported a call by gov nikki r haley of south carolina to remove the flag from the grounds of the statehouse there after the mass shooting in charleston the state legislature after passionate debate eventually agreed to remove the flag i think they should put it in the museum let it go respect whatever it is that you have to respect because it was a point in time and put it in a museum mr trump told reporters at the time historians say the battle flag has had shifting meanings over time a symbol of white resistance to integration during the civil rights era a more complicated but still racially charged symbol now grace elizabeth hale a professor of american studies and history at the university of virginia who has written extensively about the south segregation and white americans said the flag had long been a symbol for outsiders and a rebuke to the forces of decorum and political correctness she said its use now both in the south and outside it could be seen as an expression of concern that white culture has been displaced as the norm maybe for the first time ever definitely in my lifetime people outside the south are in a very public way claiming a white racial identity she said stephen moss a republican state representative from the small town of blacksburg s c was one of a number of lawmakers who voted against removing the flag from the statehouse grounds in july to mr moss a supporter of mr trump the flag represents the heritage of those who fought for the confederacy but he acknowledged that the flag had also been hijacked by hate groups asked why the flag was turning up in the hands of trump supporters he said he thought that it might be part of a backlash of working white voters who suspect that people in their minds often minorities are taking advantage of the federal welfare system a lot of these people who go to work every day are in the line at the grocery store and over half the people are bringing out these cards to pay for the groceries he said two days after the presidential race concluded ms robinson a writer and editor who lives in maplewood n j was back in her hometown to watch the return day parade a long running tradition in which winners and losers of local elections ride through town together in a show of unity and party leaders come together to bury an actual hatchet there were marching bands and smiling faces and ms robinson felt that perhaps the country was on its way to healing after a particularly ugly election then a white chevrolet pickup rolled by flying an american flag a trump flag and the battle flag ms robinson a white hillary clinton supporter was standing next to a black friend at the time i wasnt shocked i was horrified ms robinson said she suspects that some white trump supporters are indulging in new freedom to be politically incorrect now that the nations first african american president is on the way out mr trump declared his candidacy on june the day before the charleston massacre he would go on to see his political stock rise at the same time as pro flag backlash was emerging particularly among people who felt their heritage

the early stock market reaction to donald j trumps election victory was overwhelmingly positive but that doesnt mean a trump presidency will be good for the economy stock markets often serve as an economic scoreboard increasing stock prices are equated with economic victory but these inferences are too facile because some increases connote good news while others do not reading market movements such as the steep rise in stock prices in the early postelection days as well as the subsequent ups and downs requires a rosetta stone constructing one takes an understanding of what drives stock prices and how that relates to the overall health of the economy buying stock in a company entitles the owner to a percentage of present and future profits the share price should be equivalent to a prediction of what these future profits will be thats the theory anyway and stock markets when they work excel because these stocks are traded assets and all traders can contribute to the markets overall prediction if traders feel stock prices are low relative to future profits they will bid up prices if they feel prices are high they will sell and drive down prices in this way the final price represents a collective prediction by the entire market an increase in stock prices therefore signals an expected increase in future profits the movement in stock prices has a direct effect shareholders are immediately wealthier anyone holding a retirement portfolio knows the all too familiar feeling of reading stock price movements through the narrow lens of how well you can retire this does not benefit all people in the economy some shares are held by citizens of other countries and the shares held in this country are not equitably held but at the least a surge in stock prices equals more wealth for the citizenry but rising stock prices can spell good news for other reasons even many of those who do not own stocks can expect a brighter future this is because when companies prosper consumers frequently also do well this notion can be somewhat counterintuitive after all we often reflexively assume that when businesses make more money they do so at our expense that is by overcharging us in a well functioning market though the interests of companies and consumers are aligned businesses profit when customers enthusiastically buy their products higher profits mean happier customers the economy as a whole is doing well by way of example suppose apple unveils a new iphone that buoys its stock price traders are bullish about the iphones robust sales they are focused on the fact that these sales add to apples coffers but each sale assuming consumers are choosing wisely is also presumably producing joy for consumers this example also makes clear when the stock market can be a poor scoreboard for the economy sometimes companies can profit without improving consumers lives or possibly even by worsening them for example part of the stock surge after the election most likely occurred because of a widely held belief that a trump administration would slash regulations that may be good for some companies bottom lines but is that good for everyone else it depends do those regulations hinder only products that were profitable and good for consumers or do they also hinder products that are bad for consumers take the case of wells fargo which was recently found to have created millions of accounts in customers names without their knowledge these accounts were profitable for wells fargo but surely not good for consumers the extent of this behavior was uncovered because of the work of a regulatory watchdog the consumer financial protection bureau mr trumps election increases the possibility that the bureau will be shut down or that its powers will be curtailed but if this prospect raises the value of bank stocks because it makes it more likely that behavior like wells fargos can flourish thats hardly cause for celebration and its not good news for the economy in short whether a rise in stock prices is good or bad for nonshareholders depends on whether the increase in profits arises because companies are serving consumers or because they are profiting at consumers expense there is a final factor to consider the capacity of traders to make predictions about future profits is limited in michael rashes then a doctoral student in economics at harvard and now a principal at bracebridge capital noticed something funny about stock prices on oct worldcom made a bid for mci communications shares listed under the symbol mci went up that day in itself that wasnt surprising good news raises prices the problem as mr rashes noted was that the ticker symbol mci belonged to massmutual corporate investors this fund had nothing to do with mci communications which traded under the ticker symbol mcic his paper was published in the journal of finance in under the title massively confused investors making conspicuously ignorant choices this was not a freak event traders are highly fallible on oct for example after twitter announced its initial public offering the stock price of the boston based consumer electronics chain tweeter which had filed for bankruptcy in rose to cents a share from the previous days close of less than cent trading was eventually halted a large body of research now emphasizes a basic fact despite the rise of computers and artificial intelligence markets are at their root made up of human traders yes the crowd is often smarter than the individual but smarter does not mean perfect many of the biases of individual traders become broader market biases in fact some new biases are introduced when traders feed off one another and compound their mistakes on election night the votes at the ballot box mattered in the financial markets another kind of vote counting took place just as the presidential election tells us only who voters believe is good for the country the market can tell us only what traders believe is

berlin president obama and several european leaders unanimously agreed on friday to keep sanctions in place against russia for its intervention in ukraine amid concern that president elect donald j trump would soften the united states stance against moscow the show of solidarity came as american allies and ukrainians themselves have been unsettled by uncertainty regarding what kind of foreign policy mr trump will pursue with surging populist movements straining alliances and mr trumps election upending the political calculations of many countries ukraine may be among the most vulnerable to the shifting political winds fighting in ukraine has continued since moscow stealthily fomented an uprising among ethnic russians in eastern ukraine with the help of undercover russian forces and then annexed crimea in march as a candidate and as president elect mr trump has frequently expressed admiration for president vladimir v putin of russia and a former trump campaign manager paul manafort previously worked for a former ukrainian president viktor f yanukovych who is now exiled in russia meeting in berlin mr obama and the european leaders agreed that the sanctions should stay until moscow upheld its pledge for a cease fire and to withdraw heavy weapons from front lines in eastern ukraine according to the white house those in attendance on friday included the german chancellor angela merkel and the french president franois hollande as well as the prime ministers of britain italy and spain the agreement on ukraine followed remarks by mr obama on thursday warning mr trump to stand up to moscow when it violated international agreements ms merkel also reminded russia that peace in europe had been possible over the past several years only because all nations respected the boundaries drawn after world war ii fridays meeting concluded a weeklong visit to european allies by mr obama whose terms ends in january but what was supposed to be a valedictory lap turned into an exercise in calming anxieties about the future of trans atlantic relations spurred by the victory of mr trump who repeatedly called the nato alliance into question during his election campaign the group also discussed tensions in the middle east including the situation in syria the white house said the leaders agreed that attacks on the city of aleppo should be halted immediately and they called on russia and iran to end their support for the government of president bashar al assad on syria of course looking at aleppo we were united in our condemnation of the atrocities that are taking place there mrs may told reporters standing alongside ms merkel after mr obama had departed we agreed the need to keep up pressure on russia including the possibility of sanctions on those who breach international humanitarian law that consensus too was another potential point of departure from the incoming mr trump who has signaled that he may side with russia in backing the assad government against the opponents trying to unseat it including the islamic state after the meeting in berlin mr obama left germany for latin america
re states of confusion thank you jim yardley you beat me to the punch having left the united states in to live in spain for a year which turned into i returned in and have daily made a mental list of the changes during that quarter century yardley eloquently speaks to many of these and i would add a few more some trivial but still noteworthy the rampant advance of capitalism ranging from the commercialization of halloween to the corporate naming of our sports stadiums and other public buildings feminism and civil rights becoming dirty words the rebirth of exclusiveness and elitism like the greek system and brand only consumerism and wearing ones religion like a lapel pin i could go on i left when george h w bush was elected and came back because barack obama had passed health care reform maybe it was too soon speaking as an american expat this piece certainly resonated with me the palpable anxiety the extreme wealthy class the police state militarism at every turn the partisan acrimony etc all seem to be intensifying since when i left with my family when we return from visiting i usually feel exhausted from the stress of my vacation however while this is all often true its also true that the states can also be a wonderful place to live and travel these places you covered are all exceptional cases the u s mexico border detroit baton rouge san francisco and even the evangelical zeal of kansas are not the best examples of average america i spent three of the past four years in mongolia in both rural and urban environments reading the news from home obsessively in a much shorter period of time than yardley has spent i too felt like a stranger i am back in the u s a now and i am very much trying to hang on to my view of the u s as a foreigner someone who has not gradually adapted to the boiling water of american citizenship situated between russia and china mongolia depends on the u s for its commitment to democracy and stability and especially to its resolve to enforce these principles with its allies in asia what mongolians saw in july before i left was the continued ineffectiveness of american democracy to fix the problem of mass shootings by americans with guns that are or seem to be sanctioned by our government those who make the assault weapons support the representatives that make them legal even with mongolias ineffective government this would be an easy problem to fix then comes the news that the police are shooting anyone with a nervous twitch especially if they have a skin color that might have a grudge against their races treatment by the police yardley has only scratched the surface the entire world is waiting for us to get our act together re clinton trump maureen dowds article inspired a thought that it wouldnt be surprising if this past election contest was nothing more than the result of a friendly bet not unlike the one by the two duke brothers in the movie trading places instead of a pygmalion like endeavor to nurture a street hustler into becoming a successful commodities broker it was for running for president with the goal of destroying the republican party the percent have more in common with each other than with the rest of the country many politicians have more in common with each other than with the people they sometimes try or sometimes purport to serve no surprises in this article and yes its as if were in that greek myth in this election choosing between two flawed options that do have at least one thing in common wealth and power what i get out of this is that politics is not for those with a weak stomach or an inclination to be kind perhaps the same applies for new york city the ability to manipulate people money and crowds is not an uplifting way to spend a day much less a life the piece is hugely informative but the story within is less a sensational plot than a sad expos on bad characters americans need to move away from entertainment as a way of life because if we dont this is who our leaders will be

the weeks between thanksgiving and new years day are often called the giving season when charities ramp up their pitches and people consider to what causes and organizations they will give but for many students in the united states and elsewhere giving via volunteer work or service learning projects is also tied to school curriculum or strongly encouraged as a way to strengthen college applications no matter what the reason youre giving back we encourage you to think about how to do it in a way that has the most meaning to you and makes the most impact on an issue you care about below some ideas from the times the learning network and around the web to do just that learn why giving is good for the giver not only can giving make the world a better place but it can be good for us too some tibetan monks even claim giving is selfish since it makes you feel so fantastic a op ed points to scientific evidence that giving enhances our happiness and might actually be good for our health the authors write the op ed concludes think of times you were generous when you tried to help others by donating your time energy money or possessions did being generous ever make you feel happier or healthier whats your reaction to the research results that generosity can be good for health do they make intuitive sense to you choose a problem you care about start thinking about giving by first identifying the problems you want to help address alone or with others brainstorm three lists global problems national problems and local problems for example you might include the civil war in syria under global homelessness in america under national and gender equality in your own school under local circle the issues you care about most or that most inspire you to get involved dont worry about how large or small the issues are youll be able to scale what and how youll give to fit an issue no matter what you choose another way to get ideas on the table the one question interview technique we recommended in a lesson plan about philanthropy we published during the great recession here are teacher directions and here are open ended questions students might ask one another like when have you or a friend or family member done meaningful community service of some kind or if you had to give to any charity or nonprofit agency you wanted to which would you give it after the divisive presidential election many people are vowing to take action on causes they care about for instance the opinion columnist nicholas kristof offers a step program to make a difference including avoid demonizing people who dont agree with me about this election he also includes useful links to organizations like reach out and read and the international rescue committee that might help you

facebook had a message for advertisers on wednesday whoops the company the worlds biggest social network acknowledged in a lengthy blog post that it was moving to restore confidence among advertisers in its methods for explaining how long users see videos news articles ads and corporate messages steve lohr and sapna maheshwari write a little more than a month ago facebook apologized for overstating how long on average users spent watching videos but dont worry facebook now has a blog called metricsfyi that explains these things in detail and that will explain and analyze how it comes to its metrics the blog is one of a number of changes the company is making to restore confidence among the advertisers that pay the bills its been an odd week for facebook for the last few years it has seemed as though the company could do no wrong with the exception of some serious missteps in a plan to provide internet access in india but with the presidential election over some are asking hard questions about the impact of all those fake news stories you saw friends sharing no in case you were wondering hillary clinton did not go to jail no leading hollywood personalities are not actually lizard people mark zuckerberg facebooks chief executive has publicly doubted fake stories had much of an impact on the election but just in case his company reminded people that fake news sites are banned from the facebook ad network
san francisco an automated army of pro donald j trump chatbots overwhelmed similar programs supporting hillary clinton five to one in the days leading up to the presidential election according to a report published thursday by researchers at oxford university the chatbots basic software programs with a bit of artificial intelligence and rudimentary communication skills would send messages on twitter based on a topic usually defined on the social network by a word preceded by a hashtag symbol like clinton their purpose to rant confuse people on facts or simply muddy discussions said philip n howard a sociologist at the oxford internet institute and one of the authors of the report if you were looking for a real debate of the issues you werent going to find it with a chatbot theyre yelling fools dr howard said and a lot of what they pass around is false news the role fake news played in the presidential election has become a sore point for the technology industry particularly google twitter and facebook on monday google said it would ban websites that peddle fake news from using its online advertising service facebook also updated the language in its facebook audience network policy which already says it will not display ads in sites that show misleading or illegal content to include fake news sites in some cases the bots would post embarrassing photos make references to the federal bureau of investigation inquiry into mrs clintons private email server or produce false statements for instance that mrs clinton was about to go to jail or was already in jail the use of automated accounts was deliberate and strategic throughout the election the researchers wrote in the report published by the project on algorithms computational propaganda and digital politics at oxford because the chatbots were almost entirely anonymous and were frequently bought in secret from companies or individual programmers it was not possible to directly link the activity to either campaign except for a handful of joke bots created by mrs clintons campaign they noted however there was evidence that the mystery chatbots were part of an organized effort there does seem to be strategy behind the bots dr howard said by the third debate trump bots were launching into their activity early and we noticed that automated accounts were actually colonizing clinton hashtags a hashtag is used to indicate a twitter posts topic by adopting hashtags relating to mrs clinton the opposition bots were most likely able to wiggle their way into an online conversation among clinton supporters after the election the bot traffic declined rapidly with the exception of some pro trump programs that gloated we won and you lost dr howard said trump campaign officials did not respond to requests for comment twitter executives argued that more people would not follow the programs and so they would be picked up only by those who looked for particular hashtags anyone who claims that automated spam accounts that tweeted about the u s election had an effect on voters opinions or influenced the national twitter conversation clearly underestimates voters and fails to understand how twitter works said nick pacilio a twitter spokesman the researchers based their study on a collection of about million twitter posts gathered in the first nine days of november they selected tweets based on hashtags identifying certain subjects and identified automated posting by finding accounts that post at least times a day for example the top accounts which were mostly bots and highly automated accounts averaged over tweets a day and they generated more than tweets the researchers noted the top accounts which still used high levels of automation generated around tweets at an average rate of tweets per day the oxford researchers had previously reported that political chatbots had played a role in shaping the political landscape that led to britains brexit vote the researchers have coined the term computational propaganda to describe the explosion of deceptive social media campaigns on services like facebook and twitter in a previous research paper dr howard and bence kollanyi a researcher at corvinus university of budapest described how political chatbots had a small but strategic role in shaping the online conversation during the run up to the brexit referendum the bot managers seem to repurpose the programs as well during the british campaign they discovered that a family of bots that had been tweeting around israeli palestinian issues for three or four years had suddenly become pro brexit after the vote the bots returned to their original issue in the case of the american election the researchers noted that highly automated accounts the accounts that tweeted or more times with a related hashtag and user mention during the data collection period generated close to percent of all twitter traffic about the presidential election they also noted that bots tend to circulate negative news much more effectively than positive reports one of the consequences of the intense social media campaigns will be a rise in what social scientists call selective affinity clinton supporters will cut the trump supporters out of their network and trump supporters will do the same dr howard said the polarization of the election is going to make this stuff worse as we self groom our news networks
campaign promises are easy governing is hard it is a truism that donald j trump and his team will soon learn and a fascinating example has emerged since the election courtesy of global currency markets it is a study in the kind of complex trade offs that mr trump rarely grappled with during his campaign but will face many times a day in the oval office a centerpiece of mr trumps campaign was the united states trade deficits he pledged to eliminate them and create a resurgence in american manufacturing he has also pledged tax cuts infrastructure spending and deregulation that set of policies has led markets to expect speedier economic growth and thus higher interest rates in coming years that in turn is driving the value of the dollar higher since election day the dollar is up percent against an index of six other major currencies the value of the mexican peso has fallen percent against the dollar a remarkable swing for the united states third largest trading partner you dont need to be an economist to see what that means a pricier dollar makes it harder for american manufacturers to compete overseas it gives an advantage to companies that locate operations elsewhere and it will all else being equal tend to make the trade deficit higher rather than lower this is not to suggest that the shift in the currency so far is a major disaster for american manufacturers and other exporters there was a bigger rise in the dollar in and that damaged export sectors even more but lets imagine that mr trump follows through on the policy mix hes hinted at so far a combination of loose fiscal policy and tighter monetary policy at that point the dollar could move decisively higher creating a tension that the president and his advisers would have to resolve one way or the other as a rule of thumb said joseph gagnon a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics a percent rise in the dollar would be expected to increase the current account deficit by to percent of g d p in the ensuing two to three years in that case mr trumps pledge to eliminate the billion united states trade deficit would have just become billion to billion harder this is the kind of dilemma presidents face all the time the oval office debate might go something like this the commerce secretary complains mr president this strong dollar is just killing our manufacturers they cant compete with this kind of appreciation the treasury secretary who is in charge of the currency responds its a necessary evil mr president our economy is booming so much that global investors just cant get enough of united states assets when there are these kinds of disputes the president has to decide and when a president tries to find a solution that answers both concerns there are always complex ripples for example lets appoint fed officials who will cut interest rates might temporarily let you have both a booming domestic economy and a competitive export sector but would mean an increase in inflation which will make both the bond market and many retired americans living on fixed incomes unhappy the tension between currency policy and trade policy is just one example mr trumps promises to repeal obamacare while keeping some of its most popular features would be hard to carry out in practice virtually every issue in tax policy diplomacy and regulatory policy features similar complex trade offs none of this is to say that these tensions are unsolvable or that mr trump wont overcome his lack of a policy background to arrive at good solutions but he will almost certainly find out that make america great again is a slogan not an answer
donald j trumps victory could well push the american party system toward a clash between an overwhelmingly white ethnic party and a cosmopolitan coalition of minority groups and college educated whites despite the unexpected result mr trump lost the popular vote in an election that in some respects closely resembled barack obamas victory over mitt romney in an ordinary end to a very abnormal campaign the power of party identification held approximately percent of republicans in mr trumps camp however mr trumps campaign may set in motion a process that reorients american politics toward the cosmopolitanism versus nationalism divide that he emphasized reconfiguring our party system and shaping our politics for decades to come the power of social identity suggests that such a dynamic could be difficult to stop once set in motion in recent years the democrats and republicans have battled along a liberal conservative axis of conflict that emphasizes disagreement over the size and scope of government rather than divisive disputes about racial identity during the and presidential elections for instance john mccain and mr romney ran against mr obamas domestic policy proposals on issues like health care and the economy after the republican party hoped to continue along this path and expand its appeal to young people minorities and women but as the political scientists gary miller and norm schofield note candidates and parties sometimes engage in flanking moves so as to enlist coalitions of disaffected voters by changing positions on social issues that cut across party lines they seek to attract voters who are only loosely attached to the other party mr trump seems to have pulled off one of these maneuvers in shifting from traditional conservatism to a kind of race inflected nationalism though the move cost him votes among college educated whites he attracted support among the larger group of whites without a college degree pulling in just enough votes in the rust belt to tip the election despite all the attention paid to economic anxiety as the basis for mr trumps appeal the evidence to date is more consistent with his brand of identity politics being the most important cause of this shift in voting patterns from mr trumps approach has the potential to transform the party system first the success of his campaign may encourage other republicans to adopt his model he has shown that the penalty for deviating from orthodox policies is minimal and that an ethno nationalist style can have significant electoral advantages second though presidents cannot impose their will on most of domestic policy they can help define the issues on the political agenda in the choices that he makes mr trump may play down conflict over the size and scope of government and shift the political debate toward questions of national identity immigration and culture finally few republicans are likely to want to cross mr trump and his energized supporters given the threat of a potential primary challenge in consider for instance mr trumps decision to name as his chief strategist steve bannon the head of breitbart a website described in an article in the conservative national review as catering to a small but vocal fringe of white supremacists anti semites and internet trolls though the move lacked recent precedent no republicans in congress objected which made the issue into a partisan dispute with democrats mr trump has also stirred emotions by promising to deport two to three million undocumented immigrants by contrast the fate of a tax cut normally the top g o p domestic policy priority has received less attention mr trumps success is likely to provoke a response from democrats that could accelerate this shift they face an outraged liberal base that is likely to reject conciliatory messages intended to win back votes among the white working class the party might instead double down on cosmopolitan appeals to the minority voters and college educated white voters who were the main target of hillary clintons campaign the strategy failed in but the incentive to try again is clear democrats came closer to winning several sun belt states where minority and college educated white populations are growing like arizona and georgia than they did some traditional midwest strongholds with higher numbers of noncollege whites like ohio and iowa a focus on cosmopolitanism might make electoral sense for democrats given the changing demographics of the country but it could further weaken their appeal to whites without college degrees dividing the electorate by race and class even more nothing about this process is preordained of course republicans may yet succeed in steering mr trump toward a traditional g o p agenda of tax cuts and deregulation but the effects he could have on americas party system could be of far more lasting consequence than almost any policy he might propose

indias family law was written to discourage divorce and in that sense it has succeeded brilliantly the last census in showed that the number of indians who described themselves as separated was nearly three times the number who were divorced the countrys legal code offers a notably narrow selection of divorce worthy faults among them cruelty incurable leprosy and renunciation of the world by entering religious orders many applicants plead mental cruelty but defining mental cruelty is a murky affair often coming down to a judges discretion no uniform standard can ever be laid down for guidance declared a supreme court panel in adding unhelpfully that what is cruelty in one case may not amount to cruelty in another case here are some examples of the idiosyncratic ways judges used their discretion to support claims of cruelty forcing a husband to move out of his parents home in a hindu society it is a pious obligation of the son to maintain the parents if a wife makes an attempt to deviate from the normal practice and normal custom of the society she must have some justifiable reason for that the court found in our opinion normally no husband would tolerate this and no son would like to be separated from his old parents deriding a husband as a fat elephant the calling of names and hurling of abuses such as hathi mota hathi and mota elephant by the appellant in respect of her husband even if he was overweight is bound to strike at his self respect and self esteem the court found obviously the respondent was sensitive to such taunts and it is not the appellants case that the taunts were made jokingly or out of love and affection and without malice excessive interest in politics this case depicts the sordid episode of the life of a woman who spoiled her homely environment and family relationships running after the politics and politicians forgetting her solemn duties and responsibilities of a matrimonial life the court found she was cautioned and reminded of her pious obligations but she was mesmerized so much by the political thoughts and quite adamant that she failed to understand the consequence of her negligent attitude withholding of sex without a good excuse even assuming for a moment that the appellant wanted to have a child only after two years does not mean that the appellant and the respondent cannot and should not have sexual intercourse the court found admittedly both of them are well educated and there are so many contraceptives available and they could have used such contraceptives and avoided pregnancy
for magnus chasehotel valhalla guide to the norse worldsby rick riordanread by kieran hour minutes listening library tales of the peculiarby ransom riggsread by simon callow with bruce mann and garrick hours minutes listening library as time passes the relationship between adults and young people evolves the preboomer era image of befuddled parents trying to figure out whats going on in the minds of their offspring has given way to a kind of berempathy free from irony some adults now respect children as they themselves wish to be respected and give children what they actually want rather than force them to stomach what is put in front of them until they are old enough to decide for themselves this shift is evident in the world of literature for young audiences these days writing for children often takes on a brazen quality as if theres a cardinal rule that respect from the young reader is best earned by conjuring detailed landscapes of limitless imagination by not withholding writers like j r r tolkien the father of high fantasy fiction created entire languages and illustrated mythical lands with detailed maps and if tolkien is the father of high fantasy perhaps the beloved roald dahl is the master of the darkly comic dahls writing no less imaginative exhibits a keen knack for pushing the envelope past the comfort zone to a place young audiences find true delight in two new books and their unabridged audio recordings are steeped in both of these worlds they indicate we are in a time for young readers fiction thats perhaps our most unbridled and mischievous to date rick riordans guide to the norse worlds is inspired by norse mythology and is ostensibly the little book found somewhere in a room at the hotel valhalla a destination for those who are exploring the norse underworld and looking for quick thorough descriptions of everything in this complex universe in one handy volume it was assembled by the hotel manager helgi to ease the toil of having to answer irritating questions from patrons riordan maps out the extensive geography of the norse underworld and all its inhabitants as well as the ethnic nuances of those groups in a neatly categorized zagat guide sort of format he covers key characters of norse mythology and includes interviews with some in which they reveal their particular story a messy teenage snarkiness is laced throughout the book lots of farting and other normally questionable personal habits are a trademark as with riordans other best selling greek mythology inspired series norse mythology is underlined in tolkienesque anthropological detail but with a sassy youthful shrug there are details that might seem anachronistic as when this distant worlds inhabitants use modern colloquial expressions or velcro that helps keep the traditionally structured guidebook form off balance and quirky the actor kieran culkin gives his audio interpretation a nerdy textbook genre delivery that shows his affinity for riordans wry sense of teenage humor this could have been an even greater listening experience if hed inhabited the characters in the scenes outside the narration with more immersion and definition although the reading he gives is indeed charming tales of the peculiar is a selection of stories first introduced in ransom riggss best selling miss peregrines peculiar children series now also a tim burton feature film the tales are a wildly diverse sampling of narratives that take place all over the globe and share some version of that dahlesque daring and darker edge an edge that might have seemed too nightmarish or graphic for children in times past or for younger children today the stories tip a hat to grimm like fairy tales paranormal or fantastical events or powers are common a major premise of the stories as in the miss peregrine books is some strange ability or other that a character possess the ability to cure people of their nightmares to hold back the sea or to grow back severed limbs to name a few ultimately a crossroad is reached about the consequences of using that power or not using it there is a poetic timeless morality to these tales like classic fables but they all have a modern sensibility a mischievous darkness and an understanding of what it feels like to be young that can be moving and thought provoking the beloved british actor simon callow handles this ambitious unabridged audio performance with supreme confidence and the flair of a true storyteller his command of the many international dialects required is impressive and the listener will savor his mastery of them with delight though he skipped the chinese presumably to avoid offending which this reviewer respects greatly like his colleague reading the riordan book he might have also immersed himself in the actual characterizations of the non narration dialogue passages with more relish to make those personalities just a little more vivid but both actors succeed quite well in never overdoing it that is indeed no small task these books share authors with unbridled imaginations and a skill at focusing their tales with a strong point of view and a writing style aimed at delighting young readers today with so many attempts to engage the young imagination seeming base or paltry fiction remains perhaps the most imaginative and brain nurturing material for young people to enjoy and that is a noble achievement
congress should exercise greater scrutiny over trade and investment practices between the united states and china in order to prevent china from taking advantage of the economic relationship a congressional commission said in a report released on wednesday in its long list of recommendations the commission advised congress to authorize a government panel that reviews foreign takeover deals to bar chinese state owned companies from acquiring or gaining effective control of american companies it also said congress should ask a government watchdog agency to write a report on whether large scale outsourcing of manufacturing to china is leading to the hollowing out of the defense industrial base in addition the commission suggested ways in which congress could better bring antidumping cases against china each year the u s china economic and security review commission releases a report to congress with recommendations based on months of research the commission aims to make suggestions after examining trade investment and national security issues between the two nations its recommendations are not binding the report this year took a critical look at the free trade relationship between the united states and china for example implying that the countries are not competing on a level playing field it follows a populist airing of grievances over the downsides of free trade and a globalized economy in western nations this year that helped lead to the election last week of donald j trump as the next united states president and to the vote by britons in june to leave the european union china in its recent public statements has emphasized the tight economic ties between the two major trading partners and said the countries would benefit more from working together during his campaign mr trump said he would bring manufacturing jobs back to middle america and consider imposing a percent tariff on chinese exports as well as labeling china a currency manipulator some economists have said a trade war with china would harm the united states economy and lead to a recession in september after prodding from some lawmakers the government accountability office a watchdog agency said that it would examine whether reviews of foreign purchases should include a stricter look at more types of foreign investments and be broadened to define more industries as important to the nations economy the review process is done by the committee on foreign investment in the united states or cfius which approves most of the foreign purchases that it examines the report released on wednesday said it is that panel that congress should authorize to reject purchases by chinese state owned enterprises such companies are the main drivers of chinas economy the new report said congress should also create an office in the international trade administration to identify and bring antidumping and countervailing duty cases countervailing duties are imposed on goods to offset the fact that the goods may have been made with the help of subsidies besides trade and investment the report covers topics like security relations chinas global footprint and the united states rebalancing to asia in one section the authors criticize what they see as meager american government efforts to block intelligence collection by china the obama administration has expressed concern over what it sees as state sponsored hacking from china in recent years the u s government response to the threat from chinese intelligence collection has suffered from the lack of an integrated coordinated effort within the u s intelligence community the report said the u s governments efforts to counter chinese intelligence collection operations have manifested largely as a series of espionage prosecutions rather than a strategic whole of government response it added the obama administration has taken steps to improve cybersecurity among u s government agencies and defense contractors but these measures could mitigate not eliminate the significant cyberespionage threats to these organizations
washington hillary clinton held back tears on wednesday as she asked her supporters not to lose heart after a crushing election loss and to continue working for a better country i will admit coming here tonight wasnt the easiest thing for me mrs clinton said at a gala for the childrens defense fund where she worked as a young law student there have been a few times this past week when all i wanted to do is just to curl up with a good book or our dogs and never leave the house again in her first public remarks since conceding to president elect donald j trump last week mrs clinton told the crowd she was struggling to recover from an unexpected defeat that she said had left nonwhite children and vulnerable people across the nation afraid i believe the measure of any society is how we treat our children and as we move forward into a new and in many ways uncertain future that must be the test for america and ourselves mrs clinton said in a minute speech no child should be afraid to go to school because theyre latino or african american or muslim or because they have a disability introduced by marian wright edelman the groups president and founder as the peoples president and the first woman to win the popular vote mrs clinton who had accepted the groups invitation before the election said she had had to overcome deep sorrow to keep the commitment but she came bearing a message of resolve i know many of you are deeply disappointed about the results of the election i am too more than i can ever express she said i know this isnt easy i know that over the past week a lot of people have asked themselves whether america was the country we thought it was she implored her supporters though to believe in our country fight for our values and never give up mrs clinton has stayed out of the public eye since the day after the election but in a private call with donors over the weekend she cast blame for her loss on the announcement by james b comey the f b i director that he was reviving the inquiry into her use of a private email server as secretary of state she said that decision by thrusting the email controversy back into the news days before election day had halted her momentum in the crucial closing days of the race and prevented her from ending her campaign with an optimistic argument to voters a second letter from mr comey clearing her two days before the election compounded the harm to her chances mrs clinton told the donors feeding into a narrative that the contest was rigged and causing wavering voters including white suburban women to abandon her on wednesday though there was no talk of opportunities missed or messages muddled instead mrs clinton was regretful and the slightest bit defiant she said she wished she could go back in time and tell her mother abandoned at a young age not to despair look at me and listen mrs clinton said she would have told her mother her voice thick with emotion you will survive you will have a family of your own three children and as hard as it might be to imagine your daughter will grow up to be a united states senator represent our country as secretary of state and win more than million votes in her campaign for the presidency democrats stunned and dejected over last weeks electoral losses are struggling to rebuild their party re energize supporters and determine what lessons to draw from their defeat president obama told supporters in a call on monday afternoon that he expected to be a part of that debate starting in january when he leaves office but it is not clear what role if any mrs clinton plans to play the event on wednesday a beat the odds gala honoring at risk children who have found success was in some sense a capstone to mrs clintons life in national politics the same event in was the first public appearance she and her husband bill clinton made after he won the presidency
washington over the past month president vladimir v putin of russia has received two starkly different messages about hacking into american computer networks from the current and future presidents of the united states dont you dare and dont worry were not even sure it was you the white house confirmed in a statement on wednesday that eight days before the presidential election the united states contacted the russian government directly regarding malicious cyberactivity that was targeting u s state election related systems it sent the message over a rarely used system a hotline connecting the nuclear risk reduction centers in both countries which they had agreed three years ago could also be employed to deal with major cyberincidents the pre election warning only the latest after verbal cautions by president obama his defense secretary and the director of national intelligence was reported by the washington post the warnings to russia against further hacking into polling or registration systems or any further effort to affect the outcome of the election are being hailed by the obama administration as a success in deterrence after all they argue a year and a half of russian hacking activity seemed to slow or halt and there is no evidence that voting or counting of ballots was disrupted on election day but more than a few experts in deterring cyberattacks take a more skeptical view they say the russians had already achieved their main goal to demonstrate how they could disrupt the american electoral process with the leak of hacked emails including from the democratic national committee and hillary clintons campaign chairman john d podesta mr putin suffered nothing worse than a warning they note no sanctions no counter cyberstrikes no embarrassing revelations engineered by the united states and he now has the satisfaction of dealing with president elect donald j trump who during the campaign praised him promised to build a more productive relationship with russia and maintained there was no evidence that the russians were behind the hacking anytime anything wrong happens they like to blame the russians mr trump said in an oct debate with mrs clinton she doesnt know if its the russians doing the hacking maybe there is no hacking mr trump contended that the allegations of russian activity were intended to tarnish me for advocating a new relationship with moscow he frequently repeated similar sentiments in the last weeks of the campaign suggesting the hacking was a fabrication the leaks of emails worked largely to his advantage embarrassing democratic leaders like representative debbie wasserman schultz of florida who was forced to resign as the chairwoman of the democratic national committee mr trumps larger strategic message is that the united states and russia need to cooperate on a range of issues but for now the situation underscores the uncertainty around the world about the direction of american foreign policy and gives mr putin the opportunity to exploit differences between the current president and his successor until mr trump is inaugurated on jan it is also raising the question of whether the obama white house pushed back hard enough when american intelligence agencies concluded on oct that only russias senior most officials could have authorized these activities james a lewis a computer expert at the center for strategic and international studies in washington dismissed the administrations claim that it had deterred russias hacking it seems a little bold to claim this is a success for deterrence since the russians werent deterred from doing anything he said their hacking work was mostly complete the issue now is whether they will be deterred in the future and the guessing is they will not strong private warnings arent enough to constitute deterrence in fact the russians appear to have paid less of a price for their hacking around the election than north korea did for its attack on sony pictures entertainment in that attack melted down about percent of sonys computers and servers at its studios wreaking considerable damage and embarrassed many sony executives it was in response to the release of a movie the interview that imagined a c i a plot to kill kim jong un the north korean leader after the sony episode the united states issued more sanctions against north korea and encouraged china to limit the norths internet access all of which runs through chinese switching centers many experts had expected the white house to follow a similar path with russia instead the white house concluded that the warnings and the unstated suggestion that the united states had the power to reach inside russian networks and see the origin of attacks might suffice it is not clear if the administration plans any other actions against russia before mr obamas departure from office but that seems less and less likely the oct warning did not deal with the hacking of the democratic national committee or mr podestas account which james r clapper jr the director of national intelligence had previously said was conducted with the knowledge of the russian leadership instead it referred only to the concerns about hacking around the election process itself and the fear it was originating from russian territory though it stopped short of saying it was a state sponsored attack

posted about the black lives matter movement to his more than twitter followers and recently joined other wisconsin athletes in demanding university action after a fan appeared in a mask of president obama and a noose at a badgers home football game hill a redshirt junior also writes provocatively on twitter and in september wisconsins starting point guard the senior bronson koenig traveled to support protesters of the dakota access pipeline many of whom are like him native american on the eve of the presidential election the three teammates sat in the locker room at kohl center in madison wis after practice and discussed the challenges and opportunities of being athletes particularly college athletes who want their voices heard the interview has been edited for length and clarity are you ever afraid to speak out knowing that you are not yet paid and could hurt your prospects hayes ive had people tell me hey nige you need to stop be quiet stop voicing your opinion it may hurt your draft stock next year teams may not want you but at the end of the day the quote i hang my hat on is i was black before i picked up a basketball and when i retire ill still be black ill be black more of my life than ill be a professional basketball player it does not make sense for me not to say something at the point of my life when i can have the most impact im playing basketball and more of you are listening which is why more of you are pissed and telling me to stop so why would i not use this time to try to voice an opinion and bring about the most change hill its definitely a struggle it would be stupid for me to say that i dont want to buy my mom a house a car want to make money doing what i love to do and travel and see the world at the same time im not going to feel good about myself with the knowledge that ive gained just holding my tongue koenig thats kind of selfish hill superselfish koenig i dont know why more people with the high profiles that they have dont speak up i dont understand it i get why they dont but as he was saying its selfish you probably did not get into basketball to have more of a voice what is it like discovering you have yours amplified koenig i think its weird that in the united states athletes have as big of a platform as they do we dont really do anything that important were playing a sport its odd to me that people want to hear what we have to say and care what we have to say whether they agree with us or not but im thankful for the platform that i have the position youre in as an athlete youre kind of a role model whether you want to be or not you have that voice you have the right to choose whatever you want to do with it colin kaepernick really put himself out there hayes what hes standing up for is obviously the right thing his stance is that racial inequalities go on particularly that occur with black people you have a group of people that get upset about it or a group of people that think hes stretching the truth or that racism isnt as prevalent as it is and then you take a glance at twitter you see people calling him the n word or saying go back to africa or i hope you tear your a c l do you think he has less credibility with the general public because he is an athlete hill that would be the first inclination of people but at the same time he got up there and said what he said and was very very eloquent and he knows stuff to back it up i dont know if you know all the stuff hes still doing now hes having camps to help kids understand their rights they want you to come talk to their kids and come do this and help here and all that as long as youre doing exactly what they want you to do which is tell them to work hard and tell them to stay in school and so on not that those are bad things but for you just to be boxed in to all right just say this but dont say anything on the issues that are actually plaguing the nation and even more at that level i respect it so much because hes risking money there are people who im sure disagree with him who may have sponsored him or planned on sponsoring him thats serious thats his livelihood koenig you never know whats going on in his life behind the scenes the people in his corner even might be like no dont say that because youre going to lose money sponsorships whatever its unfortunate that we have a voice that people want to hear what we have to say but when its something they dont agree with were just dumb athletes madison has a reputation for being very liberal it is also id imagine whiter than the average place hayes by far do you feel it is

social media has been in the glare since the election for its perceived harmful qualities such as the spreading of hate speech and the false information but the effect of social media on world affairs is much larger than just misinformation and mean tweets farhad manjoo writes in his new state of the art column he argues that social media now collectively used by billions of people worldwide through services like facebook snapchat twitter wechat and weibo has grown to a point where it is increasingly influencing the course of global events the election of donald j trump who used twitter to magnify his message is evidence of that shift farhad writes so was the rise of bernie sanders whose liberal philosophy and policies were also spread by social media and there are many other examples such as brexit and the momentum behind isis of events and movements most likely enabled by social media now each person with once maligned views can see that hes not alone farhad writes and when these people find one another they can get things done create memes publications and entire online worlds that bolster their worldview and then break into the mainstream social media is also in the spotlight for a different reason these days the kind involving big dollar signs that comes in the form of snap the parent company of the social media service snapchat which has filed confidentially for an initial public offering michael j de la merced and katie benner write snaps i p o which is likely to take place early next year is set to be the biggest tech offering since that of the chinese e commerce company alibaba in it presages a wave of other possible public offerings from highly valued tech start ups such as airbnb and uber time to mark your calendars
what are the economic benefits and drawbacks of global trade who are the winners and losers in this story of economic change these are the questions students will consider as they learn why trade became such an important issue in the election as part of the lesson they will also consider the implications of president elect donald j trumps related campaign promises background global trade was one of the core issues mr trump returned to over and over during his presidential campaign in the end the states that effectively handed mr trump his election day victory were the rust belt states of pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin states that were predicted to vote for hillary clinton yet have been hard hit by an exodus of well paying manufacturing jobs why has mr trumps message that our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization moving our jobs our wealth and our factories to mexico and overseas resonated with so many voters why has he condemned the north american free trade agreement as the worst trade deal in history and declared that chinas entrance into the world trade organization has enabled the greatest jobs theft in history the lesson begins by having students investigate where their possessions are manufactured then they use a times video and article to help them better understand the complex consequences of increased trade further down we offer opportunities for debate and argument writing analyzing the effects of global trade abroad and doing additional research warm up what countries make the products we buy this activity can be started for homework the night before or completed entirely during class then using a computer or their phones students should find out the minimum wage and the g d p per capita of three or more countries that produced the highest number of goods for the class or their small group they should find the same information for the united states assuming the u s is not included in their list already be sure students understand what these economic terms mean after they have gathered this data students should consider any trends they notice about the countries that produce most of the goods they and their classmates identified how do wages and economic activity in these countries compare to the same categories for the united states all of this information can be recorded using this handout video the iphone economy to better understand how global trade works and the consequences of it students should watch this times video here are questions for writing and discussion how is the iphone a product of global trade how has the u s economy lost some higher wage jobs as well as a job multiplier as manufacturing has moved abroad how does comparing the united states largest employers today with those in tell a story about how the american economy has changed over the past years how does apple fit into this story what groups are the winners and losers in the american economy today according to the video why are our economic problems so hard to solve an article to read annotate and discuss more wealth more jobs but not for everyone what fuels the backlash on trade next students should read and annotate peter s goodmans in depth article more wealth more jobs but not for everyone what fuels the backlash on trade heres an excerpt from the article so you can quickly assess its reading level and get to the heart of its argument below are questions for writing and discussion the article states for generations libraries full of economics textbooks have rightly promised that global trade expands national wealth by lowering the price of goods lifting wages and amplifying growth what went wrong why was global trade such an important issue in the election for many voters the article states successive administrations in the united states led by democrats and republicans alike have embraced liberalized trade as a central component of the nations foreign policy yet only percent of american voters said trade with other countries created more jobs in the united states according to a new york times cbs news poll released in july why is there a disconnect between government trade policy by both democrats and republicans and what american voters think the consequences of increasing global trade for american workers and the american economy are complex who are the winners who are the losers and how are some groups both winners and losers the article states american factories produced more goods last year than ever by many indications yet they did so while employing about million workers roughly the same number as in when production was roughly three fourths what it is today how can this be that american factories are producing more than ever before but while employing fewer workers what is nafta what is the w t o explain how each has affected american workers and the american economy douglas a irwin an economist at dartmouth college stated we have a public policy toward trade we dont have a public policy on automation what point is he making and why is it relevant to this discussion what kind of safety net do government programs provide for workers displaced by increased global trade how does this safety net fall short in the united states activity debate discussion or argument writing is increasing global trade a force for positive or negative change or both and should the united states pursue more free trade agreements or trade protectionism as the best solution to the negative consequences of globalization after watching the video and reading the article students have enough information to support both sides in an evidence based discussion debate or argument writing piece they can also suggest policy proposals for supporting workers or businesses hurt by the changing economy for example is there anything government policy can do to raise wages and working conditions for service workers now that many manufacturing jobs have disappeared if you want

as negotiators meet in morocco to hammer out details of the landmark global climate change accord reached in paris almost a year ago the independent international energy agency warned that the nearly nation deal was too weak to meet its avowed temperature target the i e a s annual world energy outlook stated that reaching the paris targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was possible and that meeting those targets would slow climate change yet the agencys estimates also showed that the result of those reductions was not likely to keep the temperature increase beyond preindustrial levels well below degrees celsius as hoped instead the reports authors estimated meeting the national commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions would still allow temperatures to rise degrees celsius by meeting the most ambitious temperature goal discussed at the conference would be next to impossible the report stated the transformation required for a reasonable chance of remaining within the temperature goal of degrees celsius is stark a shifting mix of energy sources that favors renewable energy and more efficient energy use are putting those targets within reach the annual report of the international energy agency based in paris noted that renewable energy was booming with more capacity added in than for coal oil and nuclear power combined still fossil fuels will have a substantial role to play in the global energy mix for many years to come especially natural gas which is rapidly displacing coal the era of fossil fuels is far from being over even if the paris pledges are fully implemented said fatih birol executive director of the agency today he said the share of fossil fuels in the global energy mix is about percent if paris goals are met the share will drop only to percent by this is in part because even though renewable energy sources are finding their way into electricity generation oil is still an important source of power for transportation and petrochemical production still there are winners and losers within fossil fuels dr birol said the biggest winner worldwide in the groups projections is natural gas and the biggest loser is coal china the worlds largest coal producer and user has been pulling back and appears to have reached the peak of its coal use in dr birol declined to discuss the effect on the groups projections of the election of donald j trump who has called climate change a hoax and pledged to abandon the paris deal and to promote a revival of coal we are a technical organization dr birol said governments come and go around the world and this is a perfectly normal thing he said the group would be watching the actual policies and actions that emerge from the trump administration since these changes may have global implications once the policies do emerge we will include them in future reports dr birol said the report predicted that by percent of the new energy generated to meet global demand would come from natural gas and renewable sources like solar and wind power a push to use energy more efficiently is expected to help in the fight against climate change dr birol said citing predictions that world energy use is expected to rise more slowly than in the past even in the face of continued economic growth tim buckley an analyst with the institute for energy economics and financial analysis a progressive research organization based in cleveland said that the decline of coal and the explosion in low cost renewable energy provided a simple lesson those who exit fossil fuels and embrace solar and wind will reap financial rewards and avoid stranded assets stranded assets is a term applied to fossil fuel reserves such as oil coal and natural gas that are still in the ground in many scenarios of addressing climate change companies would not be able to exploit their reserves oil companies like exxon mobil have disputed the issue the new report states that unless governments work hard to address the issue for a smooth and orderly transition away from fossil fuels there is a risk that major losses will be incurred
washington congressional republicans are settling in for what they hope is a long run in the majority but president elect donald j trump doesnt want them to get too comfortable were going to put on term limits which a lot of people arent happy about but were putting on term limits mr trump said in an interview with minutes that aired on sunday were doing a lot of things to clean up the system if one thing could put mr trump on a collision course with his new allies on capitol hill it is his embrace of proposals such as term limits and tougher restrictions on allowing lawmakers and top aides to become lobbyists in the lucrative world of washington influence peddling members of congress like to talk about returning power to the people but many would prefer not to vote to limit their own tenure or future employment opportunities bringing up term limits is seen by some as raining on their postelection parade senator mitch mcconnell republican of kentucky and the majority leader made that quite clear last week when he said the senate outlook for term limits was severely limited i would say we have term limits now mr mcconnell told reporters theyre called elections and it will not be on the agenda in the senate still mr trumps highlighting of his call for term limits it is no on his list of priorities to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in washington d c revives an initiative that has been dormant in washington for years after republicans rode it to the house takeover in but then failed to make it happen mr trump found a surprising kindred spirit on term limits on monday when president obama seemed to endorse the concept i think we want to see new voices and new ideas emerge mr obama said at a news conference thats part of the reason why i think term limits are a really useful thing aides said later that mr obama might have been referring more to the limit on presidential tenure and his view that george washington set the right precedent by leaving after two terms but his words could certainly be extended to congress proponents of term limits say mr trumps position has put new energy behind the campaign to adopt a constitutional amendment restricting house members to three two year terms and senators to two six year terms the other part of the pressure is going to come from the public said nick tomboulides the executive director of the group u s term limits when they know term limits is an issue on the table they will make it very difficult for congress to ignore i think congress is going to be forced to vote on it term limits have always been popular with voters and got a surge of momentum in the throw the bums out political atmosphere of the early leading multiple states to adopt them for their legislatures through ballot initiatives and other means as part of the contract with america in republicans led by representative newt gingrich of georgia promised the citizen legislature act and a first ever vote on term limits to replace career politicians with citizen legislators the mantra helped them topple speaker thomas s foley of washington a staunch opponent of term limits via a challenger george nethercutt who promised to serve just six years that term limits vote did come in march and won a majority but fell more than votes short of the two thirds majority necessary to advance a constitutional amendment forty republicans many of them committee and subcommittee chairmen joined democratic opponents in defeating the proposal the amendment again fell short a year later opponents argued then and argue now that arbitrary term limits would rob congress of the institutional knowledge and expertise needed to conduct business and that voters had regular opportunities to end the service of their lawmakers they dont talk about how gerrymandering and the advantages of incumbency make it hard to defeat sitting lawmakers whether the proposal can go anywhere this year will depend on how serious mr trump and his advisers are about pushing it against the wishes of congressional leaders or whether it was just part of his message to stir up frustrated voters at this point it is impossible to say but it was a primary element of his call to drain the swamp that appeared to resonate with the public and term limits are just one issue conservatives also are raising the alarm about a move by house republicans to restore congressional earmarks special home state spending as long as they are directed to a government agency rather than a private interest a source of corruption in the past some lawmakers have argued that restoring the ability of individual lawmakers to earmark money would make it easier to pass spending bills but critics are moving quickly to quash any effort to bring them back with the earmark proposal on the verge of being adopted by republicans on wednesday speaker paul d ryan called off the vote fearing it would send a bad signal so soon after the election he promised a review of the idea and a vote early next year like other self professed outsiders before him mr trump will discover that draining the swamp is much easier said than done
there were shouts and moans and finger snaps at a weekend performance of party people at the public theater tears and laughter joined together so did sympathy and rage commissioned by the oregon shakespeare festival for its american revolutions cycle developed by the director liesl tommy and written by the spoken word collective universes this semidocumentary work is a disjointed exploration of two radical groups the black panther party and the young lords party in the current political climate it may be the most frightening and exciting piece of theater now up party people begins as a young african american man in a beret malik who also uses the name mk ultra bluffs a tough speech for a camera hes a contemporary artist riffing on the macho bravado of the panthers an organization to which his father now serving a life sentence once belonged malik and his latino friend jimmy whose alter ego is a clown provocateur named primo have conducted numerous interviews with former party members and spliced them into a video those members will soon gather at a gallery to watch it once the former revolutionaries assemble the evening segues into reminiscences interspersed with musical numbers and occasional goading from primo who sports an acid house court jester ensemble there are tributes and apologies rants and infighting and a mildly bizarre self reflexive section in which a character sits down next to a spectator and says i dont know how i feel about anything i saw tonight i liked some of it i hated some of it party people written by the spouses steven sapp and mildred ruiz sapp and by mr ruiz derives its language vibrant and volatile from actual interviews yet the storytelling is less than cohesive like most parties political or festive this piece has a slow beginning a terrific middle and an ambiguous ending conflicting impulses shift party people toward drama at some moments toward history lesson at others toward agitprop occasionally it is too long too unfocused and perhaps too democratic with nearly every character receiving his or her spoken word aria yet in a room full of people distraught and enraged by the election of donald j trump to the presidency party people felt heartbreakingly timely and intensely necessary many in the audience had visceral responses to the piece which asked them to confront a century history of civil disobedience and to then contemplate what resistance they might offer in the seen one way the two parties here failed the work of the panthers did not end police brutality or obviate the need for black lives matter the efforts of the young lords did not give puerto rico self determination the collectives disbanded berets went out of style but viewed another way these groups demonstrated that small bands of citizens using a variety of methods some troubling could have a striking impact on politics and culture they could get garbage collected and children fed and sick people treated they could make young men and women feel pride and power in their ethnicity and inheritance achievements malik and jimmy admire they were working so hard at such a young age makes me feel so inadequate jimmy says makes me wonder what i would be doing if i were alive back then malik says or what he might do now
the house of representatives voted overwhelmingly on tuesday for legislation to extend american sanctions on iran for years a move that proponents called critical economic leverage to ensure iranian compliance with an international nuclear agreement the legislation known as the iran sanctions extension act needs senate approval and president obamas signature before the end of the year when american sanctions are set to expire under the nuclear agreement which took effect in january between iran and six world powers including the united states many economic sanctions were suspended or relaxed in exchange for irans verifiable pledges of peaceful nuclear work but the deal also contained a snapback provision that would allow for the reimposition of sanctions if iran were found to have violated the terms the legislation approved by the house on tuesday would also extend longstanding american sanctions against iran that predate the dispute over that countrys nuclear activities iran has increasingly complained about these non nuclear sanctions particularly the prohibition on iranian access to the american financial system and use of the dollar the iranians say such restrictions have discouraged many foreign companies from investing in iran subverting the economic rewards it expected from the nuclear agreement republicans and many democrats opposed the agreement asserting that iran was untrustworthy and had gained too many concessions during the negotiations president elect donald j trump said during his campaign that he would renegotiate the accord or renounce it in a march speech to the american israel public affairs committee the most powerful pro israel lobby group in washington he said his top priority was to dismantle the disastrous deal with iran whether he will follow through on that pledge remains unclear the other countries that agreed to the deal with iran britain china france germany and russia have said they intend to honor it president franois hollande of france said on tuesday that he did not believe mr trump would scrap the agreement telling the france television channel that the absence of an accord would be very serious iranian leaders reacting to mr trumps victory have also asserted that he will not be able to undo the agreement president hassan rouhani of iran told his cabinet ministers the day after the american election that the agreement cannot be overturned by one governments decision according to the official islamic republic news agency on monday national security experts including former officials of republican and democratic administrations exhorted mr trump not only to accept the nuclear agreement but to use it as a way to ease tensions with iran on other longstanding problems

a federal program meant to encourage investment in the united states from wealthy foreigners is increasingly supporting large luxury real estate projects not the development in the rural and downtrodden districts that some say were the original targets of the program with billions of dollars flowing in mostly from wealthy chinese the program faces an uncertain future in september congress reset the expiration date on parts of the so called eb program to dec the program grants permanent residency in the united states to those who are willing to immigrate and invest in a business that creates at least jobs many of the projects that have received money have been in real estate though investments have also gone to charter schools medical centers and manufacturing plants some billion of investments have been made through the program since according to the eb coalition an industry group in washington critics have derided the program as essentially a legal way for immigrants to buy their way into the country donald j trumps election adds a new wrinkle he campaigned heavily on immigration reform pledging to build a wall on the mexican border and increase the deportation of criminal noncitizens he also said he wanted to reduce legal immigration and ensure jobs are offered to americans first whether president elect trump will actually follow through on these pledges remains to be seen said stephen w yale loehr a law professor at cornell university and an immigration lawyer it is always difficult for congress to enact significant immigration changes because immigration is so complex and controversial the united states is not alone in offering residence for investment germany australia and canada have versions of the program as do several small countries competition among caribbean nations is rising for their citizenship by investment programs with st lucia being the most recent to revamp its program foreign interest is growing according to an analysis by professors at new york university investments in the program are increasingly financing large scale luxury or entertainment oriented real estate developments among them nearly billion gathered in the last year from investors to build a chinese style casino in las vegas million from investors for new yorks mixed use hudson yards project and million from investors to construct the beverly hills waldorf astoria the program was intended to reward people for putting money into the united states projects that raised more than billion were practically nonexistent in the program before prof jeanne calderon of new york universitys stern school of business wrote in a march report on the program but when banks turned off the credit spigot around the financial crisis developers started getting more creative in finding alternative financing n y u tracks projects across the united states that have raised more than billion from foreign investors many of these projects are run by large commercial developers who could proceed without any foreign investment but are reaching out to foreign investors for cheaper financing than they would receive from banks reformers from both political parties are calling for a much tighter definition of the areas eligible for investment through the program to remove the tracts in prosperous urban areas and get money to underserved ones they are also looking at raising the investment minimum to in addition they hope to make the projects more accountable by requiring better disclosures to protect potentially vulnerable immigrants from fraudulent schemes federal securities regulators have filed several enforcement actions against people committing fraud through the program in recent years the issue has friends and foes on either side of the political aisle senators from rural parts of the country want more development dollars coming to their districts while those from large cities want to maintain the status quo as for the immigrants themselves they are entering the program mostly in an effort to gain permanent residency in the united states which gives project developers more power like so many things there are a lot of people who are adversely affected but only by a little and there are a very small group of developers who benefit they win said david north a fellow at the center for immigration studies in washington the beverly hills waldorf astoria is being developed by beny alagem an israeli born american entrepreneur who also owns the beverly hilton it has nine acres and stories and includes a hotel and a residential condominium tower three hundred investors contributed million to the project in the form of a loan it is estimated to create jobs the wanda group which is the largest commercial developer in china and is owned by the nations richest man is said to be seeking foreign investment program financing for its wanda vista hotel in chicago the city approved the project last november the wanda group is also developing one beverly hills hotel next to the new waldorf in that city the genting group a global development conglomerate based in malaysia is developing resorts world las vegas with nearly billion of program money the billion project includes rooms and square feet of gambling space restaurants shops a panda habitat and a seat theater jeffrey berkowitz is developing skyrise miami a square foot multipurpose entertainment complex and observation tower along biscayne bay that will be the citys highest building when completed foreign program investors are

in the music business when you disappear for a long stretch of time you abandon your right to grouse about how things have changed in your absence nostalgia is a cheap crutch and a lame weapon when the whole world is changing though disappearing and then re emerging in different circumstances can be more deeply destabilizing the things you held dear might be missing or under attack adjusting is a full time job last week the members of a tribe called quest one of the essential groups of the came back after nearly two decades into a hip hop world that had iterated a dozen or more times they didnt flinch and they returned in a moment when americas racial tensions were at an outrageous level they stepped into action its been years since a tribe called quest released an album enough time for eight years of george w bush and almost eight years of barack obama for lil wayne and kendrick lamar sept and black lives matter drake and young thug the rise of streaming and the fall of the record store in its day the group was at the vanguard of hip hops progressive wing an exquisite balance of philosophical and attitudinal melodic inventiveness and subwoofer thump its internal politics were sometimes rancorous though which meant that last years reunion was a pleasant surprise the members were recording the often stunning new album we got it from here thank you your service when phife dawg one of the groups rappers died in march the record reckons with shifting sands both internal and external personal and political but strikingly not musical the groups commitment to its history and sonic signatures is intact and impressive and rewarding in truth its hard to tell if the version of a tribe called quest captured on this album the core members q tip phife and ali shaheed muhammad the sometime member jarobi white here back on equal footing and the longtime associates de facto affiliates consequence and busta rhymes is even paying much mind to the surrounding music world the musicians giddiness at working together at being in the same room is palpable they trade lines with a bubbly verve the sort of eager overlap that comes from working in close quarters with old friends it all makes for an album that interweaves social and political truth telling with extreme personal joy all under a cloud of heartache the range of grief and grievance q tip spans on this album is dizzying his voice is still piercingly nasal his lyrics full of tightly condensed abstractions used to see the tv screen as the place to land my dream in on songs like kids and ego he raps with wisdom earned over years while still acknowledging the knuckleheaded power of the version of himself that once was young q tips production on the album manages to thicken the groups traditional sumptuous warmth for the modern ear its old sound amplified not rebuilt without tinkering too intensely with the old component parts a therapeutic low end stinging drums unlikely samples a rich understanding of how genres bleed into one another phife was as sharp as ever here full of his slick sports metaphors and also serious about structural social inequality as on whateva will be a cavalcade of guests show up to pay respect andr delivers a characteristically mercurial verse on kids elton john plays relaxed piano on the strolling solid wall of sound jack white peels off a caustic guitar solo at the end of lost somebody kendrick lamar delivers angry grit on conrad tokyo and kanye west bellows a hook on the killing season and the verses from jarobi white long the groups lost member suggest a great hip hop career that never was on the killing season hes scathing invoking and updating strange fruit these fruitful trees are rooted in bloody soil and torment things havent really changed or theyre dormant for the moment while this reunion cum tribute album was born of personal need it ends up rising to meet a social and political moment it couldnt have wholly anticipated on saturday night the group was the musical guest on saturday night live for the first episode after the contentious election dave chappelle was the host and the episode tried hard to grapple with the countrys new political uncertainty the group performed we the people and the space program two of the more bluntly political songs on the new album at the end of the space program the group was joined onstage by consequence and busta rhymes all of them chanted lets make something happen then gathered for a deep embrace heads down that gesture was a security blanket and a balm a healing of a still fresh wound and a model for gathering love in the face of unpredictable trauma
from the start the central enigma was donald j trump how did this loose lipped celebrity tycoon with no political experience get so far who were the americans supporting him and why when i started my unusual assignment of covering the american presidential campaign from the perspective of a foreign correspondent for this an american news organization one of the first things i did was to invite questions from international readers the bulk of them revolved around mr trump whose unorthodox romp through the republican primaries propelled him to the partys nomination and ultimately to the presidency going back through my monthslong journey across america there were many clues to mr trumps rising tide although not all were easy to read i drank with trump supporters in bars and casinos i approached them at rodeos i chatted with them at gun clubs and diners and roaring political rallies the broad topography of trump country is in many respects easy to trace it is a place of anger and frustration gripped by a feverish anti establishment sentiment people wanted change and a chance to raise a throbbing finger to the forces they blame for their lot in life yet other factors were at play too in this unruly insurgency factors that sometimes made it hard to see clearly racism xenophobia bigotry talk radio social media bubbles and a simmering culture war separating thriving coastal areas and the wounded interior of the country it wasnt always clear which elements were powering the trump train as the movement called itself and which were being buoyed along one of my first stops was williamson a decimated coal town in west virginia it had a sports bar which offered beer for on thursdays and a biker bar where it was said patrons sometimes squealed tires inside until the room filled with smoke both were filled with trump voters little surprise since he had promised to reopen coal mines shuttered by the obama administrations environmental regulations and cheap natural gas in williamson i also saw how mr trumps message about change was overshadowing other issues that many analysts thought would have disqualified him from winning over the social conservatives who have long been a core republican constituency in conversations after church on sunday many christians glossed over the candidates three marriages and boasts of his battle with sexually transmitted disease it was hard to square but perhaps that was the lesson that a mysterious alchemy was at work in this election one in which outrageous rule breaking might offer a route to success around that time apple released its seventh iteration of the iphone that glossy black totem of progress inscribed on the back of every iphone are the words designed in california assembled in china as if california is a separate country and thats how many in trump country saw it that instead of being part of the iphone economy they were living in a land that sent jobs overseas one thing that i like many europeans and other foreigners had long seen as distinguishing the united states was its restless optimism and innate self belief mr trump though traded on pessimism his slogan make america great again embodied a nativist vision that aimed to restore pride in the countrys military and business but also scapegoated immigrants minorities and muslims at mr trumps rallies most of the faces in the crowd were white people flew confederate flags they spoke impatiently about the blacks broad brush prejudice toward muslims was openly expressed danny popma a factory owner in michigan told me that children in dearborn which has the countrys largest percentage of muslims had stayed home from school in droves on sept because they had secretly received advanced warnings of the attacks the atmosphere at trump rallies was permissive if someone said something offensive or loutish there was little fear of being hushed or contradicted yet in another confounding twist a significant minority of trump supporters were minorities themselves i met people who defied neat categorization a black woman in her who worked at a record label in miami a japanese uber driver in las vegas a guyanese doorman in queens n y at a rally in the campaigns final week in michigan a rust belt state that would prove central to mr trumps victory i saw how the candidate connected with crowd when he spoke it was if he held an invisible tuning fork held to his ear listening for the smallest murmur of applause which he would seize upon and amplify it reminded me of powerful preachers and populist politicians id seen during my years based in pakistan what was hard to know was how far the electric energy inside this hall was radiating maybe these were just the hard core loyalists state by state polls suggested that mr trump was behind in many places critical to electoral college victory political professionals including republicans dismissed the notion that mr trump could win mainly by consolidating the support of white voters its like the hunt for the lost tribes of the amazon was how stuart stevens a consultant who had worked for the republican nominee mitt romney put it early on if you paddle your canoe far enough up the river and bang your drum hard enough they will come to the riverbank but theyre just not there but when i mentioned the polls showing mr trump lagging to his supporters they snorted derisively everyone they knew was voting trump colleagues relatives children some were former democrats others were people who hadnt voted for decades the polls they said were either asking the wrong questions or were being manipulated by the news media the polls themselves were part of the system these people were trying to overthrow at the time i discounted the conspiratorial talk as a product of the facebook echo chamber that became so powerful in this election but in broad terms the trump supporters were right in key states their votes were
when victoria woodhull ran for president of the united states she couldnt even vote for herself if the women can be allowed to vote the new york herald claimed when woodhull announced her bid in mrs woodhull may rely on rolling up the heaviest majority ever polled in this or any other nation after all the paper said women always take the part of each other the herald called for passage of a womens suffrage amendment and then victory for victoria in that was before the sex scandal hit woodhull was a divorced woman and sexual history was already a point of controversy but soon the papers dredged up a truly salacious item she once shared her home with both her first and second husbands woodhull defended herself in the press she explained that her family had taken in her alcoholic disabled ex husband as an act of charity not bigamy but the headlines branded her disgraced and called her career busted woodhull was evicted from her home and forced to withdraw her year old daughter from school the cartoonist thomas nast literally drew her as the devil and the conventional wisdom that women would always support each other turned on its head the suffragist support that had boosted woodhulls candidacy fractured a columnist for the cincinnati commercial wrote that while under certain circumstances men may vote for a candidate who is somewhat less than immaculate a female candidate must present as a paragon of propriety if she hoped to secure the feminine vote of the country in support of her political ambition in the theory that women would vote together in the interest of their gender soared and crashed once again this was supposed to be the election where women formed a coalition to block the man who boasted of groping them who has been accused of sexual assault by more than a dozen women who said women who have abortions deserved to be punished who said women facing sexual harassment at work should find another career who implied that a female journalist was on her period when he didnt like her question who said his female opponent didnt look presidential it was supposed to be the election in which women rejected the candidate who hates women in favor of the candidate who is one instead although hillary clinton won women last week cnn exit polls showed that percent of women voted for her she also lost women the womens vote was drawn and quartered by race education geography and marriage percent of black women voted for clinton while percent of white women voted for donald j trump percent of married women voted for him percent of white women who didnt attend college did too over all initial polls suggest that female voters were slightly less likely to vote for the democrat than they were in and the most offensive thing mitt romney ever said about women was that he had consulted binders full of their rsums in order to hire them to his staff the idea of a womens vote is both a lofty american dream and an ugly little myth its been in circulation before women could legally cast a ballot in a proponent of womens suffrage argued in the new york times that women display more of the virtues of good citizens forethought temperance industry and self restraint than men do and in susan b anthony claimed that when women earned the right to vote theyd collectively seize the moral high ground female voters propose to do away with vice and immorality to prevent the social evil sex work by giving women remunerative employment to forbid the sale of spiritous liquors and tobacco and to teach men a higher and nobler life than the one they now follow she said one man at a new york parlor meeting in said he supported womens suffrage only because he knew it would not challenge the status quo if there was danger that women might overthrow anything good he said there might be a reason to prevent their voting last week on election day female clinton supporters traveled to the new york cemetery where susan b anthony is buried they wore yellow roses and affixed their i voted stickers to her tombstone in an act of feminist tribute but the suffragists who fought for a womans right to vote were invested in enfranchising a particular kind of woman their pitch for womens political consciousness was rooted not in the collective experience of american womanhood but in an image of white feminine virtue many white suffragists pointedly ignored the women of color in the movement rosalie jones a white socialite turned suffragist gave herself the title of general and led an army of women from new york to washington in when a group of southern men confronted her to ask if she favored suffrage for black women she hedged telling them that the states must solve their own problems and when a group of black women tried to join her march in maryland she refused to acknowledge their existence they took up the back of the line for a few hundred feet before falling away in a white woman at a meeting of the brooklyn woman suffrage association complained that new york had become asylum for the trash of all nations and argued that womens suffrage ought to be carefully restricted to keep undesirable women out of the ballot box think what it means to give it to all women she said our criminal and pauper men have wives there are thousands of female operatives in tobacco factories and similar fields of labor there are probably two million negro women in this country who are but little uplifted above the plane of animals here was a woman who was denied one of her countrys most basic rights and yet she was content to argue that she should get the vote only once it was safely denied to most other women
this election year has often felt like one enormous swarm of poll numbers vote forecasts and nonstop statistical analysis and post election coverage has provided little relief how key was the working class vote to donald j trumps success did young voters shy away from hillary clinton what about hispanic voters all this number crunching led the two of us a videographer and a polling editor to wonder what might be missed when we try to explain entire groups as being pro trump or pro clinton if we write that rural voters were especially likely to back mr trump are there assumptions that we might be reinforcing but that actually dont hold true for many rural dwellers if we say that millennial voters were unlikely to support him are we getting the full picture the video above is our attempt to unpack just a few of these broad stroke terms we hope it will serve as an invitation to keep digging and to look at the headlines we see reporting exit poll statistics as only telling part of the story
arthur brooks hi gail so just when we thought that couldnt get any more shocking it did with a trump victory i told you last week that strange happenings were afoot in the universe what with the cubs winning the world series and all i hear that new yorkers are taking it pretty hard are people stocking up on canned goods gail collins greetings from the land of duck and cover arthur not sure its quite sunk in but yes freeze dried foods and subterranean real estate are in demand arthur duck and cover sounds like a hunting club so where shall we begin gail im a little weary of the why it happened conversations lets get right to it what do you think will happen next arthur donald trump will set up an administration the sun will rise in the east my dog chucho will chase squirrels the world will go on gail glad to hear chuchos taking it well arthur he stayed cautiously neutral in the election but hes a very good boy i think you once made the point to me that there are no permanent victories or defeats in politics so perhaps thats a good place to start a conversation about the future ive been amazed since i came to washington at the collective failure to understand that point it is patently true upon the most cursory inspection of recent history in democrats were popping champagne over the dawn of a permanent era of progressive politics now they see most of their dreams being unraveled and republicans celebrating today will sooner or later be miserable gail hey i made a point things are looking better already arthur both winners and losers who ignore this reality make silly unforced errors the losers err on the side of excessive fatalism like the classic threats to leave the country gail reader email has informed me its way harder to leave the country than one might think we americans arent in all that much demand arthur and the winners fail when they convince themselves that since victory is permanent they can set an agenda that attracts no one from the other side gail well looking at a president trump and a republican controlled house and senate id say we are in for a stretch of dumb things presidents generally get most of their big changes done in the first year or two president obama did that with health care his agenda was nothing compared to george w bush who did everything from tax cuts to getting authorization for the iraq invasion but obamacare was certainly a big lift it was also a central campaign promise i know you think it was a bad idea arthur i think that strategy is enormously shortsighted i remember thinking when the democrats held the white house and both houses of congress in even though they dont have to it might be wise to give a little to bring some centrist republicans into obamacare some day the republicans might be in a position to reverse everything if they have zero political investment in it and sure enough here we are my point is that of course a president should have a vision that matches his ideology thats why he got elected but i think it is impractical and imprudent to forgive me for another reference to this is spinal tap turn it up to give on a few things where you dont have to because someday youre going to need friends to protect the stuff you care about most the trump administration might learn from the outgoing administrations horror at seeing some or all of obamacare repealed gail we part company here my perception of obamacare was of a democratic party willing to work on compromise legislation while the republicans just stalled there was no unified republican position just a ton of people who wanted to be deal makers but kept changing their mind but the bottom line is that weve left behind the old lets have a drink after work congress weve now got guys who sleep in their offices and dont even talk to the other side at the house gym arthur secretly a lot of them are actually friends but i take your point and thats another recommendation i would make to president trump make friends everyplace that was the l b j reagan clinton magic dont golf with the same people every week gail since i have no choice im prepared to look on the bright side for a while the republican hatred of obamacare is so great that even if hillary clinton had gotten elected it would have been really hard to get the necessary fixes through congress trump has promised something better and as of his minutes interview something better that preserves the most popular parts of the program so well see what he comes up with i know youre a big paul ryan fan his agenda and trumps agenda really dont match do they arthur congress is set to have a big influence on the agenda over the next years and ryan and trump will figure out how to make their ideas jibe ryans plan includes a health care replacement plan for obamacare it will actually do some of the things liberals really want like getting more people covered i realize that its very disappointing for progressives to see obamacare repealed but its not like it will be replaced by nothing gail this is one area where the product doesnt usually resemble the recipe i remember presidential candidate barack obama saying all health care negotiations could take place in public on c span grab your crystal ball and give me a couple of other predictions im seeing a big tax cut and huge spending on infrastructure repair followed by a stupendous rise in the national debt arthur its certainly true that neither party has been great at getting the deficit under control in my lifetime nobody calls his
washington the f b i reported monday that attacks against american muslims surged last year driving an overall increase in hate crime against all groups the data which is the most comprehensive look at hate crime nationwide expanded on previous findings by researchers and outside monitors who have noted an alarming rise in some types of crimes tied to the vitriol of this years presidential campaign and the aftermath of terrorist attacks at home and abroad since that trend appears to have spiked in just the last week with civil rights groups and news organizations reporting dozens of verbal or physical assaults on minorities and others that appear to have been fueled by divisions over the election in its report on monday the f b i cataloged a total of hate crimes in a rise of about percent over the previous year including assaults bombings threats and property destruction against minorities women gays and others attacks against muslim americans saw the biggest surge there were reports of assaults attacks on mosques and other hate crimes against muslims last year a jump of about percent over it was the highest total since when more than attacks occurred in the aftermath of the sept attacks attacks against transgender people also sharply increased blacks were the most frequent victims of hate crimes based on race while jews were the most frequent victims based on religion according to the f b i data but the increases in attacks on these groups were smaller than the rise in attacks against muslims and transgender people over all percent of the hate crimes that the f b i recorded were based on the victims race ethnicity or ancestry religious bias accounted for about percent of all attacks and about percent of attacks were based on sexual orientation law enforcement officials acknowledge that the statistics give an incomplete picture because many local agencies still have a spotty record of reporting hate crimes years after congress directed the justice department to begin collecting the data we need to do a better job of tracking and reporting hate crime to fully understand what is happening in our communities and how to stop it james b comey the f b i director said monday the f b i regards the prosecution of hate crimes under federal jurisdiction as the top priority of its civil rights branch since the election hate crime monitors like the southern poverty law center have reported a rash of verbal or physical abuse targeting minorities and others at schools mosques and elsewhere some supporters of president elect donald j trump however say they too have been victimized
moscow president vladimir v putin of russia and president elect donald j trump spoke by telephone for the first time on monday agreeing to review what both consider the poor state of relations between the two countries according to a statement from the kremlin the two agreed on the absolutely unsatisfactory state of bilateral relations said the statement and they both endorsed the idea of undertaking joint efforts to normalize relations and pursue constructive cooperation on the broadest possible range of issues the issues discussed included trade and economic ties as well as combating terrorism mr putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate mr trump last wednesday sending him a telegram about an hour after he had emerged the victor but the two men have not met nor had they spoken previously mr putin repeated the congratulations over the phone the russian president said he hoped that moscow could build a collaborative dialogue with washington on the bases of equality mutual respect and noninterference in the others internal affairs the release said the two men also discussed syria in the context of the need to work together in the struggle against the no common enemy international terrorism and extremism the statement said although mr putin maintained studied neutrality during the presidential race the state run news media which answers to him clearly pulled for mr trump among other issues mr putin blames hillary clinton then secretary of state for the mass demonstrations that greeted his return to the presidency in after mrs clinton lost the flagship state television news broadcast took to referring to her as the blonde woman during the campaign senior united states security officials accused russia of hacking the computers at the democratic national committee headquarters and releasing emails that proved embarrassing to the clinton campaign mr putin denied any state role in the hacking the russian government was one of the few around the world that was openly gleeful about the american election result with members of the state duma the lower house of the russian legislature breaking into applause at the announcement the united russia party loyal to mr putin dominates the duma mr trump and mr putin developed something of a mutual admiration society during the election particularly after mr trump suggested that crimea which moscow annexed from ukraine should belong to russia and that the united states should ally itself with russia and the syrian government of president bashar al assad to fight the islamic state mr trump also suggested the united states might dilute its support for nato which russia considers a main threat much of the brief statement from the kremlin about the telephone call echoed previous statements that mr putin had made about his goals for relations with washington including a return to pragmatic mutually beneficial cooperation mr putin openly endorses the idea that the world should return to the era when two superpowers assumed a general responsibility for global stability and security some analysts however have suggested that mr trump is unpredictable and the traditional republican penchant for painting russia as a dire threat could still emerge the putin administration is hoping that the west will lift sanctions imposed over the crisis in ukraine on the phone call which the kremlin said was arranged by mutual consent the two men agreed to stay in contact and to meet at an unspecified date in the future earlier mr trump described the note on his victory that he received from mr putin as beautiful for its part russia has continued its glowing tributes to mr trump as a paragon who triumphed in what is repeatedly depicted in the russian media as the swamp of american politics the main weekly news program on state television every sunday night tends to focus mainly on the united states with dmitry kiselyov the anchor suggesting this week that europe follow the american lead in replacing its leaders under president trump mr kiselyov said the american government would finally drop what the russian anchor called its annoying slogans about human rights and democracy russia has a lot of trust in trump he said
what do you do when things dont turn out as you expected this week carl richards sketches out a solution and a five point plan for uncertain times he also introduces a new term into the financial lexicon the industrial certainty complex as you might expect hes not a fan when returns began turning donald j trumps way tuesday night and markets started to respond i spent the next four hours putting together a column for people to read wednesday morning its a reminder of sorts no matter what happens to stocks in the short term if your long term goals havent changed its not clear why your investments ought to once the election results were clear paul sullivan returned to a topic he knows more about than nearly anyone the estate tax my weekend column looked at the question of whether we might all be able to agree on the fact that people who work for smaller employers ought to have easier access to workplace retirement plans and it sure would be simpler if this could happen on a national scale self reliance plus a safety net ought to be bipartisan enough concepts to make a majority of congress happy right
the consumer financial protection bureau the nations top consumer watchdog is stepping up an investigation into seller financed home sales that target lower income home buyers unable to get a traditional mortgage the regulatory agency on monday disclosed that it recently ordered two major companies that offer high interest installment contracts called contracts for deed to comply with a civil investigative demand for documents the request is a sign that the investigation is advancing the two firms which challenged the demand for documents are harbour portfolio advisors of dallas and national asset advisors of columbia s c the agency began informally looking at seller financed homes and specifically contracts for deed this year enforcement lawyers at the agency have been investigating the prevalence of these types of transactions to determine whether they violate federal truth in lending laws the agency posted the orders signed this month on its website on monday several recent reports including a front page article in the new york times have explored a revival of these kinds of transactions and the abuses in the market harbour portfolio bought more than single family homes after the financial crisis of most of them from fannie mae a government controlled mortgage finance firm through bulk sales harbour paid or less for most of the homes which were foreclosed on during the financial crisis and sells them as is this year harbour began to sell off more than homes with existing contracts for deeds in place to other investment firms and individual investors harbour has been regulated at the state level since its inception and it has always prided itself on following the law and treating consumers fairly said a harbour spokeswoman we dont believe contracts for deed are a consumer financial product or service under the c f p b s authority since these investigations are quite daunting and costly for a small organization such as our own we thought it appropriate to exercise our right to challenge the c f p b s basis for jurisdiction harbour portfolio is represented by lawyers with hudson cook a maryland based law firm that specializes in consumer finance regulatory matters a lawyer for national asset said the firm stood by its legal filing sent to the agency opposing the document request the five year old regulatory agency has recently sought to flex its muscles with enforcement action announcing new rules this year that would prevent many financial companies from forcing consumers to resolve disputes through mandatory arbitration it has also worked on a new set of regulations for payday loans which often carry high interest rates and predatory features yet after last weeks election of donald j trump the future of the regulatory agency seems more uncertain than ever president elect trump has signaled that his administration will seek to roll back some of the financial reform regulations and legislation enacted by the obama administration after the financial crisis the consumer financial protection bureau has been a favorite target for critics in congress and on wall street who contend the agency has been too aggressive and strayed from its mandate of better regulating the mortgage market by venturing into subprime auto loans mandatory arbitration and payday lending but the investigation of contract for deed firms would seem to fall within the broad purview of the agency to oversee national standards for the mortgage market contracts for deed and similar products such as rent to own deals for buying homes have become more prominent since the financial crisis because of the unavailability of smaller mortgages in urban and rural communities these alternative deals in which the seller retains ownership to a home until a contract is paid off are popular in some midwestern states hit hard by the foreclosure crisis seller financed transactions are particularly popular in michigan and ohio two states that helped propel mr trump to victory realtytrac a property data service estimates that on average homes a year have been sold nationally through contracts for deed since and the pace of deals has quickened since the crisis but it is difficult to know just how many homes are sold through contracts for deed or rent to own leases because not all states require such transactions to be publicly recorded this summer the national consumer law center issued a report in which it said many seller financed deals were toxic and were transactions that were built to fail and that had harmed consumers
last week i posed a provocative question on a financial services discussion board if the expected overhaul of financial regulations proceeds do we still need to worry about planning for the failure of big financial institutions including derivatives clearinghouses that is one of many questions that have been raised by the recent election and the call to repeal the dodd frank act the financial regulations passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis part of those regulations concerned rules for running most if not all derivatives trades through a clearinghouse or central counterparty but a blueprint for what to do if the clearinghouse itself runs into financial trouble and needs saving has been a point of much discussion among those interested in financial regulation answers to these questions are hard to come by because although many members of the soon to be dominant political party have called for such a repeal the movement that elected the new president is at least in part based on hostility to the establishment which presumably includes the big wall street banks that are largely the focus of dodd frank at times during the campaign donald j trump suggested he would reinstate the old glass steagall rules as part of repealing dodd frank these were the new deal regulations in force until the late that kept depository banks separate from investment banks and insurance companies a change like that addresses only a part of the broader scope of the postcrisis overhaul for example what do we do about resolution or bankruptcy for banks some have suggested moving all of what is now covered by the orderly liquidation authority the federal deposit insurance corporations new insolvency system for too big to fail institutions into the broader bankruptcy system that might work but often it is also suggested that these big bank cases should be put in front of life tenured district court judges rather than bankruptcy court judges who serve year terms because the cases are apt to be so politically fraught that would seem to lose most of the benefits of the current bankruptcy system which operates as well as it does because of the practical common sense approach that most of the bankruptcy judges bring to cases moreover district court judges are generalists and spend little of their time thinking about insolvency and reinstating glass steagall will not address derivatives are we going to go back to the precrisis nonregulation of derivatives as my opening question asks does the repeal of dodd frank mean abandoning the move toward transparency in these markets including the use of central clearinghouses and the required posting of collateral to back up these trades there are a host of questions here for example are we also going back to the old system of consumer protection in the financial industry we will probably have to wait a good while for answers as the new administration is apt to focus on the more politically charged issues of repealing the prior administrations health care immigration and environmental regulations and there is also the matter of the supreme court and the many other judicial vacancies left by the senates decision to halt judicial confirmations in the end it means several more years of uncertainty for the financial industry somewhat ironically just as the industry was finally adapting to the new regulatory framework that frameworks permanence has been thrown into doubt
if there is one thing that has caused me regret in last weeks election it is including my mobile phone number in my voter enrollment form after moving back to california from the east coast there wasnt much or any activity around the presidential election in california but we were lucky enough to have dozens of state propositions and local measures to consider marijuana state bonds a local soda tax you name it and we had a chance to vote on it we also had the opportunity to receive an endless streams of texts and phone calls in the weeks leading up to the election it would take an astonishing civic sensibility to not be annoyed by all this attention as steve lohr wrote over the weekend the cell number has become as important as the social security number its the backup for passwords on all sorts of forms and connected to all sorts of databases people feverishly protect their social security numbers but they often dont think twice about handing out that cellphone number they should reconsider being so free with that number trust me on this
as our south west train pulled out of busy vauxhall station tim farron pleasant manner daybreak coffee preston accent set out his case for what the richmond park byelection is about any byelection any kind of election is about what the electorate says its about he said we were heading for richmond station travelling against the morning peak travel flow it was the liberal democrats leader thought the seventh time he had struck out for the famously handsome london suburban town since his party picked a candidate to try to boot the famously handsome zac goldsmith out of his famously handsome richmond park parliamentary seat my sense is that heathrow expansion was of course the big thing that everyone talked about in the first week farron went on he had a point of course indeed the byelection is only happening because goldsmith chose to keep a promise he made to richmond park electors when challenging the then lib dem incumbent susan kramer during the general election campaign that he would if elected resign and re fight the seat as an independent should a conservative government go back on the promise that had been made by the then shiny new party leader david cameron in that if he became prime minister heathrow airport would not be expanded no ifs no buts but goldsmith isnt the only candidate against expansion the lib dems as a party are too and while labour appears in favour despite the reluctance of its leader its richmond park hopeful is not farron argued that it is the seats electorate that has pushed the airport down the pecking order of issues though given that the tories arent running a candidate leaving the case in favour of expansion unmade in local hustings or media debate its hard to see how it could have gone anywhere else its not off the agenda but people dont seem to think this byelection is going to shift the dialogue on that because all the candidates are against it farron reasoned whereas the thing that is going to have the most lasting and significant impact on peoples lives is brexit and the nature of it if it happens note that pregnant if the lib dems historically super europhile and down to just eight mps have said that unless the government promises british voters a second referendum on the deal it strikes at the end of negotiations over the terms of britains withdrawal from the european union it will vote against the triggering of those negotiations through the formal mechanism of article of the lisbon treaty with this stance farrons party is effectively seeking to claim the who voted to remain in the eu as their own thats nationally of course in the borough of richmond upon thames remain took a massive of the vote one of the highest shares in remain backing greater london the scope for the byelection to be or be seen as being a sort of local referendum on the brexit one is down to goldsmith representing one of the boroughs two constituencies being a noted leaver moreover he is one who has sustained damage to his formerly almost saintly reputation thanks to his shockingly negative and deservedly disastrous london mayor campaign just a few months ago which sought to create anxiety over his labour rival sadiq khan being muslim it also offers the lib dems hope of recovery from its recent miserable electoral decline goldsmiths defeat of kramer in was the start of the collapse of a strong lib dem position in this region of greater london where the party has since lost three more of the five seats they once held to conservatives they also lost control of richmond council to the tories in

somehow donald trump manages to dumb down everything somehow he manages to lower the bar to the point where he can play by a different set of rules and somehow the media and elected officials just shrug their shoulders and walk away by his own admission the president elect is negotiating business deals at a time when his predecessors were you know filling cabinet positions and transitioning to power he met with his indian business partners and the trump organization signed a kolkata deal last week as trump tweeted earlier this week prior to the election it was well known that i have interests in properties all over the world only the crooked media makes this a big deal he explained this in more detail if not entirely coherently in his interview with the new york times ive built a very great company and its a big company and its all over the world people are starting to see when they look at all these different jobs like in india and other things number one a job like that builds great relationships with the people of india so its all good its all good is indeed trumps approach to mixing his business and political affairs the law is totally on my side he claimed meaning the president cant have a conflict of interest to be clear profiting from the presidency would not be a quaint conflict of interest this is not about whether trump favors one country or president over another gives a contract to one company or another or spends more time making money for himself than he does boning up about policy there are laws on the books about us businesses influencing foreign officials with payments or other inducements the law is called the foreign corrupt practices act and its goal is to stamp out bribery by any us citizen bribery is what the law calls favors and payments given to foreign officials in exchange for business deals not a conflict of interest payments and favors going the other way into the pockets of the president are so clearly corrupt that they were forbidden by the founding fathers in the constitution the so called emoluments clause prohibits gifts and titles from foreign powers as follows no person holding any office of profit or trust under them shall without the consent of the congress accept of any present emolument office or title of any kind whatever from any king prince or foreign state its this clause that leads to exceptional red tape around any and all gifts received by the white house and every other department from a homemade quilt to a rolex watch everything is detailed declared and surrendered officials can only keep the gifts up to a value of if they repay the us government this process will be hard within the world of international real estate where foreign powers can grant gifts ranging from planning permits to investments from sovereign wealth funds the list is almost endless now we dont know if donald trump discussed his buenos aires investment with president mauricio macri of argentina but we do know that his daughter ivanka now running the family business was on the call we dont know if there was any suggestion that president mauricio macri could expect any benefits for himself or his country spokespeople for president macri and president elect trump have denied reports about the mixing of trump business and politics on the call but we do know that the long stalled buenos aires project is now moving forward news that emerged just three days after the call between macri and trump for a president who has refused to release his tax returns the need for transparency is not exactly clear in any case the fact that were even having this discussion tells you something profound about the trump presidency before it officially begins trumps promise to his voters was that he was incorruptible because he was so independently wealthy that nobody could touch him he knew how to drain the swamp because he had lived in it for so long buying off begging politicians for so many years that it made him sick this argument was always a stretch but clearly many voters bought into his pitch just two weeks since the election its obvious that trump has no interest in separating his personal wealth from his political agenda the damage caused is not confined to public confidence in the united states government being leader of the free world is not a casual concept that cold war phrase encapsulates the long prized notion that the united states is a beacon of freedom and democracy for the world as his own transition came to an end president elect kennedy best summed up the notion in his final address in boston in january i have been guided by the standard john winthrop set before his shipmates on the flagship arbella years ago as they too faced the task of building a new government on a perilous frontier we must always consider he said that we shall be as a city upon a hill the eyes of all people are upon us the eyes of the world are on the trump transition right now they see a president elect who lost the popular vote by more than million votes and almost percentage points this is a difficult notion of democracy to explain to a world struggling against authoritarian regimes where votes are routinely ignored and discounted the work of democracy promotion by the national endowment for democracy established by reagan is immeasurably harder as a result of the election the work of spreading corruption free government has become just as hard as a result of trumps business dealings if a sitting president can enrich himself while in office then why cant a president of a developing country set up his own businesses to do the same why should they not do both after all as trump told
appearing on that most revered of presidential forums donald trump released a video this week describing his plans to make america great again for everyone and i mean everyone ive learned not to believe trumps magnanimous act but others really want to henry kissinger told fareed zakaria on cnn that we should give trump an opportunity to develop the positive objectives that he may have and barack obama told an audience in peru that he wants to be respectful of the office and give the president elect an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every instance well forgive me mr president because im about to pop off have you lost all sense of judgment you and kissinger talk as if we have no idea who donald trump is or what he has been saying for months on end but trump has made it abundantly clear momentary opportunistic words of inclusion notwithstanding that his administration will be loyal to the far right fringes of the united states leaving even the republican establishment running behind him trumps announced cabinet choices simply leave no room for imagining a kinder gentler donald at the helm of the usa those of us concerned about the fate of the undocumented or the environment or reproductive rights see much reason to worry with the selection of steve bannon jeff sessions mike pompeo and general michael t flynn to trumps inner circle among many other troubling things all these men also share a deep antipathy to islam general flynns anti muslim views are as scary and they are well known trumps pick for national security adviser has called islam a malignant cancer and stated that islam is a political ideology that hides behind this notion of it being a religion asked about flynns views current republican national committee chair and trumps designated chief of staff reince priebus told abc news that there are some aspects of the faith that are very problematic i didnt realize that preibus was a scholar of islam or perhaps even a a renewer of the faith who according to popular muslim tradition comes to revive the practice of islam for following generations or maybe he just said an ignorant thing that would sound bigoted if it were about another religion but today sounds like policy preibuss comments are troubling rather than enabling establishment republicans as a moderating influence on the team the trump administration is pulling the traditional gop down its own far rightwing foxhole giving less extreme republicans about as much voice in this new administration as clint eastwoods chair actually its worse at least the chair had the good sense to stay quiet my worry extends beyond the realm of what this administration says and reaches into what it will do building a wall on the us mexico border is a near physical impossibility the immediate deportation of millions of people is much harder to execute than it sounds but the muslim stuff that can and most likely will happen kansas secretary of state kris kobach another anti muslim hardliner who is in the running for homeland security chief recently met with trump and was photographed holding his kobach strategic plan for first days openly in his hands plain for the world to see was the re establishment of an old useless program of the bush administration officially called nseers and more commonly known as special registration i remember vividly the panic and confusion among the muslims of new york city when special registration was first enacted in this program which required non immigrant visa holding men from muslim majority countries and north korea to register with the government was a massive failure even the governments own auditor found the program to be ineffective and a huge waste of resources the cost to american taxpayers was more than a year and the program alienated muslims around the world from the united states families were torn apart because of special registration and the brilliant program netted a grand total of zero terrorism prosecutions special registration was useful only as a tool to disrupt average muslim lives and to spend a lot of money needlessly it served no security function and yet trump is considering reviving it why we can assume because it will make this government like its doing something on the backs of ordinary muslims and then theres this justifying a muslim registry on fox news trump surrogate carl higbie positively invoked japanese internment as a legal precedent for the program that heinous comparison led the new york times to publish an op ed by a harvard law professor reassuring us that even if the legal decision authorizing internment has never been overturned we shouldnt be worried because the judiciary now sees the legal justification for internment as bad constitutional law but that whole exercise is nuts the question is not about the constitutionality of japanese internment the question is why the hell are we talking about japanese internment anyway are we seriously working through the legal likelihood or unlikelihood of holding large numbers of completely innocent people in detention camps if racial hysteria led us down that road once before whos to say that todays panic wont lead us down a similarly treacherous path with or without a legal precedent its beginning to feel like were one major terrorist attack from martial law in this country and the new administration hasnt even taken office yet theres a rightwing fiction in the us that is frequently promoted by the likes of fox news and that had a major impact on this election the notion is that in our contemporary multicultural age salt of the earth white americans dont get theirs while every minority and special interest group gets extra privileges the idea cultivates a mood of bitterness and suspicion even if its fundamentally untrue many americans honestly believe that muslims are getting special privileges that some accept will lead to the imposition of
traditionally a british ambassador needs royal documents of accreditation from the court of st jamess in order to represent her majesty abroad theres none of that fuss for nigel farage he has appointed himself ambassador to the united states as a stepping stone to some higher office such as foreign secretary farage prime minister farage or perhaps if the donald should suggest it in a tweet king nigel not on the basis of such fussy old paraphernalia as a great seal a royal charter or elected office of any kind but simply by flashing a photograph at us in the age of the selfie and the celebrity presidency farage has invented a new source of political authority it dazzles and blinds more than days after it was taken as it shines its power drunk bully light into every corner of the news it is the picture that defines drooled one befuddled commentator at this rate it will define too for the photograph that stirred the confusions of a stupefied britain on the weekend after americas psychotic meltdown of an election shows no sign of slipping away into memory usually photographs record history this one is making it for farage is successfully using it as a badge and instrument of power like a barbarian chief returning to his thanet village with a tablet from the roman emperor that appoints him ruler of the britons the sheer freakishness of the image enhances its grip on us for we cant stop staring at this monstrously matey exchange of bonhomie in a lift lined with gold trumps almost beatific post electoral grin is matched by the nigels starstruck guffaw theyre high rollers headed for the penthouse where the casino has provided them with entertainment for the night or whatever other cinematic image comes to mind to me this is somewhere between a martin scorsese film and a scene from the heyday of the third reich hermann goring would have loved that gold elevator but if this year has taught us anything it is that you cant assume your revulsion is universally shared maybe to many this is a gleeful and even joyous picture of two buddies having a well earned celebration love it or loathe it britain cant stop looking at it news sites whipped it out again this week like farages personal ultra gold american express card after the president elect attempted to appoint him by tweet as our man in washington in dwelling on this potent picture this virile vision we are rushing after pied piper farage dancing gladly to his tune for mr brexit loves this picture and he understands it too the gold is hilarious it makes everyone look what really matters however is the intimacy it parades the proof that he and americas scarily unpredictable new president are not just allies but real and close friends this is what makes the picture so much more than just a nice souvenir of a visit to trump tower it has become farages trump card an actual instrument of political power that he has played with frightening brilliance when will we wake up to the fact that nigel farage is a political genius he has used this photograph like a machiavel of the digital age to ruthlessly undermine britains prime minister and cabinet just a few months after the entire government was turned upside down by the brexit vote he claims credit for whats his game where does it lead the truly sinister thing about this photograph that is empowering nigel farage so much is that he personally produced it he went to new york got into trumps elevator made sure they posed for a picture together and released it on his twitter account it first appeared in a tweet by farage at on november in which he smugly goaded britains elected politicians with his proximity to the most powerful man on earth farage is understandably delighted with the pictures progress writing a fuming attack this week on the may governments supposed folly in refusing to obey an order from trump tower in the far right website breitbart naturally he boasts about it i have said since the now famous photograph with donald trump ten days ago that i would do anything to help our national interest and to help cement ties farage was first to release the photograph and hes still harping on it as incontrovertible evidence that he is the president elects good friend while conventional politicians who have been shy of acclaiming a man who spewed out hatred and bigotry in his campaign look wrongfooted look the old parliamentary politics has failed its time for the winners in the great gold elevator to have a go for farage this picture is gold but what does it mean when the normal rules of power can be bypassed with a photograph of two guys in a lift is there anything inherently wrong with grounding a claim to political importance in a photograph of yourself next to donald trump the german social theorist max weber distinguished between rational legal authority which corresponds to theresa mays government in this extraordinary situation traditional authority which is embodied in britain both by the monarchy and the venerable traditions of our parliamentary democracy and the third kind the wild card the dangerous unpredictable force that is charismatic authority nigel farage has already done a lot to destabilise rational legal and traditional authority in britain with the revolution he sees in brexit but its not enough now he is calling politics a cesspit and catastophically undermining what is supposed to be the brexit government what will be good enough when will he stop charismatic authority revels in the glamour and irrationality of visual images just as it revels in emotion stridency fear and loathing in a world cut free from conventional rules the charismatic leader uses bizarre unprecedented symbols of power to undermine the dullards who cling to outworn expectations farage waves his picture about from his

first of all we dont know where all the evidence is going to lead but what president elect trump was saying was that he would rather look forward instead of backwards and that his eyes right now are looking through the windshield not the rearview mirror so that was the point he was making and that look hes not going to spend his time sitting around thinking about how hes going to prosecute hillary clinton hes gonna think about the future of america for all americans that are out there thats where his focus is and thats really what hes saying now im sure if something comes around that if

while prime minister justin trudeau flogged our public assets last week he had a soothing message rest assured well be well served by the private sector bankers and billionaires lined up to sound a note of confidence i think its unprecedented exclaimed canadas top business lobbyist john manley a once in a generation opportunity enthused trudeaus economic advisory council these corporate figures are rubbing their hands because trudeau is about to put one of our great crises in their hands the need for historic investment in the countrys infrastructure for so long the domain of the state no one will deny the urgency roads and bridges are crumbling and congested with traffic subways and buses overcrowded and underfunded we need a roll out of emissions reducing initiatives to avert catastrophic climate change and a build up of defences to protect ourselves from floods and fires already locked in but many will question the liberals plan to deal with it selling off existing public assets to raise money and having private investors fund build and operate new infrastructure if they get their way expect a wave of privatizationstargeting public services and goods like roads ports airports utilities the post office and more according to adam vaughan one of its liberal architects there simply isnt an alternative to be afraid of the private sector when youre trying to fix this countrys infrastructure is shortsightedstupid irresponsible by responsible and far sighted does vaughan mean the result of past canadian experiments in privatization unsafely constructed schools packed dangerous prisons water treatment systems flooded with sewage super hospitals built with faulty wiring in emergency rooms senior care homes over run with inedible food and filth the politicians prattle about the private sector covering the risk of projects the enabling lie that cannot for its life find evidence time and again the costs of these public private partnerships have instead been borne by the public in ontario over the last decade alone their cost overruns burdened citizens with an extra and racked up in public liabilitiesthe equivalent of per household but perhaps canadians are just too stupid to understand their merits stupid enough that percent of them surveyed now oppose such privatization schemes so stupid indeed that in many cases they have clamoured successfully for these services to be returned to public control trudeaus plan for a privatization bank would expand these local disasters to a national scale corporate and pension fund backers have already announced they expect returns of to percent on their investments how do you think that will happen the only way that skimping ever does higher bills user fees and hidden government subsidies diminishment in quality of service cuts in jobs and pay no wonder some of trudeaus corporate advisors are offering their helpful advice free of charge its regular people who will end up carrying the cost these costs are not an oversight of privatization but their objective the inevitable result of opening up the public sphere to private profit making for more than thirty years in canada such measures have been a tool of an elite agenda promoted by successive liberal and tory governments the transfer of wealth from the poorer to the wealthy from the public trust to the private clutch is it any wonder why most peoples incomes and standard of living have stagnated while those of millionaires has skyrocketed so its not surprise that trudeau doesnt dare call privatization by its name instead his ministers have invented hip ambiguous names like asset recycling and the flywheel of reinvestment to describe their proposed schemes and the public opposition might explain how the liberals proclivity for consultations hasnt extended to this matter because privatization serves the elite it always spawns contempt for democracy take this revelatory example from a decade ago a slide show used by a canadian legal firm as they promoted privatization projects in british columbia one slide describing the obstacles to privatization is entitled inherent diseases the obstacles stakeholders transparency and public justification for corporations chasing endless profits the basic value of democracy are not essential to a healthy thriving society they are a scourge to be avoided all this secrecy euphemism and dismissive rhetoric is meant to obscure a single glaring fact the arguments in favour of privatization are rubbish there is no need to privatize public assets with government borrowing rates at historic lows the liberals could simply take out loans and build infrastructure at a fraction of the cost and forget the notion that were broke this line is regularly peddled by the political and corporate class to distract from the cash much of it accumulated through tax cuts hoarded by canadian corporations at the end of a stunning youd think that trudeaus anti austerity pledge so crucial to his election would have meant putting our hands on some of these obscene corporate profits it has taken scarcely a year for the facade to fall away he has barely shifted canadas taxation structuremeaning government revenue which could be the engine of a bold economic transformation remains at the lowest since the post period and now none other than donald trump has introduced a privatization infrastructure bank proposal strikingly similar to trudeaus will even that not make the liberals blush those of us who anticipated and warned that justin trudeau would continue such policies were shouted down but privatization deregulation and downsizing in the scope and spending of the state this is the neoliberal consensus that continues to grip politics across the continent donald trump has become only its most racist and authoritarian expression trudeau its most glossy and beguiling the transition that canadians want will require enormous levels of spendingand need to be public and paid for by strengthening and reinventing the public sphere the government could unleash a program of mass transit building renovations storm barriers urban redesign and green jobs that reduces emissions racism and inequality all at once but pretending the private sector can lead this is a recipe for
this bloodbath of an election a friend emailed me like watching someone get murdered another said over the phone and this in an email from a veteran of the vietnam war the third vietnam draft dodger is now commander in chief welcome to the full flowering of the era of trump which began with that now mytho epic glide down the escalator at trump tower where trump commenced his candidacy with these historic words when mexico sends its people theyre not sending their best theyre sending people that have lots of problems and theyre bringing those problems with us theyre bringing drugs theyre bringing crime theyre rapists and some i assume are good people if ever a monument is erected to the trump presidency then surely these words shades of gettysburg will be carved into the marble walls along with blood coming out of her wherever fifty bucks a steak and i would bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding in true demagogic fashion trump bypassed the head and spoke directly to the gut to the biles and bubbling acids of raw emotion he said things that many civil temperate americans hardly dared to admit we carried in ourselves were hardly aware of just how deeply we resented our own niceness how angry our interior lives with all this stuff bottled up years and years of internalized micro aggression from a culture that kept insisting on diversity inclusiveness tolerance many discovered just what a drag political correctness was all these years and to be free of it freed from this code that was jamming us up that was relief akin to a lung puncturing primal scream from the start trumps rallies had the air of the tent revival that same hot thrum of militant exorcism and ecstasy lets not fool ourselves a friend wrote i cant stand anything but cold honesty right now this is not a repub winning the election which would be bad enough this is white supremacy winning calm down were tempted to say its really not that bad stances are taken things get said in the heat of a campaign and we could take heart in the newly gracious conciliatory trump on display for several days after the election then came the news that steve bannon the erstwhile chairman of the trump campaign who bears a striking resemblance to otis the town drunk on the old andy griffith show was named senior counselor and chief strategist for the incoming trump administration the mainstream press still feels compelled to explain the term alt right but we know already we know we know we know white nationalism aka honky purity along with thick glistening lardings of apocalyptic racism and a style sense that falls somewhere between springtime for hitler and queer eye for the straight guy prior to his gig on the trump campaign bannon spent four years as chairman of breitbart news which he proudly declared to be the platform for the alt right as breitbart chairman bannon presided over such headlines as gabby giffords the gun control movements human shield birth control makes women unattractive and crazy and two weeks after a white nationalist murdered nine members of a bible study group at a black church in charleston south carolina hoist it high and proud the confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage find myself not sleeping at night a friend wrote the first president endorsed by the ku klux klan noted another then there was obama being obama on the day after the election we have to remember that were actually all on one team a mans character is his fate as heraclitus said and what a strange twisted fate indeed that barack obama cerebral disciplined cool ever seeking to reconcile and accommodate has had to deal with an opposition that very much regarded him as not on the team there was the birther movement for starters the closet muslim conspiracy theories the terrorist fist bump founder of isis teenage crack dealer hanging out on the corner all this damage hes done to america is deliberate said marco rubio during one of the republican debates which is a laugh if obama wanted to trash the us all he had to do on taking office in was sit on his hands and let the hot mess of the bush economy continue its meltdown to oblivion but the issue is bigger than any particular president after his post election all on one team remark obama continued the point though is that we all go forward with a presumption of good faith in our fellow citizens because that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant and functioning democracy this goes to the heart of the matter the american system of constitutional government is founded on deliberate fragmentation of power the separation of powers and checks and balances that we all learned in high school civics for government to be effective for government to meet the needs of the people the us constitutional order requires a healthy measure of good faith cooperation among the players this good faith began to fray in the early as gop leaders in congress newt gingrich and tom delay chief among them declared war on all efforts even from those in their own party to govern from a stance of bipartisan cooperation democrats in gingrichs world of moral absolutes were the enemy of normal americans gingrich and his allies were fighting no less than a civil war with liberals and as he declared in a speech to the heritage foundation this war has to be fought with a scale and a duration and a savagery that is only true of civil wars and so began the constitutional hardball and scorched earth tactics that have characterized the past quarter century of american politics you may recall the gingrich orchestrated government shutdowns of and over budget disputes and the impeachment of bill clinton for lying about a blowjob in more recent times
canadas role in europenatalie nougayrdes piece describes the canadian virtues of solid democracy tolerance openness and decency and goes on to quote the canadian trade ministers statement that canada is a country that shares european values why wouldnt europeans want to trade with us still many europeans and canadians are leery of the new trade deal so perhaps a different arrangement might work better than the comprehensive economic and trade agreement full membership in the eu it seems there will soon be a vacancy when the uk finally moves towards the exit and canada might make a suitable replacement canadian society is multicultural and proud of it while english is the lingua franca throughout most of canada french is widely spoken increasing numbers of spanish speakers have expanded our linguistic diversity canada fought in europe in both world wars it has paid its dues and the seven years of negotiation that went into ceta have surely paved the way for a canadian application to join the continent with which it has so much in common canadas full membership might make it easier for both parties to accept a mutually advantageous trading relationship canadian republicans might happily exchange the english monarchy and the british commonwealth for a seat in brussels and i think we might feel right at home there george bruce levineottawa canada i do not see any reason why natalie nougayrde calls the anti ceta demonstrators radical left a broad coalition of church union and environmental groups in addition to millions who signed an online petition to stop the trade deal express valid concerns without leaks we the citizens would still not know what was written in the treaty only after the continued protest did the negotiators adopt minute changes where is the democracy even our mps couldnt read it beforehand and everything was in english who in the french or spanish parliaments understood what was written inside nougayrdes democracy argument does not hold only the wallonia parliament dared to speak out against the deal if everyone in the eu were asked chances are a majority would reject the deal eu officialdom must think how it needs to convince citizens of the benefits of free trade what are the benefits for sub saharan africa or the common people in the eu trade deals impoverish the great majority of people which is one of the major reason for the ongoing migration crisis all major economies became rich without free trade only after their economies could compete internationally did they gradually open their markets the latest example is china but so did germany france japan the us and great britain steffen mllerhastings ukthe brexit conundrumwith reference to the high court ruling on article what a farce it is we have a government that only managed to persuade one in four of those eligible to vote for it to do so trying to usurp the will of parliament on the basis of a very marginal referendum result on the economic front we have neoliberal free traders who do not want a free market in labour even though labour makes up a significant part of most markets these are just the latest examples of a trend it has been my impression that since the late the western world has been slipping back into a new dark age where decisions are made more and more on the basis of belief mysticism and wish fulfilment than on evidence on the basis of what has happened in the last few weeks and months i think that we have arrived i look forward to the new enlightenment malcolm marchdorchester uk polly toynbee writes theresa may cannot tear up our right to be eu citizens without the authority of parliament yes she can and should because she has the authority of the british people i wish we germans had a chance to have our say

polly toynbee serious she hopes mps represent their constituents by ignoring and overruling their clear vote for brexit thereby saving the uk from its own people this elitist know better disconnect

had the courage to spell out the truth about the eu referendum rather than hiding behind the pretence that the british people have spoken like too many politicians and commentators simon coatesbrussels belgium was it satire or did polly toynbee really say mps should ignore the electorate and vote to remain it seems democracy is only good enough if it suits her particular brand of

because america is entirely governed by two political parties passage of legislation usually requires bipartisan support in us congress however the republican party is the only major political party in the world that denies the need to tackle climate change therefore for several years any hope of passing climate legislation hinged upon breaking through the near universal opposition among republican legislators a number of groups have focused on doing just that in the wake of the us election results i contacted these groups to assess their feelings about the prospects of us government action on climate change in the near future the general sentiment was understandably one of discouraged pessimism but each group identified glimmers of hope citizens climate lobbys success and growthcitizens climate lobby is one of the leading grassroots climate organizations in america and has also expanded rapidly internationally the group has seen explosive growth in recent years now hosting chapters in of americas congressional districts with a membership approaching strong under the ccl proposal carbon pollution is taxed at the source and of the revenue is returned to taxpayers via a regular rebate check its a bipartisan solution liberals get their desired carbon pollution tax while conservatives get a free market policy that doesnt grow the size of government moreover modeling projects that the policy will have a net overall positive effect on the economy citizens climate lobby has also achieved several significant successes the group was involved in spearheading the gibson resolution in which republican members of congress called for action to tackle the risks posed by climate change ccl was also the driving force behind the creation of the house climate solutions caucus a group currently comprised of republican and democratic members of congress exploring bipartisan climate policy solutions and ccl initiated the california state governments resolution urging the federal government to pass a revenue neutral carbon tax according to ccl executive director mark reynolds the election didnt change groups strategy as reynolds told me because democrats are already on board with climate policy as an organization with a long history of working with republicans on climate policy now that the republican party controls us government ccl is now more relevant and important than ever reynolds told me that since the election results traffic to ccls website has increased eightfold and attendance of its weekly introductory calls has spiked from an average of about to last week the majority of americas who are unhappy with the election results have become galvanized which bodes well for grassroots support of climate solutions reynolds also sees an opportunity for republicans to take control of the climate issue after many liberals rallied against a revenue neutral carbon tax proposal in the state of washington this opens up a window for the republican party to take ownership of one of the best policies to tackle climate change as donald trump might put it a revenue neutral carbon tax is a great deal because it efficiently addresses the problem while boosting the economy and the rebate protects american wallets from rising energy prices niskanen center gop could replace regulations with carbon taxthe republican party has thus far opposed all climate policies in congress but the supreme court ruled that the epa must regulate carbon pollution and it began doing so under president obama some have proposed that the easiest way for the gop to eliminate those government climate regulations which party leaders abhor but most republican voters support would be to replace them with free market legislation for example the niskanen center is a free market think tank that supports this type of policy and has proposed swapping epa regulations for a revenue neutral carbon tax the groups president jerry taylor wrote a detailed post about the prospects of a carbon tax under the incoming republican leadership which is well worth reading taylor thinks that republican leaders are now less likely to propose a climate tax than prior to the election for several reasons first they will likely devote the next several years to delaying weakening and or eliminating the epa regulations rather than replacing them because of the supreme court decision eliminating the regulations will be difficult but since trump will appoint at least one justice to the court it may not fully survive legal challenges however if it does survive the next president could fully restore the epa regulations if congress declines to replace them with legislation while this offers a glimmer of hope that the gop could pass a climate bill its doubtful that party leaders will be so forward thinking second the election results made it clear that climate denial will not hurt most republican politicians in elections third while many republican members of congress privately accept the reality of climate change and the need to address it and niskanen has identified several who would be willing to introduce climate legislation if the opportunity were to present itself taylor believes the election results make such a political opportunity less likely r street institute sees other opportunitiesthe r street institute is a free market think tank that has likewise made the conservative case for a revenue neutral carbon tax the groups president eli lehrer believes the chances of carbon tax legislation would have been low regardless of the election outcome as he told me r street energy policy director catrina rorke elaborated where she sees opportunities in cutting carbon pollution under the incoming government climate future looks dim but there are glimmers of hopethese groups were generally pessimistic about the prospects of a climate bill coming from the next congress but they did spot glimmers of hope and the future isnt set in stone in its congressional lobbying effort ccl reported that republican members of congress were times more likely to be receptive to the groups message than to be hostile up from a to ratio just two years ago many gop policymakers recognize the threats posed by climate change at least in private as jerry taylor noted
former french president nicolas sarkozys political career has been effectively ended after he was dealt a humiliating defeat on sunday by his former prime minister franois fillon in the first round of the race to choose the rightwing republican partys candidate for the presidency next spring fillon a socially conservative free market reformer who admires margaret thatcher and voted against same sex marriage came close to winning the nomination straight out with around of the poll he now faces a second round runoff against more moderate alain jupp the mayor of bordeaux who was prime minister under jacques chirac the divisive former president sarkozy suffered a humiliating defeat knocked out of the race after he ran a hard right campaign on french national identity targeting muslims and minorities his poor score after a campaign in which he suggested banning muslim headscarves from universities and was forced to protest his innocence faced with several legal investigations into corrupt campaign financing showed he had become just as much a hate figure on the right as on the left who is franois fillon the man who ended sarkozy dream read morefillon and jupp now have one week to do battle over who could better unite french voters against the far right in a country struggling with mass unemployment economic sluggishness and the threat of terrorism donald trumps us win has thrown the spotlight on france as the next place for a possible shake up of the political system polls have consistently shown that the front national leader marine le pen will make it to the french presidential final round runoff next may but that it would be difficult for her to win fillon a year old paris mp is the the epitome of the traditional provincial right he is a catholic from a village in north west france where he lived in a century chateau with his welsh wife and their five children during a long career in local politics a tea drinking anglophile he has broken ranks with the long running statist tradition of the french right to propose the most radical pro business reform programme vowing to cut a staggering public sector jobs over five years attacked for going too far with proposed state cuts by jupp fillon said in his final rally im tagged with an economically liberal label in the same way one would paint crosses on the doors of lepers in the middle ages but im just a pragmatist when he became prime minister in fillon caused friction with sarkozy by declaring that france was almost bankrupt fillon voted against same sex marriage when it was introduced by the socialist president franois hollande and had the support of the traditional catholic right claiming to stand for christian family values he has campaigned against medically assisted procreation for single women or lesbian couples he surged in the polls in the final weeks of the campaign after publishing a book on the fight against radical islam saying there isnt a religious problem in france yes there is a problem linked to islam he said the solution was not to target law abiding muslims but to target fundamentalism but he caused anger among a black rights association during the campaign when he referred to french colonialism as france sharing our culture fillon has called for a rapprochement with the russian president vladimir putin on syria after the us election he welcomed a new alliance between putin and trump asked early in the campaign whether france should cooperate with syrias bashar al assad to fight islamic state he said france should unite with all possible forces democratic or not he told the website atlantico in october de gaulle churchill roosevelt allied with stalin to defeat nazism fillon said the french people wanted authority and his was a powerful project to reform france admitting defeat sarkozy said he felt no bitterness no sadness after belittling fillon as his employee when he was president sarkozy said he would now back fillon in the final round of voting on november whoever wins that vote will instantly become the favourite to take the presidency next spring jupp has led a centrist campaign promising economic reform and rejecting what he called the suicidal identity politics of sarkozy which he warned would deepen rifts in french society over the past few months he had consistently topped polls as frances favourite politician after undergoing a staggering image transformation from the when he was the most loathed french prime minister in modern times after million people took to the streets in protest against his pension changes in jupp received a month suspended sentence and was barred from holding elected office for a year over a scheme that illegally put workers for chiracs party on the payroll of the paris town hall although it is accepted that he did not profit personally and was seen as having taken the flak for chirac some critics warn the case could come back to haunt him during a fierce presidential campaign since trumps election critics have warned he would seem too old school establishment against le pen with echoes of the us campaign i am not hillary clinton and france is not america he said this week insisting he could be trusted to take swift action on major reform the candidates economic programmes are similar they agree on lowering public spending ending the hour week scrapping frances wealth tax cutting varying levels of state jobs and overhauling welfare the deeply unpopular socialist president franois hollande will make an announcement next month on whether he intends to run for re election hollande is said to have been boosted by fillons strong showing feeling it would be easier for the left to unite against fillon and dismiss him as a french thatcher it was the first time the french right had held an open us style primary race to choose its candidate and turnout was high any voter who signed a charter saying they agreed with
for someone who made his career writing about and founding media organisations rafat ali is surprisingly downbeat about what they can achieve if anything the trump election has shown that we are ascribing too much value to what media can do he says a week after donald trumps victory it has its role it has to continue to do its role its even more important today but the view that it will somehow change the world and change peoples minds or give people the right path its just too much to ask hes not alone in doubting the extent of the established medias influence following an election result which almost no outlet predicted and very few supported but in the post election autopsy many commentators have said at least some of the blame should be laid at the door of facebook and its fake news filled filter bubbles ali shares their concerns particularly about the parallel world where people have no connection to reality in which many millions of us citizens appear to live just the fact of what they believe about muslims that hillary is doing this or obama is doing this its just crazy but he says many of the complaints from those working in tv or newspapers stem from an unrealistic belief in their own impact i think that while obviously this is a huge problem we are trying to get out of media way more than its capable of giving he says its not like if the majority of the media goes away or a big proportion of the media goes away that suddenly people are going to miss it ali has first hand experience of the impermanence of media from paidcontent his first company which lasted not much more than a decade he launched the site in taking what was then a relatively novel approach by applying lessons from one part of the media such as the recording industry to other areas such as newspapers which were grappling with the disruptive powers of the internet it was acquired in by guardian media group for an undisclosed sum in the millions of pounds it was run as a standalone business and ali stayed until before leaving to travel the world for two years in early gmg sold paidcontent to another digital media site gigaom which later that year shuttered the brand and itself closed in meanwhile ali had returned from his trip with a plan to apply paidcontents connecting the dots approach to the world of travel and in the summer of he launched a business called skift with travel journalist jason clampet while most of those writing about the travel industry were focused on one sector such as airlines or hotels ali based his plan on the realisation that travellers simply see an end to end process of getting around the world that seemed to leave a gap for a media organisation taking a more holistic approach while writing in a less stuffy more accessible way than the established trade press in the early days ali who operated as skifts chief executive planned to use the sites reporting as a foundation from which to sell data about travel starting with the way it was marketed online however things did not go to plan and while trying to drum up investment in he hit a brick wall i wasnt able to raise the round he says it was the most humbling six months of my professional career we were three months away from running out of money we were or people at that point we had a famous as in famous in our company moment when we went to iceland for our first off site it was a very seminal moment for us as it was supposed to be a celebration of us closing the round ali and the team tried to work out how to continue growing without any outside investment the answer was to drop plans to sell data and focus on more established ways of making money in skifts case research events and advertising two and a bit years later ali says the business is now profitable with double digit revenue growth heading for upwards of a year within the next months traffic is not huge around million visitors a month but skifts priority is its list of email subscribers which stands at more than the company now employs close to people mostly at its new york headquarters and is expanding into europe with hires such as a uk editor based in london though he chose to build his second company around travel ali did not stop wading into arguments about the travails of established media companies including the guardian he says most mainstream outlets are operating more like drive by media where you hope and pray you show up in a feed but he doesnt pretend to have all the answers i dont have a prescription for any of those people he says its hard always even in our business which is doing very well people say oh my god you guys are doing so well and i say yes then i look back thinking holy shit if they knew how hard it is to build a media company its always going to be hard and trumps victory is going to make things harder not just for the media but also the travel industry which ali says is facing a huge challenges from the insular ideologies that are taking over western politics i think trump has already said a lot of things that will enervate people coming to the us even if he does half the things he said it will have a bad effect on the travel industry his rhetoric stands directly opposite to what the promise of travel stands for the most progressive expression of human curiosity fringe is the new mainstream it is worrying for everyone especially for europe which sits at the centre of immigration issues is there
in january the republican party will take control of the us government for the first time since the switch from being the party of opposition to being the governing party is never easy and the deep divisions in todays republican party make todays transition unusually chaotic the election added to the chaos as president elect trumps evident dismay and lack of preparation for taking office suggested that he had little interest in doing the job for which he had campaigned so viciously whats more trump lost the popular vote by a significant margin and democrats also got more votes for both houses of congress this lack of popular support puts even more pressure on republicans to craft policies that a majority of americans can accept therein lies the republicans problem todays party is led not by practical politicians but by ideologues this was not always the case traditionally republicans embraced the idea that americans naturally enjoyed social and economic harmony it was the job of congressmen and women to develop that harmony by figuring out how to use the government to promote equality of opportunity for those just starting their climb up the economic ladder those individuals were the engine room of production they would produce more than they could consume so they would in turn support a thriving middle class when he was elected president in the first republican to be elected to the job since dwight eisenhower accepted the reality that unregulated capitalism and the lack of a social safety net in a newly industrialised country precipitated economic and social crisis although it sprang from traditional republicanism rather than the tenets of the democrats eisenhowers middle way looked much like the democrats new deal this new liberal consensus between democrats and republicans maintained that the government had a role in promoting economic fairness and social stability but it sparked a backlash one we can still see playing itself out today a few wealthy businessmen insisted that government regulation infringed their liberty by affecting the way they did business taxes to fund social welfare also hampered their freedom they stood firm on the concept of individual liberty which was they argued as firm as a principle as those of the ten commandments these movement conservatives saw an epic battle between themselves and liberals whose embrace of government activism was permitting communism to snake its way into america but movement conservatives had a practical problem most americans government regulation of business and social welfare to advance their cause movement conservatives turned to racism when the us supreme court handed down the brown v board of education decision requiring desegregation in schools leading movement publication pushed the idea that an active government used white tax dollars to benefit black americans suddenly the arguments of movement conservatives began to get traction in they got their chance to restore america to purity republican candidate barry goldwaters supporters called for an end to civil rights legislation a new voice in the movement added conspiracy theory and populism to what had been an elite conversation phyllis schlafly president of the illinois federation of republican women accused the eastern financiers and banking interests who made up the eastern establishment of backing the liberal consensus because they made money from a murky world of international co operation she backed goldwater as he offered a clear vision of a nation that stood against communism enough with eggheads who called for nuanced responses to complicated problems in the world what should americans do about communism stop it goldwaters presidential run turned into a rout but the electoral map offered a blueprint for future republican candidates goldwater carried his home state of arizona and five other states all of them in the deep south race became a staple in movement conservatives lexicon later richard nixon added sexism and a distrust of organised labour to the racism that had clinched his election he told supporters that some people wanted to live by government handouts rather than by working and that these lowlifes were sucking hardworking americans dry through tax dollars in ronald reagan implanted this bifurcated world view into the white house the election of democrat bill clinton horrified them he was a popular statist who threatened to undo all the work they had done to destroy government programmes they set out to destroy his administration in when movement conservatives under newt gingrich captured the house for the first time since the eisenhower administration they set out to begin an emergency dismantling of the welfare system which is shredding the social fabric bankrupting the country and gutting the work ethic educational performance and moral discipline of the poor they set out to defund the government entirely in the hope that debt would end expenditures newt gingrich muslims who believe in sharia law should be expelled from us read moreby movement conservatives laid siege to remaining traditional republicans in the party purging it of those they called rinos republicans in name only they turned to texas governor george w bush as their presidential nominee and when he squeaked into office after losing the popular vote declared he had a mandate bush slashed taxes and regulations and brought evangelicals directly into white house deliberations barack obamas election represented everything republicans opposed he was a black man who promised to use the government to help women and people of colour taxed enough already screamed protesters who called themselves tea partiers when obamas foreign policy signalled a return to a multilateralism that recognised the end of americas post second world war dominance movement conservatives howled in republicans built on the tea party anger with the money of wealthy businessmen to take control of swing state legislatures in however the winking of republican leaders at the racism and sexism of obama bashers backfired they found themselves trailing in the wake of a reality show tv star who stripped the veneer off their dog whistle rhetoric and openly called mexicans rapists and criminals and talked about women
say what you like about past presidents and their international legacies but its hard to dispute the caliber of their national security advisers from henry kissinger to colin powell from zbig brzezinski to sandy berger from condi rice to susan rice the list is a long line in smart seasoned and strategic thinkers until now donald trumps decision to pick lt gen michael flynn as his most senior national security aide is a rupture with the past and with sane foreign policy flynn is a conspiracy theorist and islamophobe who hangs around the darker corners of the white nationalist internet he also lost his last job in the intelligence services i suspect because he cant manage his way out of a paper bag all of which would be mildly amusing if flynn wasnt about to take on a job that will determine the immediate fate of large parts of the globe the presidents national security adviser plays a unique role inside the west wing unlike almost every other corner of the presidency national security is unquestionably controlled exclusively by the commander in chief trump and flynn make bush and cheney look like tenured professors of military historyshort of declaring war and obtaining a defense budget the president needs nobody elses say so to unleash the worlds most powerful military intelligence services and diplomatic corps which is why the national security adviser is normally a stable wise character who can sift through mountains of intelligence maintain a clear sense of strategic priorities in the national interest and wrangle the sprawling bureaucracy these are all qualities that are hardly obvious in michael flynn flynn has falsely claimed that shariah law is spreading across the united states and that the nation is in the midst of a world war with radical islamists fear of muslims is rational he tweeted earlier this year flynn previously ran the defense intelligence agency but lost his job after two years because of clashes with officials for his part flynn claims he was fired because he opposed the obama administrations view that islamist terrorists were a fading threat like his new boss flynn appears very comfortable with the current russian regime working with russia today the kremlins propaganda tv network he apparently received classified intelligence briefings while running a lobbying firm for foreign clients he seems to favor working with russia to combat islamist terrorists while turning a blind eye to russias designs on ukraine and its support for the assad regime in syria as trumps trusted adviser sitting in on his daily intelligence briefings flynns early record on advising the president elect is shockingly undiplomatic haphazard at best and unethical at worst in the brief time since he won the election trumps first call with a world leader was not with a trusted us ally but with the egyptian dictator president al sisi he sat with prime minister abe of japan this week but his aides told the japanese not to believe every word trump said he met with the populist right wing british politician nigel farage before meeting the british prime minister theresa may but he somehow found time to meet with several indian real estate developers to discuss his property interests with them and the trump organization signed a kolkata deal on friday amid his many interactions with foreign powers trump is speaking without briefing papers from the state department because his transition team is in such chaos that they have yet to establish meaningful contact with the nations foreign policy professionals heck of a job flynnie we are condemned to repeat history if we choose to forget it and donald trumps voters have chosen to forget the lessons of the last republican president after eight years of recovery from the catastrophe of george w bushs national security decisions we are now staring at the prospect of an even more impetuous set of decision makers trump and flynn make bush and cheney look like tenured professors of military history never mind that trump spent most of the presidential campaign pretending he opposed bushs war in iraq when in fact he supported it so far as anyone can fathom his position it was to pick the winning position after the outcome was clear when a leader is both boastful and indecisive the leadership vacuum is filled by aides who feed into the posturing but compensate for the indecision flynn fills that trump shaped hole perfectly but we know where this leads cheney cherry picked manipulated intelligence reports to build a case for the war in iraq that was the single worst us national security decision in a generation we are still living with its consequences today with isis and a global refugee crisis that is unthinkable without the iraq war condoleezza rice bushs national security adviser was unable to control the hawks inside the cabinet even as she leaned towards the doves flynn doesnt need to control any hawks because he is leading the pack the opportunity for flynn to cherry pick intelligence is almost limitless with his public hatred of islam and his desire to wage a war of religion the case for military action will be simple inside the trump west wing it may be time to concede that one of the biggest winners of this election is the twisted and murderous worldview distilled by osama bin laden unlike bush and obama trump and flynn believe we are engaged in a war with islam just as al qaida and isis believe they are engaged in a war with christianity and judaism the jihadists have infected their enemies with their own sickness to be fair this infection had been growing for many years before trump started running for office it broke out when congress democrats and republicans voted against the closure of guantnamo bay it is obvious in much of the worlds refusal to deal with the syrian refugee crisis but now the sickness has given us trump and flynn to escalate a religious fueled
robert john burck better known as the naked cowboy sings and plays guitar outside trump tower photograph mike segar reuterspresident elect donald trump has settled the multi state class action fraud lawsuit over the now defunct trump university for million according to new york attorney general eric schneiderman in my office sued donald trump for swindling thousands of innocent americans out of millions of dollars through a scheme known at trump university donald trump fought us every step of the way filing baseless charges and fruitless appeals and refusing to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university today that all changes todays million settlement agreement is a stunning reversal by donald trump and a major victory for the over victims of his fraudulent university i am pleased that under the terms of this settlement every victim will receive restitution and that donald trump will pay up to million in penalties to the state of new york for violating state education laws the victims of trump university have waited years for todays result and i am pleased that their patience and persistence will be rewarded by this million settlement donald trump announced the nomination of alabama senator jeff sessions as attorney general and kansas congressman mike pompeo as director of the central intelligence agency as well as the selection of retired lt gen michael flynn to serve as his national security advisor sessions one of trumps earliest backers during the republican primary campaign has served in the senate since and served as alabamas attorney general for two years before that the lawmaker has the rare distinction of once being passed over for a federal judgeship over racist comments he allegedly made during sessions confirmation hearing in lawmakers heard testimony that sessions called respected civil rights organizations communist inspired in another set of testimony a prosecutor told congress that sessions had

bellacor has dropped the trump home range of chandeliers and other domestic trinkets from its website massachusetts senator elizabeth warren has released a blistering statement in response to trumps nomination of sessions to serve as the next attorney general thirty years ago a different republican senate rejected senator sessions nomination to a federal judgeship in doing so that senate affirmed that there can be no compromise with racism no negotiation with hate today a new republican senate must decide whether self interest and political cowardice will prevent them from once again doing

the imprisonment of hillary clinton and before he came to view an entire religion as responsible for terrorism he issued a public plea for nuance in intelligence ret lt gen mike flynn photograph alex wong getty imagesin flynn followed his longtime friend from the elite joint special operations command stanley mcchrystal to afghanistan their partnership had transformed jsoc into an apparatus that collected and disseminated intelligence as rapidly as it killed people and then fed that intelligence back into its internal systems to accelerate the lethal process as with jsoc mcchrystal would command the war and flynn would run its intelligence shop but flynn soon considered the entire us intelligence apparatus in afghanistan to be focusing on the wrong targets the trouble in flynns estimation was that us intelligence focused too much on the taliban insurgency it gave comparatively little emphasis on granular data about trends among afghans themselves which at the time the coterie of counterinsurgents around mcchrystal considered decisive win the people the thinking went and the insurgency would lose the base of support necessary to survive in a rare move for a serving intelligence officer flynn took his critique public the most salient problems in afghanistan are attitudinal cultural and human he wrote in a january paper for the center for a new american security at that point the ascendant defense thinktank and a job pipeline into the obama pentagon m erely killing insurgents usually serves to multiply enemies rather than subtract them commanders flynn and his co authors wrote needed information including census data and patrol debriefs minutes from shuras with local farmers and tribal leaders polling data and atmospherics reports from psychological operations and female engagement teams refocusing on population centric information the authors wrote was crucial to victory it would admittedly offer few clues about where to find insurgents but it

posts said that disgraced general david petraeus the former director of the cia is being considered for the position of secretary of state petraeuss nomination would prove ironic however in light of

france votes this weekend to choose the rightwing candidate likely to face the far right marine le pen in next springs presidential election just as donald trumps us win has thrown the spotlight on france as the scene of the next possible shakeup of the political system polls have consistently shown that le pen head of the far right front national will make it to the french presidential final round run off next may but that it would be difficult for her to win the three leading contenders in the open primary race to choose the rights candidate on sunday are all establishment figures two former prime ministers alain jupp and franois fillon and the former president nicolas sarkozy for weeks they have been fighting over who could better unite french voters against the far right in a country still struggling with mass unemployment and a major terrorism threat jupp the mayor of bordeaux who served as prime minister under jacques chirac in is frances most popular politician and has for months been the favourite he has led a centrist campaign pledging pro business reform but also promoting social harmony against hard right identity politics vowing i wont turn people in france against each other jupp has undergone a staggering image transformation since the when he was the most loathed french prime minister in modern times and million people took to the streets in protest against his pension changes in he received a month suspended sentence and was barred from holding elected office for a year over a corrupt scheme that illegally put workers for jacques chiracs party on the payroll of the paris town hall although it is accepted that he did not profit personally and was seen as having taken the flak for chirac the case could come back to haunt him during a fierce presidential campaign since trumps election critics have warned he would seem too old school establishment against le pen with echoes of the us campaign i am not hillary clinton and france is not america he said this week insisting he could be trusted to take swift action on major reform sarkozys bid for a political comeback is seen as his last chance in french politics he has led a hardline campaign on identity politics targeting muslims and minorities denying climate change and unashamedly veering into le pens far right territory sarkozy remains a divisive figure in france but he has loyal core support in his les rpublicains party which is expected to turn out massively to vote he wants to ban the muslim headscarf from universities and public companies limit the french nationality rights of children born of foreign parents and has insisted that children who dont eat pork should lose their special school dinner options and instead eat chips although he supported clinton in the us election since trumps win he has styled himself as anti elite and has promised to go against all that is politically correct his campaign has been hampered by legal woes including when the french state prosecutor recommended he should face a criminal trial over alleged illegal campaign funding in the final campaign debate on thursday night sarkozy was quizzed about fresh claims that he received millions in funding from the late libyan leader muammar gaddafi towards his campaign sarkozy had no answer and losing his cool said the question was disgraceful franois fillon sarkozys former prime minister has gained in the polls in recent days to become a serious challenger a devoted admirer of margaret thatcher fillon has the boldest project for economic reform vowing to cut public sector jobs in the next five years a paris mp he is also a symbol of the provincial french right a catholic from a village in north west france where he lived with his welsh wife and their five children he voted against same sex marriage when it was introduced by the current socialist government and surged in the polls after publishing a book on the fight against radical islam saying no there isnt a religious problem in france yes there is a problem linked to islam he said the solution was not to target law abiding muslims but to target fundamentalism the candidates economic programmes are however similar lowering public spending curbing the hour week scrapping frances wealth tax cutting state jobs and overhauling welfare the younger political generation has so far failed to take the lead in the primary race the two youngest candidates former ministers nathalie kosciusko morizet and bruno le maire arent expected to reach the final run off the deep unpopularity of socialist president franois hollande and his fractured party means the french left are not currently predicted to make it to the final round of the presidential elections next may the rights primary vote is open to any voter who signs a charter saying they agree with the republican values of the centre and the right and pays about million people are expected to turn out including some leftwingers two euros seems cheap to have a say in keeping out sarkozy said one leftwing publisher franois miquet marty head of viavoice pollsters said there was major interest in the primary in part because were in a period where people are looking for solutions and want a quick transformation to get france out of its rut sarkozys presidency was seen as disappointing hollandes has been seen as insufficient so theres a big interest in who tomorrows candidate would be the first round in the rights primary race takes place on november and the second round run off on november the candidatesalain jupp is the moderate centre right mayor of bordeaux and former prime minister under jacques chirac once nicknamed amstrad for his robotic efficiency and cold grey image he is now frances favourite politician nicolas sarkozy is leader of the rights les rpublicains party he was french president from to his hard right views on immigration identity and security have won support from
ron wyden is taking donald trump at his word much of official washington is wondering whether trump will implement the agenda that won him the presidency some of trumps defenders like tech investor peter thiel contend that trump should not be taken literally but the democratic senator from oregon shows no signs of interest in that discussion as perhaps the democratic partys premier civil libertarian on capitol hill his anticipation of the trump administration starts from the perspective that the president elect will govern as he campaigned against muslims against immigrants for torture for surveillance wyden from his perch on the intelligence committee is preparing for a four year battle were going to have to make sure now that a political agenda doesnt replace a set of constitutional priorities thats the heart of it wyden said in an interview with the guardian this week wyden is one of the few national politicians who can plausibly claim to have fought national security abuses and championed civil liberties with equal vigor in the george w bush and barack obama administrations he is far more comfortable discussing policies or proposals than he is discussing personalities opting to refer to trump simply as the president elect you look at some of what the president elect has to say and it certainly ought to be a wake up call from the standpoint of potential abuse of power wyden said a quote sticking in wydens mind these days is one trump issued in july after the democratic national committee hack which us intelligence has blamed on russia trump discussing his political opponents mused honestly i wish i had that power id love to have that power by january it will no longer be hypothetical barely a week after the election wyden conceded that its probably early for strategy but he said he has early priorities for racking up wins in order to provide privacy cybersecurity and civil liberties advocates with the momentum needed to take on the trump administration one is to block a measure wyden said is still alive in the intelligence authorization bill that would provide the fbi with powers to scour americans browser history without court oversight there his approach is straightforward running the clock out on the current congress and scour all these bills to see it doesnt get added to any other piece of legislation but congressional inertia can cut against him as well on december an impending change to the federal rules of criminal procedure will vastly expand law enforcements ability to remotely hack suspect electronic devices unbound by jurisdiction opponents have few options as the change known as rule will take effect if congress does what it does best which is nothing wyden said we understand our backs are against the wall he and his allies including democratic senator chris coons and gop senator mike lee are attempting to delay the change when trump officially takes over the stakes will escalate perhaps most urgent is trumps proposal to create a database of muslims which is just light years away from what you can debate is constitutional wyden said i will use my opportunities on the intelligence committee as a member of the democratic caucus the bully pulpit that i have to drive that message from one end of the country to another that would be unconstitutional wyden said by the end of will come an epic fight against the intelligence agencies over surveillance they will seek the renewal of an expiring legal provision known as section of the foreign intelligence surveillance act that permits a vast dragnet of data collection to include americans international communications our fight to reform also got a lot more important as the result of the election wyden said similarly he considers trumps call this year to boycott apple over its encryption battle with the fbi indicative of antipathy to privacy protective cybersecurity wyden said he will fight the trump administration and again democrats and republicans in the congress who propose weakening encryption telling vice he would filibuster any such effort unprompted wyden anticipates relitigating the years old fight against torture an issue prospectively settled under obama though anything but when it comes to addressing the cias history with trump were going to have to deal with that again a first step he is planning will be attempting to ensure the committees landmark torture report isnt destroyed a very real possibility if it escapes legal limbo to return to a panel now controlled by report opponent richard burr of north carolina trumps allies are signaling that a legal prohibition on cia torture enacted in is not an immovable obstacle on cnn this week pete hoekstra a former house intelligence committee chairman said thatd be a process youd have to work through with congress and youd probably do it in secret and you probably wouldnt do it through the public process it remains to be seen if wyden would have access to such secret decisions even from his perch on the intelligence committee the trump administration could revert to a process of keeping the full committee from learning most intelligence practices wydens very good relationship with incoming ranking panel democrat mark warner of virginia will become critical to those efforts yet wyden might have had warners perch he was next in line to take the ranking membership with dianne feinsteins departure a move that would have strengthened wydens opportunities for oversight over the intelligence agencies in the age of trump enormously doing so would have meant he would have had to give up his position on the finance committee and wyden considered his potential loss of influence over healthcare trade enforcement and technology policies too high a price to the consternation of some of his allies outside government in this horror show context congressional oversight is more important than it has ever been before we would have preferred senator wyden leave his chair on the finance committee and take the ranking chair on the intelligence committee
there was still a note of caution around understandably given the ructions of recent weeks but investors still managed to push most european markets higher in the uk the ftse was boosted by better than expected retail sales figures but italy underperformed amid worries about its forthcoming referendum on constitutional reform the banking sector in italy was under particular pressure again in the us markets took janet yellens testimony in their stride with the fed chair hinting that a rate rise was likely next month disappointing results from wal mart helped limit any gains however jasper lawler market analyst at cmc markets said a rapid rise in retail sales in october helped uk stocks gain ground on thursday despite poorly received results from royal mail there was a more mixed performance in european shares with german and italian indices weighed down by the banking sector us markets opened mostly higher though disappointing walmart results dragged the dow jones down the final scores showed the ftse finished up points or at dax edged up to cac climbed to ftse mib fell to ibex ended up at greece the athens market added to wall street the dow jones industrial average is currently up just points or if you want to listen to yellens testimony again it can be replayed here janet yellen in both her prepared remarks and subsequent comments to congress strongly suggested an interest rate rise was on the cards in december as most economists now expect she said the economy had strengthened since the feds last meeting and inflation was moving up but she admitted the aftermath of the us election had caused uncertainty and the fed would have to take this into account and following donald trumps criticisms that the fed was making decisons for political purposes she defended the central banks independence despite talk in the immediate wake of trumps victory that she might resign she stated clearly she wanted to serve her full term until january yellen shakes hands with joint economic committee chairman senator dan coats after her testimony to congress photograph susan walsh ap much discussion of the lack of wage growth and how to tackle it and how to help people who are not benefitting from the growth in the economy and some comments about how low interest rates mean companies are more likely to do share buybacks than invest yellen says its not clear to her why investment spending has been weak but denies the feds low interest rate policy is part of the problem and with profuse thanks for yellen for turning up the session ends questioning turns to cybersecurity and what steps fed has taken to address the risks yellen says cybersecurity is one of most significant risks the country faces and the fed is working with others to make sure there is a system to deal with them have to make sure controls financial institutions have in place are sufficient we are proposing highest standards firms of systemic importance should meet and it is a broad threat and fed cannot deal with it alone she says that in every country that has suffered hyperinflation it was because central banks had to compromise their independence yellen defends the independence of central banks she says congress establishes the goals for monetary policy but it is critical the central bank can make independent decisions to pursue those goals without interference while being accountable and transparent they need to be able to not think about the short term and sometimes they need to do unpopular things ken odeluga yellen says wants to serve full fed term despite criticism by pres elect realdonaldtrump they also disagree on doddfrank fincl regs november yellen is asked about the dodd frank the legislation brought in to regulate financial institutions after the financial crisis which donald trump has talked about repealing yellen says she would not want to turn back the clock and would not want all the improvements under dodd frank eliminated more on the aftermath of the election yellen says that markets are anticipating fiscal policy will be expansionary and this could have inflationary consequences but she adds that there is still much uncertainty about future policies she says we will watch what decisions are made and factor them into our calculations i believe uncertainty about these matters will last for some considerable time we have said gradual increases in rates are likely near term risks do seem reasonably balanced the judgement the fed committee reached in november is appropriate one yellen no i cannot i fully intend to serve out my term which ends in january as a reminder donald trump had been critical of yellen and there had been some talk she might resign if he won the election now for questions yellen my own judgement is looking at economic data thus far the evidence since we met in november is consistent with the expectation of strengthening growth inflation moving up there will be many economic policies which congress and the administration will consider in the months to come when there is greater clarity the committee will have to factor that into their assessments and perhaps adjust the outlook depending what happens yellen has begun her testimony janet yellen photograph us congress as the introductions begin at congress ahead of yellens testimony analysts continue to suggest a rate rise in december is pretty much nailed on neil wilson at etx capital said roll on december aside from a slight rise in us treasury yields weve seen little major effect on financial markets after janet yellen said interest rates could rise soon the fact is a december rate hike has already been priced in markets think there is a roughly chance the fed will increase the target federal funds rate it now looks almost impossible for the fed not to raise rates next month its painted itself in a corner and has to respond with a hike or all hell will break loose in the
a man who uses misogynistic language and has been accused of sexual assault is soon to become the president of the united states of america for feminists desperate to see the countrys first female president the result was devastating how could someone with such disregard for womens rights become leader donald trump boasted about being able to freely grope women because he is famous and by the end of the race different women had come forward to accuse him of sexual assault he also suggested during his campaign that women should face some form of punishment for having abortions before backtracking and saying states and congress should take the lead with lawmaking on this matter after the publication of a video in which he describes grabbing women by the pussy experts and many non experts predicted that hed lost the female vote but this turned out to be incorrect it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their actionslauraaccording to cnn exit polls of white women voted for trump those without a college degree supported trump over democrat candidate hillary clinton by nearly two to one white women with a college degree only narrowly voted in favour of clinton by six percentage points by contrast of black women and of latinas voted for clinton some feminists are finding it difficult to comprehend why women werent so offended by trumps misogyny that they voted for clinton en mass we interviewed women across america to find out why they voted for trump and why they describe themselves as feminists heres what they said laura a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or expected she thinks and makes her own choicesgovernment worker laura who lives in the much fought over state of florida voted for trump she describes herself as socially moderate financially independent and educated every female i know either friends or co workers except for one voted for trump i want to show it was not only men or non college educated citizens that voted trump i am an economic conservative who is registered as a non party affiliate i feel that trump has the best economic polices to create jobs and therefore rebuild the economy i truly thought the video of trump was as its been dubbed locker room talk having two brothers boyfriends and a fiance i can make an educated guess that all heterosexual men have bragged about their exploits with women to another man at some point i believe in equality between the sexes i have the right and capability to make my own decisions and live the life i choose for myself because i am a feminist i know and exercised my right not to be put in a box or voting group and to freely think and make my own judgment as to who i thought would be the best candidate for president it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their actions a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or expected she thinks and makes her own choices i thought the sexual allegations were unsubstantiated and therefore equivalent to rumours and campaign mudslinging if these women had truly been assaulted why wait until one month before the election to come forward to the press not the authorities i thought it incredibly hypocritical to characterise him as a sexual predator when we know for a fact that bill clinton is one and hillary helped him cover it up through libel and slander of the women who did come forward this didnt change my opinion about him except for maybe a more sympathetic attitude and feeling that the media was treating him unfairly a persons gender has no bearing whatsoever in their qualifications for a job including the presidency hillary was not clear as to what her policies as president would be except to maybe continue with the same failed practices her policies would not have helped our depressed and stagnant economy i believe trumps plans for job creation benefits everyone including minority groups i also ascribe and have for a long time to a more isolationist foreign policy alyssa im not going to vote for somebody because of their gender or race trump voter alyssa a mother of two boys who is currently not employed calls herself a feminist on most things but she is fiercely opposed to voting for someone based on gender alone instead she backed trump who shares her own beliefs including not raising taxes her home state of ohio a mix of rust belt big city appalachia farmland and suburbs more white and less educated than the national mean voted for trump at some things i would be a feminist but it doesnt mean i vote for someone because she has a vagina ive always voted republican and always support the party they pushed a female candidate through to break the glass ceiling of a perceived gender equality biasheatherat the end of the day the video of trump did not affect my support for him what he says and what he does dont matter in those senses because im looking for somebody that has the same beliefs as i do in running a country at the end of the day were all sinners and we all say things like this it isnt uncommon we act like the president of united states should be some holy person we can go through all the us presidents and you will see sexual dysfunctions in all of their personal lives even hillarys husband had an affair at the end of the day my husbands sex life does not involve his work life and my sex life does not involve my day to day life these women that came out about trump could have been hoping for media attention or maybe just simply paid by hillary to make her criminal issues look
over the next few years the future of cycling in britain may depend on what happens in london the place that has done more than any other to build segregated bike lanes only six months after they opened the new tracks have succeeded beyond our wildest dreams the embankment one carries an astonishing people an hour in the peaks according to transport for londons alan bristow but theyve also been controversial with regular claims made that the lanes arent being used or are causing pollution theres now what looks like a campaign to turn back the clock and reclaim road space for the motor vehicle will the citys mayor sadiq khan buckle well during mays election he made some great promises he signed a pledge to triple the number of miles of protected cycle lanes on londons roads he told british cyclings chris boardman he wanted to see more segregated cycle lanes and new routes he promised to accelerate the cycling programme increase the pace of change and increase the proportion of transport for london s budget spent on cycling in the next couple of months well know fairly definitively whether he means it under the previous mayor for whom i was cycling commissioner it took us three years and two months to build londons first miles of protected main road cycle tracks we are three years and six months from the end of khans term if he does want another miles he needs to get started so far despite the pledge to accelerate work the opposite has happened no new projects have been announced on existing projects most work has stopped and one of them on the westway flyover has this week been scrapped officially its a rerouting but theres no word on what the new route will be and it seems improbable that the tory councils who control the only alternative roads will allow a meaningful scheme so here are a few tests in no particular order of whether khan is serious about cycling will he finish the projects already open work on the last central london section of the east west superhighway along birdcage walk and past buckingham palace was supposed to be complete last month it has not even started leaving a half mile gap and one of londons nastiest junctions in the middle of the route to fill that gap theres a shovel ready scheme fully consulted on fully designed and with all permissions in place the royal parks has been won round it wont even take much traffic space birdcage walk already has a spare lane unused by motors other agreed schemes are slipping badly an extension to the north south superhighway was consulted on in february approved by city hall in september but wont actually start building until next summer val shawcross khans deputy mayor for transport has said that work on the buckingham palace project will begin in january whether it does and whether it keeps the birdcage walk route will be the first test and a fairly easy one will he open the gates to the hampstead nimbies in february we consulted on a cycle superhighway from swiss cottage to the west end via the outer circle of regents park removing a hideous gyratory and closing four of the parks eight traffic gates to motors for most of the day youd still be able to drive into the park but it would be harder to use it as a through route it has public support but a minority have protested that ending their rat run will destroy the area seal off hampstead and cause a solid queue to hatfield none of this of course is true in august city hall announced that the scheme cycle superhighway would proceed with some changes however close scrutiny reveals that no decision to build it has in fact been taken my fear is that the changes will include keeping the park gates open and allowing the outer circle to remain full of traffic rendering what was always a fairly modest scheme essentially pointless this should again be a pretty easy call for khan the entitled of arent his voters their case is weak and their cause isnt popular save our rat run i cant believe no one ever wrote a folk song about that will he announce new schemes and stick with them sadiqs replacement for the westway route may be a scheme we in fact planned and as an addition to it cycle superhighway originally supposed to run from central london to hammersmith chiswick and hounslow before i left i approved preliminary designs for the olympia hounslow stretch with a consultation date of december this year that wont happen though shawcross has said its coming next year to partly make up for the loss of the westway khan will need to persuade kensington chelsea council to accept segregated tracks on kensington high street not something we managed in my time then an even taller order hell have to get them to stick with it after the inevitable nimby backlash the rest of the route wont be easy either there are more than a dozen further designed up new schemes for major accident and death blackspots and several new routes which havent seen the light of day whether they emerge will be another important test and a much tougher one will he control the timetable or let others control it our most sophisticated opponents were seldom overt or frontal their key weapon was the timetable and their key technique was the filibuster they would agree to things then find endless reasons not to do them or theyd give the impression they could be won over if only we had a few more consultations impact assessments stakeholder meetings or working groups but of course no consultation could ever be long enough team khan risks playing into these peoples hands talking as if theres some process that can make cycling schemes acceptable to everyone but while meaningful
in robert and helen lynd a husband and wife team of researchers travelled from new york city into the heart of the midwest to undertake a study of daily life in an ordinary american town muncie indiana the lynds approached their mission in much the same spirit that joseph conrad entered the heart of darkness to look upon denizens of middle america as an anthropologist might chronicle the strange customs of another race interactive timelinewhile many sociologists were quite willing to discuss dispassionately the quaintly patterned ways of behaving that make up the customs of uncivilised people helen lynd wrote for many others it was distinctly distasteful to turn with equal candour to the life of their fellow americans yet nothing can be more enlightening than to gain precisely that degree of objectivity and perspective with which we view savage peoples the lynds didnt happen upon muncie by chance indeed they scoured the country in search of a city as representative as possible of contemporary american life something that could stand in for the whole of american culture in the bestselling book they published five years later which would become a classic work of american sociology they did not name muncie or any of its citizens they simply called it middletown for the past six months the idea of the real people out there has been the preoccupation of most journalists first during britains eu referendum campaign and then as donald trump ran away with the republican primaries commentators opined from the metropolis while reporters ventured to the parishes to anthropologise the white working class editors charged their employees with finding out why they are so angry what has made them so disaffected what is driving their erratic electoral behaviour but the real problem is baked into the premise they are not us we dont know them their views are not often heard in newsrooms and they know it and so the journalist swoops in for a day or two armed with polls reports and expectations and finds the angry and disaffected people they are looking for the reporters question their subjects on the holy trinity of identities race sex and class but only one at a time and then they find some local colour and hurry back to the office pundits speculated whether hillary clinton could win texas when it turned out she couldnt even win michiganthe protagonists of any given story are easily slotted into already existing archetypes soccer moms white van men and placed within a narrative arc that makes sense of their views a revolt against the elites or why the right must embrace diversity or how the left needs to learn values and then election night arrives and the whole thing collapses under the weight of its own hubris before starting all over again the next day with the hasty construction of a new narrative to explain what happened i came to muncie in the path of the lynds although not necessarily in their tradition in the hope that i might do something a bit different like them i did not happen on muncie by chance it sits in a swing county both barack obama and george w bush won it twice and voted for both donald trump and bernie sanders in their respective primaries rejecting the pleas of both party establishments it seemed like an ideal place to avoid the made for tv spectacle of a presidential election which had pundits at one stage speculating about whether hillary clinton could win texas when it turned out she couldnt even win michigan i arrived on the night of the second debate to find people more embarrassed than angry looking for a debate watching party i went to the fickle peach a bar in town where the three screens were set to either sunday night football or baseball dylan the barman put the debate on for me with the sound down and two of us watched it with subtitles it was two days after news broke of donald trump bragging about grabbing women by the pussy when his election prospects were understood to be over when i left town a month later trump was putting together his transition team and meeting obama in the white house on election night a small crowd had gathered in the fickle peach the results were on every screen with the sound turned up as the liberal audience some crying watched the certainties of just a few hours earlier evaporate their hopes crushed in real time state by state we woke to a new normal the object of our derision would soon have the nuclear codes gingerly but deliberately respect for the process the office and its trappings superseded the moral issue of what the victor had said and done en route to victory many of the very same people who just the day before said he was unfit for office now told america to unite around him meanwhile those who had not seen any of this coming confidently told us what we had seen and what would be coming next middletown had spoken for reasons to do with class gender race masculinity disaffection populism elitism or all of the above it had made common cause with a garish new york city multimillionaire to send a message to the establishment reporters were dispatched not to test this thesis but illustrate it when the lynds arrived in muncie years ago to begin their fieldwork they had more resources and more time than are generally available to a newspaper reporter they had two research assistants and they stayed for the best part of two years they published their findings in with a detailed portrayal of a town becoming less devout and less deferent more educated and more automated where women were less likely to bake their own bread and more likely to work outside the home young people led more independent lives public speeches were getting shorter and schoolgirls preferred cotton to silk

graham a senator from south carolina told reporters on capitol hill when asked about the bannon appointment ive never met him i wouldnt know him if he walked in the door he said before adding of breitbart the website in question was a friendly site to the alt right i dont like them and they dont like me and im glad marco rubio said he had no reaction to the bannon news even though the former breitbart chairman used his website to try and undermine the florida senators political career the president has a right to choose his own staff said rubio who ran unsuccessfully against trump for the republican nomination but was re elected to a second term in the senate last week rubio also dismissed speculation that he might serve in trumps cabinet saying he had not spoken with the president

or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control barack obama used his last foreign tour as president to warn against the rise of divisive politics with the global ascent of what he described as coarse nationalism and tribalism apparently referring to donald trumps decision to appoint stephen bannon as his chief strategist in athens a city he repeatedly hailed as the birthplace of democracy the outgoing leader spoke of the dangers posed by such politics with the stark reminder that not that long ago europe had been turned into a bloodbath because of them i do believe separate and apart from any particular election or movement that we are going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of nationalism or ethnic identity or tribalism that is built around an us and a them he said

minister obama sought to distance himself
in the end david foster wallace summed it up as well as anyone when he said that acceptance is usually a matter of fatigue more than anything else and fatigue is a good a word as any to describe the essendon supplements scandal jobe watsons decision to hand back the brownlow medal and place the game ahead of individual honour was rightly applauded particularly in the context of the clubs interminable tactic of fighting the afl asada and wada that the bombers chairman lindsay tanner put out an accompanying statement saying that essendon take s responsibility for placing jobe in this position and unreservedly apologises to him and his family was also a welcome change in rhetoric afl brownlow medal awarded to trent cotchin and sam mitchell read more but while watsons statement was contrite it also hinted that he was simply worn down and acknowledged that his decision did not in any way reflect a change in his personal opinion instead it reflected his desire to put to a close further speculation about what should be done with the brownlow medal this shouldnt diminish the fact that watson reached a decision that should not have been his to begin with but rather one the afl appeared unwilling or incapable of making despite being able to use the cover of being a signatory to the world anti doping code you cant help but feel had watson held his ground the afl would have outsourced the decision to afl fans through an online poll proudly brought to you by its official sponsors a breach of this code is of course something the afl should not outsource or even have feelings about it is simply something that is wada operates on the consensus that performance enhancing drugs are bad for sports for any middle pew catholic moral arguments around the players culpability are almost of a secondary concern it is the athlete who is ultimately responsible for what goes into their body the lines have been drawn the lines exist and the court of arbitration for sport has upheld that essendon players including watson crossed the lines this is the framework in which the afl agreed to work within is it not expecting too much of a footballs governing body to well you know that the afl asked watson to make a case to keep the brownlow is yet another example of an administration thats sick of its burden but lacking any other bluff to run other than taking out the trash during the white heat of the us election to announce that seven afl clubs had been handed fines by the league for failing to keep player information up to date in regards to drug testing or there is lachie whitfields baby sitters club adventure at the home of craig lambert the missed drugs test and the decision to cut a deal with whitfield lambert and graeme allan that saw them accept negotiated bans that fall under the afls disrepute rules rather than the anti doping code and the four year penalty and if the essendon saga is a guide an arduous four year process that comes with it although in allans case the point is largely moot having resigned from his position as collingwoods general manager of football in the wake of tuesdays announcement the negotiated resolution was dependent on all three agreeing to the terms of the suspensions that is to say should either allan or lambert have refused the deal preferring to plead their innocence at cas the player they were allegedly trying to protect could be on the hook for a career ending suspension for lambert who former brownlow medallist simon black said goes above and beyond in terms of the welfare work he does for players and their families the decision wouldve been a no brainer the negotiated wording of the charges and admissions also appear to be the most recent matinee in which the afl reveals its slight of hand in applying punishments that allow those who transgressed to avoid an admission of guilt the afls tactics around the whitfield issue bring to mind the findings from researchers at northwestern university that rhesus monkeys would starve themselves rather than pull a chain that administers an electric shock to a companion unfortunately at the afl it appears that the rhesus monkeys have left the basement and taken up corner offices gws player lachie whitfield handed six month ban for missed drugs test read more but as the study suggests even monkeys occasionally pull the right chain in announcing that the brownlow medal be awarded to west coasts sam mitchell and richmonds trent cotchin afl chairman mike fitzpatrick came close to striking the right tone both effusive in his praise for watsons noble and honourable gesture and in mouthing the supplement scandals stain on the game however given the afls hesitant handling of the saga up until this point fitzpatricks stain on the game remark had a hollow feel to it not unlike the acoustic qualities of a bowling alley while both mitchell and cotchin are worthy medallists had the commission vacated the medal it would have brought the severity of the supplement scandal and its sorry impact on the game into relief but perhaps the commission is as worn down as the rest of us and was never in a statement making mindset instead simply wanting it to go away with as little fuss as possible so with the brownlow returned and the playing bans served the supplements saga has largely been drawn to a close and it is watson who is the only actor in this drama to have enhanced his reputation though the sad fact is that it still has a way to play yet and will not be over until watson and his team mates know once and for all exactly what they were injected with unfortunately that is something we may never know and perhaps were too fatigued to do anything other

trump morality and realitythere has been a huge emotional outpouring of doom and woe about the election of donald trump it is probably much ado about nothing very different in reality us presidents have very limited powers just ask barack obama he never could close guantnamo and it took him until his second term to get some modest health care reforms and an inadequate minimum wage trump will have many of the same disadvantages as a democratic president because he is not really a member of the republican establishment and they have few common values he will most likely be in the position of an independent president and cannot rely on the support of congress for good or bad initiatives the main independent presidential power appears to be to commit aggression george w bush and tony blair killed a lot of innocent people obama and clinton between them launched lots of bombs and drones and clinton probably deserved the warmonger jibe that trump threw at her so why do we think he will be worse calm down it will soon be business as usual ray ferris victoria british columbia canada there is any amount of analysis of the disastrous outcome of the us presidential election attempting to explain economic political sociological and psychological factors in the electorate but there is something missing the factor of individual moral responsibility we should not confuse understanding with excusing consider each voter standing privately in the voting booth pencil hovering over the box next to the name trump at that moment every single voter knows full well that this candidate is a predatory misogynist racist narcissistic demagogic bully so if they choose to mark a vote for him they are demonstrating their collusion with him effectively sharing some or all of those characteristics there is absolutely no excuse for that individual act felix anselldreia portugal ive come round to thinking that trump is far cleverer than we all thought his philosophy is to appeal to our worst angels our basest instincts and then to rule us probably to everyones relief by calling forth our better angels hillary and the elites operated the other way round c lendoncanberra act australiapolitical arrogance over tradei too thought that people power would end these eu free trade deals and was sure that the hundreds of thousands of people who had demonstrated against the transatlantic trade and investment partnership in september had convinced governments to give it second thoughts indeed for me it seemed blindingly obvious that these deals are highly undesirable they threaten environmental and social legislation will nudge countless small and medium sized businesses into bankruptcy and leave governments wide open to malicious legal cases from powerful corporations so i was deeply disappointed when brussels browbeat the walloons into agreeing to the comprehensive economic and trade agreement between the eu and canada indeed i was so affected by this that i ended up taking the train to brussels to be there at the historic moment when our leaders signed away our democracy it was a sad affair outside the building with barbed wire and riot police present to keep just a handful of harmless demonstrators at bay when politicians show this level of arrogance and just carry on regardless of strong public opinion then it is any wonder that voters drift away to radical parties i can see us arriving at a highly dangerous situation where even engaged moderate voters either dont bother voting or decide to vote for anything but the establishment alan mitchamcologne germanyempathy is universalas i always read the guardian back to front owen joness article on empathy hit me in the face maybe it was the most important article in the issue because its about every single one of us personally my parents whose ancestors came from all over europe brought me up in england with the open door ethic our house was often buzzing with foreigners be they students au pairs distant relatives friends of friends seeking temporary board and lodging just recently i welcomed feras a syrian asylum seeker into my home here in france while he was getting his papers sorted out he is now settled with his wife and children not too far from where i live so i can keep up the new friendship so my advice to anyone who really has empathy and a spare bed is to try sharing your living space with people fleeing war and strife you then find out how enriching this simple gesture actually is lea yaunerpessac france owen jones argues admirably that we all possess a natural empathy for other human beings but once we lose that it is easy for injustice to flourish he is only repeating a founding principle of the three abrahamic religions judaism islam and christianity in this age of closing borders and hostility to refugees let us remember that god tested abraham by sending angels disguised as travelling strangers without asking any questions abraham welcomed them in washed their feet and gave them food and shelter constance lever tracyadelaide south australiahuman rights and wrongswith amusement and astonishment i read that russia has lost its seat at the uns human right council i agree that russia as a perpetual right abuser shouldnt have a say in this but it makes me wonder that brazil with its displacement of small scale farmers for soy monoculture egypt with thousands of protesters in prison or civil war iraq made it into the circle not to mention the us or uk which waged illegal wars or saudi arabia with stoning and beheading by

on a sunday afternoon in early september sister bernadetta boggian drove into the compound of the catholic convent where she lived in bujumbura the capital of burundi and called out to her fellow nuns there was no sign of the other elderly sisters who lived in the convent so sister bernadetta went to find father mario pulcini the head of the mission to ask if he had seen them he tried phoning them but there was no reply so they walked across the shady compound to the nuns quarters where they found the curtains drawn they knocked and called out but there was no answer the priest was about to force open the door but sister bernadetta walked around to a side entrance which was unlocked inside she found a horrific scene sister olga raschietti was lying dead in her bedroom blood pooling around her head in the bedroom next door lay the body of sister lucia pulici both women had been stabbed and their throats slit sister lucia would have celebrated her birthday the next day sister olga was together these three elderly friends had worked for almost years in south kivu an eastern province of the democratic republic of congo that was at the centre of a series of conflicts sometimes known collectively as the great african war the deadliest in the continents modern history when the three sisters finally left south kivu for burundi they were looking forward to a more peaceful retirement posting father mario called the local police and his superiors in italy lorries and pickup trucks arrived quickly disgorging police and soldiers and security forces circled the compound at around the congregation poured out of mass in their brightly coloured sunday best straight into a crime scene a papal official stood over the bodies and wept outside the convent young women the sisters had taught to sew wailed with grief when noises woke sister bernadetta in the night she phoned father mario i think the killer is still here she saidsister bernadetta who remained collected throughout accompanied the bodies to the morgue and then returned to the convent father mario wanted to find somewhere else for sister bernadetta and the other nuns to sleep but the sisters insisted they wanted to stay together and sleep at the convent as night fell heavily armed police patrolled the compound when noises woke sister bernadetta during the night she telephoned father mario who was still awake writing down an account of the previous day i think the killer is still here sister bernadetta told him in a shaky voice the priest hurried to the nuns quarters but he was too late sister bernadetta was already dead in an act of violence unimaginable to those who knew the small and wiry year old the killer had cut off her head the next morning shocked and angry locals closed their businesses and gathered outside the convent to protest against the murders people claimed the killers were being protected by the police some protesters saw the notorious head of the state intelligence agency general adolphe nshimirimana enter the convent some time later father mario emerged from the gates and appealed to the protesters to disperse peacefully three weeks on a leaflet was found at the convent urging the mission not to pursue an investigation into the crimes the murders at the convent horrified burundians not just because of their brutality but because they took place almost a decade after the end of the countrys year civil war in which were slaughtered and million a fifth of the population fled their homes in the wake of that conflict which divided the nation along ethnic lines between hutu and tutsi burundians vowed that their country would never again experience such brutal violence church missions to countries riven by long term civil strife are liable to get caught up in toxic politics the powerful catholic church in burundi which represents of burundians has come under suspicion for providing aid to militant groups during the civil war but it has also regularly criticised government abuses and paid a price for it in during the civil war when the majority hutus rose up against the abusive tutsi military gunmen executed two priests and a lay preacher suspected of supporting the rebels a year later a moderate tutsi archbishop was murdered by gunmen more than catholic clerics were assassinated in burundi in the first three years of the civil war when church leaders have denounced the violence of the countrys warring factions political leaders have often seen them as a threat and done whatever was necessary to silence them the murders at the convent followed a ripple of unrest across the region in april the united nations envoy to burundi had cabled un headquarters in new york with a warning that the hutu led ruling party was distributing weapons and uniforms to its youth wing in some areas particularly outside the cities the group acts in collusion with local authorities and with total impunity it acts like a militia over and above the police the army and the judiciary the cable said the group was described as one of the major threats to peace in burundi and to the credibility of the elections as they are responsible for most politically motivated violence against opposition the government of burundi issued a rebuttal to the un vehemently denying that it had been funding arming or training the youth wing known as the imbonerakure nonetheless the cable was received with alarm the italian nuns bernadette boggia olga raschietti and lucia pulici who were murdered in a convent in bujumbura the capital of burundi photograph afpa few weeks after the un cable burundis most prominent human rights activist pierre claver mbonimpa told listeners of the popular radio station radio publique africaine that

presided over the semi public enterprise of his presidential campaign we know he has a track record of tolerating the kind of internal rivalry that ends up in ritual slaughter his first campaign manager corey lewandowski warred openly with his second campaign manager paul manafort and the same goes for the third and fourth people to fill those roles kellyanne conway and steve bannon himself chaos is trumps coin of the realm the only complex situation he seems to manage with some consistency are his tax avoidance schemes the bannon priebus announcement was carefully constructed with bannons appointment ahead of priebus such formalities do not go unnoticed in the corridors of power of the nations capital where the pecking order is the only game in town of the two bannon is by far the superior operator having turned breitbart from a cult into a powerhouse of white nationalism needless to say this is not a positive development for an immensely diverse nation with a long history of racial violence priebus for his part has shown his house of cards talent by staging the coup that ousted his former boss michael steele priebus seized the job of rnc chair just after steeles rnc swept the board in the mid term elections but with no experience in the executive or legislative branches of government priebus is hopelessly out of his depth at best hes a party hack who will follow the orders of his friends on capitol hill at worst hell drown as he attempts to manage the west wing the federal bureaucracy national security crises washington politics the venal media and a president who has returned to twitter all of which makes him easy pickings for bannon who is offensive in every sense of the word according to sworn testimony by his ex wife bannon is so virulently antisemitic that he insisted he didnt want his girls going to school with jews not for nothing as the anti defamation league gone public with its opposition to his appointment the coming bannon priebus cage fight is only one side of the struggle for power inside the administration for the real influence lies in the hands of trumps children and son in law already jared kushner husband to ivanka has reportedly ousted the head of the transition the hapless and gormless new jersey governor chris christie ostensibly christies downfall was because he is embroiled in the scandal known as bridgegate but the proceedings about the closure of the george washington bridge have been rumbling for three years a more likely scenario is that christie could not be trusted with such a powerful transition job because he presided as us attorney in new jersey over the prosecution of kushners father blood is so much thicker than water especially inside trump tower with so many competing fiefdoms the trump presidency has already sown the seeds of its own chaos can these people successfully navigate their way out of a paper bag never mind the confirmation process that could doom their own administration in case people have forgotten with full control of congress and at the height of his popularity the newly elected president obama stumbled repeatedly with nominees whose tax returns were questionable and who seemed too cozy with corporate power perhaps president trump can help his nominees dodge their tax questions by ordering the irs to audit them all as quickly as possible as for his desire to drain the swamp of corporate influence those promises are now being managed by a small army of lobbyists who control his transition how clueless is team trump according to the wall street journal they had no idea the entire west wing would evacuate on inauguration day next year that they would have to appoint every single member of staff except for the permanent help tending to the building and grounds as a result president obama intends to spend more time helping his successor understand the scale of what hes about to take on the first black president is going to help train the white president whose campaign was built on questioning his own citizenship obama started his presidency winning the nobel peace prize but he ends it deserving some kind of sainthood like all good shakespearean tragedies the trump presidency is presaging its own collapse at the height of its glory the priebus bannon family disputes will corrode the west wing from within they are the manifestation of a leader who projects certainty but cannot decide if he wants to repeal all of obamacare or keep parts of it if he wants to end abortion rights or force women to travel to get abortions if he wants to bring the country together or end the wave of racist intimidation that is being spray painted across our schools and churches the republican establishment may think they can manage trump through priebus but they are about to discover that this dumpster fire of a campaign just turned into a brushfire of a transition
when it looked like the news couldnt get any worse it did worse in a way that dwarfed our petty elections and clueless pendulum analyses worse in a way that dusted the present with the irrelevance of history in the journal science advances five of the worlds most eminent climatologists warned of the possibility that warming may be significantly worse than we thought previous consensus was that the earths average temperature would go up by between life altering but manageable and cataclysmic now the range suggested by one projection goes up to which is game over by the century it relates to the us because their incoming president has promised actively determinedly to bring about the worst case scenario acting on the now familiar pre enlightenment logic that because its beyond the limits of his intellect to comprehend it climate change doesnt exist but it relates to or rather clarifies things on a deeper level rational american citizens are post trump going through the same grief trajectory as many of us did after brexit the debate is all fierce conjecture about how they lost whom they failed to listen to whose anger had been ignored and by which people for how many decades but underneath that is a profound crisis of civic engagement a deep agonising question what is the point if reason doesnt matter if truth doesnt if solidarity is for wimps if experts are charlatans whats the point of getting involved in this circus paul krugman identifies it as a creed of quietism conceding its definitely tempting to conclude that the world is going to hell but that theres nothing you can do about it so why not just make your own garden grow ultimately he chooses engagement to save the soul i dont see how you can hang on to your own self respect unless youre willing to stand up for the truth the american journalist nancy letourneau took it one step further and tried to find a positive in the powerlessness via gandhi whatever you do in life will be insignificant but its very important that you do it patriotism self respect for the sake of your neighbours for the good of your children these are all credible and decent reasons to carry on fighting the hard right even when it knocks over your strongest arguments with a casual breath but the urgency of the climate crisis is a better one authoritarians strongmen fascists whatever you call the figureheads of the new right you know one thing they are never good stewards of the earth to accept this political order as a desperately sad but immovable new normal means accepting that the earth will burn and theres nothing we can do this cannot be borne in practical terms this means picking winnable fights showing solidarity and being visible i cant do very much about a country not my own and its adherence to the paris treaty but i can join a action on the uk governments stance on wind energy you cant do very much about oil exploration in alaska but you possibly can do something about keeping the gas in the rocks of the ribble valley capitalise on victory there is no more buoying story i can think of than that the balcolmbe fracking protest turned into a green lit solar farm when the world gets its first solar powered transport network when a country runs for four days entirely on renewables celebrate if theres a synchronised global march for the climate go to it there has always been a tendency to write mass environmental protests off as self indulgence pointless by definition because their participants will go back the very next day to their fossil fuelled lives intolerance of imperfection is fatally corrosive to any movement but to environmentalism most of all it is not possible to be perfectly green yet you can be a vivid green by turning up this has been the year the liberals lost every argument explanations range from they lost because they were wrong all along to the right always prospers from economic hardship but there is a growing consensus around one thing we remain quite good at interpreting data pointing out incoherence making sarcastic remarks but we lost the ability to make a bold ambitious sincere and plausible case for a better future settling instead for a future that wasnt worse this has been the case across europe and the us it cannot be blamed on british politicians singly or en masse its global scope has led many to look for the cause in global trends financialisation corporate greed things that for brevity we class as neoliberalism optimism accrues around each hopeful action each small victory until it becomes obvious that it is the driving forcei wonder whether the answer is something much simpler we stopped making the case for hope when we stopped feeling hopeful the spectre of climate change much more influential on the left than on even the sensible right loomed so large that we reasonably enough began to fear the future at the same time losing confidence in our collective ability to do anything but mess stuff up the pessimism infected our political language left it pale and limp but it didnt actually halt progress discoveries were made and solutions found we have in likelihood the technical expertise to halt emissions forever between electric cars and solar glass between wind power and cross continental supergrids we have amassed enough sheer ingenuity to fix the unfixable the only obstacle granted its a significant one is a post truth politics that would prefer to pretend theres nothing to fix optimism is not something you can decide to rediscover nor can you fake it with rhetoric its not something one really good leader can bestow it accrues around each hopeful action each small victory until it becomes obvious that it is the driving force many of us frame our interest in the environment as a care for
i have spent years pushing against apatriarchy that tries to tell me what to look like what to feel who to demur to and that there are many things that icant do because im female the weaker sex i gave birth i wouldnt be balled up on the ground if kicked in the groin its tiring and it takes a toll and ill keep pushing in my own steady way for thomas frank to leave sexism out of his response piece wholesale and to choose to use the word shrill toward the end of his article a word which conjures up images of women leaves me frustrated and tired frank whom im sure is a wonderful person in many respects is as sexist as the next and hasnt faced his own inner demons whether or not you think hillary clinton had the best interest of the lower class and working middle class in mind for frank to say that she isnt really competent that her email server was a real issue and that biden would have been a better choice is just a cloak for his inability to face himself in the mirror to his credit or to the detriment of at least of half of us frank is not alone in his unacknowledged sexism even when we pit a woman against the least competent candidate we could imagine for arguably the most important job there is our society as a whole cant stomach voting for her voters literally stayed home from the polls rather than elect a woman lets throw this frank article in the virtual trash where it belongs and instead read response articles penned by feminists we have work to do india viola amid the negativity and strong words about the result of the presidential election it is important that we stay positive and true to our morals and standards unlike donald trump as ayoung woman feminist and member of the younger generation i can certainly say that i will not tolerate trumps revolting words against women and those who dont fit his mould of a perfect citizen from this i am reminded of the standards of how men should behave towards women with respect and compassion the doom and gloom events of this year have taught and emphasised to me the importance of staying positive and not letting morals and standards slip because of the behaviour of a leader such as trump furthermore hillary clinton has shown particularly to women and girls that anything is possible if you truly believe and that women can be and are champions for this as she said in her speech there is still much work to be done and the only way we will aid the work ahead is if we stand together with positive energy and hope against people like trumps fear and discrimination eleanor sutcliffe in an otherwise searching article sarah churchwell falls prey to the same negativism in attitudes toward women politicians that shes writing about while it is true that a staggering of white women voted against clinton it is not true that once again a female candidate did not carry even the female vote some of women voted for clinton not all white but all women marcia saunders is it possible that we have underestimated donald trump is it possible that the rage racism boasts unpleasant vilification of hillary clinton and ludicrous promises were his carefully calculated pose to woo those voters he recognised as disillusioned with the washington establishment and longing for change that the wall was never going to be built that the secretary of state was never going to be sent to jail that the clampdown on muslim communities could be quietly overlooked that nato would survive and trade treaties would remain untorn he is where he wants to be he will have real power he will use it to get what he really wants he is a wheeler dealer a negotiator he knows how to choose and use talented people who can deliver his goals let us by all means be fearful of what those goals might be but let us also look beyond the smokescreen of his performance in the campaign listen to the change of tone of his carefully emollient victory speech remember how he outmanoeuvred the other contenders and shrugged off the disdain of the republican hierarchy let us hope that american liberals will not write him off as a fool who cannot possibly survive chris harris it is interesting to reflect that while all recent us presidents have made very public professions of attachment to the christian faith donald trump does not appear to share this none of his frequent utterances over the last year have alluded to faith and his actions and words during the election campaign were hardly those of a christian adherent quite the opposite so we may reasonably assume that the tea party religious right a key influence in his election is now headed up by an amoral infidel that would be one of the weirder outcomes of november robin wendt how come liberals encourage violence while exercising their freedom of speech this is something ill never understand you always speak of love and understanding when making conservatives knuckle under to your beliefs yet when you dont get your way after a fair election you unhinge like a crazed three year old filth property damage foul language and disrespect for the individual and country this is a liberal who loses your hypocrisy is staggering kimberly brockway the protesters in american cities all appear to be in the twenties this is the generation particularly if they are college educated who have been brought up on the shibboleths of political correctness safe spaces and cultural appropriation while being protected from viewpoints and literature running counter to their sensibilities all of these are bound to trump democracy they must be shell shocked edward thomas at a time of great uncertainty and anxiety following the election of
wednesday november its another big week for me and my cancer but its wednesday so its day and things are really hotting up before the us election weve got a good show ive managed to persuade piers morgan as one of the few british journalists who actually knows donald trump to speak to us from his car while hes filming in florida for itv and hes really interesting about what the media have and critically havent understood about the donald piers is also one of the people from the worlds of journalism and broadcasting many of whom if im honest i really cant claim to know especially well whove come forward to make my life easier by offering good wishes and positive thoughts and if my experience is anything to go by if you know anyone with a cancer diagnosis dont hesitate just drop them a line to let them know youre thinking of them genuinely appreciated all the show went well i think but im still suffering from occasionally quite acute fatigue i blame the radiotherapy as i didnt get anything like this in the course of seven cycles of heavy duty chemo also since the radiotherapy im really only able to sleep on my back the doctors reckon this might be because of the impact of the radiotherapy on my diaphragm which mightve been clipped by the high energy x ray beams anyhow alls well with the back sleeping malarkey except that at around five on thursday morning i get the first signs of an unmistakable and potentially very painful condition kidney stones i was first diagnosed with them more than years ago and every now and again since a new one would get stuck in my kidney and kick off a bout of renal colic the name given to the excruciating pain that can come with them this time a couple of painkillers see it off but stand by if you can face it for what happened a few days laterthursday novembermy first day on the new treatment paclitaxel and ramucirumab and my first visit to what one of the nurses laughingly described as business class otherwise known as the ppmdu so at there i am being shown into the unit discreetly hidden from the regular nhs day unit ill be visiting later for my paclitaxel infusion and guess what it looked very similar to its nhs equivalent and while were on the subject of business class the seats were actually identical staff were great of course and i got my first dose of the very expensive ramucirumab which the nhs currently wont finance the treatment was first class and as ive previously indicated ive no problem with the principle that i should pay for it as the nhs should be protected from additional unfunded treatment costs i choose to avail myself of but i still struggle with the royal marsden taking a markup simply to supply an already very expensive drug which by the way is already standard treatment as part of second line chemotherapy for my cancer in the us and charging a private patients day rate as a whole day for a treatment that takes just over an hour ive taken to calling it my very own cash for treatment scandal i hope theyre putting the money to good use which is perhaps something worth looking into anyhow having received my ramucirumab i was escorted back downstairs to rejoin the rest of the human race in the nhs mdu and do you know aside from having identical seats to upstairs i think there might actually be more space down here but time to get reacquainted with the cold cap this as its name suggests is a rubber cap attached to a refrigeration system that rapidly cools the wearers head thus reducing the risk of hair loss that some chemotherapy drugs otherwise more or less guarantee it doesnt work for everyone but it really worked for me over seven cycles of chemo and to be honest a few quizzical looks from other patients more used to seeing women using it and the endurance test that is the first minutes of wearing it as it literally freezes your scalp was a very small price to pay of course id forgotten how hard it would be and very nearly took it off but in the end the name of the new machines they now have at the marsden paxmans true and a well timed traquiliser from the staff got me though it and so far i still have hair on my head saturday novembertoday would turn out to be one of the most difficult since i was diagnosed back in march and none of it to do with my cancer or its metastases directly for a start i have been suffering with constipation which once it gets to or days as it has for me can become almost painfully uncomfortable then there was the discomfort under my right ribs put down to my liver playing up or more likely another hangover from the radiotherapy and to cap it all was the recurring renal colic from my age old kidney stones and their appalling sense of timing and heres the twist the painkillers co codamol a mixture of paracetamol and codeine tend to work less effectively over time but critically make you more constipated to cut a long story short saturday was a bit of a perfect storm in increasing discomfort and waiting until enough time had elapsed to allow me to take more painkillers which a no longer quite do the job and b make the you know what worse as a result i cant leave the house and have no desire to eat or drink and its the latter thats set to provide the biggest twist of all tuesday novemberdue at marsden for pre chemo blood tests preparatory to the next dose of new chemo due thursday by now after such a dreadful weekend i can
saturday night live began its first post election episode on a sombre note kate mckinnon dressed as hillary clinton singing several verses of leonard cohens hallelujah and playing piano im not giving up and neither should you she said at the end but then it was time for dave chappelles return to television with a standing ovation from the crowd for those people who remember chappelle mostly from first or reruns of comedy centrals the chappelle show and not his transcendent ahead of its time standup comedy you missed out go watch killing them softly and then come back to this recap chappelle couldve just stood up on that stage and bullshat his way through a staff written monologue and you wouldve laughed but he didnt it was vintage and it was real and here are the words that he said i didnt know that donald trump was going to win the election i did suspect it seemed like hillary was doing well at the polls and yet i know the whites you guys arent as full of surprises as you used to be and i think i speak for all of black america when i say that we are all praying for omarosa i dont even know what shes doing in the news i havent see white people this mad since the oj verdict im not saying im enjoying it im just saying ive never seen this before chappelle explained i watched a white riot in portland oregon on television the other night people said they did worth of damages every black person was watching that like amateurs im staying out of it he vowed im going to take a knee like the san franciso quarterback kaepernick let the whites figure this out amongst themselves weve been here before i dont think its even the most important thing were dealing with dont forget all the things that are going on shootings he said then riffing on how the pulse nightclub shooter was rumoured to have a grindr account you cant even go to the goddamn zoo without seeing a shooting out there he added they shot a gorilla in my local zoo and the cincinnati police said that shooting that gorilla was the toughest decision this department ever had to make i said you about to see a lot of n s in gorilla costumes in cincinnati why do we have to say that black lives matter he asked rhetorically now i admit thats not the best slogan but mcdonalds already took you deserve a break today i get its kind of catching because everyone else is biting it he said even the police bite it blue lives matter what was he born a police that is not a blue life thats a blue suit you dont like it take that suit off find a new job cause im gonna tell you right now if i could quit being black today id be out of the game returning to trump chappelle had a confession to make i feel bad saying it im staying in a trump hotel right now he revealed i dont know if hell make a good president but he makes a swell hotel suite im telling you that housekeeper comes in the morning cleans my room and im like hey housekeeper grab a big handful of pussy say you know boss said it was ok he also admitted that unlike some of his other wealthy black contemporaries hes not leaving but is going to stay to take advantage of the tax breaks first time i got some money it didnt work out like that he said most unlikely thing happened ever the first black president came out of nowhere like come on everybody lets start thinking about everyone else aw no n i just got this money i didnt think you was possible as a topic though trump remained irresistible trump went to go see obama last week you see that did you see trumps face when he came out of that meeting he asked the audience trump got sonned he looked shook he looked like he got shook but even chappelle couldnt resist an appeal to the emotion of the week at the end of his monologue did you need a skit fine the first skit was a too real look at a brooklyn results watching party at which chappelle played the only black guy in the room the white guests started off quite optimistic as the polls closed while chappelles character was increasingly cynical for the white guests who continue drinking and popping xanax to get through the results play against their beliefs in america while affirming chappelles cynicism at when in real life it was clear that clintons path to a win was incredibly narrow chris rock appeared i dont get you ladies he said the country is women if the country was black wed have a tonne of black presidents flava flav would be president cecily strongs character said oh my god america is racist chapelles reaction oh my god i think my great grandfather told me something like that but he was like a slave or something i dont know aidy bryants character echoed strongs saying i cant believe it why arent people turning out for hillary the way they did for barack obama chris rock had a response maybe because youre replacing a charismatic year old black guy with a year old white woman thats like the knicks replacing patrick ewing with neil patrick harris at the end as one of the actors declared the election the most shameful thing americas ever done rock and chappelle laughed and laughed for the second skit chappelle in a call back to the trope of his comedy central show in which he stood on stage and introduced his sketches stood on stage and introduced a sketch featuring many of the characters from his show as part of a homage to the walking dead
picture the scene a us air force f falcon has come down over syria the pilot is being held by islamic state which threatens to behead him video shows the pilot being tortured in a cage while the terrorists taunt new us president donald trump the pilots family plead for the white house to save him the drama is dominating the hour tv news networks its a media storm what will trump do answer nobody has a clue trump lacks military experience he has never served in the armed forces nor does he have any background in diplomacy what trump does have by all accounts is a short fuse a tendency to shoot first and ask questions later his predecessors would have played for time appealed to local allies or pursued deniable back door talks while examining options for a rescue but president trump is different unused to the awesome responsibility of the oval office under fierce pressure to act enraged by isiss personal jibes infuriated by accusations of dithering and determined not to show weakness it is easy to imagine trump making a wrong hasty and disastrous call with a few hot headed words translated into situation room orders trump could not only lose the pilot he could plunge the us inextricably into the quagmire of another middle east war there are grave doubts about trump inexperience volatile temperament and macho instinctsgrave doubts about trumps inexperience volatile temperament and macho instincts also apply in other global hotspots where a us presidents actions or inaction are always critical and sometimes lethal here are five dangerous flashpoint issues that could suddenly and unpredictably test the novice presidents judgment cool and common sense in the first days of his tenure syria and iraqthe isis hostage scenario is not wholly imaginary in january last year a royal jordanian air force pilot muath al kasasbeh was captured and burned to death in a cage by the jihadis after negotiations for his release failed similar repeat incidents involving us european and arab members of the anti isis coalition and local forces are becoming more likely as the endgame in the fight against the isis caliphate approaches the battle is being fought out on two main fronts one is the siege of mosul northern iraqs principal city trump has criticised the conduct of the campaign which involves the mainly shia iraqi army kurdish and sunni arab militias backed by us special forces commandos but he has not offered an alternative strategy much the same holds true of the attempt to seize the isis headquarters in raqqa in northern syria trump says that defeating terrorism is a top priority and he will bomb the shit out of isis but nobody including him appears to know what this means in practice if the battle goes badly will he escalate will he carpet bomb cities where millions of civilians live is he prepared to deploy us ground forces what will he do if as seems possible both sieges become bogged down or isis begins mass daily executions of civilians trump is also silent about turkeys significant military intervention in syria and iraq and its parallel fight with the kurds president recep tayyip erdoan wants two things from trump an end to us support for the kurdish peshmerga and the extradition of fethullah glen a cleric exiled in the us who he blames for last summers failed coup with isis on the back foot and the iraqi and syrian governments weakened the turkey kurd feud could explode at any time as the protagonists try to redraw national boundaries and compete for territory and resources russia and eastern europetrump has raised expectations that he can repair the us rupture with russia but a reset will come with a price in the first instance vladimir putin russias authoritarian president will want a relaxation or scrapping of punitive sanctions imposed after russia annexed crimea in to dismay in europe trump has suggested he may agree putin also seems likely to get his way in syria where russian forces have pushed his client bashar al assad to the brink of victory in aleppo and elsewhere trump has made no serious objection to russian actions in syria even though the un says they may constitute war crimes he seems content to have assad remain in power or even to treat him as an anti isis ally however the regimes renewed use of chemical weapons for example new russian atrocities or a suddenly escalating humanitarian and refugee catastrophe could all trigger a new crisis that blows up in trumps face forcing him to move against putin the idea of no fly zones and civilian safe havens still has backers if trump goes down this route he could end up directly confronting russias military the european allies cannot do much about trumps syria insouciance but they will strongly oppose him if he tries to run down the nato alliance as he has suggested russian pressure on natos easternmost members in the baltic republics poland and bulgaria in terms of political meddling disinformation cyber attacks missile deployments and military exercises is reaching new heights influence peddling and destabilisation operations are increasingly reported in moldova montenegro and elsewhere in the balkans eastern ukraine remains a ticking timebomb any of these flashpoints could ignite at any time in trumps first days european governments want to present a strong united front but trump seems more interested in buying russia off by acquiescing in putins reclamation of former cold war spheres of influence trumps disdain for the eu he loudly applauded britains vote to leave and critical european reaction to his election notably in germany and france point to a possible us europe schism down the road if it happens trump will have helped putin achieve a long cherished russian strategic objective shattering years of euro atlanticism chinabeijing shows no sign of backing away from its expansionist policies in the south china and east china seas it is busily transforming reefs and
did hillary clinton lose the election because she is a woman the answer is no but the reasons behind that no are complicated its certainly impossible to dismiss the presence of extreme sexism in the campaign the media narrative of a battle between a hard working highly qualified woman and a pussy grabbing man donald trump demonstrated over and over again that he loathes powerful women who do not bend to his will and so did many of his supporters much of his criticism of clinton often through taunting and bullying had strong sexist undertones and yet misogyny was not the reason that clinton was defeated she lost because lower and middle class white people wanted dramatic change and these voters felt that in spite of her gender she offered them more of the same during the election much was made of the extra pressure that clinton was under to conform to expectations of appearance and behaviour she received extreme attention to the way that she was dressed and groomed especially in contrast with the dishevelled and orange presentation of her opponent suspicion was cast on the meaning of her controlled delivery suggestions were made that she lacked passion as if passion could only be demonstrated through red faced screaming at baying crowds though her passion was evident as was her intellect it is true that clinton sometimes seemed a bit anodyne not because she is anodyne but because the nature of the campaign limited her means and forms of expression a woman politician whose appearance and delivery matched those of donald trump would be unlikely to be elected to city council a woman who made the error of referring to people supporting her opponent as deplorables people who screamed for walls to be built on borders and for people to be lynched was excoriated while her male opponent suggested that they come after her with guns none of this was fair in a country that holds fast to values of freedom everyone should have an equal opportunity to speak their mind and indeed wear bright orange foundation if that is a look they want to go for but this is not the reason that clinton lost like many leftwing women i went to my polling place on tuesday wearing a trouser suit and a nasty woman t shirt the hours long queue was packed out with mothers who had brought their small daughters to watch them vote for the first woman president the scene was almost enough to make it seem that the election was about seeking a long delayed victory for feminism but this was a side effect it was a media friendly narrative harnessed by clintons campaign strategists to enhance her brand rather than what the election was really about if the head of state can treat women like objects why should any other american man feel he should behave differently clinton won the popular vote probably by more than a million she was we need to remember the candidate of choice for most voters that is why it is essential to look more deeply into the numbers the reason that clinton lost the electoral college and in turn the election was that she failed to appeal to enough white women especially in decisive states my moderate excitement in clintons candidacy was not shared by a majority of women who look like me or clinton herself trump won the votes of of white women they were voters whom clintons campaign team likely believed were an easy win because of her calls for pay equality leave for new mothers and investment in young children and for her oft stated belief that womens rights are human rights but clintons campaign missed the mark with them those women who voted against clinton did not do so because they are sexist or because they dont believe in womens ability to lead and achieve they are themselves leaders and achievers instead they voted against her because they believe that her party has given them their families and their communities short shrift in trump however they have a future president who threatens to withdraw their rights who claims to aim to roll back roe v wade to take a womans right to choose out of the constitution and to institute some kind of punishment for women who terminate pregnancies trumps promise to repeal the affordable care act on his first day in office means that unwanted pregnancies will become harder to prevent with coverage withdrawn for women to get contraception provided free or at low cost in addition to policy it is impossible to overlook the impact that this most misogynist president will have on american social norms donald trump has boasted about committing sexual assault and has a dozen women with evidence that his boasts were more than just locker room talk he has called women pigs and dogs said that putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing and agreed that his daughter ivanka was a piece of ass he has described a woman who was breastfeeding as disgusting even if many women voters didnt care that trump disparaged clintons appearance her stamina her presidential look her ability to satisfy her husband they might be affected by their country being led by a man who behaves as trump does if the head of state can treat women like objects why should any other american man feel he should behave differently i know that we still have not shattered that highest glass ceiling clinton said in her painful concession speech on wednesday morning but some day someone will hopefully sooner than we might think right now how soon will that be progressives must be diligent to ensure that the enduring narrative of clintons failure does not centre on her gender only then will the democratic party be able to accomplish the drastic reform it needs to build a legitimate strategy to take back the white house in blaming sexism is
it is no use pretending donald trumps presidential election victory is a disaster for the united states and the world it is at least in part a victory for prejudice and fear for ignorance and spite it represents the triumph of economic nationalism and introspection over internationalism and the global good it is a victory built on fabrications because of this trumpism will ultimately fail confounded by its contradictions and its immorality it will be defeated but correcting this deformation will not be easy it will take time and the damage will be considerable many explanations have been offered for hillary clintons defeat last week all have an element of truth for some she was an uncharismatic figure the democratic base was uninspired and many stayed at home doubts surrounded her past conduct not least in respect of the clinton foundation in many minds she represented a discredited political establishment there was about her candidacy an off putting sense of entitlement there was her husbands inescapable ambiguous legacy and clinton was a woman reaching up to a place of power no woman has ever gone a mostly unspoken misogyny undoubtedly played a part in her downfall more broadly the complacency of the democratic party and americas liberal left too comfortable after eight safe years of barack obama did clinton a great disservice the party and its elected representatives badly misread the mood of the nation so too for the most part did independent pollsters and the us media they initially dismissed trump as a clown and then proceeded with honourable exceptions to give him too easy a ride all these factors contributed to clintons demise but they are not the whole story trump won because he successfully tapped the alienation and disillusionment of white voters men and women who comprise of the electorate and turned out for him in large numbers as polling breakdowns show the determining factors were not education or gender not age religion or geography not trumps sexual predations or clintons fbi entanglements they were race and colour linked to economic distress trump exploited a feeling among whites from all backgrounds urban suburban and rural that obamas multicultural multiracial tolerant inclusive and open outward looking america was not working for them there were significant numbers of people who felt their grievances were no longer being listened to by a centrist party that had loosed itself from its blue collar moorings as thomas frank said in these pages last week the democrats went from being the party of decatur to the party of marthas vineyard and they did so at roughly the same time that the republicans were sharpening their deadly image of the liberal elite part of the constituency that switched to trump was railing against a sense of being overlooked during eight years of president obama race unquestionably played a part when trump shrieked his slogan make america great again what he was really saying was make america white again when he spoke about curbing immigration and building a mexican wall when he demonised muslims minorities and people from foreign countries he does not know or trust when he vowed to scrap international trade deals that he claims are destroying jobs in the midwest when he railed against selfish allies who do not pay their way the subliminal message was always the same fear of the foreigner in americas midst trump conjured the illusion of a return to a simpler homogenous monocultural society of secure employment safe neighbourhoods and agreed values no wonder african americans latinos and other dark skinned minorities are frightened no wonder us relations around the globe are in turmoil and rightwing european populists and hard brexiters are celebrating no wonder observers speak of the end of the west and the demise of liberal democracy trumpism has stormed the shining city on a hill betrayed the founding fathers who stood tall for human dignity and universal rights and now presages an isolationist america made in trumps image a beacon of discrimination and malice there are the peculiarities of the american electoral system to consider too hillary clinton won a majority of the popular vote but was handsomely beaten in the race for electoral college votes and too little attention was paid to the effect of a decision by the supreme court in when it struck down a key part of the voting rights act of by a five to four vote what this did was allow nine states with long records of voting discrimination such as georgia louisiana mississippi south carolina to no longer seek federal approval to change their laws the effect was seen last week as the explained consider what has been happening in north carolina a battleground state with a history of racial discrimination in voting republican lawmakers and officials have gone to remarkable lengths to drive down turnout among black voters who disproportionately favour democrats there were numerous other examples across the country including stringent voter id rules that the federal government had stated earlier this year had a disproportionate effect on minorities for the so called leader of the free world to allow legalised voter suppression is beyond irony what supporters and opponents alike are about to discover is that trumps appeal like the blue collar billionaire himself is two faced much of what he promised on the campaign trail will not be delivered or will be so watered down as to make no difference trump says he will cut taxes raise public spending and slash the federal deficit thats impossible all at once trump says he will renegotiate or scrap nafta and other free trade treaties but his conceit that this will help uncompetitive carmakers in detroit or steel makers in ohio is implausible he says he will slap swingeing tariffs on chinese imports but he knows the geopolitical and commercial realities mean he will not he says he will make america strong and honour its friends then kowtows to vladimir putin the wests most formidable strategic
when president elect donald trump enters the white house next year he will bring with him potential conflicts of interest across all areas of government that are unprecedented in american history trump who manages a sprawling international network of businesses has thus far refused to put his businesses into a blind trust the way his predecessors in the nations highest office have traditionally done instead he has said his businesses will be run by his own adult children donald trump jr trumps eldest child has insisted that trumps holdings would go into a trust managed by him and his siblings eric and ivanka trump were not going to be involved in government trump jr told abcs george stephanopoulos in september on good morning america he wants nothing to do with the company he wants to fix this country candace smith realdonaldtrump eldest children son in law are on his presidential transition team executive committee pic twitter com jr eric and ivanka trump are all on the president elects transition team executive committee per abcs candace smith as is trumps son in law jared kushner but according to regulators who have overseen potential conflicts of interests under two former presidents trumps arrangements were unprecedented and present a host of issues this is in no way a blind trust said karl sandstrom former chairman of the federal election commission the regulatory body that oversees campaign finance under bill clinton and george w bush a blind trust is not anywhere near the same you dont still have access to the decision being made thats why you put assets in and dont just have someone else manage the company he said trumps assets will instead apparently remain united under his company and operated under his name even if he is not directly in charge reagan spent some time in the private sector but he certainly wasnt a ceo said robert lenhard also a former fec chair appointed by george w bush he wasnt operating a set of companies like trump is most of our presidents have come out of political careers eisenhowers time out of office was mostly a hiatus between the military and the presidency trump owns hotels in chicago new york city las vegas waikiki and most recently in washington dc just down pennsylvania avenue from the white house as with any hotel chain the trump organization will oversee power water maintenance security billing and any number of other logistical details that will now essentially be negotiated between the provider and the family of the president abroad trump holds properties in istanbul where his election was met with satisfaction by that countrys president recep tayyip erdoan as well as mumbai vancouver and seoul among many others with trumps children running his businesses there is also the matter of their bearing his name and thus the name of the president anywhere in the world when they arrive to negotiate leases and construction deals from his financial filings the future us leader also appears to be a shareholder or beneficiary of several entities headquartered abroad among them excel venture llc in the french west indies and caribusiness investments srl based in the dominican republic how trumps holdings in those countries will affect us relations with them remains to be seen both are notable for their use in finance to avoid taxes trump has promised to cut the rate for repatriating cash into the us as an incentive for others who like him keep taxable funds overseas in azerbaijan trump has a real estate project he said was on hold during the presidential campaign his partner in the endeavor was anar mammadov son of the iranian transportation minister ziya mammadov who was accused in diplomatic cables released by wikileaks in of laundering money in russia where trumps election has been met with congratulations by president vladimir putin trump worked closely with the russian born american financier felix h sater managing director of the new york based firm bayrock llc sater and bayrock founder tevfik arif worked closely with trump and others in his organization in a deposition trump said that he had discussed numerous deals all over the world with arif and that arif had brought potential russian investors to meet trump at his office according to a report in the new york times bayrock was examined closely during a lawsuit filed by its former finance director jody kriss the times said the firm had occasionally received unexplained infusions of cash from accounts in kazakhstan and russia also in russia there are trumps ties to paul manafort who ran his campaign from march to august manafort who helped to install putin ally viktor yanukovych as president in ukraine was named in a corruption investigation by a ukrainian authority working with the fbi then there is the matter of the president elects stock portfolio trump has holdings in dakota access pipeline company energy transfer partners in his first days trump has pledged to remove every impediment to the pipeline which has been the subject of protests violently suppressed by police in north dakota he also owns stock in facebook whose ceo mark zuckerberg posted that he was feeling hopeful on wednesday and in bank of america he has promised to deregulate the banking industry michael cohen trumps attorney defended trumps post election business plans on thursday speaking of trumps family he said theyre really intelligent theyre really qualified thats why he really didnt run in because they were younger by four years he told cnn while conflicts of interest may cause scandals for the president they are unlikely to add to his long list of legal woes in the supreme court gave richard nixon absolute immunity to prosecution for most kinds of crimes committed while in office setting a precedent for administrations to come the presidents absolute immunity is a functionally mandated incident of his unique office rooted in the constitutional tradition of the separation of powers and supported by the nations history wrote justice lewis
for years america has toyed with the idea of a woman becoming president this year for an all too brief moment it looked as if the idea might become a reality but the dream of a female president has remained just that a disingenuous myth america occasionally serves up in fictions but never permits to spill into its facts instead of witnessing the landmark moment of a woman moving into the oval office we can now see the all too real misogyny that became a feature of the presidential campaign bedding down in the corridors of power when donald trump called hillary clinton a nasty woman in the final debate only a few days after a series of recordings revealed him admitting to a series of sexual aggressions and assaults many people thought it was the end of his bid for the presidency instead social media during election night revealed trump supporters male and female voicing the diehard view that a woman is simply not capable of being president too weak to stand up to foreign leaders and the military the sucker punch for those of us who believe that this particular woman was spectacularly more ready for the white house than her grossly underqualified and abusive opponent is that as has historically been the case once again a female candidate did not carry even the female vote a staggering of white women voted against clinton and for the man whose statements and attitudes brought misogyny kicking and screaming into the light facebook twitter pinterest hillary clintons concession speech in fullwhen clinton conceded the presidency she tried to offer hope to the women especially the young women of america i know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling but i know someday someone will and hopefully sooner than we might think right now of course we may not think that right now because right now the media is focusing its attention on white male economic and racial disempowerment it is not interested in the disempowerment of women but that is also the story of this election which was fought over a series of fictions myths and outright lies for two solid years the media engaged in spreading half truths and misinformation about the first serious female candidate for president for a few days after we learned that trump likes to grab women by the pussy the mainstream media began admitting how many of the derogatory stories swirling around clinton were misogynistic how many were literally trumped up fictions but then the fbi intervened and the story reverted to its misogynistic mean relentlessly informing the american electorate that clinton is duplicitous dishonest untrustworthy it was character assassination and it worked anyone who still believes these claims are factual and on the evidence some million people do should consider how closely they resemble the stories that have always been told about female politicians both real and fictional to do so is to realise that it is time to stop suggesting as some commentators are doing that clinton failed us the truth is we failed her to understand a culture you must know its stories taking a hard look at some of the tales weve told about the idea of a female president can teach us a great deal about this election as well as those to come the women who have become american presidents in the history of fiction are not quite as vanishingly scarce as they are in reality but theyre not exactly numerous and until very recently the fictions were as presumptively white as the candidates just women have mounted a serious bid for us president three of whom made it to a major partys national convention although only one secured that nomination five became third party candidates and two became major party running mates both of whom lost we have had three female secretaries of state one female speaker of the house but no woman has ever been elected to the executive branch of the american government the idea of a woman in the white house has always prompted the same responses it is either a joke a disaster or a cheat clinton was endlessly called crooked hillary to shouts of lock her up although her crimes always varied had she murdered vince foster or ron brown had she covered up wrongdoing in the deaths of americans at benghazi stolen millions or was she in fact beelzebub it didnt matter what mattered was the idea of illegitimacy most stories imagine a female president who lies cheats murders or sleeps her way into office or inherits the roleour fictions about women becoming president have always worked to invalidate the very idea take for example the novel co authored by a former speaker of the house and avowed enemy of clintons newt gingrich which tells of a woman who becomes americas first woman president and chooses politics over national interest resulting in a benghazi style attack its title now gingrich has been tipped for a cabinet appointment because propaganda works in neither history nor fiction are there more than a handful of stories that imagine a female president who could ascend to the highest office in the land honestly through merit and hard work instead she either lies cheats murders or sleeps her way into office or she inherits the role passively from a man fictional depictions of a female presidential candidate on the actual campaign trail are even rarer this may correlate with the fact that as clinton herself noted she was always more popular in office than while running when female presidents are imagined they are in office thanks to a fait accompli of some kind which is also delegitimising power was handed to her or she inveigled her way into it either way its crooked just like hillary serious fiction is a club into which women presidents arent admitted they are segregated by genre cropping up primarily in satire or science fiction female presidents
people are a lot more wary on my way home today i walked passed a patrol of armed soldiers and i was suddenly surprised by how normal that has become to me theyve definitely become part of the scenery in paris and are part of a new france at war vocabulary along with vigipirate frances national security alert system security levels in public places have been heightened and i think people were and perhaps still are a lot more wary about two months after the attacks a car back fired and people threw themselves to the ground personally i had a hard time going out to concerts and big events for a while and even now i have to scout out the fire escape when i get there my friend was killed at the bataclan last year and i still cant get used to that he was a good kind person accepting of everyone and brimming with potential theres not a day where i dont think about that and feel angry sad and bereft roisin paristhe attacks are being exploitedi used to often spend saturday nights near the republic square and i was shocked to see how empty it was months after the attacks i also surprise myself everytime i go as i cant prevent myself to stop at the square for a moment and to feel sad it did change my relationships with others especially with some friends as i come from a town in the suburbs which has a lot of immigrants making up the population with adiversity of origins debates about what happened and what is still happening are part of our daily life and some friends dont have the same opinions as me some people i thought i knew started to call for war or to call refugees animals because they thought they were terrorists having really racist thoughts and istopped talking to some very good friends of mine because what they said really hurt me my father being muslim himself i got personally offended by whats been said by some people i think the attacks are being exploited by politicians to win the upcoming presidential elections they just scare people and hope to win like this and theres now no difference between the parties as they just all target muslims romana bekkai paris the nationalism is scary politically france is in an utter mess and has been for a long time the front national have made gains accross the country monopolising on the magnanimous fear since the attcks and the left is too disorganised to do anything about it the fact that veteran leftist jean luc mlanchon is putting himself forward once again for the next elections speaks volumes about the lack of progress made by socialism in the past few years here people are exasperate by the parti socialiste their handling of the loi du travail protests was disasterous the country is currently having an identity crisis far right politicians have been saying that france is the home of secularism in the same breath as saying that france is a catholic country what they really seem to be getting at is we dont want muslims here the levels of nationalism being stoked by even the centre right politicians is scary nicolas sarkozys obsession with referencing the gauls as the true frenchman is as nauseating as it is historically inaccurate theo radford paris i cant really tell if its resilience or simply numbnessits hard to say theres been a real change the country has rocked and swayed but its foundations are solid it feels more like what a quake or the crash of plane does strong reactions at first slowly dwindling out one year later you cant deny something did happen but the scar is faint if not invisible the bataclan is poised to re open the various cafs already have people have resumed their normal lives paris looks the same it was before those appalling events it has healed we may be seeing more cops and soldiers patrolling in the streets but its not that striking if a change has taken place it is happening at a deeper level and while its true the emergency state has been extended there hasnt been any report of real abuses though some may have flared up every so ofteni cant really tell if its resilience or simply numbness and resignation as a matter of fact if the purpose of the attacks was to spread terror then it hasnt panned out people are both willing to resist and fatalist if something must happen it will happen and theres hardly anything you can do to prevent it so the best course is to carry on as before and be oblivious of the danger which is the right path to tread vincent parisfrance has changed dramatically since the attacks france has changed dramatically since the attacks during euro there was this fear of mass gatherings and the possibility of an attack politically too france has changed politicians had been making a discourse out of what it means to be french for years but since the attacks every party and every politician has something to say good and for bad the whole political debate gravitates around what defines the fundamentals of french society and on what kind of social contract we all rely my biggest hope for france is too stay united and not to get lost in adversity i wish that we can continue to live with different cultures especially in a city as mixed as marseille luca aug marseillethe most relevant think is the rise of islamophobiasince the paris attacks every day i hear conversations about muslims whereas it was not the case before when i talk about politics with my friends the first issue they mention is immigration the migrant crisis which europe is facing has bolstered this atmosphere the most relevant thing is the rise of islamophobia politically the national front takes advantage of it

observers cite voter anger at an entitled political establishment and an ever wealthier and privileged elite gridlock and dysfunction in washington international tensions and economic dislocation and distress to explain his victories in the primaries and now in the general election theyre not wrong over the course of the campaign trump threw fuel on all these hotspots still more critical to his success he nailed the white male support that would put him over the top in electoral votes on by his continual attacks on the legitimacy of the nations first african american president his targeting and denunciation of undocumented immigrants and muslims and his overtly sexist remarks about women but after writing a book about donald trump his father and his grandfather i think other factors played a pivotal role for starters theres a trump family culture of ruthlessly pressing any advantage stretching the truth and pushing the legal and ethical envelope to the max trumps german immigrant grandfather who operated restaurants in gold rush era seattle and the yukon amassed a nest egg by offering miners alcohol food and proximity to women his father greatly increased the family fortune by exploiting loopholes in new deal government subsidies he tapped to construct middle income housing in brooklyn and queens and trump used a billion dollar loss of borrowed money and four corporate bankruptcies to build a global brand and avoid paying personal income taxes for nearly two decades that family culture also includes an adherence to the success oriented theology of dr norman vincent peale author of the bestseller peale was the pastor of marble collegiate church where trumps parents attended services where trump and his sisters married and where funeral services for their parents took place in his book peale emphasises the supreme importance of self confidence a notion that trump has not merely embraced but weaponised with a winning at all costs scorched earth approach that has more than fulfilled his own fathers fierce injunction to be a killer in every pursuit among many results are a remarkable litigation history according to as of mid trump had been involved in more than lawsuits including dozens that are still active and a political campaign characterised by an unprecedented level of venom and vitriol but trump has also contributed his own special flourishes linguists found trump was second only to hillary clinton in terms of how feminine he soundedfor example his much ridiculed hair for years it has been a highly effective trademark a humanising bit of vanity that made him the peoples billionaire rather than a remote tycoon and on the campaign trail his coiffure made him the perpetual centre of attention as with the traditional circus clowns big red nose trumps bouffant blond combover cued audiences that at any moment he might do something entertaining and that it was permissible to laugh even cheer if some sort of antisocial activity occurred for a clown this includes antics like hitting people with a baseball bat or dumping water on their heads for trump it was likely to be a vicious taunt a preposterous exaggeration even a suggestion to rough up protesters behaviour that would ordinarily be considered unacceptable but was now tolerated even celebrated because it could be explained away as only a performance a joke or one of trumps favourite phrases truthful hyperbole ultimately however trumps success may have hinged on his voice i am your voice he declared in his acceptance speech at the republican national convention in july and there is more to that claim than might have been apparent at that moment let me lay it out curiously despite his obsession with showing that he is the most powerful person on earth his speech doesnt have the archetypal tough guy edge in part this is because as the reported during the primaries linguists found he was the second only to hillary clinton in terms of how feminine he sounded moreover when measured by non verbal cues like gestures facial expressiveness and statements posed as questions he came in as the most feminine of the entire field but perhaps even more importantly it is also because of the way he sounds although hes shown hes more than capable of shouting in classic rabble rousing style more often than not what comes out when he opens his mouth is not traditional alpha male talk in contrast to both the hyper belligerence of jean claude van damme and the chilling rasp of clint eastwood trumps speech tends to be in the middle range even slightly high pitched not effeminate but despite his guarantee in one debate as to the adequacy of his genital endowment not testosterone laden either this low key verbal tone might seem unimportant at most a meaningless distinction overshadowed by his relentless aggression and braggadocio in other words not a big deal but its effect is a big deal instead of insistently bellowing or pounding his chest like an arnold schwarzenegger hes tapping into a different stereotype the counter intuitive strongman who tosses off some of his most devastating comments with a malevolent sneer think marlon brando or robert de niro who make their point not by shouting theyre going to blow your head off but by hissing that youd better cooperate if you want to see another sunrise moreover trumps speech is hardly bristling with complexity rather his vocabulary is extremely simple almost to the point of being childish and his use of incomplete thoughts and sentence fragments has an unmediated stream of consciousness feel it is this combination the hint of menace beneath the surface added to what appears to be an unpolished immediacy that millions of listeners take as evidence of trumps authenticity and spontaneity indeed the way he talks reminds them of the voice inside their own heads a rich and sometimes dark stew of conversational snippets and memory scraps random phrases and half thoughts and by extension it somehow seems as if theyre hearing the voice inside his head

donald trump has won science and scientists played almost no part in the campaign now scientists must consider how they fit into a trump future this wont be easy many scientists are scared in the tribal world of us politics many now find themselves on the outside looking in most university scientists are democrats and the president house and senate will all be republican for this group nothing portends disaster more than the elevation of a long time opponent to national and international policies myron ebell of the competitive enterprise institute to oversee the transformation of the environmental protection agency even those academics who lean republican would despise trumps rejection of what a george w bush adviser once dismissed as the reality based community while speculating on details like who trump will ask to replace john holdren as his science advisor scientists should not just be asking what trump will do for them they should face up to the difficult question of what they should be doing for trump some scientists will have to join the white house itself when george w bush was elected his administration had a hard time finding a scientist willing to serve as his science advisor when jack marburger a highly respected administrator and physicist who was also a democrat took the job he was excoriated by his peers and excommunicated from some scientific circles we see hints of similar responses to trumps election already earlier this week the american physical society issued a press release congratulating trump on his victory and encouraging him to make sustained and robust funding of scientific research a top priority the aps received so many complaints that it felt compelled to retract it and issue an apology some have already written off trumps yet to be named science advisor for instance robert cook deegan of arizona state university says for trump im not sure his science advisor would matter because there wont be any policy apparatus science wont get much attention except when it gets in the way or bolsters support for a political priority marburger was called a prostitute upon taking the position under bush there are thousands of political appointees including many science positions that will need to be nominated expert advisory bodies constituted and reconstituted and experts put into staff positions under the white house any scientist who agrees to hold their nose and work with the trump administration should expect much of the same criticism received by marburger some such as government scientists will not have much choice but to engage that is their job the rest of the scientific community must still ask itself some difficult questions we suggest three is money all that matters during the late stages of the presidential campaign nobel prize winners endorsed hillary clinton and pushed for more funding for research and policies that support the scientific workforce they suggested that there were other reasons for their support but focused on what the next president might do for the interests of the scientific community the incoming president of the american geophysical union expressed a similar concern theres a fear that the scientific infrastructure in the u s is going to be on its knees everything from funding to being able to attract the global leaders we need to do basic science research if trump imagines that the scientific community could cause him trouble one option would be to do what nye bevan did to reactionary doctors in setting up the nhs and stuff their mouths with gold trump could echo obamas rhetoric promising to restore science to its rightful place by increasing funding it would be the art of the deal and it would put critical scientists in a difficult position no one knows what trump will do on science or much else however the history of us science funding shows that republican presidents appear more eager to spend money on r d than their democratic counterparts priorities have varied with democrats spending more through the environmental protection agency and commerce while republicans spend more on defense the national science foundation and national institutes of health overall spending on r d is not well correlated with party politics mainly because science funding has long been a bipartisan priority other than the massive injections of cash through the apollo programme and obamas smaller stimulus package more recently non defence science funding has remained pretty stable as a proportion of government discretionary spending since the end of world war two without much discussion of the fiscal consequences trump has announced grand plans for increases in us infrastructure investment for science this could mean high profile funding for nasa perhaps newt gingrich will revive his vision of a moon base and a mission to mars the military industrial scientific complex demoted since the end of the cold war could receive a boost organisations that advocate for more science funding have already sought to tie in r d funding with trumps calls for greater investment scientists need to consider how to react to possible increases in funding as well as express fears of decreases in doing so they might position themselves as representatives of the public good rather than just another special interest group should pragmatism trump purity how should scientists engage on policy issues such as vaccination and climate change where republicans are often accused of being anti science or worse at war with science despite trumps rhetorical nods to the social conservative wing of his party during the campaign and his enthusiasm for convenient conspiracy theories he is clearly a pragmatist with little worry about changing his policy preferences scientists should therefore ask themselves whether they would support policies that did what they regard as the right thing but for the wrong reasons policies focused on deploying electric vehicles and nuclear or wind power may be justified in purely economic rather than environmental terms alternatively environmental regulations may provide convenient cover for the taxing of imports as the usa struggles to
world leaders have begun congratulating donald trump on his election win as people around the world anxiously wait to see how their country will engage with the new us president the order in which trump spoke to leaders around the world has sparked speculation as to how he will shape his foreign policy in the hours after his victory speech trump spoke to egypt ireland mexico israel turkey india japan australia and south korea the uks theresa may was on the list more anti trump action planned after second night of protests across us read moreegypts president abdel fatah al sisi was the first to have a conversation on how to foster closer diplomatic ties with the us australias prime minister malcolm turnbull discussed trade regional security and how to defeat isis a key promise in trumps election campaign but although the german chancellor angela merkel and the french president franois hollande offered support they labelled his leadership a period of uncertainty we asked people around the world to tell us what the situation looks like from where they live how their governments are responding to trumps victory and how they think his leadership will affect their lives egyptegypt and the us will probably grow closer but as citizens we will suffer from trumps endorsement of our president sara engineerwe live in a police state where students activists and journalists disappear or are jailed the obama administration had been putting pressure on our government to improve human rights and freedom of speech but i doubt donald trumps administration will do the same this is evident from our current presidents eagerness to connect with trump i hope he hires a team that understands the complexities of the middle east it is evident he does have a cluesara egyptboth hillary clinton and trump are heavily disliked in the middle east by muslims and arabs while trump is openly hostile to muslims and clueless about the region hillarys policy as secretary of state has been very deliberate and damaging to the region despite her partys more tolerant and inclusive tone having gone through a very similar election scenario in egypt in where both candidates were hated i was not very surprised by the outcome the democratic party underestimated trumps popularity and the dislike for hillary i feel a lot of votes went to trump out of spite for hillary perhaps if a different candidate had gone against trump the outcome would have been different just like what happened in egypt it looks like the american population is now sharply split in half with each side demonising the other i think thats the most dangerous thing that can happen to a country having racist intolerant people in power might make it easier to challenge them as they are now out in the open but healing the rifts in society is much harder i simply hope trump will become a president for all us citizens as is his duty and reign in the hateful extremist tendencies displayed by white americans i hope he hires a competent team that understands the complexities of the situation in the middle east and worldwide as it is evident that he does not have a clue chinapotential trade conflicts but he will use his business wisdom to deal with it boyang beijingi feel great about the result its a tremendous win for the masses for those who were constantly ignored by political elites in washington i like trump a lot because he knew the real problems of the country rather than just chanting politically correct slogans the us is divided now probably more divided than when i worked there for three years that happens when you are obsessed with gay rights and minority rights but forget to promote the most basic right of living a better life for the majority he will be a great president if he improve some of his rhetoricboyang chinathe pivot to asia plot and the tpp are now dead trump is likely to be a more pragmatic figure than obama so sino us relations will improve theres going to be some trade conflicts if trump lives up to his word about china but i believe he will use his business wisdom to deal with it china will have an easier situation and a stronger influence in the region a win win cooperation between these two countries could benefit humankind i wish that trump could be more presidential he will be a great president if he improves some of his rhetoric i hope that he can get along with china indiawe have a lot of supporters for trump mostly from far right parties mithun keralato say the result was shocking would be an understatement victory of an alt right fanatic like trump in a country known around the world for its liberal virtues and principles is something that adds to the swerve of the world to the right he adds on to the list of rightwing politicians such as recep tayyip erdoan in turkey vladimir putin in russia and of course narendra modi in india maybe we are witnessing the gradual transition of the world into a global conflict in india we have a lot of supporters for trump mostly from far right parties its another moment of jubilation for them maybe the consequences for foreign policy will be beneficial as trump has publicly shown his admiration for modi and his way of governance but his temperamental nature makes trump truly unpredictable so we will have to wait and see as long as he doesnt turn rhetoric into reform i think the world will be safemithun indiain southern india where im from most of the people have a similar opinion to me but in the northern areas of india the stomping ground of the ruling rightwing opinions may differ the philosophy of gandhi of a mutual peaceful coexistence which was even enshrined in our foreign policy until an ideological regime change is something i firmly believe
an estimated of americas million armed forces personnel are stationed abroad there are an estimated us service personnel dotted about the middle east but the us does not release precise information on all their locations global mapafghanistanafghanistan barely featured in the election campaign but when donald trump takes office he will not be able to ignore what is now americas longest war thousands of us troops are still stationed there the security situation is deteriorating as the taliban threaten cities and consolidate control of rural areas and isis has joined the war although american forces are not officially in a combat role have died there this year making it a deadlier theatre of operations for the us military than iraq or syria the taliban responded to the us election result by calling on trump to withdraw americas troops but advisers will warn him that without the backing of foreign airpower and other military expertise the country is likely to fall to the taliban his strong stance on fighting isis and islamic terrorism means he is unlikely to hand control of a country where thousands of american troops died to a scarcely less hardline group he has also expressed concerns about nuclear weapons in neighbouring pakistan trump has repeatedly called for us allies to pay more towards their own security but there is almost no cash to be had in afghanistan which is already largely dependent on foreign aid for its budget and is one of the poorest nations in the world he is likely to be stuck then with the multibillion dollar bill for the us presence and support of afghan troops emma graham harrisonbaltic statesthe baltic states are nervous about whether a trump administration would defend them in the event of a russian attack in july trump told the new york times he would not necessarily come to the aid of lithuania latvia and estonia unless they had first stumped up enough cash into nato coffers nato has recently been ramping up its military exercises in the baltics in response to what it sees as a growing kremlin threat in december the us airborne unit is due to train with latvian troops at a former soviet military base but it is unclear if such us led exercises will continue there is also uncertainty as to what will be trumps russia policy the fear is that trump will effectively concede eastern europe to moscow as a sphere of influence this would give vladimir putin russias president a free hand to create havoc in the baltics raising the spectre of cyber attacks subversion of democratic elections and even covert russian invasion similar to the events of in east ukraine and crimea luke hardingcanadathe possible impact of a trump presidency on trade is the main worry of canadas goods and services exports go to the us representing of the countrys gdp and jobs trumps promise to renegotiate nafta which he called the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere has alarmed ottawa but analysts point out that much of the two countries trade is also governed by world trade organisation rules and the us ambassador to canada has said canada would be willing to look again at the agreement in a gesture of goodwill towards the new administration canadians are also worried by trumps views on climate change and the consequences not just for the un paris agreement but bilateral pacts such as the deal struck by barack obama and the canadian prime minister justin trudeau to limit methane emissions from the oil and gas industry trump could prove positive for the canadian oil industry suffering like many from low prices transcanadas planned keystone xl pipeline carrying oil from alberta to a us terminal in nebraska was rejected by the obama administration after six years of review trump has said he would approve the project which would give canadian oil companies easier and so more profitable access to international markets if it were resubmitted as long as the us benefited from its construction and got a share of the profits jon henleyfrancetheir world collapses ours is being built tweeted florian philippot a front national vice president and marine le pens righthand man as trump headed for victory trumps win certainly makes a president le pen more plausible more than polls in the last two years have consistently shown her finishing second or winning the first round of frances presidential elections on april after that conventional wisdom says le pen will be heavily defeated in the run off stage by her rival at present likely to be the veteran centre right former prime minister alain jupp who is seen as a safe pair of hands after two hugely unpopular presidents some le pen policies particularly that of taking france out of the euro simply scare too many voters and current polling says le pen would lose to jupp backed by an anti fn front rpublicain after brexit and trump we know polls can be wrong for them to be wrong by percentage points would be extraordinary but the same factors that drove trumps victory are clearly in play in france le pen as the countrys president cannot be completely ruled out especially if jupp does not make it to the second round jon henleyiranall eyes are on how trumps presidency will play out vis vis last years landmark nuclear deal which was widely praised as a triumph of diplomacy that averted the risk of another war in the middle east despite his speech in march to the pro israel lobby aipac during which he said his first priority was to dismantle the disastrous deal with iran it is still unclear what path trump will follow in office he has contradicted himself on the deal previously conceding that it would be hard to rip it up without european support trumps lack of credibility among traditional european allies of the us led some to think that his victory would be unlikely to cause much trouble
donald trump has invited theresa may to washington and affirmed his belief in the special relationship between the uk and the us the invitation came in mays first conversation with the president elect trump reportedly spoke to nine other world leaders before he spoke to may but number sources have said there was no urgent need for a conversation philip hammond the chancellor has announced plans to strengthen links between the london and shanghai stock exchanges he was speaking at a press conference with the chinese vice premier ma kai laura hughes philip hammond says china and the uk are enjoying a golden era and are taking their relationship to a new level pic twitter com miliband the former labour leader has denounced trump as a a racist misogynistic self confessed groper but also set out three lessons progressive parties can learn from his election victory thats all from me for today i have to get to a school parents evening which is late afternoon thanks for the comments this is from the suns harry cole harry cole source trump affirmed special relationship wants to strengthen bilateral trade and investment be honoured to invite her to dc november this is from the evening standards joe murphy joe murphy i gather president elect invited mrs may to visit as soon as possible and sd it would be a great honour to welcome her to washingtonnovember theresa may has spoken to donald trump this is from itvs chris ship chris ship prime minister had her conversation with president elect realdonaldtrump at uk time this afternoonnovember it is worth noting that of the three lessons that ed miliband thinks progressives need to learn from donald trump two are ones that jeremy corbyn has already embraced corbyns policy agenda is ambitious not incremental and he can credibly pose as an outsider but he is not particularly comfortable championing nationalism or patriotism ed miliband the former labour leader was on the world at one talking about donald trump he expressed horror at trumps politics but like jeremy corbyn yesterday and emily thornberry this morning he accepted that trump won support because people were rightly fed up with the economic status quo miliband said that he thought he had a good analysis of this problem when he was leader of the labour party but that his solutions were obviously not sufficiently convincing however since then miliband appears to have given the subject more thought because in his interview he offered some fresh thinking on how political parties could respond to these challenges it was one of the most interesting interventions ive heard from any british politician since trumps election here are the key points miliband identified three lessons that progressive politicians could learn from the success of donald trump parties like labour needed to offer big solutions stop defending the system like insiders and embrace patriotism he said i think there are deep lessons from brexit and trump what are the lessons first of all the economic lessons because whatever you say about trump and brexit they offer big solutions i think they are false solutions and we should not invent false gods of our own but our solutions are too incremental and not big enough for the diagnosis of inequality and the problems that we see secondly being political insiders is a massive problem trump was the consumate outsider and i do think in a sense that got him permission to be heard and i think we have to think very hard about how we dont defend the existing broken politics that people perceive but actually want to change it then thirdly this issue of nationhood and patriotism and the truth is that trump has invented a xenophobic anti immigrant nasty view of nationhood but we dont yet have a convincing one of our own simply defending globalisation openness on its own without fairness has been proved to be deeply insufficient he said neoliberalism had failed we should certainly be saying neoliberalism has failed the current economic system does not work it has accrued the gains to the top and people have got squeezed and left out he said that following the brexit vote he accepted that there would have to be some controls on the free movement of eu citizens into the uk politicians had to understand peoples concerns he said having seen the referendum we have got if at all possible to see some change in relation to free movement he said that he still believed in openness and the advantages of the single market but that this needed to be combined with fairness too he described trump as a racist misogynistic self confessed groper and said people should be deeply worried about his election the idea that we have shared values with a racist misogynistic self confessed groper beggars belief i think we should be deeply worried about the implications for many of the things that we care about tackling climate change he says its invented by the chinese and its a hoax dealing with problems in the middle east he says hes going to recognise jerusalem almost immediately as the capital of israel with all kinds of implications that has for the middle east peace process his attitude to russia and then this fantasy about trade this guy is anti trade hes an odd combination of protectionism plus the old trickle down tax cut formula that has got us into a lot of this mess in the first place he said trumps election was symptomatic of a sickness in america ed miliband photograph will oliver epa philip hammond the chancellor has suggested that donald trumps protectionsim could damage global prosperity nicola sturgeon the scottish first minister has said some of trumps views are deeply abhorrent the uks hopes for a continuation of the much vaunted special relationship with the us under trump have suffered an early setback after the new president elect spoke to nine world leaders in the hours after
britains national newspapers registered their profound shock at donald trumps victory over hillary clinton with pages and pages of coverage the daily telegraphs front page called it the election that shook the world while the daily mirror showed the statue of liberty clasping her face and a headline asking what have they done in lengthy editorials leader writers sought to make sense of what the times referred to as the most dramatic insurgency in american political history politics will never be the same said the times it was a political earthquake that the american political class could not bring itself to imagine the guardian also called it a global political earthquake contending that president trump is the shock heard round the world the financial times believes it marks a thunderous repudiation of the status quo while the daily telegraph sees the vote as the shattering of the liberal consensus by antipolitics every paper has views on why it happened of course and there is a considerable and somewhat surprising measure of agreement across the political spectrum the times points out that trumps base white working class men was bolstered by white women with college degrees plus nearly one third of asian and hispanic voters for all of them trump was the change candidate and that change is scary with the threat to impose stiff tariffs on chinese and mexican imports even so the times thinks britain may do well because trump has far more affinity with and affection for these islands than mr obama trumps victory was said the daily telegraph americas brexit moment his campaign was based on being the outsider who would give the political establishment a bloody nose trump is not a rightwinger in economic terms and on social policy he has mostly adopted liberal positions nor is he a leftwinger because he believes in low taxes and has been strident in his comments about immigration but his protectionism is problematic it would help no one said the telegraph least of all those americans who want mr trump to improve their lives it continued from britains point of view upholding the special relationship is more important than ever in the wake of the brexit vote none the less if president elect trump is to be true to the spirit of brexit that he has invoked then he must lead an america that reaches out to the rest of the world and does not retreat into an isolationist shell the daily mail reads trumps win as a revolt against a complacent liberal elite that includes but is not confined to media pundits the bbc bienpensant politicians and the massed ranks of luvvies it was an unmistakable warning to the wests we know best political class who have nothing but contempt for the ordinary people whose interests they profess to hold dear the paper continued they simply fail to understand voters rejection of all the isms beloved of the left or trumps appeal to the most enduring ism of them all old fashioned patriotism and that left had displayed the same stunned reaction to brexit why because voters were fed up with having their concerns about mass immigration ignored and were sick to death of a political class bailing out super rich bankers while family budgets were relentlessly squeezed for the mail the result is a warning to all liberal elites including the french germans and those who seek to frustrate brexit of the penalty for ignoring the electorate the sun urges people to calm down arguing that trumps crazier ideas should be reined in by experienced republican party advisers anyway it thinks he has some solid economic policies and could forge a new era of dialogue with vladimir putin whom he admires ah yes and he is also a fan of brexit like the mail it sees an equivalency between the vote for trump and the vote to leave the eu contending that smug lefties should condemn less and seek to understand more do they not grasp that for years voters with falling wages were ignored by politicians in washington or westminster the daily express which views every current event through its obsessive loathing for the eu is relieved that trump backs brexit the express registers its delight that nigel farage has cosied up to trump and believes it is a great relief to have a friend in the white house who respects the special relationship and is ready to put britain at the front of the queue the daily mirror as its brilliant front page indicates is downcast at trumps victory a tragedy not just for america but the rest of the world it says the keys to the globes most powerful democracy have been handed to a man who is a serial liar sexual predator and overt racist anyone who cares about the wellbeing of the united states where inequality is rife and racial tensions run high should be alarmed those who care about global security the international economy climate change and human rights should despair the mirror finds trumps domestic agenda such as his plans to dismantle obamacare expel muslims and build a wall on the mexican border distasteful it also believes he poses a risk to world security the global economy and nato but the mirror believes it necessary to understand why he won he spoke to those left behind by globalisation stuck in low paid and insecure jobs and fearful for their families future the independent believes trumps election is part of a revolution sweeping through the developed world but argues that although the brexit trump phenomenon is powerful and new it does not mean that centrist liberal politics is dead however if centrist liberalism is to survive it must learn some deep lessons and renew itself the wrong response to defeat is to blame the american voters for their stupidity or prejudice just as the wrong response to the brexit vote was to deride leavers a successful and confident liberalism has to
in my country the white lash and the man lash have just created president donald trump an unqualified candidate who came up not through politics but through inheriting money a gift for bullying and being on television though hillary clinton won the popular vote trump won enough to get a majority of electoral votes that was a move to the right not unlike brexit and the rule of prime minister modi in india yet i also have to admit that in answer to the question im most often asked i hoped but never quite believed i would see a female president in my lifetime at least not a woman like hillary clinton if a first female president were someone like say margaret thatcher sarah palin or another woman who knew how to play the game and win i wouldnt have been surprised but hillary clinton didnt just play the game she changed the rules she insisted that womens rights are human rights that women can decide the fate of our own bodies that workers of all races should get paid the same as white men for the same work that fathers can and should be equal parents that womens rights and childrens rights should be fundamental to foreign policy and that global warming was a reality thats why she was and always has been supported more by women than by men more by voters of color than by white voters and more by scientists than creationists its also why she is deeply and vehemently resented facebook twitter pinterest hillary clinton concession speech i know its painful there have always been women who could have changed the game i was in college when margaret chase smith became the first us senator to oppose joe mccarthy the donald trump of his day later she also became the first woman whose name was placed in nomination for the presidency by a major party convention yet that was as far as she got in i ran as a delegate pledged to congresswoman shirley chisholm a candidate for the presidency though she was only on the ballot in states she spoke out against the vietnam war and against racism and sexism in education and politics in the public imagination she single handedly took the white male only sign off the white house door the truth is that for two and a half centuries this country has excluded females of every race from its top leadership also the of males who are african american hispanic jewish or otherwise seen as needing an adjective also the who identify as gay or lesbian and also the who cant afford to purchase a college degree there has been only one president who wasnt married and none who was openly atheist or agnostic add this up and weve been selecting our top leadership from of our talent at most we may be giving birth to democracy but there will be years of labor to come thats why electing barack obama was such a crucial beginning we were rewarded by his intellect and gift for unifying his cool head and warm heart i believe he will be remembered as a great president yet he too was often paralyzed by corporate and religious powers that are deeply racialized and gendered and include a male cult of guns sometimes i thought that if his opponents had cancer and obama had the cure they wouldnt accept it though in public opinion polls rightwing issues were rarely supported by more than a third of the country their representatives were elected and re elected by unlimited corporate contributions gerrymandering by state legislatures and low voter turnout they took and kept control of the once centrist republican party that had produced margaret chase smith and was the first to support the equal rights amendment now we need to be aware that this obstructionist minority is still hooked on hierarchy and still opposed to issues of equality add the fact that many men especially powerful men havent seen a female authority since childhood and they felt unmanned threatened and regressed by the prospect of hillary clinton in the most powerful position in the world add those white americans who are about to become a minority for the first time and are opposed to everything from birth control to immigration of course this is guilt talking they fear being treated as they have treated others finally there is free floating misogyny hostility to washington and real economic suffering all of which donald trump exploited incited or exposed the result is a lot im being realistic not negative almost every issue of equality now has majority support in public opinion polls ideas of race and gender are changing activism and iphones are exposing the racial violence that has always been there sexual assault from the campus to the military is no longer hidden and trumps very public misogyny has unified women educated men and inspired activism its the anita hill effect but deepened and multiplied trump has helped to expose desperation among those jobless and working poor who support him only because they oppose washington it is also telling that the angry third or so of this nation are desperate enough to support a soft and by stereotypical standards un masculine man like donald trump he inherited his power has no athletic or military record and no financial success earned on his own has cheated the hard working white male constituency he now courts behaves as a sexual predator toward women that alpha males are supposed to protect and sports cotton candy hair and suit jackets that fly open to reveal a gelatinous mass though a mans word is supposed to be his bond his own lawyer warned donald is a believer in the big lie theory if you say something again and again people will believe you to paraphrase the great mary mccarthy his every word is a lie including and and the at times like this gandhi used
at least seven people have been killed and more than taken to hospital after a tram believed to have been going too fast crashed in south london on wednesday morning survivors of the accident said people went flying as the tram left the tracks with bodies and blood inside the carriages following the derailment which occurred at about some passengers said the driver of the vehicle who was arrested afterwards had blacked out martin bamford from croydon one of those on the tram recalled it speeding up everyone just literally went flying he said speaking outside croydon university hospital where he was being treated for broken ribs he added it was just terrifying there was a woman that was on top of me i dont think she made it at all she wasnt responsive there was blood everywhere bamford said he asked the driver if he was ok he said yeah i said to him what happened he said he thinks he blacked out royal navy veteran kevin snow was one of those injured he said the tram failed to slow down at its usual point coming out of a tunnel between the lloyd park and sandilands stops usually as you come out the tunnel you feel the brakes but i didnt seem to at all i thought he should be braking in a minute the next thing i knew we were on our side everyone was screaming and shouting a lot of people were injured lots couldnt move he said the tram slid for between eight and seconds before coming to a halt it seemed like for ever that everyone was trying to get out but we couldnt find a way out all i could think about was if no one called the emergency services could another tram hit us the rail accident investigation branch said initial indications suggest that the tram was travelling at a significantly higher speed than is permitted british transport police asst ch con robin smith said the force was investigating whether the driver fell asleep alongside a number of factors he said officers would be working through the night at the scene and staff would be present for a number of days he said we have a very difficult and very challenging scene we have carriages that are lying on their side which will eventually have to be moved carefully and at the same time us being able to understand exactly what happened the year old male driver from beckenham is being held on suspicion of manslaughter and is currently in custody british transport police said the crash occurred near to sandilands junction on a sharp left hand curve as the tram was approaching a stop as it travelled from new addington to wimbledon there is a speed limit on the section in question which is on old rail tracks the croydon trams have a top speed of around after news the crash broke claims emerged on facebook that an incident had occurred on the same stretch of line on october though there were no reports that anyone was hurt in a post written that day andy nias from croydon wrote of us on the tram this morning and we all thought our time was up tram driver took the hard corner to sandilands at i swear the tram lifted on to one side everyone still shaking its mad in a further post on wednesday nias said he had reported the incident to british transport police who advised him not to speak to journalists another man james tofield who is also from croydon said he too was on the tram on october on wednesday evening he posted an image online of a text message to his partner dated that morning it read the driver went round the bend so fast u no the tunnel when u r coming up to sandilands hes obviously forgot theres a bend approaching smacked on the brakes and somehow the tram managed to stay on the track he said he intended to report the incident to both transport for london and the police tfl said it was aware of the claims but refused to comment further because an investigation was ongoing british transport police did not respond to a request for comment wednesdays crash is the worst accident on the rail and tram networks since when seven people were killed in a rail crash near ufton nervet in berkshire when a car driver trying to kill himself caused a serious accident there have been no fatalities on board a tram in the uk since when two female passengers and the driver died when a tram caught fire in shettlestone road glasgow after a collision with a lorry martin harris who was on his way to work called his mother jane after the crash to tell her a body was lying on top of him she told the telegraph that he had told her it looked like the driver had fallen asleep jane harris added he was on the tram the tram was going really fast the

opposition leaders are warning that the democratic republic of the congo faces civil war if president joseph kabila does not relinquish his grip on power and step down when his mandate ends the drc has suffered repeated bouts of unrest since kabila announced that elections scheduled for this month would be delayed the countrys ruling coalition and part of the opposition recently agreed to postpone the vote to april however the deal was boycotted by rassemblement the main opposition coalition which says it violates the constitution congos powerful catholic church also rejected the agreement the international community has watched the continued turmoil in the vast central african state with increasing alarm scores of demonstrators and several policemen were killed and the offices of major opposition parties badly damaged amid widespread looting during protests in september no drc leader gives up power peacefully so why would joseph kabila vava tampa read morekabila supporters say logistical and financial constraints mean it is impossible to hold fair polls as planned critics say the president whose second term in office expires in december is trying to cling to power by whatever means necessary the people will take over said etienne tshisekedi the year old leader of both rassemblement and the union for democracy and social progress a political party kabila has performed a coup dtat against himself by signing that agreement to delay elections because he made an oath to protect the constitution valentin mubake tshisekedis political adviser said civil war was a predictable consequence of the governments delaying tactics elections are the only solution anything else will lead to war the people will take to the streets kabila will kill one or two million of them but he wont be able to kill million he said western states including the us have repeatedly told kabila to stick to the election calendar or be prepared to surrender power the us recently intensified targeted sanctions against senior individuals within the presidents inner circle the un which has an strong peacekeeping force in the country has asked political leaders not party to the new deal to seek to resolve their differences peacefully kabila took over as leader of the drc less than two weeks after his father laurent was shot by a bodyguard in the presidential palace in he was elected president in disputed polls in and again in the drcs constitution bars a third term critics of rassemblement have accused the coalition of trying to use the threat of street violence to extract concessions the church suspended its own participation in the talks in september and has called for elections to be held in in a statement bishops called for a firm commitment from kabila not to run for a third presidential term edem kodjo a former prime minister of togo appointed by the african union to facilitate negotiation talks said whether kabila goes or not or whether the congolese took to the streets in protest and got hunted down by the security forces was not his problem he said if president kabila wants to use the extra time weve given him to change the constitution and keep himself in power that would be an error we came here confident that we would settle something which could prevent this country from collapsing but if he wants to carry out a coup dtat nobody can stop him a recent opinion poll found that kabilas popularity has collapsed to and that the majority of congolese would vote either for tshisekedi or mose katumbi a former governor of katanga province and the owner of africas top football club he is currently overseas and faces prosecution in congo on charges of hiring mercenaries charges he says are politically motivated he has also refused to take part in negotiations with the government the poll conducted by the congo research group at new york university in collaboration with a congolese polling institute found that more than of the respondents oppose changing the constitution to allow kabila to stand for a third term with saying he should leave office this year the resource rich drc has been mired in violence and corruption since belgiums king leopold ii turned it into his own personal source of income at the end of the century dictator mobutu sese seko took power in and ruled for years amassing a billion dollar fortune which he spent on marble tiled gaudy palaces and leopardskin hats mobutu was overthrown in a coup in by laurent kabila the drc has never had a peaceful transition of power whereas neighbouring strongmen denis sassou nguesso in congo brazzaville and paul kagame in rwanda easily pushed through constitutional changes to allow them to stand for third terms kabila has been unable to take such a blunt approach kabila a former taxi driver has however received support from some african leaders last week chads idriss dby and angolas jos dos santos who have been in power for and years respectively endorsed the recent agreement between the congolese president and some opposition factions lambert mende a government spokesman said any accusations that kabila was trying to retain power were gross lies the constitution stipulated that the president should not leave office until a new president was elected mende said only someone who has not read the constitution or wants to discredit the president would call this a constitutional coup dtat he said we have had problems with the electoral process and we had to find a way to manage these problems and give the congolese people the opportunity to vote in the best electoral conditions possible but tshisekedi the opposition leader said the situation was worse than under mobutu the veteran politician said in an interview at his home in kinshasa this is the worst situation weve ever been in nothing is working the people have nothing except hunger the security situation is worse than ever the whole country is unsafe and kabila hasnt done anything under trees and faded beach umbrellas crowds of people
donald trump triumphed but so did bashar al assad like other leaders around the world syrias isolated president most likely spent the day after assessing the impact on him of the republicans unexpected victory the dreadful assad soaked in blood after five years of civil war is probably one of the big winners but there are plenty of big losers too putin applauds trump win and hails new era of positive ties with us read morevladimir putin heads up the first category trump has shown unusual partiality towards the russian president even though the two men have never met as a candidate trump suggested that unlike barack obama he could do business with putin and might for example accept russias illegal annexation of crimea trump failed to condemn alleged russian online hacking of the democratic party and covert meddling in the election process he has rattled nato allies in eastern europe by stating that as commander in chief he would not necessarily rush to their military assistance if threatened by russia in syria and iraq trump says his top priority is defeating isis not toppling the regime in damascus hence assads big sigh of relief he has declined to condemn russias leading role in the merciless bombardment of eastern aleppo and its actions on other syrian battlefronts which the un says may constitute war crimes it is widely believed russia is gearing up for a final battle to take aleppo for its ally assad while the american transition is under way perversely despite his focus on isis little or nothing has been heard from trump about moscows targeting of syrian opposition factions rather than the jihadis like the people of syria the citizens of afghanistan are losers too for them trump represents a new twist in an old nightmare he sees continued us military involvement there as contrary to american interests and could simply pull out leaving the country to the taliban and al qaida china tantalized by us election mayhem and prospect of trump as president read morexi jinping chinas president is probably feeling quite good xi is a strong authoritarian quasi dictatorial figure the sort of leader like putin that trump appears to admire one can imagine the two men hitting it off on a personal level although xi is the more subtle of the two he will worry about trumps unpredictable temperament and his talk of trade tariffs on china xi will relish trumps criticism of obamas so called pivot to asia which he sees as a bid to contain china if trump pivots away from the region that will suit beijing just fine especially if it means it can accelerate its illegal expansionism in the south china sea and ratchet up the pressure on taiwan a big asian loser on the face of it is shinzo abe japans prime minister who has bet the farm on closer military ties with the us trump says japan and south korea must do more to defend themselves including possibly acquiring nuclear weapons to deter north korea his threats to nuke north korea if provoked could if realised make losers of us all in contrast a big undeserving winner is rodrigo duterte the new philippines president who famously called obama a son of a whore and declared he was cutting military cooperation duterte notorious for the drug busting death squads he has unleashed welcomed trumps victory on wednesday a reaction that will likely be shared by human rights abusers from belarus to burma in iran hassan rouhani is in an even bigger bind now that trump is heading for the white house his nuclear deal last year with obama is under constant fire from conservatives including the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei in this respect trump has much in common with the mullahs he called the pact the worst ever deal in history and vowed to scrap it trumps evident ignorance of and lack of interest in large parts of the world mean for example the pressure may be off leaders like omar al bashir sudans president who stands accused of genocide and war crimes in darfur and the repressive regime in saudi arabia responsible for documented atrocities in yemen trump does not support the international criminal court or the un system in general antonio guterres the incoming un secretary general may struggle to keep a trump administration engaged are entering a reign of mexico reels from trump election win read moremexico as yet not walled off looked like another big loser as the peso went through the floor president enrique pea nieto is widely loathed by his electorate for failing to challenge trump during his surprise visit to the country in september but in private he may be congratulating himself for getting on the right side of his new neighbour the lukewarm reaction to trumps success in many european capitals reflects a deep ideological as well as a political antipathy german ministers normally extremely cautious in public statements went so far as to imply it was a thoroughly bad outcome franois hollande the french president was even surlier saying the result showed the need for europe looking after itself for the eu already battered by brexit trump is bad news his hostility to free trade means the proposed ttip agreement is dead if not yet buried his belief that europe must do more to maintain its own security challenges the eu to put its money where it mouth is in developing a euro army and other independent capabilities this could hardly come at a worse time for the stripped eurozone countries the positive reaction of rightwing populist and nationalist parties across europe including frances national front indicates that they feel his anti establishment insurgency may facilitate theirs as close elections loom in france germany and the netherlands for britains government however trump could provide a much needed boost trump applauded the narrow british vote to leave the eu and hosted its best known advocate nigel farage on the campaign
wall street reacted positively to the election of donald trump as the us president despite his victory sparking panic on global markets earlier in the day but experts warned that the us and global economy faces a very uncertain future heres how the markets looked at the close the dow jones up to points the s p up to the nasdaq up to the biggest corporate winners were private prison operators oil companies and pharmaceutical companies all of these sectors faced punishing regulations under a clinton presidency and will benefit from trumps mission to loosen controls of businesses on the currency markets the dollar hit its highest in nearly four months against the japanese yen it had fallen in overnight trading the mexican peso plunged before stabilizing at at pesos to the dollar year treasury yield rose above the highest level since january economists cut their forecasts for us gdp growth by percentage points and warned of despair in the financial markets trumps economist adviser warned that janet yellens days as chair of the federal reserve are numbered and the odds of the central bank increasing interest rates in december have lengthened the ftse fell upon opening on wednesday before recovering to end the day more than points up the japanese nikkei closed down and hong kongs hang seng fell were wrapping up for the day but well be back tomorrow the former chairman and ceo of general electric said the opportunities are unlimited under a trump presidency you look at lower taxes you look at job creation we are stuck we have been stuck in a terrible overregulated economy for eight years i mean stuck business stinks welch a longtime republican told cnbc that he liked trumps message from the first day but he is still concerned about the messenger every time i lurched forward in support id lose the messenger hed do some wacky thing he said he said he hoped trump would build a broad coalition of republican talent in the white house you cant have grudges in this game you need talent we will win with the best people he said welch withdrew his support for trump following the revelations that the president elect thought he could grope women with impunity because he was famous jack welch like republican message on economy security and supreme court unfortunately wrong messenger party must change nominee now october the guardians economics editor larry elliott says americans have gambled on trumps promise that he can shift the the us out of its post financial crisis torpor by cutting taxes and increasing spending even though they run the risk of higher inflation and a bigger budget deficit although trump campaigned as an outsider his policies have been tried before ronald reagan said his tax cuts and extra spending for the pentagon would generate higher revenues and balance the budget it didnt tax breaks for the rich and military keynesianism sent the deficit rocketing for the time being all wall street can see is higher growth and bigger corporate profits thats why share prices have been going up you can read larrys whole piece here trump will have to temper his global antagonism economists saydont panic too much says berenberg banks chief americas economist mickey levy in a note to clients trump will learn quickly that international affairs are very complex and he will quickly come to rely on the various government agencies and experts that understand and influence the us approaches on international affairs this will serve to soften some of his brash statements during the campaign levy said trumps often outrageous campaign pledges to build a wall with mexico and tear up global trade agreements will fade with no material follow through or implementation and no wall will be built between mexico and the us china and mexico are two of the uss largest trading partners neither wants to enter a trade war with the us and neither can afford to do so the us relies heavily on imports from those partners current concerns about major trade barriers being erected are over stated and not realistic luca paolini chief strategist pictet asset management declared trump no friend of trade and warned that his protectionist streak poses perhaps the biggest threat to both world growth and financial markets his proposals to raise trade tariffs pledging among other things to levy a per cent tax on chinese imports are a worry his denouncement of china as a currency manipulator could also invite retaliation from the worlds second biggest economy at a time when global trade appears to be experiencing a structural decline trumps stance casts a shadow over the worlds economic prospects bofa merrill lynch downgrades us growththe bank has cut its forecasts for us gdp growth by percentage points in both the first and second quarter of and warned of despair in the financial markets it said near term drag shaved from first and second quarter gdp growth thereby lowering the annual number from to a more cautious fed we expect rather than fed rate hikes between now and the end of next year with the probability of a december hike falling to in given the high level of uncertainty about the exact policy changes at this stage we are assuming that trade tensions and fiscal stimulus have offsetting impacts on growth in the medium term while a wide range of outcomes is possible the risks to the economy seem to be skewed more to the downside trumps economic advisers have accused janet yellen the chair of the federal reserve of creating a false economy by keeping interest rates artificially low to help president obama and his democratic opponent hillary clinton trump has attacked yellen throughout his campaign in september he said yellen should be ashamed of herself i used to hope that the fed was independent he said in an interview with cnbc and the fed is obviously not independent its obviously not even close to being independent just hours
in an unexpected win donald trump rode the wave of anti establishment sentiment to become the next president elect of the us if youre a mexican living in mexico or the us wed like to hear from you what do you make of the results how are you feeling share your reactions with us by filling in the form below well feature a selection of responses in our live coverage topicsus elections trumphillary clintonus politics
in the long run i have hopedavid colorado a lifelong republican who voted for hillary clintoni am very disappointed about the result but i cant be despondent i am by nature an optimistic person so as the evening wore on and it became clear that trump was going to win i started thinking about what is actually going to happen after this in the beginning there will be dark moments and things will happen that are not good for our country or for the world im sure that the affordable care act wont survive for example but then i believe that the republicans will start to realize that they didnt really get what they wanted trump after all isnt a republican he has made that clear he just agrees with them on some things or claims to i think the first half of trumps term will go very badly for the republicans voters will become disillusioned and the midterm elections in will be disastrous for them democrats will probably end up with control of both houses of congress well get a new supreme court justice but im not worried about whether theyll be too conservative i would be more worried that they wont be qualified in the long run though i have hope i believe in checks and balancesdan california voted for donald trumpits done voted shortly after polls open on tuesday and i voted for trump reluctantly no disrespect intended to the third party candidates but a vote for an alternate candidate is in reality a vote either trump or clinton so i was faced with a vote for an incompetent or a crook i chose to vote for the incompetent in the end it wasnt the emails that sealed the deal it was the remaining hope that checks and balances would modify the impending chaos the system of checks and balances appears to be in position to better counter trump than hillary trump has already lost substantial support among the gop so he cant count on either the existing supreme court or congress to ignore him then there is the press what we see is a press overwhelmingly anti trump a vote for hillary means we can not count on the press to honestly and diligently keep the public informed of hillarys potential malfeasance nor at this point can we count on the institutions of government to counter hillary in any meaningful way so i voted for the candidate likely to lead us into the weeds without opposition the establishment underestimated the publics ragegeno pennsylvania voted for jill steinwell i think were all astounded instead of bushs predictable fifth term were facing nobody quite knows what i never thought this was a serious possibility until today but the establishment apparently made a misjudgment in underestimating the publics rage after decades of being impoverished to benefit the since the primary was rigged against the only semi progressive major candidate this was the next prominent way to give the democrats a well deserved heave im not exactly shocked at that but dismayed that so many of my fellow citizens still refused to look outside the two party duopoly or help the greens reach federal funding levels the impetus is understandable this is a rejection of the two party status quo more than an actual endorsement of trumps racism or anti intellectualism but the forces hes unleashing are volatile and damn scary as always the bigger struggle starts after voting positive change only comes from public action so theres arguably a better chance for it now than under a democratic president if theres no actual policy coming from the oval office theres space for saner voices to shape it itll be tough but at least the citizenry seems ready to seriously push back the campaign got younger voters surprisingly engaged and proved that candidates dont have to be owned by corporate money if enough ers remember the power lies with us we may have a fighting chance after all i am ashamed of how this plays with the rest of the worldsarah florida voted for hillary clintonhillary clinton lost this election because sexism enabled voters to perceive the most qualified candidate in the world as someone more reprehensible than bar none the most despicable person who has ever sought the presidency because the contingent of mostly older white americans overlooked empathy for minority groups due to their own positions of privilege because of voter apathy because we watched brexit happen and refused to heed its warning i am ashamed of how this plays with the rest of the world ashamed of my state in particular and dread what consequences it will bring the fallout of supreme court turnover alone will last long after his term is done it should go without saying that a president should not threaten the wellbeing of certain citizens as a main selling point in his campaign and my heart goes out to any individual who feels unsafe i know the cold fear you are experiencing the only way we can think to proceed is to brace for a prolonged fight ahead of us the man slated to be president has built his platform on harming the vulnerable and shouting over the voices of the oppressed if you find this rhetoric deplorable if you are kind then seize any opportunity to defy it do not wait to speak out until they come for you to clinton your loss is the nations loss i am sorry they were too blind to see the america im waking up to today scares memonica vermont voted for hillary clintonin my wildest dreams i never would have thought the public would swing so wildly away from reason as to elect someone like trump i grew up in a working class latino family im a liberal but my father was conservative ive been a single mom working multiple jobs to keep a roof over my daughters head and struggled to make ends meet

theresa may has congratulated donald trump on his us presidential election victory as the labour leader jeremy corbyn and his lib dem counterpart tim farron expressed deep unease at the result nicola sturgeon has urged donald trump to prove that he can act for all us citizens regardless of their heritage after his surprise victory in the us presidential elections david davis has pledged to share the westminster governments latest thinking on brexit with the leaderships of scotland northern ireland and wales before the first meeting of a forum intended to allow the devolved administrations to help shape britains strategy two families who claimed that the bedroom tax which restricts housing subsidies was unfair have won their appeals against the uk government at the supreme court amnesty international has criticised a uk trade minister for travelling to qatar to seek contracts for british companies ahead of the world cup without apparently highlighting the human rights abuses faced by migrant workers building venues for the event thats all from me for today thanks for the comments what will or should donald trumps presidency mean for the uk here are three good articles that address this jeremy cliffe at the economist says a trump presidency will make brexit harder a single theme unifies these risks brexit is a giant shock to britains place in the world it will sever old links and require new ones to be forged as some of its keenest proponents concede this transition will bring painful costs most of all it demands lots of good will and flexibility on all sides in so far as mr trumps win means a meaner more fractious more volatile global order it raises those costs and shrinks that space for compromise and consensus essential for a smooth brexit limiting the damage of a trump presidency on a brexiting britain demands ambition and perspective from mrs may her approach should be two sided first build a new closer alliance with angela merkel not just on brexit but on wider issues the world economy security russia and china in berlin and other european capitals officials complain that junes referendum result has taken britains mind off all other matters the prime minister must not allow that to happen and instead work with mrs merkel as a bloc capable of countering mr trumps worst traits second mrs may should use britains influence in america to attempt to moderate the new president staying his hand when he does wrong and indulging his vanity when he does right mrs may already had her hands full with brexit now for britains sake and that of the world she must also deal with mr brexit himself will straw executive director of britain stronger in europe at the new statesman looks at what the left can learn from the trump and brexit victories a new politics is necessary one with the seeds of dignity we must find our way to a prosperity which gives people a greater sense of belonging where communities have more autonomy to judge their own affairs and where international cooperation is used to tackle the worst excesses of globalisation including tax avoidance human trafficking and illegal immigration so too do we need a new language of politics one that refuses to pander to prejudice but recognises that what the social psychologist jonathan haidt calls the moral octaves which those on the left cannot hear for example imagine that there are concentric circles of loyalty family community country which are not just a comfort blanket in times of crises but are hardwired into us as human beings from this perspective overt displays of patriotism which may make liberals uncomfortable can in fact be harnessed and used to reinforce positive values larry summers an academic and former adviser to barack obama has called it responsible nationalism which starts from the idea that the basic responsibility of government is to maximise the welfare of citizens not to pursue some abstract concept of the global good bill emmott at capx asks if the special relationship can survive we cannot know in advance how protectionist the us is going to become but we can know that britain as a trading nation wanting to buy and sell freely with the whole world is likely to be a loser if protectionism really does become the flavour of the era at least the traditionally close relationship between our intelligence services and those of america can still be depended upon but it is not going to be a comfortable or predictable ride theresa may and boris johnson had better mean it when they say that post brexit britain will have a great new

result through the same prism as brexit the head of the no policy board george freeman tweeted at its heart this is about a broken contract through the failure of globalised market economics to serve the interests of domestic workers he said the result was a stunning demonstration of how disempowered low income americans feel by washington politics and globalisation the insurgency is a big test for the constitutional protections for liberty and democracy in the uk and the us it is clear we are living through a genuine crisis of legitimacy sweeping through western political economy he asked whether the eu leaders will wake up to the roar of anger at globalisation machine politics and out of touch elites freeman who was a fierce critic of the tone of trumps campaign and at one point described him as trumpolini added the key now is how he governs and who he appoints to his administration nicola sturgeon urged trump to prove that he can act for all us citizens regardless of their heritage the scottish first minister said many us voters and others around the world would feel a real sense of anxiety at his victory adding i hope the president elect will take the opportunity to reach out to those who felt marginalised by his campaign and make clear in deeds as well as words that he will be a president for everyone in modern multicultural america today must also be a moment for those who share progressive values all of us who believe in tolerance and diversity to speak up loudly and clearly for the values we hold dear francefrench president franois hollande said trumps

theresa may has congratulated donald trump on his us presidential election victory as the labour leader jeremy corbyn and his lib dem counterpart tim farron expressed deep unease at the result the prime minister said she was confident that strong co operation on trade security and defence would continue with the republican in the white house despite his presidential campaign pledges to pursue a more protectionist economic policy and isolationist foreign agenda i would like to congratulate donald trump on being elected the next president of the united states following a hard fought campaign

that his wife believed there were enough donalds on the world stage corbyn said many in britain would be understandably shocked by donald trumps victory in the us presidential election the rhetoric around it and what the election result means for the rest of the world as well as america the victory for the republican outsider should be taken as an unmistakable rejection of a political establishment and an economic system that simply isnt working for most people corbyn said adding it is one that has delivered escalating inequality and stagnating or falling living standards for the majority both in the us and britain he called trumps victory a rejection of a failed economic consensus and a governing elite that has been seen not to have listened and said public anger had been reflected in political upheavals around the world some of trumps answers to the issue of economic instability and the rhetoric he used were clearly wrong the labour leader said i have no doubt however that the decency and common sense of the american people will prevail and we send our solidarity to a nation of migrants innovators and democrats after this latest global wakeup call the need for a real alternative to a failed economic and political system could not be clearer that alternative must be based on working together social justice and economic renewal rather than sowing fear and division and the solutions we offer have to improve the lives of everyone not pit one group of people against another americans have made their choice the urgent necessity is now for us all to work across continents to tackle our common global challenges to secure peace take action on climate change and deliver economic prosperity and justice farron issued an angry statement after the result saying the continued rise of the populist right did not have to be inevitable liberal values of moderation freedom respect for the rule of law openness and concern for one another can no longer be taken for granted he said in the united states last night those values were defeated but those values are vital if we are to live together in peace prosperity and freedom those who still believed in a future for liberal values need to fight for them to win the arguments to inspire new generations to the great and historic cause of liberalism farron said never in my lifetime have those liberal values been so under threat and never have they been more relevant and necessary there is nothing inevitable about the rise of nationalism protectionism and division the election of canadas prime minister justin trudeau proves that i am determined that together we must make it our mission to build that liberal cause the alternatives are unthinkable among other mps and politicians reaction was mixed in an emailed statement with the subject line caroline lucas responds to racist being elected us president the green party mp called trumps election a devastating day for women for people of colour for disabled people and for an inclusive society in the usa a hammer blow for the fight against climate change the conservative mp michael fabricant said he was hopeful of closer us uk ties

heres an overview of where we are this morning donald trump has won the presidency in a stunning upset that surprised pollsters and media alike hillary clinton called trump to concede the election shortly after wisconsin was called for the republican candidate sealing his victory the former secretary of state did not make a concession speech instead she allowed advisor john podesta to tell the crowd at her party in new yorks javits center to go home shes expected to make a concession speech this morning in his victory speech trump called for unity praising clinton for a hard fought campaign

nuclear accord tasnim which is affiliated to the elite iranian revolutionary guards saw donald trumps win as a vindication for the iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who said last week that the american businessman appeared to be the one saying the truth about the state of affairs in the us referring to trump khamenei said last week what is interesting is that the person who spoke more candidly attracted more attention from the people of america because that man spoke more candidly and more openly the people of america paid more attention to him the other party clintons camp said that he is adopting a populist method why populist it is because the people were watching him and they saw that what he was saying was correct they saw it in the realities of their life human values have been annihilated and trampled upon in that country there is racial discrimination in that country fouad izadi a political analyst sympathetic to the conservative camp in iran said trumps presidency would be better for iran than that of clintons the only advantage of having trump over clinton in regards to iran is that he would have much more difficulties in bringing together the international community in order to make obstacles for iran he told tasnim analysts such as izadi think that pressure on iran in the past was because obama had managed to persuade the uss european allies to rally behind washington in imposing sanctions on iran they think trump lacks the credibility to do so in case the nuclear deal falls apart donald trump has updated his twitter bio to reflect his new position trumps twitter bio photograph twitter jeremy corbyn mp leader of the labour party in the uk gave the following statement many in britain and elsewhere will be understandably shocked by donald trumps victory in the us presidential election the rhetoric around it and what the election result means for the rest of the world as well as america trumps election is an unmistakable rejection of a political establishment and an economic system that simply isnt working for most people it is one that has delivered escalating inequality and stagnating or falling living standards for the majority both in the us and britain this is a rejection of a failed economic consensus and a governing elite that has been seen not to have listened and the public anger that has propelled donald trump to office has been reflected in political upheavals across the world but some of trumps answers to the big questions facing america and the divisive rhetoric around them are clearly wrong i have no doubt however that the decency and common sense of the american people will prevail and we send our solidarity to a nation of migrants innovators and democrats after this latest global wake up call the need for a real alternative to a failed economic and political system could not be clearer that alternative must be based on working together social justice and economic renewal rather than sowing fear and division and the solutions we offer have to improve the lives of everyone not pit one group of people against another americans have made their choice the urgent necessity is now

unexpected win which he said had proven that journalists and intellectuals were the true demagogues who were anchored to a world that no longer exists grillo also pointed out trump had been called sexist homophobic and populist much like the five star movement but that the establishment had failed to realise that people no longer read newspapers and did not watch television for news the real heroes he said were the misfits and the failures that were driving the tandem movements sending a big fuck you to the freemasons major banks and chinese groups other of renzis political opponents also

to accommodate those who were forced to wait in line for hours to cast early voting ballots according to cnn the trump campaigns legal team filed for relief in case the election of presidential electors from the state of nevada is contested this action is to preserve the status quo so that if the election of presidential electors from the state of nevada is contested the candidates and courts may redress egregious violations of nevada election law perpetrated by the registrar on november the lawsuit reads the registrars violations were not random and neutral in their effect but very

the dakota access pipeline operator chose the day of the us presidential election to announce that the final phase of its controversial construction project will begin in two weeks marking a bold escalation in its response to the native american protests dakota access pipeline the who what and why of the standing rock protests read moreenergy transfer partners the company overseeing the north dakota oil pipeline has already completed construction up to the river that provides water to the standing rock sioux tribe and announced on tuesday it would soon begin drilling at the site the company said it would not halt construction despite requests by federal agencies to delay the project as the us government reassesses permits and considers possible reroutes in a statement energy transfer partners said it was mobilizing horizontal drilling equipment in preparation for tunneling under lake oahe a reservoir on the missouri river by the protest camps and native american reservation the corporation said it would be ready to start crossing the water in two weeks the announcement came on a quiet election day at the encampments built by members of the standing rock sioux nation and other indigenous people in opposition to the pipeline after a string of clashes and mass arrests rumors spread among activists that the pipeline government and tribal leaders had negotiated a day moratorium on both construction and protest or religious ceremonies on the front lines of the conflict im in shock im speechless said cheryl angel a sicangu lakota tribe member who has been at the standing rock camps since the spring its unconscionable and devastating its almost as though they have no soul the announcement presents the final phase of construction as a done deal and will be seen as a clear illustration that the oil company is aggressively moving forward with the pipeline in defiance of barack obama and the thousands of demonstrators who are camped out at standing rock to fight the project last week obama made his first remarks on the huge demonstrations since police arrested hundreds of unarmed protesters who call themselves water protectors and say the pipeline is destroying sacred indigenous lands the president said the us army corps of engineers was exploring ways to reroute around native american lands and said the government was going to let it play out for several more weeks and determine whether or not this can be resolved in a way that i think is properly attentive to the traditions of the first americans in september the government said it would temporarily halt permits to dig on federal land near or under the missouri river and requested that the company voluntarily pause all construction activity within miles east or west of lake oahe energy transfer partners ignored that request and continued construction recently approaching within a few miles of the river causing widespread anger and sadness at the standing rock camps which have been opposing the pipeline since april tuesdays statement does not address the requests from the government for a delay on the contrary it suggests that the company is not giving consideration to alternative routes or obamas recent remarks dakota access previously received a permit from the army corps with respect the tunneling activities under lake oahe and dakota access has all other regulatory approvals and land rights to complete the crossing of the missouri river at lake oahe the statement said adding that the company expects to receive final permissions in a time frame that will not result in any significant delay the army corps did not respond to requests for comment asked about obamas comments pipeline spokeswoman vicki granado told the guardian we are not aware that any consideration is being given to a reroute and we remain confident we will receive our easement in a timely fashion the companys announcement comes as north dakota regulators are moving ahead with a formal complaint against the corporation for failing to properly disclose findings of native american artifacts along the construction route angel said the pipeline construction plan was environmentally irresponsible and illegal considering the army corps has yet to approve final permits noting that the missouri river provided drinking water to millions she added im in tears because i cant believe the company would do this to a whole group of people who dont have any say this past sunday more than a hundred water protectors used boats to ferry across the cannonball river and attempted to climb turtle island a portion of army corps land where tribal members say there are burial sites several tribal elders including darrel killsinsight implored everyone to return to the main camp referencing the alleged day agreement but representatives of the tribe never officially confirmed that any such agreement was in place and tuesdays statement flies in the face of any hope for a moratorium jan hasselman the attorney representing the standing rock sioux in its permit litigation said that the statement from dakota access was probably a response to an army corps spokesman telling bloomberg that the company had agreed to slow construction but she added dakota access does not have all the permits it needs to begin drilling including the easement starting construction without permits would be beyond the pale even for dakota access hasselman told the guardian it is deeply irresponsible to keep putting investors money into this route when both the president and senator tim kaine are openly discussing rerouting away from lake oahe the timing of the announcement on election day instantly raised suspicion and anger among the activists gathered at standing rock activists have expressed frustration with the us presidential race noting that democratic candidate hillary clinton has refused to take a position on the conflict and gop candidate donald trump has close financial ties to the pipeline with the election being so big and north dakota being so small they think they can just sweep this under the rug said danny grassrope a member of the lower brule sioux tribe im

only we can save the planetdamian carringtons piece on the recent wwf and zoological society report was horrifying to read despite politicians talking about sustainability climate change and the protection of the natural environment we are actually doing little we go on using finite resources continuing to build large projects consuming without much regard for the ecological damage we do the carbon we create the indigenous habitat we lose and the destruction we cause we really have to stop talking about the importance of the environment and act to halt the loss of the biodiversity livability and sustainability of our planet weve lost so much forest and so many animal species through land clearing climate change and human developments we must preserve what wild habitat remains we need to take a stand and say stop not just for the welfare and betterment of humanity and the future we pass on to our kids but for the other creatures that inhabit the planet and the health of the earth itself the ecological situation is dire environmental destruction is increasing pressure on many ecosystems and wild animals lets be the wise generation that solves these urgent problems steven katsinerishurstbridge victoria australiathe great water follyafter more than years of reading the guardian weekly i cannot remember an article that falls wider of the mark than sophie elmhirsts piece on bottled water these superficially cutesy four pages of prose totally ignore the many real issues surrounding the bottled water industry i live on vancouver island one of the great rainforests of the world yet just last year we endured four months of water restrictions because of severe drought a few years earlier in tofino one of the wettest areas of north america the authorities found themselves without sufficient municipal water and were forced to bring in the precious commodity on trucks farther east in ontario members of a small community are fighting the giant nestl apparatus in an attempt to head off plans for further expansion of a water bottling operation that already draws billions of litres from the local aquifer this is the same nestl whose ceo is on record as saying that public access to water is not a right and that privatisation of the life giving resource is the way to go so the world ends up with mountains of plastic bottles more fossil fuels burned to deliver them and more landfills crammed with useless garbage the guardian has done magnificent work with its keep it in the ground campaign but elmhirsts article reads more like a trade show catalogue than the kind of journalism for which this newspaper is praised in canada water is becoming a serious issue in some parts of the world it is already a matter of life and death the world has indeed gone mad but some consideration of the real issues by elmhirst would have been welcome barry munnnanoose bay british columbia canada i find a stark contrast between the succeeding articles in your october issue a small price for dignity discusses how elderly people in rural ghana make wonderful use of tiny amounts of money provided through their governments social protection programmes the

he set out in advance to lay blame squarely on the maverick venezuelan government certainly his account is one sided whether through political bias or ignorance there are two remarkable things about the venezuelan revolution which watts does not remark on first over the period poverty was reduced by healthcare became free and of a high standard and so did education over the same years the us appalled by the threat to its interests in the country with the largest oil reserves on the planet channelled more than to opposition groups with the stated objective of regime change despite extreme hardship with inflation and supplies of food and medicines there is evidence that a large number of people probably the majority do not want an opposition government that promises nothing but foreign intervention and uncertainty and that their dreams have not dried up they are up against history however which tells us that socialism in one country is likely to fail especially in a country that is so strategically important to a large capitalist neighbour mike downhamstrathblane uktime to get rid of electionsthanks to george monbiot for bringing christopher achen and larry bartelss important work democracy for realists to a broader audience i wish you had also printed the subtitle of their very interesting book why elections do not produce responsive government as it hints at how we could fix our broken democracies its time to get rid of elections yes this suggestion shocks most people as elections and democracy are synonymous in most peoples minds however as david van reybrouck in his book against elections argues and the sortition foundation in the uk recognises there is a more democratic alternative to elections random selection of people to political office everyones first reaction to this suggestion is incredulity but it is how the ancient athenians not usually considered ignorant in political matters populated the vast majority of their political offices how the irish are debating their constitutional ban on abortion how south australia is deliberating about nuclear waste dumps in that state and how the city of geelong is deciding on the structure of its new council random selection is fast becoming the new gold standard for democratic legitimacy and although its no panacea it would solve many of the problems that monbiot acknowledges offering much more

thats it for this blog and the campaign our new york team is up early for a polling day blog us election voters head to polls as trump and clinton aim to make history live read more hillary clinton has a chance of winning the election according to a polling day email from the respected pollster nate silver thats up from a chance on sunday night so clinton has had a good run in the polls in the final days of the campaign clintons projected margin of victory in the popular vote has increased to from as a lot of you noticed nevada north carolina and florida flipped from red to blue over the course of monday we dont think thats a particularly meaningful metric because the forecasts are probabilistic clintons chances of winning florida increased to from for instance which is nontrivial but not an especially large change still we know its something a lot of readers follow its unlikely that any further states will flip to clinton in our final forecast as shes too far behind in ohio the next closest state its possible that florida and north carolina could flip to trump by tomorrow morning though probably not nevada where clintons lead is a bit larger who is to blame for not stopping trump sooner few suspects spared a mention in jonathan freedlands hall of shame they include the other republican presidential candidates such as jeb bush marco and ted cruz who allowed themselves to be streamrollered by a reality tv host and serially bankrupted businessman but also trumps trio of enablers rudy giuliani chris christie and newt gingrich those three horsemen of the republican apocalypse conspired in the lie that a snake oil salesman was fit to be president and destroyed what remained of their reputations in the process plus trumps running mate mike pence the defender of family values who has served as the running mate of a thrice married serially adulterous self confessed grabber of women freedland also rounds on the indulgence on a epic scale of the media and there are cameos for julian assange and vladimir putin and finally theres a dig at the us electorate some blame surely attaches to the americans who let trump keep up the bullying and the bigotry and voted for him anyway there is no escaping the fact that north of of the us electorate have been prepared to vote for trump despite everything that he has said and done one poll found of trumps own supporters believed he would start a nuclear war they thought that but were prepared to vote for him anyway none of them will be able to say we didnt know who is to blame for this awful us election

information from the attorney generals department that are relevant to the terms of reference this includes an order for the department to produce documents sent on october the department has advised the committee that it has provided relevant documents to the attorney general and that these are still being considered with a view to the attorney general making a claim of public interest immunity the committee is concerned that the attorney general has only been prepared to provide documents that could in some way be construed to substantiate the assertion that the direction was substantively discussed at the meeting on november despite other participants contradicting this claim the committee has not been provided with any of the documents it has asked for pertaining to the direction in his submission the attorney general refers to handwritten meeting notes taken by his staff which merely refer to the process of obtaining advice as defined by the direction and guidance note no documents have been produced to substantiate the actual consultation process and drafting of the directionmckim wants a senate select committee created to assess whether they are reasonable claims it is time for the senate to stand up and be counted because we are being treated by contempt by the government mckim says he is talking to labor and other senators about the issue he gives no indication whether he has the numbers for the committee the opposition and greens dominated the senate committee so there is always a dissenting report from government members government senators say the inquiry set up by labor destroyed the career of the solicitor general this is from the dissenting report during the course of the inquiry government members came to the conclusion that the position of the solicitor general had become untenable the solicitor generals subsequent decision to resign was in the view of government members of the committee commendable and perhaps an unavoidable consequence of the public inquiry government members regret that this inquiry set up by the labor party to attack senator the hon george brandis attorney general of the commonwealth of australia has in the end destroyed the career of the solicitor general who was himself appointed by the previous labor administration government members of the committee are concerned that the majority on the committee have used the senate committee process and thereby the taxpayers indulgence to pursue a partisan political agenda recommendation the senate disallow the amendment to the direction or the attorney general withdraw it immediately and that the guidance note be revised accordingly recommendation that the attorney general provide within three sitting days an explanation to the senate responding to the matters raised in this report recommendation that the senate censure the attorney general for misleading the parliament and failing to discharge his duties as attorney general appropriately senator ian macdonald is criticising gleeson for telling the committee hearing details about advice he has given without the permission of his clients ie the ag he says the sg is a senior public servant and should abide by the rules of his job paul karp pratt brandis said not just that he consulted but that he consulted with the solicitor general auspol auslawnovember paul karp pratt the attorney general was not informed the direction was wrong in
greg clarke the business secretary has told mps that workers rights will be protected when the uk leaves the eu speaking tonight in the first of a series of general brexit debates the government is holding he said no one listening to this debate should think that we have any intention of eroding the rights that we enjoy in this country through our process of leaving the european union because in fact the opposite is true we will be using the legislation before this house to entrench all existing workers rights in british law whatever the future relationship that the uk has with the eu he said that when the government passed its great repeal bill incorporating eu laws into uk domestic legislation all workers rights in eu law would be carried over and he denied claims that the government might include a sunset clause time limiting these protections there is no intention to have a sunset clause he said david davis has confirmed that the government may have to wait until january for a supreme court ruling on whether it can press ahead with the formal process of exiting the eu without a parliamentary vote theresa may has come under pressure from business leaders to open britains doors to more skilled indian workers and students to boost the economy and help secure a post brexit trade deal nicola sturgeon scotlands first minister has urged the uk government to further slow the pace of deficit reduction in the forthcoming autumn statement in a lecture at sheffield university she suggested austerity and lack of hope helped to explain why people voted for brexit she said uk economic policy arguably over several decades but particularly in recent years has not given enough people enough grounds for hope the current government has already abandoned the deficit reduction targets it was elected on in just as the previous government abandoned in the deficit reduction targets it set itself in theres a good reason for that the severity of government cuts has permanently reduced the productive capacity of the economy as a result cuts hindered rather than helped attempts to reduce government debt austerity is a policy which has failed categorically and comprehensively on its own terms it has also imposed needless hardship on individuals and families across the uk austerity hasnt just harmed our economy it has damaged our society fewer than one in four eligible married couples have applied for an allowance that could reduce their tax bill by up to a year hmrc figures show austerity policies introduced into welfare and social care by the uk government amount to systematic violations of the rights of people with disabilities a un inquiry has concluded thats all from me for tonight thanks for the comments clark says the conservative party is the true workers party dedicated to protecting workers rights clark says the government recognises it has more to do to tackle the gender pay gap clark says the government will not water down the tupe rules transfer of undertakings regulations which ensure that workers do not lose rights if their jobs are privatised or transferred to another employer mps are now debating brexit and workers rights this is the first of several debates the government is holding on brexit but it is just a general debate and there will not be a vote at the end and so the debate itself will count for little greg clark the business secretary opened the debate in his opening remarks he said the government would protect workers rights when it repatriated employment legislation to the uk nicholas cecil business secretary greg clark vows to protect workers rights after brexit https t co ozxsfmbocxnovember stewart business secretary greg clark all of the rights that are enjoyed in the eu will be imported into uk law in great repeal bill november here are the main points from david daviss statement on the article court ruling davis accused mps demanding parliamentary control of the article process of wanting to wreck the brexit negotiation he said the government might have to wait until january for the result of the supreme court appeal when labours angela smith said it might take this long he replied yes she is right in one respect that it may come as late as early january the expectation is that the case will be heard in the early part of december and it will take two or three weeks i expect to get the judgment written up but i think it is the proper role of government to wait and respect the judgment we get from the supreme court full stop davis rejected calls from several mps for the government to hold a vote on triggering article before the supreme court judgment it was right to wait until the supreme court issued its decision he said but he told the conservative nicky morgan that although he could not agree to her proposal for an early vote on a one line article bill he was very tempted by the idea and when peter bone a conservative said the government should just hold a vote on a resolution backing triggering article davis said that the government was not proposing that but that the commons itself could decide to have a vote he also suggested the government wanted to clarify the law on prerogative powers generally not least because they cover decisions like going to war he said that although the high court ruling implied that the government had to pass primary legislation to be allowed to trigger article the supreme court ruling could say something different he was responding to questions about whether parliament would have to pass a bill to allow the government to trigger article or whether just passing a resolution would be enough if the government loses its appeal to the supreme court he defended the independence of the judiciary although he refused to condemn those newspapers that attacked the high court judges for their
there has arguably not been a us presidential election with so much at stake for the rest of the world since the second world war one candidate stands largely for continuity signalling she would do slightly more than her predecessor to shore up the existing liberal world order her opponent is vowing to turn that order on its head jettisoning alliances and free trade agreements while seeking to cut deals with the worlds authoritarian powers if donald trump is elected on tuesday it is likely to trigger a foreign policy crisis inside washington as the diplomatic and security establishments scramble to discover whether he meant what he said on the campaign trail those who believe that the election talk was all bluster and that trump will tack back to a more traditional republican foreign policy once elected are likely to be disappointed according to thomas wright an analyst at the brookings institution in washington us election trump and clinton in tight race on campaign final day live read more my view is he is a more ideological candidate than we often appreciate and while there is a lot of bluster and a lot of ignorance on a wide number of issues there are certain things that he has been pretty consistent on wright said i think he is opposed to us alliances and i think he would try to withdraw the us from security commitments around the world he is anti trade and he would veer towards a more mercantilist system and he is pro russian he is pro authoritarian some believe that trump would be confronted with a series of resignations by diplomats and generals if he tried to turn these campaign platforms into administration policy if on the other hand hillary clinton wins the electoral college vote she will face the opposite dilemma how to distinguish her foreign policy from barack obamas she has expressed an inclination toward a tougher stance in syria and in europe for example but the wiggle room for a change of policy has shrunk with every passing week as vladimir putin has sought to create new facts on the ground in the last stages of the obama era more weeks would go by while a new clinton administration dives into an inevitable policy review however events around the globe may not wait that long whoever sits down at the desk in the oval office on january next year may be forced to take some of the toughest decisions any us president has taken much sooner than he or she would want us faces host of global threats during transition until next president read morenorth koreaus power and influence is being challenged around the world at an accelerating rate and nowhere more so than on the korean peninsula the north korean leader kim jong un has sped up tests of nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them expert opinion varies on whether his technicians have succeeded in making a nuclear warhead small enough to put atop a missile and there is a general consensus that if they have not done so yet they will soon it is also widely anticipated that in the next few years north korea will perfect an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the us west coast former and current us administrations have taken the strategic decision that pyongyang should be prevented from reaching that point by force if necessary but the ultimate decision will most likely be taken by the next president clintons foreign policy advisers have signalled that she would focus on the looming korean crisis early in her term in office reassuring japan and south korea that the us will not abandon them and seeking to put pressure on china to enforce un mandated trade sanctions more effectively that may well not succeed leaving a clinton administration with the choice of agreeing to a resumption of dialogue with pyongyang and accepting its nuclear weapons status as long as it restricts missile development if that were possible it would alarm us allies who are already within north korean missile range american allies are likely to reach that point of alarm far more quickly if trump reaches the oval office he has questioned the value of us alliances in the region and he has floated the possibility that countries like japan or south korea should develop their own nuclear weapons rather than rely on the us strategic umbrella if he sticks to that policy in office there could be a sudden nuclear arms race in north east asia and possibly beyond ultimately a trump administration would have to face the direct threat of a north korean long range missile he has said he would put more pressure on china to get tough with its neighbour and he has said he is willing to meet kim in the us on the grounds theres a or a chance that i can talk him out of those damn nukes failing that he has signalled he is quite willing to contemplate using the us nuclear arsenal if the weapons cannot be used he asked then why are we making them why do we make them china china tantalized by us election mayhem and prospect of trump as president read morewithin his or her first year in office a new us president would also face a direct challenge to us power in the western pacific the chinese programme of laying claim to reefs and

rise of rodrigo duterte in the philippines who has threatened to eject us troops casting doubt on his predecessors agreement to allow new permanent american presence clintons likely policy will be to continue obamas faltering pivot to asia and to prioritise restoring the faith of us allies in the region that washington will help
contribute withguardian witnesswelcome to this weeks blog and our roundup of your comments and photos from last week lets start with a perennially interesting question from jessica lucy beckitt do you have any books youve abandoned but keep telling yourself you will definitely pick back up for me gulp its oblomov for tom mooney it was faulkner i have tried both the sound and the fury and as i lay dying but couldnt get past pages of either it is so frustrating because he seems to have influenced every other writer i like yet i hated him one day everythingsperfect made it half way through richard powers the gold bug variation it has followed me for years being packed in and out of crates and is sitting on my bookshelf with a bookmark on page out of if i got this far surely i can finish it i have been thinking that for around years now so it will probably never happen other books nominated last week included herman melvilles moby dick mikhail sholokhovs quiet flows the don james joyces ulysses philip roths american pastoral joseph hellers catch alexander solzhenitsyns the gulag archipelago gabriel garcia marquezs one hundred years of solitude david foster wallaces infinite jest herman hesses steppenwolf and jaroslav haeks the good soldier vejk that latter is forgivable enough since haek didnt manage to finish writing it either in fact there should be no blame for not finishing a book just perhaps regret speaking personally i still havent finished bolanos more than two years after starting but im not going to give up that or so pages i snatch every so often actually makes me love it all the more and all the more determined to conquer it eventually elsewhere kristina wilde has been reading dave goulson i finished a sting in the taleyesterday i cant recommend it enough aside from being a comprehensive passionate testament to dave goulsons work and the bumblebees themselves there are some extremely funny passages mostly its due to the telling the author is the founder of the bumblee conservation trust its founding forms the last quarter or so of the book its a bit miraculous how they grew from goulsons messy office to the funded trust they are today another persuasive recommendation came from nzbarry for john gimlettes elephant complex travels in sri lanka the focus on the civil war became more pronounced as he came to the end of the book without knowing more about it that had been reported in the local press it seems to me that he did a marvellously balanced job in accounting for the war there was even some dark humour i found it funny that the indian peace keepers became so uncontrollable that the sinhalese and tamils joined together to get rid of them before carrying on with their war the book also gave a historical context to the war showing that there has been strife of one sort or another for centuries he was really very good on these conflicts elephants did feature in the central highlands where rice is grown the farmers are so overwhelmed by the numbers of elephants that they live in trees and scare the elephants away from their rice fields by wait for it singing pleasingly paulburns has been enjoying don delillos underworld a masterpiece probably a work of genius how does one even begin to write about this backwards and forwards portrait of everyday life in the usa during the cold war lenny bruces stand up comedy tour during the cuban missile crisis being in a bomber above the first nuclear explosion in the nevada desert that baseball game between the giants and the dodgers that turns into a metaphor for the whole of america the usa drowning in its own garbage rooftop life in summertime new york italo american life in the bronx with a very brief appearance by the mafia the over strict catechism obsessed sister edgar learning edgar allen poes the raven so she can terrify her eighth form students the deformed creatures and foetuses who are the result of soviet tests in kazakhstan the sheer untrammelled beauty of the writing for over pages finally theres another potential question in this post from tom mooney i have been reading two lesser known works by two of my favourite writers this week firstly cannery row by john steinbeck a whimsical nostalgic story of the people of the old canning district in monterey it has all the charm of steinbeck at his best and is just a joy to read i find with steinbeck that no matter who his stories are about no matter how desperate and downtrodden the lives of the characters i would love to be part of their families he writes about humans with such heart i loved the booksecondly jack londons scarlet plague considered by many to be one of the first ever dystopian stories it is short and inventive if not a fully developed work but well worth a look for fans of dystopia it always stuns me with london how contemporary his work seems more than a century after it was written can you think of good examples of lesser known works by famous writers im finding it hard truth be told does fitzgeralds tender is the night count if you want something more obscure i also think john kennedy tooles the neon bible is pretty interesting but ill leave it up to you to suggest the rest im sure you can do better than me interesting links about books and readingan agent explains why amazon and barnes noble reader reviews are either fraudulent or at best useless in assessing the true merit of any given title just in case you thought book banning and was a thing of the past ebook sales are down again print sales are up yay paper if you would like to share a photo of the book you are reading or film your own book

president donald j trump imagine if you can beginning the trading day on wednesday with those words ringing in your ears its a scenario that has a lot of investors worried i think wed have to brace for tremendous volatility and an initial drop in the market says timothy fisher a new york based tax attorney and an investor with retirement savings invested in stocks and bonds and in whose eyes this election involves both high political principles and economic arguments like his peers fisher has been watching the last minute shifts in the polls anxiously trump he argues simply wouldnt be a good president for financial markets or for investors or for the economy as a whole given that his adversarial approach to dealing with trading partners could dampen export earnings for us businesses and hurt the countrys gdp asian shares slide again after market spikes for eighth day read morefisher and other investment strategists and economists have been burning the midnight oil of late analyzing what a trump victory would mean for the united states their response think brexit and multiply hundreds of us economists working in academic institutions have warned against electing trump precisely because of what they referred to in a public letter as his propensity to misinform the electorate and promote willful delusion over engagement with reality it would be the us version of brexit says mark zandi chief economist of moodys analytics the election of the republican candidate for president would be like the british vote to leave the european union an event that is not expected but that is very consequential while also being very uncertain in terms of precisely what it means for us all now and into the future given that stock markets loathe uncertainty above all else the initial reaction to a trump victory as with the brexit vote would be a stock market selloff this kind of wave of emotionally fuelled selling could lead to the market losing between to in a couple of weeks or a couple of months says jack ablin the chief investment officer at bmo private bank following that poll we saw a kind of brexit bounce when investors realized that britains departure from the united kingdom wouldnt happen overnight and that it would take years to negotiate a new relationship with its trading partners in europe but the united states is a different kind of animal its a much larger market for one thing about a quarter of global gdp and some half of the value of all the stocks traded in the world are us companies changing hands on us stock exchanges add to that the fact that a lot of investors have already placed big bets that trumps democratic rival hillary clinton will prevail in tuesdays presidential election and youve got all the makings of a nasty market shock the starting point for a selloff in the stock market could be and it could get worse from there some suggest and that shock would almost certainly be a global one rippling outward from the peso and the canadian dollar to the yen and european markets simon johnson an economist at the mit sloan school of management has argued that the kind of big adverse surprise that trumps election would pose to the system causing the stock market to crash could prove cataclysmic trump whose promises to boost economic growth immediately to between and are pure fantasy in johnsons opinion has advocated anti trade policies that would lead to anything but growth the economist argues and a trump victory well that might just be enough to cause a worldwide recession johnson says nonetheless some investors are preparing for the heightened risk of a trump presidency stocking up on cash gold and such hedges against the us market as german bonds in their portfolios they have done so as the political situation has become more fraught and trump has succeeded in narrowing the polling gap between clinton and himself and making a trump presidency more likely should trump actually triumph the immediate market shock isnt the only factor that these investors will have to consider however in the near term i think a trump administration would affect business investment and hiring decisions says zandi a former adviser to republican presidential candidate john mccain no one is sure what kind of specific policy decisions president trump would make and businesses would pause until they got more clarity that would slow economic growth longer term zandi adds the outlook depends on what choices a president trump would make what form would his anti immigration stance take if trump chooses to follow through on all his policies deporting undocumented immigrants building a wall along the mexican border it could shrink the size of the us economy or trigger a trade war this is what markets will worry about most says stuart hoffman chief economist of pnc financial services if we were to impose tariffs or quotas on imported goods our trading partners would likely retaliate and our exports to those countries like china and mexico would suffer there would be no winners global growth would slow trump has promised that he would cut taxes if elected which sounds appealing to voters that has the potential to give the consumer sector at least a brief jolt to the extent that those tax cuts are significant enough to register for individual taxpayers and if those people choose to spend their windfall but hoffman notes that trumps tax plan is set up to benefit wealthy americans most many economists believe that changes in tax policy have less effect on spending by affluent households theres also the pesky question of how trump would pay for those tax cuts he is not at all clear how he would do that says hoffman do you just run higher deficits that would be a longer term

donald trump lies like he tweets erratically at all hours sometimes in malice and sometimes in self contradiction and sometimes without any apparent purpose at all the guardian has catalogued more than falsehoods made by the republican nominee over the last days and sorted them according to theme hillary clinton has been caught in more than a dozen falsehoods of her own for instance about her email practices and her past support for the trans pacific partnership but clinton often makes her falsehoods in dense legalese making them hard to pin a motive on many could as easily be errors as lies careless exaggeration or deliberately misleading claims trump on the other hand will say wrong when he hears his own quotes his own lawyers met him in pairs to counteract his lying court documents show he has invented false statistics fictional videos and sex tapes and a nonexistent man named john miller to talk about his sex life months of fact checking however reveal methods and whether he means to or not trumps guide to success through lying fbi director new hillary clinton emails show no criminal wrongdoing read moredegrade and destroyfor decades trump has described america and its leaders in apocalyptic terms he thought ronald reagan weak and a disaster he lambasted george hw bush and bill clintons policies and after supporting george w bushs iraq invasion quickly dismissed that war as a mess in trumps world crime is always rising and african americans are living in hell migrants are flooding in and they bring violence civilian and military leaders are always clueless except when they love him we have no idea who refugees or undocumented migrants are and they take our jobs trumps vision of the us has been for decades one of dystopia he even described the as a crisis worse than the great depression but amid all this desolation trump gains three things he fuels doubt and fear leaving people vulnerable he denigrates his opposition en masse blaming the world on them and he raises himself up above the nonexistent wreckage embiggen big leaguelike a man who once took a joke about the size of his hands too hard trump spends a lot of time trying to look as large as possible from his never proven worth to crowds at his rallies and his success in meaningless internet polls this self inflation is pierced throughout by paperwork in march the guardian found that trump valued a new york golf course at in one document and at in a court filing on thursday the new york times reported similarly huge discrepancies in his reported income the washington post has shown repeatedly that trumps boasts of charitable giving have virtually nothing behind them he has also falsely bragged of endorsements from federal agencies and claimed many environmental awards and tried the ploy in reverse he has called the millions his father gave him as a small loan and portrayed his loss in as an example of smart tax avoidance this sort of exaggeration is a common sales technique overstate the value of a product to make it more attractive and assume it will be bargained downward in february trump confessed everythings negotiable about his statements then quickly said building a wall on the southern border was not negotiable the equivalent of a liar saying everything i say is false but not that shout at the messenger facebook twitter pinterest donald trump on hillary clinton and the fbi shes protectedwhenever in doubt trump attacks what he calls the dishonest media accusing reporters of bias inaccuracy and a failure to show the size of his rallies he ignores that reporters quote him extensively call his campaign for comment interview his supporters his rivals campaign and independent voters and experts he often cites news stories about clinton and even praised fact checkers in a presidential debate for catching her in a falsehood at every rally trump says the cameras refuse to show his audience even though his campaign forces cameras to stay within a small pen where they pan to show the crowd as anyone at his rallies or watching online can see only one camera at each event stays fixed on trump the shared pool camera whose footage networks share and which stays on trump so as not to miss his speech last week nbcs katy tur a target for criticism from the podium noted that trump has joked in private with reporters about how he understands how the pool camera works this is a shtick that he does to rile up his base she said to give them an excuse for polls that might not be in his favor to give them an excuse to berate someone thats not donald trump trumps scorched earth insults like his attacks on other institutions try to delegitimize authority and leave only himself in its place but while most americans still respect other institutions that trump has demeaned the press was vulnerable decades of cable news punditry had already diminished opinion of the press and the internet has sapped major newspapers of

how did donald trump launch his presidential campaign during an episode of the apprentice he rode down an escalator into the lobby of a skyscraper bearing his name trump used his to criticise mexican immigrants accusing mexico of bringing their worst people to america including criminals and rapists the new york times reported on the launch as improbable quest for the republican via a series of

the investigative journalist gavin macfadyen who has died aged was founder director of the centre for investigative journalism in london he set up the cij which is funded through charitable foundations in to address what he saw as a worsening media climate for serious in depth and critical reporting and over the following years established its reputation as one of the pre eminent investigative journalism training institutions in the world gavin intended the cij as a refuge for critically minded journalists who want to do adversarial public interest journalism he thought that journalists had become accessories to the powerful rather than acting as a check upon them in his view journalisms role in a democratic society should be to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable it was not surprising that in when wikileaks began publishing documents on the iraq and afghanistan wars and then the us state department cables gavin became a close ally of the group and of its editor and founder julian assange while many of the institutions that profited from assanges revelations later turned on him gavin was steadfastly loyal seeing his role as always to stick up for those under fierce attack from powerful forces gavin and his wife susan benn were trustees of the julian assange defence fund set up to help raise money for assanges legal defence gavins house in london was a salon and refuge for dissidents journalists and revolutionaries from all over the world people often young sometimes difficult would stay for long periods and be fed and housed i love it gavin once told me i come down for breakfast and i dont know who is going to be there he said the previous week that brilliant indian writer arundhati roy had been over with that hollywood actor with good politics john cusack that was typical the cij itself was wonderfully chaotic and breathed with creativity and energy gavin was an arch democrat completely open to anyone and everyone he wanted to stretch the definition of what an investigative journalist is to include artists historians and even architects who use society as their raw material and try to filter information to reveal truth the cij was and remains an open shop born in greeley colorado to marion hall a concert pianist gavin spent his formative years in hyde park chicago he never knew his father and in childhood took his stepfathers surname macfadyen in the he became an activist in the civil rights movement in chicago he participated in the rainbow beach wade ins of that challenged segregation on public beaches and was arrested and jailed while protesting against discriminatory university housing segregated restaurants and in defence of civil rights activists in the south gavin led a convoy of trucks filled with relief supplies to an embattled civil rights outpost in tennessee on arrival he discovered that police fire had pockmarked the truck with bullet holes and on returning to chicago he was informed that fbi agents had raided his house in chicago at this time he met the young bernie sanders then a student at chicago university and exposed him to the world of revolutionary leftist politics by working subsequently as a longshoreman in new york gavin was able to pay for a trip to britain where he joined the international socialists living for a time in the home of one of its leading writers michael kidron he described this as a formative period in developing his political consciousness gavin attended the london school of film technique in and shortly after graduation he formed an independent collective chicago films he filmed the democratic convention in chicago anti war demonstrations and race riots in detroit washington dc and harlem for the bbc as he became more interested in marrying his aesthetic commitment to film with his politics he decided he wanted to make hard hitting investigative documentaries he produced and directed more than documentaries many for granada televisions world in action in countries as diverse as ecuador guyana south africa mexico hong kong thailand the ussr the us sweden india and turkey his investigations covered topics including industrial accidents neo nazi violence in the uk chinese criminal societies the history of the cia watergate election fraud in guyana the iraq arms trade child labour nuclear proliferation and frank sinatras connection to organised crime in gavin left london to work in hollywood he became a close friend of the screenwriter director and producer michael mann and was involved in three of his films as well as motion picture research projects in south east asia and a john frankenheimer film project he joined haskell wexler in nicaragua to make the independent feature latino in he also appeared as an actor in latino as well as two other movies thief and ulterior motives there was little time for small talk with gavin only the big ideas exercised him he would throw his hands up when he got excited by a devious way of getting a story and shout yes yes yes followed inevitably by lets do it being around gavin for any amount of time made you feel anything was possible and that eventually if gavin was around to help justice and the truth would prevail one approach he favoured in the cause of linking social justice activism and investigative journalism was direct action information gathering for example chaining yourself outside the offices of a multinational corporation or department of state and staying there until they gave you the information you needed for your story he was unbreakable in his commitment to the oppressed risked his own life and liberty to stand with them and saw unspeakable acts of human brutality yet at the same time none of it had broken down his ability to love and bring joy to those around him his presence lit up any gathering for many journalists work is simply a job he once wrote their interest is in lapdog confidences and dining with the powerful those

douglas stankewitz and colleen hicks are worried about the election they are seated on mismatched blue plastic chairs in cage one of the padlocked wire mesh enclosures at san quentin state prison where condemned men visit with friends and loved ones they lean into each other shoulders touching he puts his arm around her she strokes his neck stankewitz was sentenced to death years ago for the kidnap and murder of theresa graybeal aged he has been on death row since longer than any inmate in california and all but a few nationwide his murder conviction was thrown out once his death sentence twice his third sentencing hearing is scheduled for october to kill or not to kill california voters to decide who should die for their crimes read more but california has dueling death penalty propositions on the november ballot and thats where things get complicated proposition would abolish the death penalty and replace it with life in prison without the possibility of parole proposition would streamline and perhaps speed up capital punishment in the state with the countrys biggest death row both possibilities make the unlikely couple nervous hicks is director of the museum of the american indian in the bay area town of novato stankewitz is a member of the mono tribe goes by the nickname chief and has been locked up somewhere most of his life they fear that if the death penalty is abolished stankewitzs current legal case could be derailed even though the court proceeding scheduled for october will only address death or life without parole stankewitz holds out hope that his new lawyer can get him a new trial and prove that he is innocent the tall stocky condemned man whose black hair cascades to his shoulder blades is living proof that the death penalty process in california is broken at age he was the first person to land on san quentins infamous death row after the state put the modern death penalty in place in nearly four decades and two reversals later he is still there what he wants he said on a rainy sunday morning nine days before the election is freedom it sounds funny people say how do you know you been locked up so long id love to go fishing too stankewitz said i wouldnt have to catch nothing just fish and work in the garden said hicks who wants him to live with her in marin county north of san francisco if he is ever freed yeah stankewitz said smiling let those gophers know whos boss california has executed men since stankewitz landed on death row one hundred and four died of other causes according to the state corrections and rehabilitation department of natural causes from suicide and eight from what prison officials described as other today inmates await execution in san quentins death chamber with a pale green gurney on which inmates are strapped the oldest is the youngest california has not put anyone to death since in phone calls letters and an in person visit stankewitz talked about the night theresa graybeal died about the trials that were reversed about the woman he loves and about life as a condemned man in californias oldest prison all the days are the same here stankewitz said i try not to think im here its worse than an animal i know that an animal in a zoo or a dog pound has more space than us youre on death row you know youre in prison you dont ponder it he has lived in e block for the past seven years he does not share a cell no one on death row does he does not keep a calendar there is no reason to he has typed some letters asking for help he watches tv reads follows politics works out a lot of guys tell you that poor me stuff stankewitz said its unhealthy they got to fight to get out of the system even if youre innocent the system dont care the few times that there have been executions he said the prison was locked down early and the tense place became even more so some of the men who were put to death were his friends inmates such as stanley tookie williams founder of the crips gang williams was convicted of the brutal shotgun murders of four men but became an anti violence crusader while waiting to die every day is the possibility to be executed somehow some way stankewitz said the day of an execution may be more intense if you believe its wrong to take a life theres no more premeditation than this stankewitz has spent about a third of his life in solitary confinement a place that he says drives a lot of people crazy pushes them from the prison to a mental hospital back then you had nothing in your cell except darkness and a hole in the floor that was your toilet he said at they gave you a mattress and a pillow fifteen hundred calories diet a day but it was in solitary confinement that stankewitz met father jack oneill the prison chaplain who later became the parish priest at st mary magdalene where hicks is choir director and plays piano in oneill asked hicks if she would consider corresponding with stankewitz she said yes stankewitz calls hicks every morning she visits him on saturdays and every sunday after mass were a couple now hicks said i did not see that coming we talk about the case a lot she added i tell him about the museum just everything hes just interested he says i just want to know what youre doing in that big free world of yours on this sunday in late october the guards are late bringing stankewitz down from his cell to the visiting area hicks is dressed in purple the men she says are so color deprived that she tries not to wear black she has washed
anyone who has seen the documentary weiner may not have been entirely surprised that it was former congressman anthony weiner who threw a late spanner in the works of hillary clintons campaign the film charts in excruciating detail the collapse of a political career and ultimately of a marriage weiners laptop is now reportedly under scrutiny by the fbi lest it contain emails pertinent to clintons private server but if there is a movie sequel to be made it might be called podesta an avalanche of tens of thousands of other messages hacked from clinton campaign chairman john podestas gmail account and released by wikileaks in regular bursts over the past month has provided an unprecedented window on the inner workings of a presidential run there laid bare with all the brutal candour of a fly on the wall documentary are the office politics the egos the cliques the evolving attempts to package a candidate who admits she is not a natural political performer like her husband or barack obama the hoard offers insights that would not normally see the light of day until memoirs published years or decades hence the clinton campaign has blamed the russian government for breaking into podestas account and passing on the material to wikileaks in an attempt to help donald trump win next weeks election it has generally declined to confirm or deny the authenticity of the emails but podesta a veteran of nearly half a century of us politics says he has spoken to the fbi as a victim of hacking trump adviser reveals how assange ally warned him about leaked clinton emails read moreclintons handling of classified information as secretary of state which flared up again last week thanks to weiner has cast a shadow over her entire campaign and been a source of much angst at her headquarters when the issue first reached public attention in march last year podesta wrote of three fellow clinton aides speaking of transparency our friends david kendall cheryl mills and philippe reines sure werent forthcoming on the facts here the message was sent to neera tanden president of the center for american progress thinktank in washington who has a regular cameo in the emails she wrote back this is a cheryl special know you love her but this stuff is like her achilles heal sic or kryptonite why didnt they get this stuff out like months ago so crazy podesta replied unbelievable tanden added i guess i know the answer they wanted to get away with it facebook twitter pinterest hillary clinton there is no case in fbi email investigation videoboth tanden and podesta are unswervingly loyal to clinton but could be described as critical friends in another exchange in september podesta warned that the campaign has taken on a lot of water that wont be easy to pump out of the boat most of that has to do with terrible decisions made pre campaign but a lot has to do with her instincts shes nervous so prepping more and performing better got to do something to pump up excitement but not certain how to do that tanden assented almost no one knows better than me that her instincts can be terrible when the seemingly innocuous leftwing senator bernie sanders came out of nowhere to challenge clinton in the democratic primary there were fears of a repeat of her shock defeat by obama in tanden warned podesta against attacking sanders too aggressively just game out what that does to hillary she wrote in august last year when we went after obama she got killed for it reaffirmed all her negatives strengthened him we had no idea it was kryptonite for us to do that but it was i dont know if it was obama or hillary but its really something to focus group beforehand in december when tanden wrote in praise of the paris climate deal podesta responded can you believe that doofus bernie attacked it then in march this year clinton strategist minyon moore opined i think sanders is a rule breaker and has no institutional loyalty to the democratic party we should expect him to ignore the rules and persist in his quest to flip superdelegates despite overwhelming evidence that reflects his considerable weaknesses with the democratic base and no doubt in the general tanden meanwhile pulled no punches when clintons campaign hesitated over whether to condemn democratic activist david brock for demanding sanders medical records she wrote hillary god her instincts are suboptimal a stout defender of clinton in public in private tanden injects some bracing honesty that suggests the candidate is not surrounded by sycophants after the former first lady described herself as a moderate tanden asked of podesta why did she call herself a moderate he wrote back i pushed her on this on sunday night she claims she didnt remember saying it not sure i believe her tanden replied i mean it makes my life more difficult after telling every reporter i know shes actually progressive but that is really the smallest of issues it worries me more that she doesnt seem to know what planet we are all living in at the moment the daily dump of stolen emails has uncovered clintons lucrative wall street speeches lists of potential vice presidents and potential campaign slogans fresh questions over a conflict of interest with the clinton foundation and alleged advance warnings of debate questions but there have been few revelations likely to alter the course of the race for the white house in fact just as wikileaks release of us embassy cables often showed diplomats judgment in a flattering light so the podesta emails have illuminated a micromanaged campaign operation with a laser like focus and little by way of ill discipline or even foul language the nerve centre is however all too aware of its candidates weaknesses and sensitive to media criticism and as prone as any other office to personality clashes terse exchanges and mutual exasperation the
from the day that she stepped into number it has been a no brainer to some of her colleagues that theresa may ought to call an early general election as it has also been to many mps on the other side of the commons her majority in parliament is slender and just became slimmer with the resignation of the tory mp stephen phillips a disillusioned outer the conservatives are favourites to retake his seat but they wont be so fortunate with other byelections john major started with a larger majority in the parliament that began in and had lost it by the time he was done another reason for her to go to the country early is that the tory majority doesnt really belong to mrs may it was won by whatshisname that bloke who used to live at number she lacks the personal mandate that flows to a prime minister who has won an election in her own right the way she has behaved towards senior members of the old regime has created a big club of enemies on her backbenches asked recently what he was up to one very senior figure in the cameron cabinet smiled biding my time then there is brexit at some point in this parliament probably at several points there will be torrid political and constitutional crises over britains departure from the european union there will be resignations by ministers there will be deadlocks and breakdowns in the negotiations it is highly likely that there will be serious economic convulsions as well better so goes an argument popular with tory mps for mrs may to armour herself with the much larger majority that the opinion polls indicate can be hers for the asking that would give her five clear years to get through brexit and all its havocs mrs may has heard those arguments and used to dismiss them she said the voters werent clamouring for an election she thought that what the country most wanted was stability it didnt fit with her image of herself to do something that would look opportunistic nor did it suit her risk averse temperament her team calculated that labour was in such a dreadful state that the tories didnt need to rush for a quick kill has that calculus been changed by the high court ruling that the government must secure parliamentary approval before it can formally trigger divorce proceedings with the european union it has the court ruling was not as the more hysterical brextremists have been frothing an example of elitist judges frustrating the will of the people the court was reasserting the fundamental principle that the executive cannot rule by monarchical decree but must seek the consent of parliament if it wants to change the law there is an alternative to the rule of law it is called dictatorship those who campaigned to leave the eu in the name of restoring parliamentary sovereignty ought to be able to grasp this the government might overturn the ruling with a successful appeal to the supreme court but that looks unlikely if the supremes agree that the government has to ask parliament before it can activate article it is as yet unclear how mrs may intends to conform to the instruction some in government seem to think that they might get away with tabling a crude take it or leave it motion demanding that parliament simply rubber stamps her decision that would be defiant of the spirit of the court ruling and perhaps also of its letter which is why some ministers think they will have to bring forward legislation parliament would not take that as an opportunity to block brexit most mps were remainers and so were the majority of peers but they are not going to flatly defy the referendum result parliament might have something to say about the timing of the departure march is a lousy choice of month to start the countdown to withdrawal there is a presidential election in france next spring and german elections are due in the early autumn nothing meaningful will be negotiated until these are over which means mrs mays current plan simply diminishes the time available to try to make a success of it mps and peers could be doing both her and britain a favour if they slowed her down by a few months what parliament will definitely do is demand to know more about the governments exit strategy if i am not being naive in imagining that such a thing exists for more than a hundred days mrs may has sheltered behind the meaningless mantra brexit means brexit as one of the first to mock the vacuity of that tautology i have to confess that it has proved a more durable blocking mechanism than i anticipated a testimony to the potency of stubborn repetition one explanation for this long silence could be that the government has an exit plan of such elegance that it is being kept concealed to build up the suspense and increase our collective awe when it is revealed in all its brilliance no me neither i was at the parliamentary awards dinner when boris johnson had the audience in involuntary spasms by declaring that the government would make a titanic success of brexit there are some deckchairs over there that need rearranging foreign secretary the prime minister responded with a threat that was no less vicious for coming in the guise of a joke mr johnson had unwisely compared himself with the alsatian throttled by michael heseltine mrs may said boris the dog was put down when its master decided it wasnt needed any more yes she really did in a room crowded with senior politicians and journalists the prime minister told her foreign secretary that she would kill him when it pleased her the government is concealing its intentions not to keep the eu guessing but to try to hide its internal confusions and divisions when the negotiations begin and
once upon a time a long long long time ago small children might get told off for being loud or unruly or as we called it then disruptive now not so much in its cool to be disruptive its what every startup in silicon valley is straining to do its what airbnb has done disrupting the hotel industry as uber has disrupted taxis and amazon has disrupted bookshops and almost everything else two years ago i went to a conference in san francisco techcrunch disrupt and met many people claiming to disrupt many things including in one case socks but what no one anticipated was that though it may be convenient to summon a motor vehicle to ones home with a tap of a button or to buy things online while wearing pyjamas and possibly drunk it might also lead to where we are now november two days potentially before the world changes forever because donald trump is not just an over tanned reality tv star gone rogue he is not a weaponised version of lord sugar he is what happens when technology changes everything disruption wrote clayton christensen the professor at harvard business school who coined the idea is the technology mudslide hypothesis its how some scrappy little upstart like microsoft overthrew the colossus that once was ibm its how some small new technological breakthrough can have huge unexpected world changing consequences its donald trump the living breathing version of the scrappy little upstart that overturns an entire industry only this time its not an industry its democracy we have fetishised disruption governments have stood by and watched it take down all industries in its path the market must do what the market must do only now the wave is breaking on its shore because what the last week of this presidential campaign has shown us is that technology has disrupted is disrupting is threatening to upturn the democratic process itself the best most stable most equitable form of governance the world has yet come up with in many crucial ways it doesnt even matter who wins on tuesday because perhaps the best thing you can say about trump is that if it hadnt been him it would have been someone else its the opposite of the great man theory of history a misogynistic ex reality tv star is not the game changer here its technology two days ago the same hackers who took down twitter and netflix and the and reddit and cnn last week in the biggest attack of its kind that the world has ever seen started practising on a country computer malware had been used to infect inanimate objects in our homes the connected devices that comprise the so called internet of things and that its been discovered a bit late are hopelessly insecure it has harnessed these to create a gigantic internet destroying machine the so called mirai botnet and its honing its power last week it took aim at an entire country liberia a huge attack was launched against the two companies that own the only fibre going into the west african country bringing its entire internet infrastructure to a halt the worst case scenario that the hackers behind it are practising for tuesday when theyll aim their massed computing power against america this is everyday objects in our own homes smart objects intenet enabled toasters and refrigerators because this is where we are our toasters and refrigerators may be about to be used to subvert the democratic process of the greatest democracy on earth and if that reads like the most lunatic sentence youve ever read you maybe havent been paying close enough attention to because this is possibly finally the year when it hits home that technology is not just some cool titanium coloured gadget in our pockets its the facilitator of the degraded news space that treats facts and lies the same that has enabled thousands of twitterbots algorithms to scrape the internet for stories about trump and then retweet them it was robot accounts that caused trumpwon to trend after each tv debate and allowed trump to claim victory its how a man who hasnt set foot on the street for four years can with just his laptop create havoc in the critical last week of the campaign by leaking emails that potentially implicate hillary clinton julian assange has inserted himself like computer malware into the heart of the american democratic process hes infected it he is like donald trump the law of unintended consequences writ large in human form in we didnt mind the fact that the data he leaked was stolen here in the liberal press we championed it because it was stolen data that served to underscore our liberal sensibilities or at least mine and now not so much but then technology is neutral there is no left or right there is only hackers and twitterbots and year olds in macedonia who buzzfeed reported last week earn money via google adsense for writing made up stories about trump and making them go viral on facebook in a single macedonian town veles there are at least websites about american politics run by macedonian kids who make money from fabricated stories teenagers can earn up to a month by making up things about trump they dont care about trump or clinton or anyone else theyve just worked out what the us public wants to read and have found a way of serving it up to them whether its true or not the best way of making money via google is to write clickbait and the best clickbait theyve discovered the stories that are spread widest and furthest in facebook and twitter are stories about trump more specifically false stories about trump because in we read the news we want to read the so called filter bubble the means by which google and facebook give us more of what we want or what we already know our searches and
if bono being a man is not everyones ideal woman of the year the publishers of magazine cond nast should be congratulated on stimulating a sudden surge of interest in a title that contending with a generally declining sector amid a welter of competing awards definitely needed the attention take a bow cond nast executives charles robert anna david and fred like bono you guys remind us in the words of s editor of the many men who really are doing wonderful things for women these days the only difficulty will come next year when must outdo itself to get noticed or appear to go backwards maybe it could make the whole women of the year list male or feature a few brave pets or children in the line up assuming that has not already been attempted given the acute talented woman shortage by its rivals anyway thousands must have rushed to the website the better to comprehend how bono the singer humanitarian and pious tax avoider had beaten all contenders male and female to this honour and then stayed as i did to read its love horoscopes it was like going back to november starts off with venus travelling through your ambition angle increasing the appeal of powerful or older men not you gather that the current editors of appear to need any encouragement in that respect explaining the bono award cindi leive the magazines editor pointed out that this powerful older man unlike s female winners could select any cause in the world to call his own name a noble cause peace the climate saving honey bees and bono might have chosen it yet like a mills and boon surgeon or mighty sheikh entitled to date only the beautiful bono the tireless philanthropist a man as revered by world leaders as he is by top accountants has actively chosen to spend time with the poorest mousiest most bespectacled of all causes women can it be true yes writes cindi when a major male rock star who could do anything at all with his life decides to focus on the rights of women and girls worldwide well all thats worth celebrating contributor christiane amanpour underlined to readers the true significance of this compliment bono is making clear that powerful men can and should take on these deep rooted issues if his message catches on maybe the whole feminist business could ultimately be outsourced to powerful men at least until women get better at doing it themselves the prizewinner sounded willing enough im grateful for this award as a chance to say the battle for gender equality cant be won unless men lead it as well as women bono said perhaps aware that this might not sound ideally he for she or even plausible given the history of say the male dominated gender equalising labour party he explained were largely responsible for the problem so we have to be involved in the solutions maybe hes not up to speed with liam fox post brexit so what does gender equality leadership mean to bono by way of a clue he recently as an ally of the pope urged us to listen to papa francisco specifically on eradicating poverty and ending corruption though the contrast between bonos fascinating taxation arrangements and his objections to those of say exxon mobil will not disqualify him in all womens eyes from being their gender equality leader might have looked more closely at papa franciscos latest statements on women priests with a notable unwillingness unlike s women of the year judges to challenge tradition the pope has just reaffirmed that since jesuss apostles were men women must forever be second class believers then again with s new interest in paternalism we cant rule out the possibility that the pope is bang on trend the idea that men enjoy too much power and thus have no place on all women shortlists is cindi leive explained an outdated way of looking at things actually s excitement about getting its hands on bono was more redolent than anything of in the magazine era when helen gurley brown was writing articles such as how to get men to give you presents he talks you listen she once said on pleasing men you can talk to your girlfriends your boss your secretary but you may not do all the talking you would like to do with him it was a process she called sinking in for all gurley browns boosterish words on female independence her biographer gerri hirshey has written she was a realist not a revolutionary to be fair to s judges though no previous womans award panel has done as much to reach out to the rich entitled white men routinely excluded from all women awards they were not the first to suggest that the womens movement could benefit from alpha even beta male approval had they sounded more like emma watson or picked obama rather than papa franciscos co worker as their first ever male woman of the year the magazine might have enjoyed the sort of delirious reception that recently greeted the presidents identification of himself as a male feminist it would be difficult for any feminist to resist that quality of leadership alliance not that obama would have been so tone deaf as to propose one maybe it does not need saying outside that any male feminist who volunteers to represent feminists as opposed to join them either does not get feminism or is having a laugh as with snagging bono and campaigners who believed russell brand to be an anti page asset and the fawcett society were well pleased a couple of years ago when they got ed miliband nick clegg and assorted successful men to model this is what a feminist looks like t shirts even then there was an obvious issue of quality control not to speak of the contradictions if a man owed his prominence to discrimination against women why seek his
could the ruling lead to no brexit in itself no because this is a ruling about how brexit is achieved the process not the desirability or otherwise of it the decision to leave has been taken and would require another referendum to reverse what the judges decided was how the process of leaving had to be carried out they determined that parliament should be the body that decides on matters to do with uk law in this case the triggering of article which sets the uk on a two year path to exit and will mean eu laws no longer apply here the government had argued this could be done by royal prerogative effectively side stepping parliament the judges disagreed there is no doubt however that the judgment gives the remain side which has a majority in the commons and lords new opportunities to try to ensure brexit is not too hard that we remain tied into as many of the eus projects the single market police cooperation and research as possible while leaving full membership of the club longer term some remainers believe there is a chance that the public will turn against brexit if and when people see that the rosy future they were promised outside the eu is not quite so easy to achieve after all if the judgment means the dangers of leaving come more into the public mind it is possible it could mark a turning point what does the ruling mean the government now has to do theresa may made clear last week that she will appeal against the decision in the supreme court the case will be heard next month and a ruling made quite swiftly if as most people assume that appeal fails ministers will have to prepare legislation so that parliament can play the role the judges said it must in setting in motion article the nightmare for the prime minister however is that she will no longer be able to hide behind her stock stalling phrases brexit means brexit and we wont give a running commentary that have covered the fact that ministers are unclear how to proceed as they never expected the public to vote to leave if may does not reveal quickly what kind of brexit she wants mps will use the parliamentary process which the courts have insisted on to force decisions and clarity on her they can seek to amend the bill which will have to be presented to them to shape brexit as they want to see it a majority of mps across all parties could then force her hand if the commons does not amend the bill the house of lords certainly will seek to do so ministers have to try to find a position on brexit that will win the backing of mps and peers how they do it no one knows will it be a free vote this will be the subject of great debate in both the tory and labour parties cabinet ministers were allowed to campaign as they wished before the referendum vote so it is difficult to see how conservative mps can be forced to vote against their wishes at this stage particularly if amendments are submitted on issues such as single market membership the tory manifesto committed the party to safeguard the uks position in the single market whether we left or stayed in the eu so to force mps to vote to leave it would not be popular with many the danger of imposing a whip on mps is that many will rebel informal cross party alliances will be more important than the strictures of the whips does the ruling mean an early election it makes it more likely because the ruling has undermined the government and highlighted mays lack of a personal mandate and weakness in parliament her tiny commons majority shrunk further by the resignation of the tory mp stephen phillips leaves her in a perilous position in any contentious vote as she has insisted she does not intend to go to the country before doing so would be seen as a sign of her being buffeted around by events an election while likely to deliver a larger tory majority would be no easy fix however it would highlight profound splits in the conservative party in parliament and between its mps and supporters in the country brexit would be put on hold for three months of national debate and squabbling and the economy could be harmed by more uncertainty labour would have to back an early election which most of its mps would dread it would be an election that nobody wanted rather than healing the divide over brexit it could well deepen it could the row do lasting constitutional damage and further erode faith in the institutions that run the country the irony behind the arguments over the judges ruling is that leave campaigners insist that above all else they want to take back control from european institutions and vest it again in british ones but now that the uks own courts have made a ruling that complicates the passage towards a hard brexit and argues for the very thing that leave campaigners wanted most they complain that the judges assessment is a betrayal of the people the danger now is that it will not just be faith in politicians that is harmed but faith in the uk legal system as well the countrys unwritten constitution operates a delicate set of checks and balances determined through precedent involving the crown parliament the executive and the judiciary the call by the bar council for justice secretary liz truss to condemn attacks on the judges was the opening salvo in what could become a toxic and hugely destabilising inter institutional war between key components of the

latin americagovernments have often preferred republican presidential candidates because they historically put an emphasis on free trade but this time politicians and commentators are lining up to express doubts about donald trump who has alarmed many with his dismissive comments about latinos plans to build a wall on the mexican border and his unpredictable behaviour demtrio magnoli a sociologist and prominent voice of brazils new right said a trump victory would be a geopolitical earthquake trump is the closest the us has gotten to fascism you would have an american president that is nationalist and nativist and we would see mass deportations and a wall being built which is likely since he will most likely not deport million people he predicted this would force mexico to turn more towards latin america and could upset free trade agreements and hurt economic growth trump is so unpredictable and politically inexperienced we have no idea what he will do but he seems authoritarian sexist and contemptuous about latinos said violeta granera of the opposition alliance in nicaragua by comparison hillary clinton is seen as a safe pair of hands who is likely to continue the relatively benign policies of the obama administration carlos lins da silva a senior consultant for the so paulo research foundation said us regional policies were unlikely to see a major change but added the election of trump would at least in the short term cause dramatic impacts on the international system if he puts into practice some of the programmes he is advocating brazil wont come away unscathed for example if he makes the entrance of muslim people more difficult builds a wall between mexico and the us has nato members pay for us defence encourages japan to have a nuclear bomb gets tougher on nafta and other free trade deals all of these ideas would have negative consequences for many countries diplomats said they did not expect a major shift in washingtons latin american policy regardless of the outcome hillary clinton knows brazil better than trump as she has been here before and knows people here but there will not be any substantial change in relations either way because external relations with south america are a low priority for the us said rubens barbosa former brazilian ambassador to washington the country with most at stake may be cuba which has enjoyed a reconciliation with the us under barack obama former cuban president fidel castro weighed in with an article last month in the newspaper in which he awarded trump the medal of mud but the old revolutionary also had nothing good to say about the democrats middle easttrump outraged the arab world with his comments on muslim immigration and regional public opinion certainly reflects this a survey of people in the middle east and north africa found that if they had a vote half would snub both trump and clinton on the fight against islamic state clinton has pledged to never send troops back to iraq and ruled out boots on the ground in syria trump has been less specific about his plan to fight isis but said in march that the us has no choice but to send to combat troops to the region in the survey from the jeddah based daily and pollsters yougov said the us should send troops to fight isis and collaborate closely with russia on syria the rest did not want a us presence on the ground but did feel that washington should be more involved in the humanitarian efforts for syrian refugees arm moderate groups and increase air strikes on isis clinton was most popular with saying she would be the best for the arab world on the candidates policies arab opinion is much more balanced clintons stance on climate change and us israel policy found strong support in the poll but arabs overwhelmingly back trumps stance on abortion and ironically perhaps border controls russiavladimir putin was thrust into an unexpected starring role in this election and whatever the result it will please the kremlin that it has been able to cause so much mischief how much of this was down to direct kremlin meddling we will perhaps never know although the state medias bias towards trump has been fairly clear most russian analysts believe the us is systemically set up to oppose russia and while there is an understanding that trump is an unusual candidate many believe a trump presidency would not change things much other more sober heads are well aware that for all trumps friendly rhetoric as president he would be a much more unpredictable quantity than clinton the devil they know to go on the public rhetoric alone the casual observer would think the russian establishment is banking on trump russian television has been giving airtime to many of trumps claims that the election could be rigged but this is as much to help discredit the us system in the eyes of viewers as it is sincere backing for trump he has been backed not because of his politics but because he is the chaos candidate in the same way russia was also keen on brexit even if clinton wins russia knows that after this divisive campaign us democracy is in for a period of soul searching which will leave less energy and focus for meeting external threats africaif africa has barely featured in the campaign then the continent has in part returned the compliment but though many experts believe the result may not imply any drastic change in us policies in africa there is still widespread anxiety and trump has already alienated many particularly with his apparently racist rhetoric few africans are putting any store on trump if he wins the election that is if he remembers we exist once hes done with mexicans and illegal immigrants wrote gitau warigi in kenyas trumps call for a ban on muslims entering the us received widespread coverage and provoked outrage the somalia based islamic militant group al
after the incredulity the despair and then the cautious return to optimism the presidential campaign has entered a phase of almost intolerable anxiety national polls that dont signify much are instantly interpreted as omens of the apocalypse tiny anecdotes about early voting figures induce heart stopping panic or get clung to like life rafts depending on the direction in which they point until tuesday no new information is likely to bring any sense of closure only more stress but that doesnt stop us from seeking it compulsively forget fear and loathing the us election inspires projectile vomiting barbara ehrenreich read morenever mind that a victory for donald trump at this point would still require him to have executed a turnaround unknown in living memory or that the nervous comparisons with brexit have been so overblown in the closing days of an election that has kept americans and non americans alike in a state of clenched stomach tension for months allowing yourself any confidence in a victory for hillary clinton feels like mocking the gods even assuming trump loses the relief will be superficial trumpism will remain and the world will have to contend with the fact that about of the us electorate saw little wrong with his racism and misogyny alleged sexual assaults business scandals lies misrepresentations of his wealth and charitable giving probable failure to pay taxes lack of impulse control profound ignorance and tiny attention span but the relief will still be real in a way that feels unprecedented in modern politics trump has burrowed deep into our psyches stimulating anxiety that isnt confined to the borders of the us or to those who are the direct targets of his bigotry a survey for the american psychological association published in october found that the election was a source of stress for of american adults during the summer of registered voters that is including trump supporters said the prospect of a trump presidency made them anxious according to a washington post poll there have been multiple reports of election related fears arising on therapists couches as never before along with anecdotes of relationships damaged by political disagreement i think whats been so uniquely distressing isnt just that theres one person out there who thinks like that but that there are clearly so many people who agree says joan cook an associate professor of psychiatry at yale university and an expert in traumatic stress this is a kind of psychological entanglement with national and international news that most of us most of the time are spared but the trump candidacy has removed the possibility of such distance the rape abuse and incest national network reported a increase in calls to its support hotline during the weekend following the release of trumps notorious access hollywood tape armchair diagnosis dos and dontsalongside its psychological impact on the rest of us the campaign has also felt distinctive and distinctively disturbing in the ways that trumps own psychology has come to dominate it while hillary clintons inner life remains largely mysterious information about trumps insecurities leaks from his every public statement even before the new york times obtained tapes of interviews with a biographer in which trumps morbid fear of public humiliation was made plain his former ghostwriter tony schwartz has pointed out how trumps attacks on others arent random but constitute a precise inventory of his own faults unstable reckless bigoted trigger happy exhausted and prone to lying as sheena monnin the former miss pennsylvania sued by trump after she criticized his miss usa pageant put it in an interview with cnn i have a degree in psychology and i understand that underneath the bullying tactics theres usually a lot of emptiness and a strong need to feed the ego trump told his biographer michael dantonio i dont like to analyse myself because i might not like what i see but the rest of us havent had much choice like a traffic pile up the candidates involuntary self exposure has been impossible not to gawp at yet throughout this intensely psychological election psychology professionals have been restrained by a widespread though fragmenting consensus that trumps mental health ought not to be discussed at all this stance is most clearly expressed in the american psychiatric associations so called goldwater rule the prohibition on diagnosis at a distance introduced following the incident in when psychiatrists told a news magazine they believed that barry goldwater the republican candidate for president was unfit for office in a finger wagging statement released in august the apas president maria oquendo reaffirmed the ban but while there are certainly strong arguments in favour of it it risks undermining public confidence in psychiatrists and stigmatising people with mental illness its been far from obvious in that these outweigh the ethical arguments for flouting it writing in vox the psychologist cedar riener compared psychiatrists disregarding the rule to a doctor diagnosing cancer just by looking at my behaviour or public statements but in the case of psychological disorders unlike physical illnesses behaviour and speech are always the primary sources of diagnostic data and it has often seemed as if we might have more direct access to the darkest recesses of trumps mind than to some of our closest friends like many americans i was more amused than alarmed by trump at the beginning says bill doherty a marriage and family therapist from minnesota but as the trump movement picked up steam doherty happened to be travelling in austria where he encountered a neo fascist political demonstration and visited a concentration camp so i did some reading about the responses of mental health professionals in germany and austria in the and they were largely silent and some were complicit upon his return he wrote a manifesto citizen therapists against trumpism which more than of his colleagues have now signed doherty insists this doesnt violate the goldwater rule hes condemning trumpism as a threat to public health not diagnosing trump as say a narcissist

political spouse with her own high powered career who hadnt set it aside to stand by her husband when bill clinton became governor of arkansas her career became an issue in the democratic primary there were questions about whether then gov bill clinton had funneled state business into her law firm when asked about her career in a press gaggle clinton responded you know i suppose i could have

a russian frigate armed with cruise missiles has passed through the bosphorus on its way to the eastern mediterranean in a potentially ominous development for the embattled syrian city of aleppo the admiral grigorovich part of russias black sea fleet arrived off the syrian coast on friday as the latest pause in the russian bombardment of eastern aleppo came to an end adding to an emphatic russian show of naval force in the mediterranean unlike the admiral kuznetsov aircraft carrier and peter the great nuclear powered battle cruiser whose arrival in the region has drawn considerable publicity the newly commissioned grigorovich has a fearsome ground attack capability in the form of kalibr land attack cruise missiles three russian submarines from russias northern fleet capable of firing kalibr missiles are also reported to have arrived in the mediterranean five maps that show how the net closed on eastern aleppo read morerussia has used kalibr missiles equivalent to us tomahawk missiles against syrian targets a handful of times over the past year the concentration of forces in the eastern mediterranean in support of the syrian regimes ambitions to retake aleppo from rebel forces suggest they may be used again in the coming few days or hours earlier this week vladimir putin warned syrian rebels and civilians trapped in eastern aleppo to leave the city by friday night when a temporary moratorium on air strikes was set to expire but opposition groups told the guardian that promised safe passages out of besieged areas did not exist as the deadline drew near opposition groups pushed on with an assault on loyalist west aleppo while residents seemed resigned to a resumption in airstrikes nothing can be done nobody can stop the planes bebars mishal an official with the white helmets volunteer rescue service told reuters the kuznetsov battle group paused in its approach towards syria off the east coast of crete on thursday to carry out aviation exercises russian ministry of defence footage showed warplanes taking off and landing on its deck the kuznetsov is carrying about sukhoi and four mig fighter aircraft as well as up to two dozen helicopters although the su have recently been adapted to drop bombs more accurately the plane has never been used for ground attack only the mig is designed for that purpose if the planes are used to bomb targets in syria it would mark the first time russia has used its only aircraft carrier in combat that lack of experience however may limit its usefulness there are very few carrier trained pilots in fact there are more planes than pilots and most of the planes on board are not made for ground attack for naval aviation this is largely a training run michael kofman a russian specialist at the centre for naval analyses a federally funded research institute they havent done anything done anything like this in a long time and its getting heavily covered by the local and international media said peter zwack a retired us brigadier general and former military attache to moscow now at the national defence university they are arriving in the eastern mediterranean right before our election its posturing and secondarily adding capability in syria the visit of its flagship to the mediterranean is also a morale boosting demonstration of military capacity for the russian navy which has not played a significant role in the ukraine or syrian conflicts but which is seen by vladimir putin as vital to russian self image as a global power russias naval presence in the mediterranean is as much about military posture and ability to project power beyond its region as much as the syria campaign in general moscow sees it as important attributes of a great power said maxim suchkov an expert on the russian foreign affairs council and an editor at al monitor covering russian relations with the middle east the importance of image to this naval expedition is illustrated by the fact that russian sailors have spent several days during its mediterranean journey painting its deck bright blue presumably so it looks better in aerial photographs the carrier has had a long and troubled history it was launched in but took a decade to become fully operational it was first called the riga then renamed the leonid brezhnev as the former soviet premier died and then the tbilisi after the georgian capital and then rechristened after the soviet union fell apart and georgia gained independence it was initially armed with a dozen granit anti ship missiles but those have recently been removed to make more space for aircraft the carrier has had persistent problems with its propulsion system based on turbo pressurised boilers which belch out black smoke due to an excess of fuel over air in its engines they have frequently broken down and require the kuznetsov to be accompanied on high seas duty by a tug the ship has spent more time in port than at sea and will be out of action for several years for refurbishment from next year it is accompanied by the peter the great a massive battle cruiser with a fearsome array of missiles but which are designed to hit planes ships and submarines rather than attack land targets a more potent threat from the flotilla sent from russias northern fleet may have escorted the kuznetsov under the surface uk reports quoting british government sources say two nuclear powered akula class and one diesel powered kilo class submarine have been spotted trailing the battle group into the mediterranean at the same time as the kuznetsov left murmansk two destroyers left vladivostok the headquarters of the pacific fleet those destroyers the bystry and the admiral tributs are reported to be off the gulf of aden kofman said that they could be on call in case the kuznetsov encounters engine trouble possibly a plan b for nervous admirals however the bystry has the same unreliable propulsion system the arrival of the grigorovich and the russian submarines armed
now the members of the demagogic right are demonstrating that they are not only athreat toour economic wellbeing but our constitutional settlement when nigel farage threatens those parliamentarians who delay or block brexit with public anger he is denying parliament the right to hold the executive to account he has no understanding of the role of the mp as the representative of the people andnot itsdelegate which until now was regarded as the correct understanding of the role of the mp britain is a representative or parliamentary democracy not one ruled by plebiscite which is more characteristic of authoritarian states such as hitlers third reich when ukips suzanne evans demands the sacking of the judges she is undermining the independence of the judiciary yet another of the bulwarks intended to prevent the arbitrary exercise of power by governments politicians such as these when they speak of the will of the people are using it as a means of removing from the constitution all those elements that they dont like in particularthose that protect the rightsofminorities in this case the who voted remain the brexit debate isno longer just a debate on eu membership but a fight to retain those elements of the britishconstitution that make it a liberal democracy derrick joad the burkean philosophy quoted by your correspondent is the root of arrogance and self righteousness of some members of parliament burkes flowery language can be reduced to ignoring your constituents wishes if they do not accord with the representatives enlightened conscience entrusted by providence messianic zeal should have no place in a secular society steve simmons the death threats made to gina miller are both scandalous and extremely worrying coming so soon after the tragic death of jo cox such scurrilous comments bordering on xenophobia should be refuted by our free press and not encouraged as we have seen from the rightwing press describing the high court judges who ruled in the article case as the enemies of the people upholding the rule of law is at the cornerstone of our democracy and the judges involved have done just that the true enemies of the people are those who rail so provocatively against them george longstaff the argument about whether parliament or the prime minister should trigger article clouds another issue that article is impossible to use under article the other member states can present an ultimatum since the uks membership will automatically cease after two years worse even if a compromise is reached it has to be approved by the european parliament if meps reject the agreement the uk will still have to leave thus the cannot credibly commit the setup imposed by article makes negotiation impossible invoking article is close to unconditional surrender before negotiations have begun hopefully parliament will have sense enough to see the futility of negotiating without any leverage and rule out the use of article and hopefully eu leaders and leaders of other member states will realise that their commitment not to negotiate before article is invoked is not credible a deal has to be struck and it is pointless to demand that the uk surrenders all weapons before the fight has even begun brexit can mean anything just as the british crown has all sorts of arrangements with its various affiliated nations the constituent nations of great britain northern ireland crown dependencies etc so can the eu have a variety of arrangements with the uk possibly with special provisions for scotland this needs to be achieved by a treaty change or by some other means instead of through the unusable article mikael sandstrm steve flatley suggests perhaps tongue in cheek that the government could appeal to the european court if they lose their article case in the supreme court i cant see that its been pointed out yet that the supreme court must refer the case the reasoning of the high court in deciding that the crown prerogative cannot be used proceeded from the initial assumption agreed by the parties to the case as common ground that notice of withdrawal under article cannot be revoked this is a matter of interpretation of article and as the final court of appeal the supreme court will be obliged to refer the case to the european court of justice under article of the treaty on the functioning of the eu peter roderick what a shambles cameron takes a bill to parliament to have a referendum he expects to vote remain to see off ukip the entire scrutiny process of the passage of the bill fails to ask whether this is our mps last say in the matter so now our learned friends are making a pretty penny at our expense sorting out what i thought we paid our mps to do the only good thing is nigel farage being so cross that a british court has made a decision john beer the day after sir john chilcot before a parliamentary committee criticised tony blairbecause on several occasions between and things were decided without reference to cabinet the high court rules that government does not have the power it claimed to trigger article without consulting parliament prime ministers should not have to be told these things adrian betham the government should accept that parliament must have the right to debate and vote on the outcome of brexit negotiations once these have been conducted conversely parliament should accept that the government is obliged to trigger those negotiations and that in doing so it is taking its instructions from the people roderick mccallum the talk is all of early elections what happened to the fixed term parliaments act is it to be scrapped at the first sign of inconvenience to the party in power bernard besserglik i am a pro european my issue with the court judgment is thus more one of efficiency than principle international negotiations are complex and thus can only be a crown prerogative on that same principle the deployment of british forces can only
before we close up for the day here is a summary of some of the main developments us markets opened slightly lower but are now up following eight straight days of losses wall street appears to have been boosted by the non farm payrolls report it was a solid jobs report with no nasty shocks and an unexpected jump in wages it does raise the prospect of a rate hike in december but this was already

speak in brussels in a few choice words in his new book midnight in europe moscovici not only accuses the ex finance minister of unbridled narcissism but says his negotiating tactics with international creditors at the height of the euro crisis in did much to exacerbate greeces ailing economy with his frantic pre occupation with the media and unbridled narcissism varoufakis drew the limelight on himself and for several months cannabilised the discussions he contributed to the tension at the talks by refusing any negotiation varoufakis hit back on friday the more the third

european bureaucrats over riding the democratic wishes of the local power sharing executive and endangering jobs james knightley a senior economist at ing says a december rate hike is now more likely but it isnt a done deal it seems as though the tightness in the labour market is starting to generate higher pay the wage story is also good news for consumer spending with average hourly earnings not having risen this fast since mid so with the economy creating jobs and workers being paid more it backs the case for a rate hike from the federal reserve in december however it isnt a done deal any market turmoil relating to next weeks presidential election would quickly scupper thoughts of a policy change capital economics says the surge in us wages signals the fed will raise rates in december paul ashworth chief us economist writes the solid gain in employment and the acceleration in average hourly earnings growth in october will increase expectations that the fed will hike interest rates in december what will really catch the eye of fed officials is the m m increase in average hourly earnings last month which followed an upwardly revised m m gain in september as a result the annual growth rate climbed to a seven year high of from the us unemployment rate fell to in october from in september as expected the us labor department said average hourly earnings grew at an annual rate

later we are both married fathers of three adult children and experienced in our chosen fields my parents still call to ask questions about tim voice plans now allow for unlimited talk but my brief answer has never changed hes the best person i have ever met closing out her address in raleigh north carolina democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton said that the best way to repudiate the bigotry and the bluster and the hatred and discrimination is to show up with the biggest turnout in history i believe americas best days are still ahead of us if we do what were supposed to do clinton concluded every social movement every economic advance has only come about because people going to work and sacrifice and keep pushing forward in the affect of adversity it wasnt easy to get the vote for women it wasnt easy to have the final efforts made to ensure that the civil rights act was enforced it wasnt easy because there are powerful interests still trying to push us back and push us down clinton continued it is now our turn our turn to stand up to people like your governor and your legislature who wanted to shut you down and push you back we are fundamentally a good nation and we need to make sure we deliver on that promise clinton urged the crowd you can make the difference not only in who you elect but in the agenda that those people then get to work i want you to hold me accountable i want you to be my partners everything ive done started by listening to people listening to hear your stories what youre worried about and then working to bring people together to solve

the pound is holding onto its gains which were inspired first by the high court vote on brexit and then by the bank of england keeping interest rates on hold it is now up against the dollar at having been as high as against the euro it is better at pound jumps after high court ruling and bank of england decisionpound jumps after high court ruling and bank of england decision bank of england governor mark carney who let it not be forgotten has run into some political flak recently has not yet applied for british citizenship which he said he would when appointed sky is reporting ed conway mark carney has been eligible to take up british citizenship for months but has not yet applied more on skynews imminentlynovember conway there is no reason why the boe governor needs uk citizenship but mr carney did promise the pm to take up citizenship when appointednovember conway looks more like cock up than conspiracy bank thought residency requirement was in fact if you have a uk spouse its carney the high court ruling that parliament should have a vote on brexit put the cat among the pigeons sending the pound soaring and the uk market lower news that the bank of england had kept interest rates on hold helped sterling keep much of its gains and kept the pressure on shares the ftse is dominated by exporters and overseas earners who have benefitted from a weak pound so the reverse is also true the more domestically focused ftse managed to gain ground despite the uncertainty european markets outperformed the uk helped by positive updates from ing socgen and credit suisse the us was struggling for direction as investors fretted about the outcome of next weeks presidential election there was also one eye on fridays non farm payroll numbers the closing scores in europe showed the ftse finished down points or at dax dipped to cac closed down at ftse mib fell to ibex bucked the trend and ended higher at greece the athens market slipped to wall street the dow jones industrial average is currently down points or the rise in the pound following the court ruling on brexit and the bank of england keeping interest rates on hold may not be the end of it says kathleen brooks research director at city index sterling is currently up against the dollar at and incidently is also stronger against the euro up at brooks said although global markets remain at the mercy of the outcome of the us election if hillary clinton does manage to win next week then the pound may continue to outperform the the court ruling on article opens the door to a delayed brexit which seems a good enough excuse for the foreign exchange market to extend this pound rally further the increase in the bank of englands inflation forecast could also keep upward pressure on uk gilt yields which are the building blocks of a stronger pound in our view overall us election fears weighing on the dollar and brexit fears temporarily receding could trigger a break above in the pound dollar in the near term if this happens then we could see the pound dollar move towards the range between now and the fed meeting in december back with the bank of england and its forecast changes unicredit research is now expecting uk interest rates to remain on hold next year daniel vernazza its lead uk economist said the tone of the inflation report mpc minutes and the governors press conference were notably less dovish than we had expected in particular the mpc said monetary policy could now move in either direction to changes to the economic outlook cancelling its guidance from august that a cut was the most likely next move as a result we have now cancelled our expectation for a cut in the bank rate in february next year we now expect the mpc to remain on hold throughout so whats changed in

to be higher we are dropping our expectation that interest rates will be taken down to a low of we now believe that it is more likely than not interest rates will stay at for a prolonged period ahead

here are the guardians main stories on todays article court rulingtheresa mays plan to trigger brexit by the end of march will not be derailed by a high court ruling that parliament must vote on the decision no has insisted official reaction on the continent to the high courts ruling on article has been muted with national governments and the european commission regarding the decision as an internal matter parliament alone has the power to trigger brexit by notifying brussels of the uks intention to leave the european union the high court has ruled the pound jumped on the news that negotiations over britains withdrawal from the european union could be delayed after the high court rejected government claims that it has the sole power to trigger article this is the most important development in the brexit story since the election of theresa may as prime minister and easily the most encouraging day for those who backed remain since the referendum on june ive posted vast amounts of commentary on this already but here is what it means in six key points the court ruling is much more definitive than anyone expected the government is appealing to the supreme court but informed commentators seem to think it more likely than not that the government will lose again unless the government does win at the supreme court parliament will get to legislate on invoking article and that means a proper bill passing through the commons and the lords with mps and peers getting the chance to amend it theresa may has been refusing to give parliament a vote on the terms of brexit because once power shifts from the hands of the executive to the legislature the prime minister loses some control the key point about today is that mps and peers have for the first time got a strong chance of shaping the start of the brexit process the chances of brexit being overturned are still very minimal it is just about possible to conceive how the uk could stay in the eu but you would be unwise to bet on it most mps and peers who voted remain accept that the result of the referendum should be honoured but the chances of brexit being soft not hard have increased significantly there is a majority for a soft brexit in parliament and if there is a bill it will now have the chance to exercise leverage there is now a real possibility that theresa may will not be able to trigger article before the end of march the government says it still intends to meet this deadline but the need to legislate could lead to a delay an early election though by no means inevitable now does look more likely than it did this time yesterday thats all from me for today i had been intending to cover other stories but im afraid this one took over thanks for the comments the votes of northern ireland mps in the house of commons could prove critical if theresa may and the government is forced to ask parliament to trigger article all eight democratic unionist party mps are guaranteed to back brexit in the commons given that they were the only major political force in the stormont assembly to active back a leave vote in junes referendum however the position of the two ulster unionist mps fermanagh south tyrones tom elliott and danny kinahan in south antrim is interesting in june uup leader mike nesbitt called for a remain vote the uup has now switched position and said its mps will back the government to allow for the referendum result to be implemented the party will argue this is because the entire electorate of the uk has spoken in the referendum and it is their duty to back up that outcome in the commons the switch though may also be due to fears of being further outflanked by the dup especially given a number of recent defections from the uup to the democratic unionists in essence the uup is again moving to the right in order to slow down its decline vis a vis the dup all three sdlp mps will definitely vote to block brexit given that the party campaigned vigorously for remain and was involved in last weeks failed legal action in the belfast high court to declare brexit null and void in northern ireland only sinn fein will not vote in the commons because it boycotts the parliament although the party will come under fire accused of failing to add to the remain voices in the chamber that could scupper brexit yet it is the votes of the unionist bloc that will prove far more critical if and when the referendum result is tested in the house of commons expect more demands from dup first minister arlene foster for special treatment for northern ireland in order to bolster the governments numbers in a brexit vote even one after a general election here is douglas carswell the ukip mp on the court ruling douglas carswell mp shocking judicial activism these judges are politicians without accountability https t co carswell mp remainers aided and abetted by lawyers seeking to tell electorate to sod offnovember a majority of voters now want britain to remain in the european union according to a poll the press association report but there was little sign that the ultra slim majority in favour of remain reflected a change of heart since the referendum vote to leave just of leave voters polled by bmg research said they would now vote remain while of those who backed eu membership on june said they would switch in the other direction the remain camps advantage came from voters who did not take part in the referendum of whom said they would now back eu membership against who would vote to leave bmg found that the conservatives were ranked the best party to handle brexit negotiations with the remaining eu with the
its almost six months since sadiq khan became london mayor and opinion polls suggest that londoners are pleased with him so far hes had a high public profile addressing the capitals security concerns making friends with hillary clinton and even being lauded by the evening standard khan has allied with london business groups and others to lobby national government for infrastructure investment and stronger devolved powers brexit which he and most london voters opposed has added edge and urgency to this campaign hes also made starts on tackling londons harmful air quality sizing up barriers to social inclusion and recalibrating transport for london to meet some of his bolder policy goals but his biggest challenge is what is now routinely called the london housing crisis this is the issue londoners are most concerned about accordingly khan dubbed the mayoral election a housing policy referendum a large part of his approach to this complex policy area will be trying to increase the delivery of homes that are affordable for people on low and middle incomes khan has so far not set a target for the absolute number of what he calls genuinely affordable homes to be built in his four year term but he has committed to a long term goal of of all new london dwellings meeting that definition how well is he doing so far what progress is he making towards honouring other housing pledges in his manifesto a lot of the work on housing has been hard graft behind the scenes there is a widely shared view that khans deputy for housing and residential development james murray has applied himself to the vast task with an energy an intelligence and a political will that was lacking in boris johnsons time as mayor he has been nurturing the broad consensus that unless london makes a better job of building the kinds of homes it and its people most need everyone stands to lose including the rest of the country the goodwill of housing associations boroughs of all political complexions employers and commercial property developers has been sought a dinner murray had with new housing minister gavin barwell who is also minister for london and mp for a marginal london constituency appears to have gone swimmingly khan has repeatedly stressed that altering the london housing equation so that it generates better results wont happen quickly or easily sooner or later though londoners will want to start seeing solid results what follows is a round up of khans housing policy progress so far and some pointers to important things to come a trade off with property developerslater this year after the governments autumn public spending statement on november city hall will issue its long brewing supplementary planning guidance designed to encourage higher affordable housing yields from planning deals struck between boroughs and property developers across the city like it or not london depends heavily on private sector companies to finance and deliver buildings it needs including much of its affordable housing inviting them to take a hike might get you a round of applause but the ways things are now wont help put roofs over peoples heads khans spg will effectively offer developers an incentive to ensure that the proportion of affordable homes agreed for larger schemes meets a minimum level expected to be london mayors have considerable powers to intervene in planning arrangements being worked out at borough level the spg will show khan willing to give a fair wind to plans enshrining the desired percentage but take a long hard look at those that dont the trade off is that developers will benefit from the certainty this approach provides they may have mastered the dark arts of viability but the attendant aggravation costs them time and money too the spg will also set out what types of home called affordable by national government meet khans more stringent definition of being genuinely so increasing affordable supply with public moneykhan has spent some of whats left of the provided to boris johnson for to increase the affordable housing component of housing planned for the first section of the vast old oak and park royal regeneration project in west london he will soon produce a successor to johnsons funding prospectus outlining to housing associations and boroughs what it will take for them to secure grants from him this will be published following the autumn statement city hall is lobbying for further funding for affordable homes building affordable homes on public landprior to khans election transport for london had named a panel of developer partners to work with on jointly profiting from building on over acres on sites in its large land portfolio its prime objective was to make as much money as it could for the citys transport systems khan though wants an overall of homes built on these sites to be genuinely affordable his manifesto specified that these would be part buy part rent shared ownership dwellings prioritised for first time buyers whove been renting for five years especially in outer london it is another key strand of his drive to increase affordable housing supply since the election khan has put in place arrangements for out of homes he wants built on tfl land at kidbrooke station to meet his requirements and urged the transport body to prioritise some of its smaller sites elsewhere an announcement earlier this week concerned two of these one is called landmark court near london bridge station which has been lined up for more than homes of which at least will be affordable the other is called fenwick south which is actually owned by lambeth council the building of social rented homes already planned for it as part of the agreement that will extend the northern line into nine elms will now begin early next year sooner than expected tfl will be responsible for delivering the homes which will be owned and managed by lambeth a best practice guide for estate regeneration another way khan could
middletown timelineweve been asking readers to help guide and shape gary younges reporting from muncie indiana where for the past month hes been taking the political pulse of middle america during this volatile election here residents tell us about the issues that matter most to them when it comes to voting and their experience of living in muncie as with middletowns everywhere the city faces difficulties but it seems these are matched by a strong and active community willing to take them on lauren bishop weidner who taught english at ball state university for years told us your first impression of muncie is probably going to be inaccurate most people come in on the east or west side on mcgalliard avenue and you just see box store after box store but if you go through the neighbourhoods you see diversity and spirit especially downtown you need to go all the way through muncie before you decide what you think jason donati family photo donati family photo donati has four children grew up in muncie and returned eight years ago he lives in downtown muncie and is an environmental educator for the muncie sanitary district he is also the co founder of race muncie which stands for reconciliation achieved through community engagement there are jobs in muncie i know people in economic development and there are a lot of jobs which dont have enough qualified people its easy to say we havent got jobs that weve been screwed over by nafta the north american free trade agreement we have all felt the effects of losing the automotive industry thats true but what working class white people have to deal with here is the issue of addiction ive been to a lot of funerals of my friends the drugs are so much stronger people in their mid with small children are now dying through recreational use its doubling and tripling and heroin is catching up with meth theres a lack of resources in the community for mental health counselling and healing the only thing im seeing elected officials do is bust the cases it needs to be addressed as a disease i lost my middle brother to drugs in its something you deal with your entire life thats my motivation i think about my brother and the impact its had on my life and its a rare privilege to live another day i learned through my two years with americorps that you have to get out and serve im running for the muncie community school board and if i get elected i can help address some of these issues pheobechris allen is the community development block grant coordinator for hamilton county indiana helping communities fund activities such as affordable housing public service programmes and infrastructure projects he was born and raised in anderson about minutes south west of muncie went to ball state university and has mostly lived in muncie ever since in muncie anderson and the surrounding communities up until the you could go to high school and graduating was optional you could drop out get a job at gm or borgwarner or delco remy working on the line my dad worked there three quarters of my elementary class parents worked there you got married had the family and the income health benefits retirement benefits you could achieve the american dream you had the ranch house ran two cars and more importantly could afford to take your family on vacation going to the lakes or down to florida now thats a luxury these kinds of dreams have been lost and i think thats a major driving force of this election fifty years ago muncie was a boom town what are we going to do to get that back if thats not realistic then how are we going to replace it how do we get economic gains theres no doubt in my mind that there are towns like this across the world but for a lot of people muncie is the place you cant give up on it theres so much work and effort thats striving to make this place better danielledanielle grew up in the south east of muncie she graduated from muncie central high in and went to university but returned to the town after two years because of family illness she supports herself with two jobs the future of muncie is very bleak a lot of older people have seen a city just out of its prime now they see their city is dead regeneration is happening downtown not everyone involved is from the north side but a lot of them are typically thats where the doctors lawyers and educators live on the south side where those who did the factory work live they dont see revitalisation happening for the kind of skills they have i do believe healthcare has got worse i see people all the time who cant afford treatment if they choose treatment they cant eat or fall into debt and lose their homes i think education in muncie is slipping too they have consolidated two high schools and it has become a mess its hard to talk about everyone here is very closeted about their opinions particularly about anything political but muncie does have a lot of good people band together over the slightest thing theres strong community when it matters i do feel proud weve lightened up a lot kids going to different states and coming back are influencing us were changing ourselves i feel

but it is not a given that the fed will hike in december says economist james knightley at ing bank there is little in the statement to suggest that a december hike is definitely going to happen the statement comments that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen while adding the word some to the line that it wants to wait for some further evidence of continued progress towards its objectives this all suggests that things are moving in the right direction but the presidential election is an obvious reason for waiting assuming clinton wins markets are likely to react with relief given expectations of policy continuity this coupled with the reasonably firm growth rising employment and a gradual pick up in inflation should reinforce market expectations for a december rate hike should trump win then this is likely to hurt market sentiment given uncertainty as to what he will actually do when in power it is hard to imagine the fed hiking in this environment we also have plenty more data to come ahead of the december fomc meeting including two more job reports so there are other reasons for caution the fed statement has failed to give much support to the dollar and us markets have struggled for direction after the news the dow jones industrial average is now down points compared to around ahead of the statement the us dollar index has lost to gregory daco fed fomc statement us economy chugging along inflation expectations rising only need a little more progress december ratehikenovember paul r la monica no alarms and no surprises fed leaves rates unchanged but hihts st hike in december uber hawks george and mester dissent wanted hike now november a lavorgna fomc judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen fed remains on track for dec rate hikenovember although there was no rate change today it looks increasingly likely there will be one in december paul sirani chief market analyst at xtrade said with just days to go before election fever sweeps america janet yellens federal interest rate statement held no shocks with rates remaining the same however its becoming ever more likely that yellen will implement a raise early next month following signs that the american economy is gradually picking up steam she made clear in september that a rise before the end of was more than likely and with employment and inflation continuing to strengthen the central bank may get its wish the fed has dropped a reference to inflation remaining low in the near term in september it said inflation is expected to remain low in the near term in part because of earlier declines in energy prices but to rise to percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further this now reads inflation is expected to rise to percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further the fed said in its statement the committee expects that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further inflation is expected to rise to percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further near term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced the committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments against this backdrop the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent the committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided for the time being to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to percent inflation this time there were only two fed dissenters who wanted to raise rates not three esther george and loretta mester eric rosengren who voted for a rise last time has now sided with the majority breaking newsto no ones great surprise the federal reserve has opted to leave us interest rates unchanged just days ahead of the presidential election it said it was waiting for further evidence of progress towards its objectives before hiking anthony cheung awaiting any subtle change in fomc language to hint towards dec hike look out for next meeting or further strengthened november the us federal reserves interest rate decision will be released in less than an hour while most commentators expect there to be no change not this close to the presidential election the prospect of a rate rise in december is thought to be reasonably likely given the recent reassuring us economic data there is likely to be a focus as usual on the exact wording of the fed statement and whether it shows any changes from the september comments at that meeting seven of the fed members voted for no change with three esther george loretta mester and eric rosengren backing an increase any variance here could also give a clue to the likely outcome in december investors have been unnerved by suggestions that donald trump is gaining ground in the us presidential race with one poll this week even showing him in the lead over hillary clinton combined with a slump in oil prices following a record weekly rise in us crude stocks this has pushed markets in europe sharply lower but on wall street the dow jones industrial average which lost points or so on tuesday has not been hit as badly and is currently down just points ahead of the latest us federal reserve interest rate decision meanwhile the vix index

people are surprised when i express support for hillary clinton my economic politics are hard to the left and unlike hers explicitly socialist but its entirely because my analysis of inequality is economic that i endorse clinton not as a least worst option not even due to the nature of her opponent but on her own terms as a leader pledged to the material improvement of womens economic and social reality this is a structurally radical framework for broad based american change yet over the course of many a bleating bro beating on the internet the dread realisation has landed with me that among too many men who identify themselves as on the left notions of what constitutes social progress and radical redress of inequality are gendered concepts with the result that clintons activist leadership is wilfully dismissed time magazine may have called clinton a cultural revolutionary but the bernie bros are having none of it if youre a woman whos supported clinton online at any point youll know which bros i mean stop right there assuming a hillary clinton victory is downright dangerous kate aronoff read moretheyre the self proclaimed progressive gentlemen who insist that bernie sanders was robbed of the democratic nomination despite his loss by more than votes in the primaries whether brogressives brocialists or manarchists they denounce clintons claim on american left leadership despite her popular nomination policy activist record her spoken statements or her trouncing of donald trump in three debates there must be scrutiny of any candidate for office but it comes with an obsessional viciousness towards clinton in these mannish parts of the left the australian writer jane caro described an experience of praising clinton and being abused sneered at patronised and sent endless propaganda purporting to prove shes corrupt a criminal a murderer a warmonger etc ive received this propaganda too clintons critics cite unstructured blog posts about petrodollars blame her for the us mire in the middle east and post links to rough edit youtube videos proclaiming her ownership by the banks the alpha bro outfit wikileaks has fuelled some old school conspiracy theories by tweeting sly suggestions that shes a puppet of the rothschilds there are those who unbelievably insist shes just as bad as trump such ardent behaviour is global and unrestricted to those us citizens who can determine the election its been described by female writers across the world as they simultaneously explain the phenomenon of silent hillary supporters since the primaries exposed this behaviour vast communities have formed of women organising secret facebook groups so they can praise analyse and debate concerns about the clinton candidacy without abuse im in two of them an australian and american one there are thousands more and various groups run into memberships of thousands its not just leftwing women either an article in marie claire observed the phenomenon of evangelical women in conservative communities secretly organising for clinton as well why theres open hostility by certain men towards clinton as well as how her female voting base is locked down in their support for her is simplistically explained as an act of and response to sexism but there are more complex and nuanced elements here that apply to a broader western conversation about policy priorities problems of pay inequality parental leave and access to affordable childcare exist across the western world because of the scarcity within political leadership of those who fight for womens causes beyond lip service and make actual legislative change fighting inequality in the us and global context has defined clintons political engagement for her entire career her campaign is unashamed in its commitment to womens policy as an australian i look upon the opportunity americans have to exercise a vote for her with envy the hatred of clinton from the testosterone left is a dangerous self defeating omission from those who insist theirs is a project of fairness clinton has progressed from community activist to presidential candidate with relentless dedication to equality causes entirely because of her own redefinition of the first lady role its hard to imagine now how groundbreaking it was when she told the un that it is no longer acceptable to discuss womens rights as separate from human rights in beijing in or when she published it takes a village arguing that childcare is a collective social responsibility in or that she is credited with the creation of an office on violence against women at the department of justice in her busy senatorial career she championed access to contraception as a womens rights issue fought for the paycheck fairness act and co sponsored the lilly ledbetter bill for fair pay as well as campaigning for paid parental leave for us public servants her tenure as secretary of state was characterised by her unprecedented centralisation of gender equality strategies to foreign policy creating a structure for participation of women in peace processes and recognition of rape as a weapon of war which was subsequently adopted by the un let learn from the mistakes that created us poverty not copy them van badham read moreher nuanced understanding and dogged defence of womens autonomy and the right to choose has been hailed as glorious given the dangerous polarisation of the abortion issue in the us shes never abandoned her dedication to improving access to childcare it is a central feature of her present campaign and her candidacy for president has been marked by her advocacy for fairness for women and children equal pay reproductive rights health equality and family and carers leave while women fight these ongoing battles for recognition and redress of our structural disadvantage it exposes the privilege of cabinet ministers wikileaks wannabes and bernie bros alike that they can trivialise minimise or ignore them there is more at stake in the us election than one candidates victory and anothers defeat far more than who should gain the levers of an economy far more even than who deserves access to the us armoury

the pound may indeed fall to as bank of america merrill lynch has suggested but at the moment it is holding fairly steady against the us currency sterling is currently down just at but this is mainly thanks to dollar weakness due to renewed uncertainty surrounding the us election not to mention wednesdays interest rate decision from the federal reserve neil wilson market analyst at etx capital said a poll from abc that gave trump a slender lead over clinton has been the catalyst for some fairly significant risk off moves given how far ahead in the polls clinton was very recently the fact that were talking about a close race again is clearly rattling investors suffice to say we can expect more volatility in the coming week against the euro the pound is not faring so well down at heres some gloom from pro brexit fund manager crispin odey who has told investors the uk could face recession and the stock market could slump by bloomberg reported crispin odey whose main hedge fund has lost about percent this year says u k stocks could slump percent as the economy is roiled by a recession and higher inflation following the vote to leave the european union shares will come under pressure after the ftse share index climbed percent over five years even as earnings fell by percent the money manager said in a letter to investors last week seen by bloomberg news we are now destined to have a recession in the u k as well as inflation odey wrote it will be difficult for the stock market to remain above all of this a host of badly received results from standard chartered to bp to shire and pfizer has helped push markets lower not to mention renewed uncertainty over the us election a poll showing donald trump leading hillary clinton ahead of next weeks votes has unnerved investors while mixed us figures good manufacturing poor construction just added to the downbeat mood chris beauchamp chief market analyst at ig said despite two attempts at a rally today the ftse remains in the red european markets have had it far worse with the dax losing over today with euro strength helping to take the shine off markets on the continent that have enjoyed a recent spate of outperformance compared to london with us markets taking a hit this afternoon as well it doesnt take sherlock holmes to work out that the new polls giving donald trump an edge in the election are spooking investors the parallels with brexit are there for everyone to see but the key battleground states are still leaning towards the democrats in all probability the election will still turn out as expected but the markets nagging doubts are clearly getting the better of it this afternoon the final scores in europe showed the ftse finished down points or at dax dropped to cac closed lower at ftse mib fell to ibex ended down at greece the athens market dropped to wall street the dow jones industrial average is currently down points or meanwhile hsbc analysts say buy gold whoever wins the us election bloomberg reports although they deem a donald trump victory more supportive for the price of the metal than a win by hillary clinton the banks chief precious metals analyst james steel says itll enjoy at least a percent jump whoever wins the race both candidates have espoused trade policies that could stimulate demand with gold offering a potential protection against protectionism he says even the relatively more internationalist democratic candidate has argued for the renegotiation of longstanding free trade agreements thats positive for gold even if not on the scale of mr trumps agenda if the real estate magnate triumphs gold could rise to an ounce according to hsbc up from around at a m in new york if clinton wins the price of the metal could improve to an ounce by year end steel writes adding that a democratic sweep of congress would further stoke demand for the metal owing to a possible boost in fiscal spending on gold jasper lawler at cmc markets said weakness in the us dollar and rising uncertainty from presidential nominee donald trump rising in the polls saw gold breakout to a three week high the gold price has continued to climb after cftc

he was called jack he wrote about his zest for experience about the exhilaration of riding box cars about being an american hobo and a stranger in a strange land he travelled around with kin brothers and painted fantastic word pictures of drinking under the night sky lying with a newspaper under his head above me the stars were winking and wheeling in squadrons back and forth as the train rounded the curves but he didnt write a book called on the road in years before jack kerouacs novel became a bestseller jack london wrote his own masterpiece called wait for it the road without that vivid and extraordinary memoir the second half of the century would have looked a whole lot different london was the daddy o of the beats he even looked the part with his dark good looks and penchant for leather jackets more importantly he both walked the walk and talked the talk his life story is astonishing as detailed in the road he tramped the length and breadth of the us in aged just before that hed spent long brutal hours working in cannery factories and sailing on seal ships bound for japan romantically he got most of his education sitting at a makeshift desk in a saloon the owner took such a shine to him he paid for him to go to university in true beat style london dropped out later he sailed down the mississippi on a raft then joined the klondike gold rush got scurvy and discovered leftwing politics oh and he wrote more than novels a good handful of nonfiction books and dozens of short stories before expiring aged just in the late stages of alcoholism hopped up on morphine and with a body wrecked by hard years of use and abuse so its easy to see why kerouac always named london as a foundational influence and why he might have been the only author to get a namecheck in on the road but jack london is more than just a proto beat he was also a profound influence on ernest hemingway sinclair lewis and norman mailer lenin liked him too in her book memories of lenin the revolutionary leaders wife nadezhda krupskaya said that when the revolutionary leader was dying she read him a tale by london love of life it is still lying on the table in his room it was a very fine story in a wilderness of ice where no human being had set foot a sick man dying of hunger is making for the harbour of a big river his strength is giving out he cannot walk but keeps slipping and beside him there slides a wolf also dying of hunger there is a fight between them the man wins half dead half demented he reaches his goal that tale greatly pleased ilyich next day he asked me to read him more jack london it must have helped of course that for a long time london was a fellow traveller he was a sharp critic of the inequalities and injustices of the gilded age in which he lived thats part of the reason george orwell also found him so interesting and why london still feels all too relevant this month years after his death as we endure a second gilded age of rampant inequality overweening press barons and gold plated political monsters its sad to say that his depictions of dire poverty in people of the abyss and of the surveillance state in the iron heel still have plenty to teach us but before i paint jack london as some kind of leftwing saint i should also point out that he was more complicated than that he eventually left the socialist party of which he was a member he enjoyed both earning and spending huge amounts of money dressing in fine clothes and enjoying the high life in an essay quoting the passage above from krupskaya orwell says that krupskaya went on to read her husband a second story from london that turned out to be saturated with bourgeois morals and ilyich smiled and dismissed it with a wave of his hand less amusingly london also held plenty of the less appealing social darwinist and racial theories of his age and indulged a cult of the nordic orwell says london could foresee fascism because he had a fascist streak in himself or at any rate a marked strain of brutality and an almost unconquerable preference for the strong man as against the weak man while he took on londons character orwell also had a few choice words about his mentors prose london is a very uneven writer in his short and restless life he poured forth an immense quantity of work setting himself to produce words every day and generally achieving it that shouldnt put us off however although orwell complained that much of this work was scamped and unconvincing he also conceded that london produced at least six volumes which deserve to stay in print and that is not a bad achievement from a life of years annoyingly orwell doesnt name which six and confusingly he singles out at least seven for praise the road the jacket before adam the valley of the moon the iron heel people of the abyss and a collection of short stories love of life and other stories that list might give us a good place for us to start as we make a selection for this months reading group although of course that would be to ignore londons most famous novels white fang and the call of the wild theres a fine list to choose from as often well put it to the vote to nominate your favourite just name it in the comments below if you could give a reason that would be fantastic but its not compulsory ill come back in a few days to tot up the totals just to add to the fun since he
the news is hard to escape these days with many people hearing about world events not just from news websites but also on social media platforms but what impact is this having on children it could be making them more anxious according to the nspccs childline service it reported an increase in the number of children seeking help for anxiety with concern around world affairs such as the eu referendum and syria conflict its thought that the rise is down to a combination of personal and political issues while the charity said others felt it was also partly due to disturbing events seen in the media and on social media we asked parents and grandparents about their experience of this and how they try to calm children down about world affairs young and anxious do your children express fears over global events read moresalley vickers from london my granddaughter loses sleep over terrorist attacksi am a former psychoanalyst working with people who suffered serious trauma and am now a full time novelist my eldest grandchild aged is extremely anxious about political events particularly potential terrorist attacks she has become worried about travelling on the tube in london when she visits me she is also worried about going into big shopping centres because of the threat of bombs and was deeply concerned after the paris attacks she is not at all frightened by any supposed muslim threat indeed she is rather promuslim having many muslim peers which is a good and reassuring aspect of modern childrens education but she is insecure about being suddenly attacked in a place that she previously experienced as familiar and fun she loves coming to london but feels being there is nowadays more dangerous these concerns affect her sleep she has confided she has periods of lying awake worrying about terrorism and reassurances that it will not happen to her do not and in my view cannot dispel her concerns my experience of working with trauma convinces me that anxiety needs to be addressed and not given a superficial bandage of comfort my granddaughter doesnt have a computer or ipod or direct access to the web on her phone but inevitably she sees the news with her parents and hears about whats happening in school from other children who tend to big up scary events inevitably she absorbs often false or exaggerated information from her peers who have access to social media while she cannot check out the truth what they say in my view the current state of the world needs to be discussed in schools as well as at home and the spreading of rumour and gossip about scary events needs to be addressed more fully as a serious element in the school curriculum teachers need to rethink how children are introduced to political world events now there is so much greater access to them more consideration needs to be given to the way social media which can now feed into a bullying process affects children bullying is hardly a novel phenomenon in schools but i dont think we are really up to speed with the way political events can be deployed to terrify the less well informed or the more sensitive there needs to be greater education on civic responsibility for everyone and i believe for the sake of a responsible future society it should start at a younger age children need to be taught to look at the news and public reactions critically and not take them at face value in the way they were once taught to be critical of texts amet akolawin from london my daughter gets more anxious about issues such as global warmingmy daughter who turns eight next week watches the news when i do so in the morning and evening she also watches cbbcs newsround most days we do talk about the headlines a lot she takes an interest in what is going on around the world she does worry about some of the stuff she sees just yesterday at bedtime we spoke about the us election and the wall donald trump wishes to build between mexico and america it lead on to us chatting about the berlin wall and the great wall of china my daughter is very inquisitive so talking about news is an simple way to give her some insight and pass on some of my knowledge she doesnt like watching clips of war torn countries but she will still listen to what the report is saying she is quite sensitive so if there is a piece on syria for example and i think the images are disturbing her i will ask her if she would like to watch something else to be honest she gets more anxiety from topics touched on in school such as global warming and natural disasters we go to visit her gran in sardinia twice a year and much of the news recently has been about the earthquake there she has become very fixated about this and i havent been able to reassure her about her uncle lives in rome so its understandable that she would worry but its definitely made her afraid of something similar happening to her when shes there jessica eaton from staffordshire my sons worry they will end up as refugees and no one will take care of themmy sons who are five and eight had a shocking realisation about three months ago that the war in syria was real they had been in the room with me and my husband when we were discussing the decision to launch airstrikes in syria we were watching footage about the civilian casualties and condemning the decision they have lots and lots of questions about war politics and weapons the boys went away to play for a while and must have got talking because they came back into the living room shortly afterwards very upset saying real people are dying in syria with real guns and bombs they
whats the problem with hillary clintons emails clinton used a private email server situated in her new york home while she was secretary of state from to she has admitted that this was a mistake in july the fbi concluded that clinton and her aides had been extremely careless in their handling of classified information but should not face criminal charges the issue has dogged the democrats campaign for the presidency with supporters of republican rival donald trump regularly chanting lock her up clinton emails fbi gets warrant as comey told he may have broken law read morewhat just happened on friday fbi director james comey alerted members of congress to the existence of a new batch of emails he said could be pertinent to the investigation as many as messages were reportedly found on a laptop seized during an unrelated investigation of anthony weiner a former new york congressman who is the estranged husband of longtime clinton aide huma abedin abedin and weiner separated after weiner was caught in and again in sending women sexually explicit text messages and pictures of himself undressed federal authorities in new york and north carolina are investigating online communications between weiner and a year old girl senior officials at the department of justice expressed concern that comeys decision to inform congress would be inconsistent with protocols designed to avoid the appearance of interference in an election but the fbi director went ahead what is in the emails we dont know comey himself admitted the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant those mails with a connection to clintons server could merely be duplicates of emails already analysed or they could contain a smoking gun that compromises clinton even after the election on sunday the fbi obtained a warrant to begin reviewing the newly discovered emails the process will not be finished before election day what was the reaction to comeys announcement the timing less than two weeks before a presidential election drew harsh criticism from democrats and even some republicans at an organising event in daytona beach clinton called comeys actions unprecedented and deeply troubling her campaign launched an all out war on comey chairman john podesta said by providing selective information hes allowed partisans to distort and exaggerate in order to inflict maximum political damage and no one can separate what is true from what is not because comey has not been forthcoming with the facts the wider democratic establishment also weighed in four senators demanded a briefing from comey and nearly former department of justice officials and prosecutors both republican and democratic and led by the former obama attorney general eric holder signed a letter criticising comeys decision the trump campaign meanwhile was elated we never thought we were going to say thank you to anthony weiner the republican presidential nominee told a rally in nevada did comey abuse his power the nearly former officials criticised his actions in their open letter which was released by the clinton campaign director comeys letter is inconsistent with prevailing department policy and it breaks with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections they said in another scathing letter to comey the democratic senate minority leader harry reid of nevada accused him of clear intent to aid one party over another i am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the hatch act which bars fbi officials from using their official authority to influence an election reid wrote through your partisan actions you may have broken the law richard painter chief white house ethics lawyer from to said he had filed a complaint against the fbi for a possible violation of the hatch act what is the hatch act passed in it forbids anyone in the executive branch from using his or her official position to engage in political activity carolyn lerner head of the us office of special counsel wrote in the new york times five years ago at its best the act prevents people in political power from abusing their positions it prohibits coercion by a government supervisor such as pressuring employees to volunteer for or contribute to a campaign and shields the civil service and the federal workplace from politicking in july the housing secretary julian castro was found to have violated the hatch act when he expressed support for clinton comeys action however is less blatantly partisan and a case against him would be tough to prove in court the republican congressman trey gowdy told fox news on monday it is laughable that jim comey committed a violation of the hatch act i actually know what the hatch act is demonstrating a selective reading of the act he continued if the president of the united states actively campaigning on company time for another candidate to be president of the united states is not a violation of the hatch act then how is jim comey supplementing the record and telling the truth to congress a violation of the hatch act harry reid knows that this is not a violation so why did comey do it will hillary clinton lose the us election because of the fbi email investigation read morehe told fbi colleagues in a memo on friday he was aware his letter was at risk of being misunderstood but felt obliged to notify congress about the new emails after having told lawmakers that the matter was closed there have been reports that some members of the fbi were in revolt over comeys earlier decision not to recommend charges against clinton and that he feared word of the new email investigation would leak to the media leading to accusations of a cover up especially if it happened after november he therefore regarded going public now as the least worst option will these events affect the election result possible but not probable more than million people have already voted and there is little evidence of movement so
the clinton campaign has accused fbi director james comey of jaw dropping double standards for releasing news of a fresh investigation into hillary clintons private email server while apparently withholding evidence of russian support for donald trump in case it were to influence next weeks election clintons spokespeople pointed to reports by cnbc and the huffington post claiming that comey privately urged against naming russia for apparently interfering in the election and hacking democratic email accounts with campaign manager robby mook saying the decision to hold back defied all logic the white house also aired more tentatively worded concerns about comeys actions and motivations while the guardian reported that the fbi director could himself face investigation for violating the hatch act a law designed to prevent federal officeholders from abusing their power to influence an election hillary clinton there is no case in fbi email investigation videomeanwhile a slew of allegations about donald trump particularly concerning his alleged ties to russia have peppered the closing hours of october slate reported that analysis of communications between a trump organization server and a russian bank alfa bank could suggest a secretive relationship although the new york times said the messages could be marketing email s or spam the trump campaign has denied any relationship with alfa bank mother jones cited unnamed sources not verified by the guardian to claim that trump has been cultivated by russia as its preferred candidate the new york times had a look at what can be seen of trumps tax records hes chosen not to release them of course and concluded that measures he took in the early were so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the internal revenue service would likely declare it improper if he were audited and nbc reported that the fbi has opened an inquiry into paul manafort trumps former campaign manager in relation to his

the white house on monday highlighted concerns over the fbi directors decision to announce that the bureau is examining whether newly discovered emails may be relevant to its investigation of hillary clintons use of a private email server fbi director james comey may be under investigation for hatch act violation read morepress secretary josh earnest was careful to say fbi director james comey is regarded by barack obama as a man of integrity and principle but he also noted the importance of longstanding tradition and practice and norms and warned of the risk of communicating with congress earnest said one senior republican official already had suggested that his party was considering impeaching a future president clinton comey has faced a fierce backlash for going public with the new fbi investigation just days before a presidential election reportedly against the advice and guidelines of attorney general loretta lynch and other senior figures at the department of justice on sunday the fbi obtained a search warrant to begin reviewing the emails reportedly numbering and found on the laptop of anthony weiner estranged husband of clinton aide huma abedin on monday a spokesman for the office of special counsel indicated that the independent federal agency may be investigating comey over an alleged violation of the hatch act which guards against federal officials seeking to influence an election at a white house press briefing earnest said much that could be interpreted as critical of comey though he declined to do so explicitly the president believes that our democracy has been very well served for more than two centuries by officials at the department of justice and the fbi observing longstanding traditions that limit public discussion of investigations whether an election is around the corner or not he said it is clear what director comey has done whats not clear is what led to the decision nobody at the white house has insight into the decision that director comey made im not aware of any of the factors that went into director comeys decision to send this letter to congress on friday asked if the incident could affect the election outcome earnest replied we certainly have already seen some of secretary clintons harshest critics capitalise on this letter distort its contents to provoke controversy comeys letter to congress stating that the fbi is examining newly discovered information that might be pertinent to clintons use of a private email server as secretary of state has placed a widely respected fbi director in extraordinary political jeopardy earnest dismissed any notion that congress could be seen as an impartial oversight body weve already seen just in the last hours the kind of risk thats associated with communicating to them sensitive information he said theres one senior republican official who had previously endorsed the republican nominee for president whos let it slip that his party was considering impeaching president clinton even before shes been elected if shes elected facebook twitter pinterest trump whod have thought wed be thanking weiner that i think is a pretty clear indication that congress is not at all impartial and thats why many of these norms that apply even when were not talking about someone famous and even when were not talking about an election a week and a half away should apply the president believes these norms are important and worth upholding the press secretary was at pains to defend comey as an individual if not his actions in this case the presidents assessment of his integrity and character has not changed he said for example the president doesnt believe that director comey is intentionally trying to influence the outcome of an election the president doesnt believe that hes secretly strategising to benefit one candidate or one political party huma abedin has hillary clinton closest ally become her biggest liability read morehes in a tough spot and hes the one who will be in a position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts including individuals who served in senior department of justice positions and administrations that were led by presidents in both parties but im just not going to be in a position to frankly defend or criticise the decisions that hes made with regard to what to communicate in public an emboldened donald trump has described the revelation as bigger than watergate but there is little initial evidence the news has upended the presidential race a morning consult politico poll carried out after the announcement put clinton three points ahead while a cbs yougov survey of likely voters in battleground states showed that only of clinton supporters were less likely to vote for her as a consequence trump claimed on monday that the fbi had stumbled across a digital mother lode and predicted they would discover missing work related emails that had been deleted from clintons computers emails i think you are going to find the that are missing he told supporters in michigan i think we hit the mother lode as they say in the mining industry trump urged comey to resist political pressure hes gotta hang tough because a lot of people think he did the wrong thing but he did the right thing he told the grand rapids rally i was not his fan but what he did he brought back his reputation it took guts for director comey to do what he did he added to chants of lock her up from the crowd trump has seized on signs of momentum to push into once safe democratic territory in the industrial mid west he was also due to speak in warren in michigan on monday before appearing with running mate mike pence in eau claire wisconsin on tuesday until his polling gap began to narrow again last week trump had been forced back to a dwindling number of swing states while clinton eyed republican territory in utah arizona and georgia renewed optimism among republicans

welcome to this weeks blog and our roundup of your comments and photos from last week an intriguing and unexpected thread was started by frustratedartist we often read about lost books from the ancient world lost in the sense that every copy of them was destroyed and the text no longer exists or the sole manuscript was destroyed by its author for example has this ever happened to a printed book that is are there any books published after say every single copy including the manuscript of which has been lost here im thinking of printed and bound books as opposed to ephemeral publications like leaflets pamphlets magazines etc yosserian supplied an answer whose opening could almost have been the premise of a borges short story perhaps there are lost books but they are unknown because they lost i know when im rummaging in dusty corners of second hand bookshops i occasionally unearth books which are so idiosyncratic or personal i wonder if anyone at all knows of their existence they are often by elderly gentlemen reminiscing about their time at eton or in the army or something and must have had small print runs ive often had this notion of creating a museum of forgotten people and lives from stuff i find must be a sentimental resistance denial in my being to our essential ephemerality on this earth one book i did buy was a strange stream of consciousness novel by erica cotterill called it just seemed so wacky and odd that i wondered if it was a one off despite having a quote from gb shaw on the cover and while there are maybe a dozen for sale online ranging from quid to there is almost nothing in the way of discussion or reviews so it might as well be lost i suspect in this sense there are bound to be decent books that if not lost in the sense that they no longer physically exist are nevertheless thoroughly forgotten which perhaps amounts to the same thing we also got something close to a definitive answer from interwar when i was working in an antiquarian bookshop in cecil court years ago a man brought in a box of books hed been lugging up and down charing cross road i said id need time to look at them but he was so fed up he said hed take right there and then i gave it to him mostly because i felt sorry for him anyway when i finally did get round to inspecting what was in the box most of it was worthless but there was one eighteenth century novel by a woman writer unknown to me in original boards virtually in mint condition i looked it up but found nothing the british library did not have a copy so i sold it to them strangely i remember what they paid but not the name of the work or its author the price has stuck in my mind because i felt guilty about only giving the seller elsewhere daveportivo has been appreciating grayson perrys the descent of man i have to say i think its fabulous look hes not a cutting edge expert on gender studies or much of scientist but i found this book very profound in addressing the pressures and psychological stresses of the male gender role now that sounds very theoretical but what i loved about the book is how personable and how human it is it really struck me when he described behaviours that have either blighted my life in the past or that i continue to struggle with fannery oconnors wise blood also got the thumbs up from sydneyh ive finished by flannery oconnor which was just adorable the prose is perfect and the action is consistently amusing i wasnt as sure about the introduction by v s pritchett which claimed that there is not a trace of satire in her instead reading oconnor as a realist a fabulist and moralist i felt that she was definitely satirising a number of start up religions of which there are many im now interested in finding out if her short stories are similar to me she didnt seem stylistically so much like faulkner and mccarthy as like nathanael west and i really enjoyed it following on from webberexpats demolition job on valis in a previous tls bmaclean came to the authors defence saying his later novels have plenty to recommend them in fact id rate valis in particular as one of the very best novels ever written by an american dick was indeed striving to come to terms with experiences that he himself feared might have been borderline psychotic episodes and reinterpreted them obsessively in these last works i found that struggle as reflected through pkds very real literary talent intensely fascinating he dealt with it in books like and as standard science fiction novels in as what might perhaps be described as straight fiction and most compellingly in as experimental fictionalised autobiography not to mention his personal notes and journals some of which have now been published though i havent yet read any of this material maybe this is such a personal reaction that it cant be conveyed to other people but i would urge potential readers not to take webberexpats views as the final word on i dont deny that its a very strange piece of work and as such will not be to everyones taste but for those to whom it speaks it is an extremely powerful reading experience happily webberexpat was indeed the first to agree writing i couldnt agree more despite having absolutely hated valis anything by dick merits a close read i just found both archer and valis terribly sarcastic and tired of life and dismissive unpleasant you get the idea that the dick who wrote these books was exceptionally unpleasant completely different than the tone of anything else dick wrote such as the divine invasion or scanner darkly which
a former top drug enforcement administration official has accused congress of putting pharmaceutical company profits ahead of public health in the battle to combat the uss prescription opioid epidemic joseph rannazzisi head of the dea office responsible for preventing prescription medicine abuse until last year said drug companies and their lobbyists have a stranglehold on congress to protect a a year trade in opioid painkillers claiming the lives of nearly people a year dea reduces opioid production in us amid painkiller addiction epidemic read morerannazzisi director of the agencys office of diversion control for a decade said the drug industry engineered recent legislation limiting the deas powers to act against pharmacies endangering lives by dispensing disproportionately large numbers of opioids he also accused lobbyists who have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years to influence opioid legislation and policy of whipping up opposition to new guidelines for doctors intended to reduce the prescribing of the painkillers with a close resemblance to heroin congress would rather listen to people who had a profit motive rather than a public health and safety motive said rannazzisi as long as the industry has this stranglehold through lobbyists nothings going to change the former dea official who is a pharmacist was particularly scathing about politicians he said claim to be at the forefront of fighting the opioid epidemic while doing the bidding of the pharmaceutical industry in congress these congressmen and senators who are using this because they are up for re election its a sham the congressmen and senators who are championing this fight the ones who really believe in what theyre doing their voices are drowned out because the industry has too much influence he said charges that congress is too beholden to pharmaceutical companies have been levelled for years particularly over controversial legislation such as the law that barred the government from negotiating lower prices for drugs bought for the medicare and medicaid systems but rannazzisi says the influence on opioid policies is particularly disturbing because so many lives are being lost and he sees members of congress claiming to take the issue seriously during election campaigns but acting differently in washington thats a criticism echoed by democrats in the senate who issued a report earlier this month criticising republicans for passing sweeping legislation in july to combat addiction the comprehensive addiction and recovery act but refusing to fund it the report dying waiting for treatment likened the republican response to the opioid crisis to using a piece of chewing gum to patch a cracked dam the bill was comprehensive in name only without funding its policies are little more than empty promises the report said senator ron wyden of oregon who released the report acknowledged the influence of drug companies and their lobbyists on congress but he has also been critical of their sway over federal institutions there is no question that the powerful opioid manufacturers have a disproportionate voice a disproportionate amount of influence in these debates he said rannazzisi clashed with congress over a law passed in april reducing the deas power to suspend the licenses of distributors and pharmacists accused of dispensing excessive amounts of opioids without abiding by regulations the ensuring patient access and effective drug enforcement act was initiated by an industry funded group the healthcare distribution management association which claimed that the dea was misusing its powers to go after pharmacists and drug distributors which made minor mistakes in their paperwork rannazzisi said the agency only targeted those that were sending millions of drugs down the street several states have sued pharmaceutical distributors including west virginia which accused a dozen companies of dumping opioid pills on the state knowing many were dispensed to addicts able to get prescriptions from crooked doctors and pharmacists the new law requires the dea to warn pharmacies and distributors if they are in breach of regulations and to give them a chance to comply before licenses are withdrawn rannazzisi said that amounts to a free pass for institutional drug traffickers this doesnt ensure patient access and it doesnt help drug enforcement at all what this bill does has nothing to do with the medical process what this bill does is take away deas ability to go after a pharmacist a wholesaler manufacturer or distributor he said this was a gift a gift to the industry rannazzisi riled some members of congress by telling them they were supporting criminals with the law representative tom marino of pennsylvania said he was immensely offended by the comment and told the dea to seek collaboration with legitimate companies that want to do the right thing corporations have no conscience rannazzisi told the guardian unfortunately with my job i was the guy who had to go out and talk to families that lost kids if one of those ceos went out there and talked to anybody or if one of those ceos happened to lose a kid to this horrible horrible domestic tragedy we have id bet you theyd change their mind when you sit with a parent who cant understand why theres so many pharmaceuticals out in the illicit marketplace and why isnt the government doing anything well the dea was doing something unfortunately what were trying to do is thwarted by people who are writing laws asked why he thinks the bill passed over the objections of the dea rannazzisi gave a short derisive snort the bill passed because big pharma wanted it to pass the dea is both an enforcement agency and a regulatory agency when i was in charge what i tried to do was explain to my investigators and my agents that our job was to regulate the industry and theyre not going to like being regulated he said industry groups have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in lobbying to stave off measures to reduce prescriptions and therefore sales of opioid painkillers among the most influential drug industry groups is the pain care forum co founded by
fbi obtains warrant to search clinton aides laptopthe fbi has obtained a warrant to investigate emails found on a laptop used by clinton aide huma abedin as part of its investigation into the democratic presidential candidates use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state the move came as the senate minority leader harry reid said the fbi director james comey may have broken the hatch act which bars federal officials from using their official authority to influence an election by his decision to send a letter to republican congressional committee chairs on friday announcing the new development that showed clear intent to aid one political party over another reid said adding a claim that comey was not releasing information linking the trump campaign to russia

the emails currently roiling the us presidential campaign are part of some unknown digital collection amassed by the troublesome anthony weiner but if your purpose is to understand the clique of people who dominate washington today the emails that really matter are the ones being slowly released by wikileaks from the hacked account of hillary clintons campaign chair john podesta they are last weeks scandal in a year running over with scandals but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere scandal they are a window into the soul of the democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party answers the class to which i refer is not rising in angry protest they are by and large pretty satisfied pretty contented nobody takes road trips to exotic west virginia to see what the members of this class looks like or how they live on the contrary they are the ones for whom such stories are written this bunch doesnt have to make do with a comb over tv mountebank for a leader for this class the choices are always pretty good and this year they happen to be excellent they are the comfortable and well educated mainstay of our modern democratic party they are also the grandees of our national media the architects of our software the designers of our streets the high officials of our banking system the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or fine tune the middle east with precision droning they are they think not a class at all but rather the enlightened ones the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselves facebook twitter pinterest we learned to fight back dreamers campaign against donald trumplet us turn the magnifying glass on them for a change by sorting through the hacked personal emails of john podesta who has been a washington power broker for decades i admit that i feel uncomfortable digging through this hoard stealing someones email is a crime after all and it is outrageous that peoples personal information has been exposed since wikileaks doesnt seem to have redacted the emails in any way there is also the issue of authenticity to contend with we dont know absolutely and for sure that these emails were not tampered with by whoever stole them from john podesta the supposed authors of the messages are refusing to confirm or deny their authenticity and though they seem to be real there is a small possibility they arent with all that taken into consideration i think the wikileaks releases furnish us with an opportunity to observe the upper reaches of the american status hierarchy in all its righteousness and majesty the dramatis personae of the liberal class are all present in this amazing body of work financial innovators high achieving colleagues attempting to get jobs for their high achieving children foundation executives doing fine and noble things prizes of course and high academic achievement certain industries loom large and virtuous here hillarys ingratiating speeches to wall street are well known of course but what is remarkable is that in the party of jackson and bryan and roosevelt smiling financiers now seem to stand on every corner constantly proffering advice about this and that in one now famous email chain for example the reader can watch current us trade representative michael froman writing from a citibank email address in appear to name president obamas cabinet even before the great hope and change election was decided the far sighted innovators of silicon valley are also here in force interacting all the time with the leaders of the party of the people we watch as podesta appears to email sheryl sandberg he makes plans to visit mark zuckerberg podesta exchanges emails with an entrepreneur about an ugly race now unfolding for silicon valleys seat in congress this man in turn appears to forward to podesta the remarks of yet another silicon valley grandee who complains that one of the democratic combatants in that fight was criticizing billionaires who give to democrats specifically the miscreant dem in question was said to be spinning donors who have supported democrats john arnold and marc leder have both given to cory booker joe kennedy and others he is also attacking every billionaire that donates to congressional candidate ro khanna many whom support other democrats as well attacking billionaires in the year it was one of the correspondents appears to write madness and political malpractice of the party to allow this to continue there are wonderful things to be found in this treasure trove when you search the gilded words davos or tahoe but it is when you search vineyard on the wikileaks dump that you realize these people truly inhabit a different world from the rest of us by vineyard of course they mean marthas vineyard the ritzy vacation resort island off the coast of massachusetts where presidents clinton and obama spent most of their summer vacations the vineyard is a place for the very very rich to unwind yes but as we learn from these emails it is also a place of high idealism a land of enlightened liberal commitment far beyond anything ordinary citizens can ever achieve consider for example the email from a foundation executive to a retired mortgage banker expressing concern that hillarys image is being torn apart in the media and theres not enough effective push back the public eavesdrops as yet another financier invites podesta to a dinner featuring food produced exclusively by the islands farmers and fishermen which will be matched with specially selected wines we learn how a hillary campaign aide recommended that a policy statement appear on a certain day so that it wont get in the way of any other news we are trying to make but far enough ahead of hamptons and vineyard money events we even read the pleadings of a man who wants to be invited to a
the latest furore over hillary clintons alleged misuse of private emails when she was secretary of state in has thrown a tumultuous and unedifying us presidential election into even greater confusion with little more than a week to go before voting day the fbis unexpected and very public revelation that it is recommencing its investigation into clintons conduct may not be politically motivated but its timing certainly makes it appear that way the row represents yet another hammer blow to a democratic process whose credibility has been repeatedly challenged principally by the unscrupulous republican candidate donald trump despite this new firestorm stoked by republicans and rightwing media it remains likely that american voters will deliver a clear possibly resounding rejection of trump on november although opinion polls show the race tightening nationally and nothing is certain as a febrile campaign climaxes clinton is ahead almost everywhere that matters and she is the sane and reasonable if uninspiring choice a trump defeat will be richly deserved as we have noted previously he is not a fit and proper person to serve in the white house his behaviour during a long raucous and often embarrassingly vulgar campaign made that abundantly plain yet consigning the donald to the rubbish bin of electoral history is easier than getting rid of trumpism this is likely to take a lot longer trumps platform was based not on thought through policies and careful analysis but on prejudice grievance ignorance and fear spiced with opportunism his unexpected success in winning the nomination despite the republican establishments hostility reflected his close identification with mainly white working class and lower middle class voters who like him feel angry undervalued and alienated while public figures such as barack obama trumps failed republican rival jeb bush and clinton appear to this constituency to be remote out of touch and uncaring trumpism peddles the delusion that the candidate is on their side again and again in ohio florida and elsewhere disaffected voters claimed that only trump could be trusted to tell the truth only trump would keep his promises only trump could make america great again oblivious to paradox irony history or facts trumpism projects a distorted vision of american greatness the trump doctrine decrees that a nation built by immigrants that became the most powerful on earth is so scared of migrant and refugee hordes that it must build a mile wall with mexico trumpism holds that a great nation that incorporated religious tolerance into its groundbreaking constitution and bill of rights must now shatter its own principles and deliberately discriminate against muslims to keep itself safe as general concepts trumpism makes an enemy of the other equates nationality with homogeneity calls honest critics liars and seeks to threaten jail or harm opponents it says individualism outweighs state authority as in the unfettered right to bear firearms but not perversely in the case of a womans right to choose abortion trumpism distrusts and fears foreigners it believes free trade international treaties and economic globalisation in general are loaded dice intended to rip off americans paranoid trumpism holds that long term allies such as germany and japan get a free security ride at americas expense trumpism admires the domestic authoritarianism and international bullying of dictatorships in russia and china vladimir putin is a strong leader standing up for his people national beliefs and way of life any inconvenient truth that contradicts this or other trumpist narratives is inherently mendacious part of a web of lies and falsehoods spun by the treacherous mass media conspiring with the establishment to dupe honest citizens and dont forget trumpism cannot be fairly defeated if it loses it was cheated for sure trumpism appeals to the worst in people cynically exploiting and fanning the anger grievances and prejudices of the economically disadvantaged the embittered uneducated and plain ignorant it appeals to base instincts to lowest common denominators its is political dumbing down writ large it is underpinned by a pervasive and comprehensible insecurity engendered across the west by post economic injustice and social division the growing gulf between rich and poor and incompetent unfeeling or corrupt governance fear is the common enemy but fear is trumpisms friend this phenomenon is not confined to america european countries including britain experience variations on the theme in germany and france concern about rising immigration has boosted hardline nationalists whose appeal and disturbing ideology extend far beyond the cathartic issue of syria in greece poland austria and hungary rightwing extremists evil dehumanising ideas about refugees migrants and foreigners in general have become a commonplace of political discussion in britain ukip provides a noisy echo chamber for some of trumpisms most divisive chauvinistic and discriminatory refrains if trumpism is indeed a transnational pestilence it would be wise to look for a common remedy but first the symptoms must be accurately diagnosed and its long term effects should not be exaggerated much of the political turbulence and iconoclasm witnessed of late in america and europe is the direct result of continuing negative economic fallout from the financial crash hard times austerity cuts high unemployment and low wages are the manure in which political aberration takes root but as history shows they sometimes yet rarely lead to disaster when economies improve generally speaking so too does the quality of political discourse ensuring all people benefit equally from such an improvement is the one certain antidote to extreme politics while protest movements share characteristics and aims it is also evident that they are not all the same as each other trumpism is an infection others can catch yet it is also unique to america before panicking about the advance of the far right and far left in europe commentators in britain and elsewhere should remember that when all is said and done mainstream politicians such as angela merkel alain jupp mariano rajoy and yes hillary clinton do on the whole get elected or re elected notwithstanding greeces epic upheavals the centre does mostly

by declining to put up an official candidate to fight the richmond park byelection the conservative party has shown itself to be cynical cowardly and rational it took the decision knowing that it is not a great look for the governing party to absent itself from the contest it calculated that it would be an even more dreadful look to field someone in the colours of mrs may and see them slaughtered which is what would have happened the chances of an official tory candidate winning in this leafy patch of southwest london would have been somewhat lower than a flying saucer piloted by elvis and lord lucan landing on the head of the loch ness monster there is no constituency in the country with a more intense concentration of rage about heathrow expansion and the government has just declared that it wants to multiply the number of planes flying over its rooftops the constituency voted heavily to remain within the european union and the government is embarked on a trajectory towards one of the harder versions of brexit a candidate in the name of the tory party would have split the conservative vote enhancing the chances of the lib dems taking the seat so cowardice and cynicism combined with logic yet this does not mean that the absence of an official competitor for the tory party is an unalloyed blessing for zac goldsmith the former conservative mp who is recontesting the seat in the guise of an independent once upon a time when he had a reputation as someone who was not enslaved to his partys line he might have been convincing in that role not now only a few months ago he was the conservative candidate for mayor of london moreover he made the disastrous decision not to run on his own terms but to be the frontman for a racially charged campaign designed by the tory machine both nasty and ineffective even his sister jemima khan was moved to publicly deplore that campaign only very occasionally in british politics have we seen genuine independents in parliament one such was martin bell the former bbc correspondent famed for his white suit who ran and won as the anti sleaze candidate against neil hamilton in tatton at the election zac goldsmith is no martin bell to see how truly independent he is we only have to visit the website of the local tory party when i checked there on saturday the banner at the top of the home page still featured his mugshot alongside the tory logo the strapline read supporting zac goldsmith in the richmond park constituency the video content is a stream of images of the man who is supposedly no longer a member of their party a statement by the chairman says that the association and its resources will not play a part in this byelection before declaring that individuals who are members of the association may well wish to support zacs campaign and they are at liberty to do so it then provides an email address for joining his campaign statements from the tory party nationally have conveyed their warmest wishes for his re election should he be returned as an mp it is widely suspected and he has not denied it that he will only sit as an independent for a while before after an interval he judges to be decent rejoining the tory party if words in politics retain any meaning zac goldsmith is no independent if he is re elected it will be a message to mrs may to carry on as you are it is a big challenge to run as a genuine independent because they cant usually compete with the money logistical capacity and activist base at the disposal of organised parties i guess the money is no obstacle in this case the trustafarian mr goldsmith has exceedingly deep pockets there is an issue over how much support overt or clandestine he is going to get from the conservative party will the tory machine feed him with voter data this is a highly valuable commodity especially at a byelection when turnout is often pivotal to the outcome it seems to be a legal grey area whether the tory party can gift him resources without it counting against the byelection spending limit or whether he should be expected to pay a commercial rate and count that as a campaign expense he starts with some significant advantages he has a well known name enjoys the benefits of incumbency and won a chunky majority of more than in the first opinion poll for what its worth has him comfortably ahead in an age that expects politicians to betray their pledges when they become inconvenient he may earn credit with some voters for keeping his promise to resign and recontest the seat if his party went ahead with heathrow expansion here though is a paradox this byelection may have been triggered by the runway decision but it is essentially irrelevant to the contest his lib dem rivals are just as opposed to the expansion of heathrow and unlike mr goldsmiths party they have always been united in their conviction that it is a terrible idea the lib dems who came second in the seat in and held it until ache for the boost in media attention and party morale that they would receive from a victory vince cable suggested that he might be up for attempting a comeback there but in the end he did not apply to be the candidate it concerns some lib dems that their flagbearer sarah olney lacks the name recognition and the experience of her opponent but that has not prevented them from pulling off byelection sensations before tim farrons party seeks to cast the contest as a referendum on the tory government and particularly its trajectory towards a hard brexit this makes sense if they are to see a national revival from their near death experience at the
hillary clinton called on the fbi to immediately explain its review of a new batch of emails the agency said appeared to be pertinent to the previous investigation into her use of a private server world series trumps presidential election in two title starved midwest cities read moreaddressing reporters on friday the democratic presidential nominee said it was imperative for american voters to have all of the information with just days remaining before the presidential election the american people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately clinton said during a press conference in des moines iowa its imperative that the bureau explain this issue in question whatever it is without further delay we are days out from perhaps the most important national election of our lifetimes the fbi director james comey announced the discovery of the new emails in a letter to congress which did not offer any specifics other than to disclose that federal investigators would review whether they contained classified information in connection with an unrelated case the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation comey wrote i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation in july comey announced that the bureau had closed its investigation into clintons emails and recommended prosecutors not seek charges in the case but comey rebuked clinton and her aides for the extremely careless manner in which the emails were handled clinton told reporters that she and her team had been given no advance warning and learned of the email investigation through news reports when comeys letter was made public but seeking to mitigate the political ramifications of the announcement which was immediately seized upon by her republican opponent clinton urged the fbi to provide a clearer picture of its findings even director comey noted that this new information may not be significant so lets get it out clinton said adding she had not been contacted by the fbi in relation to the matter even director comey noted that this new information may not be significant so lets get it outhillary clintonfederal law enforcement officials said the emails were discovered on a laptop shared by anthony weiner and his estranged wife huma abedin a top aide to clinton weiner a former congressman from new york has been the subject of an unrelated investigation after it was revealed he sent illicit messages and photos to an underage girl clinton would not confirm the link to weiner and abedin who remains with her on the campaign trail stating weve heard these rumors we dont know what to believe thats why it is incumbent upon the fbi to tell us what theyre talking about right now your guess is as good as mine and i dont think thats good enough weve made it very clear that if theyre going to be sending this kind of letter that is only going originally to republican members of the house that they need to share whatever facts they claim to have with the american people she added and thats what i expect to happen the letter was sent to both republican and democratic leaders of relevant committees in congress facebook twitter pinterest trump gleefully responds to new fbi probe into clinton emailsa letter sent by comey to his employees on friday and reported by the washington post provided a glimpse into his thinking the fbi director said he felt an obligation to inform congress of the new review based on his prior testimony before federal lawmakers that the investigation into clintons emails was complete at the same time however given that we dont know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails i dont want to create a misleading impression comey wrote clinton has been dogged by questions over the use of her private email server since it was discovered weeks before she formally launched her presidential bid and polling suggests the controversy has damaged her image among voters just of americans find clinton honest and trustworthy according to a recent washington post abc poll sensing an opportunity to revive the email controversy despite the fbis vaguely worded statement the republican presidential nominee donald trump said during a rally in new hampshire on friday hillary clintons corruption is on a scale we have never seen before we must not let her take her criminal scheme into the oval office at a later rally in lisbon maine he called her use of private emails the biggest political scandal since watergate at a later rally in cedar rapids iowa he abandoned his weeks of accusing the fbi of collusion with the clinton campaign i give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong he said justice will prevail i think people a long time ago made up their minds about the emails and now they are choosing a presidenthillary clintonclinton whose lead over trump has widened in recent weeks as the real estate moguls campaign unraveled in the wake of a tape in which he bragged about being able to grope women said she believed the email issue was already factored into how the american public thinks i think people a long time ago made up their minds about the emails clinton said and now they are choosing a president the clinton campaign expressed its frustration with the fbis handling of the latest development criticizing the way in which the news was disseminated after maintaining silence in order to allow for clinton to first address the matter democrats quickly went on the offensive following her press conference with a series of statements calling on comey to come forward with more details the deliberately ambiguous nature of the directors most recent disclosure the emails could be significant or insignificant relevant or irrelevant contributes nothing to the publics understanding adam
im mid and have stalled but how do i compete for jobs with younger people i am in my and have worked all my life in several sectors but ive come to a standstill in my career where im working for the nhs as a doctors receptionist dragons wannabe doctors as everyone calls us this of course is not true but why bother to explain it will make no difference i want a change but feel like im an old person in a new just out of school and willing to learn make a difference world how do i prove that i can be the right person for the job with my expansive work history over all these teens jeremy saysdoctors receptionists form a human buffer zone between two groups of distracted people the doctors doing their best to diagnose and treat multiple patients every day usually in minute segments and trying and often failing to keep to an impossible timetable and their patients often anxious parents with health concerns that make them more than normally self centred i can sense from your letter that the daily experience of being held responsible for circumstances wholly outside of your control has taken its toll that is all too understandable but you must try very hard not to let your sense of grievance show one of the most unattractive characteristics you can reveal in an interview is world weariness bordering on bitterness and cynicism no one wants to import such an attitude into their workplace and it will count heavily against you sometimes its not a prejudice againstolder people as such that works against them in stark contrast with the bright eyed optimism of the young its the way they can exude a sense of cynicism and hopelessness you want a change but the chances are that your best bet of finding something satisfying to do will have some connection even if slight with some part of your previous expansive work history think systematically of all the jobs youve done and all the different situations youve encountered and pick a couple youd like to return to and then just as systematically list not what youd want from such positions but what you with all your experience could contribute to them thats what any application you make must positively project enthusiasm real understanding of the specific task concerned and with an emphasis on what you believe you could bring to it you cant prove that you would be the right person for a job nobody can but you can entirely legitimately present yourself as a very attractive prospect readers say if being an administrator has been your primary experience over the past years then there are a great many senior administrator positions that you could apply for highlighting your extensive experience including customer facing work and the associated managing of unexpected events under pressure etc but you sound frustrated so take some time to work on your mind set fatherlarryduff consider a larger employer as you will have access to internal vacancies secondment opportunities and staff development be proactive about your skills gaps and focus on redirecting your career with energy determination and positivity therunninggirl i am and my closest colleague at work on the same management level as i am is and has many skills i dont have and recognises that i have some skills he doesnt yet have either we learn from each other id say treat your colleagues with respect do the job to the best of your ability and show rather than tell those around you your abilities if you have talent and are assertive you should be able to shine but dont belittle those who are different from you tacitanontacit wait until you reach your want to help people and work in recruitment but am always told that im too nicei have worked in the relentless business of employment advice so long that i have become disillusioned about what transferable skills i have ive dealt with customers who have been unemployed for decades and helped those with severe disabilities or that are suicidal and in need of mental health assessments i first thought that i could go into recruitment but after about six interviews i got told by every company that i am either not hungry enough or am too nice for recruitment my current job is not giving me the hours i would like and i am looking over my shoulder every day waiting for the boss to say well this is your last day they pulled the plug i have all the experience in the world but not one qualification to my name i have been promised qualifications left right and centre but when i have asked about them the answer is usually something about them trying to get the funding where else do i fit what else can i do i love helping people but recruitment thinks im not evil enough jeremy saysa bit like the reader before you show signs of allowing your disillusionment to colour your entire approach to finding agreeable work again thats completely understandable but if it becomes apparent in your manner it can only harm your prospects i doubt if your lack of qualifications is holding you back in feedback recruiters often cite an absence of qualifications as an objective reason for rejecting an applicant when in truth the reason was more subjective where the right job is concerned your extensive experience should more than compensate for the absence of more formal training i would strongly encourage you not to abandon recruitment as a prime goal the fact youve been called for interview six times is encouraging not all companies share the same hard edged attitude to recruitment and staff management that youve so far encountered you have long experience of working with the long term unemployed the severely disabled and those with mental health problems and still you love helping people please hang on to that central truth whatever
were going close our rolling coverage of the presidential campaign with a few hours and days before election day you can read a summary of the days events here about hillary clintons subsequent remarks on the new fbi review here and about a falsehood strewn speech by donald trump in iowa here hillary clinton reacts to new fbi investigation into her emailshillary clinton demands fbi explain review of new batch of emails read more were a divided nation but we are fighting to bring us all together like here tonight theres love here theres love trump says we will make america wealthy again we will make america strong again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again god bless you with that trump closes out his rally we have the highest murder in this country in years trump says very falsely trump is distorting an fbi statistic into a false claim in september the agency reported that murders and non negligent manslaughter rose in the us by in the largest single year increase since that is not the same as saying there are more murders in the us than at any point since murders were reported in down from and highs of and there were more murders in than in the murder rate declined from to even though the population increased by a quarter during this weeks debate trump almost cited the statistic accurately saying we have an increase in murder within our cities the biggest in years the fbi figure is a national one not restricted to cities you dont hear that from these people he adds gesturing toward the press they dont want to talk about it you can read our report on it from the day of the release and before trump remarked on it through the link below murders up in biggest percentage increase since fbi data shows read more when i am elected president i am going to keep radical islamic terrorists out of this country trump says without details and yes we will build the wall and yes mexico will pay for the wall the cost of the wall is peanuts compared to what were talking about trump says nonpartisan analysts estimate the wall would cost at least the us goods trade deficit with mexico is about which is offset by the us surplus in services of if not for the open border policies of this administration trump says countless americans would be alive today the us does not have open borders and barack obama has deported more than million people a record as trump himself noted at hte final presidential debate hillary has pledged open borders trump says and supports sanctuary cities clinton does not support open borders but does support sanctuary cities and reform to let people pass background checks and pay back taxes in order to stay in the us and she supports obamas executive actions to shield some migrants such as people who were brought to the us as children like obama she supports deportation for people with criminal records we are going to have the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan this is only true if youre in the wealthiest bracket of american earners half of trumps tax cuts would go to the top of earners according to the tax policy center and most families below the top of earners would have income gains of less than trump doesnt linger long on the affordable care act though he leads the crowd in a chant of drain the swamp his new catchphrase for taking on corruption in washington forty five percent of african american children under the age of six are in poverty trump says inaccurately citing outdated data per politifact the poverty rates in question were as high as trump says they were at the depths of the great recession but they have since eased to somewhere between percent and percent depending on which income threshold you use still the rates for african american children are disproportionately high so trump has a point even if his statistics are too old and exaggerate the scale of poverty in that age group on balance we rate the statement half true another two million hispanic americans have fallen into poverty under the obama administration he says also falsely per the guardians own fact check trumps use of two million is misleading on two points he starts counting from when george w bush was still in office and from right before the financial crisis peak and he ignores that the hispanic population has grown dramatically in the eight years since then almost million hispanic people fell below the poverty line between and census poverty numbers show but the number of hispanic people in poverty has decreased during the recovery in it fell to down from in it will be very hard to leave your farm to your children and your heirs he says alluding to the so called death tax on inheritance though the estate tax actually only affects wealthy families and not the majority of americans trump then moves on to saying that hes really moving in the polls and that hes leading in many of them this is not true as election models and poll averages show i dont know whats going to happen now trump continues so much is at stake in this election when we win in november we are going to have honest government once again hillary clinton destroyed emails destroyed iphones he then says without evidence that clinton put her office up for sale to corporations and foreign donors hacked emails show concerns within the campaign that clintons husband bill was too close with various donors but no one has found evidence of a favor returned in exchange for donations to the clintons charitable foundation trump moves on to reminiscing about how last june he came down an elevator with his wife to announce his presidential campaign he abruptly segues into saying

airstrikes two years ago that it would likely mount an attack on mosul iraqs government has been encouraging civilians to flee the city for over a year the us has dropped leaflets on the city in recent weeks too to warn civilians to flee or find safety depending on the coalitions strategy for strikes and assaults trumps declaration of disaster is premature and his claim that surprise would be a more effective strategy suggests a dearth of knowledge about military strategy and risks to civilians deportationsas secretary of state hillary clinton allowed thousands of undocumented migrants i mean all of them thousands to be released because their home countries wouldnt take them back october fletcher north carolinatrump wrongly blames hillary clinton for releasing migrants when the government is in fact required to do so by law in the supreme court barred the us from holding undocumented people including those convicted of crimes for longer than six months if their native country refuses to take them back the lies trump told this week voter fraud and the election read moregeorge w bush and barack obama have followed that ruling and when countries have refused to accept deportees both presidents have declined to enact punitive measures on those countries secretaries of state can deny visas to countries that refuse to accepted convicted migrants but this action is rarely used and when it is it is usually against small countries with limited relationships with the us this summer trump correctly noted that the supreme court decision was responsible he has since turned the claim into a false one that pins blame on his opponent rather than the ruling trumps campaign eventually sent the washington post a statement saying the businessman was accusing clinton of failing to take punitive action against countries that refused us deportation requests hacked emails the emails also show her staff saying she has no core october clevelandtrump is here quoting an

investors keep a nervous eye on falling oil prices while scepticism around the opec deal was palpable no one really expected it to unravel this quickly but a procession of nations bearing their own sick notes as to why they couldnt possibly be expected to participate has shown that the unanimity on display recently was simply a front in addition sentiment has been hit by news that the trump campaign for president may not be quite as doa as previously thought when combined with the disappointing numbers from apple it is clear to see why markets remain under pressure at least oil prices

jeremy corbyn has accused theresa may of not having a brexit strategy he raised laughs at pmqs as he quoted baldrick from blackadder saying our cunning plan is to have no plan he also mocked the prime minister for her frequent insistence that brexit means brexit in response may said corbyn was trying to say that brexit means something completely different may has been criticised for refusing to prioritise membership of the single market when britain leaves the eu after the emergence of a leaked tape from before the referendum in which she warned companies would leave if the uk pulls out opposition politicians said her comments to goldman sachs bankers showed may really believed the uk was better off in the single market even though she has signalled controls on immigration are the most important thing to secure from a brexit deal corbyn faced criticism from some commentators for not raising the recording at pmqs labour appears set to ignore calls not to put forward a candidate to stand against zac goldsmith in the richmond park byelection by three of its frontbenchers clive lewis lisa nandy and jonathan reynolds said labour could thereby help the the lib dems kick out goldsmith who they criticised for his pro brexit stance and the divisive campaign he ran against sadiq khan during the london mayoral election compass also said there should be a progressive alliance to get rid of goldsmith the green party hinted that it may not contest the seat lib dem leader tim farron said the byelection tim farron represented an an opportunity to send a message to may over her hard brexit strategy and change the direction of the country he pitched his party as the only clear electable alternative to goldsmith which was both able to stop heathrows third runway being built and stop may taking the uk down an extreme path the president of the european parliament martin schulz has referred the altercation earlier this month between ukip meps steven woolfe and mike hookem to french police the incident triggered by the revelation that woolfe had considered defecting to the conservatives left him in a serious condition in hospital and he subsequently quit the party hookem has strongly denied landing a blow the conservative former minister nick boles has said that he is battling against cancer for a second time he fought off the disease nine years ago the former skills minister who managed michael goves failed tory leadership bid quit the government when theresa may won the contest and took over as prime minister michael russell the scottish governments brexit minister has been updating holyrood this afternoon on his work including further detail from mondays meeting of the devolved leaders at downing street it would be fair to say that the mood remains bullish with russell telling msps that the talks had made it clearer than ever that there is at present no coherent uk plan he went on but there has to be a scottish plan and ideally that should be one that is good for the uk too alongside our efforts to influence the united kingdom to adopt a soft brexit with continued membership of the single market the scottish government will bring forward our own detailed proposals to protect scotlands interests by the end of this year russell said that a key part of these proposals would be setting out ways in which scotland can remain in the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves he also reported that on a visit to brussels last week he had met guy verhofstadt part of the european parliaments brexit negotiating team who much to the scottish governments delight is previously on record saying if scotland decides to leave the uk to be an independent state and they decide to be part of the eu i think there is no big obstacle to do that the difficulties in concluding an eu canada trade deal show the importance of britain reaching an agreement over its future relationship with the eu before it leaves the bloc international trade secretary liam fox has said reuters reports that fox told the commons european scrutiny committee that the seven years it has taken to reach the ceta deal and the delays in signing it after it was rejected by a belgian regional authority showed the difficulty of doing a deal with such a large number of partners article of the eus lisbon treaty allows for an initial two year period of divorce talks before britain leaves the bloc any agreement reached in that time would not be subject to the same level of vetos as a free trade agreement he said that sort of procedure would only be undertaken were we to leave the european union after our article period without any agreement whatsoever and were looking to seek a new fta from outside its in the interests quite clearly following this experience for all concerned to minimise any sort of economic trade and political disruption to ensure thats done with the minimum of fuss staying with the richmond park byelection the lib dem leader tim farron has said it represents an an opportunity to send a message to theresa may over her hard brexit strategy and change the direction of the country the press association reports speaking on richmond green directly below the heathrow flight path farron pitched his party as the only clear electable alternative to goldsmith on the face of it the lib dems have a mountain to climb goldsmith held the south west london constituency with an increased majority of more than in last years general election and his stand on heathrow is likely to be highly popular locally but heartened by a strong performance in david camerons former constituency of witney last week farron said his party were determined to take the fight to goldsmith he said we start here as second favourites theres no two ways about it theres a big mountain
how is everyone doing ready for november yet tonight i was asked to speak about a vision for the next hundred years of reproductive choice and justice its such a wonderful frame to think about what a feminist future might look like but i bet like a lot of you its hard to imagine what the next hundred years will look like when so much of that for women especially will depend on what happens in just days there is no overstating how important this election is its not just about the next four or eight years this decision is about sending a message about who we are as a country and setting a very particular course for the women who live here well look back on this time as a watershed moment a moment that could in fact shape the next hundred years of womens rights but first i want to share a personal story a little over six years ago i was pregnant with my daughter layla and when i was weeks pregnant i got incredibly ill i developed pre eclampsia which some of you might know is dangerously high blood pressure during pregnancy i was admitted to the hospital and within just a few days i developed another complication called hellp syndrome the short version being my liver was in danger of failing and i was in danger of dying if my daughter was not born i had an emergency c section and layla was born weighing she stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first two months of her life undergoing medical interventions to save and protect her that to this day i try to avoid thinking about but i was lucky and she was lucky and today shes a wonderful healthy six year old and i feel grateful for that every day i share this story often because this was something in my life that changed me forever that shaped who i am today and when i think about this moment what i think about most often is how fortunate i was that i got sick far enough along in my pregnancy that i wasnt faced with the reality of needing an abortion to save my life and when i think about those days in the hospital the fear the urgency the confusion the stress the idea that the government could ever become involved in my lifes most pivotal moment it horrifies me so one thing i want for the next hundred years i want for no person ever to fear that their most personal life choices will be made by someone else i want for no woman ever to be afraid that her scariest life moment will be made even more difficult and traumatic by government interference in the next hundred years i want to see every woman be free from the fear that her body is not really her own and thats why i want to talk about this election tonight because thats whats at stake never before in american politics have womens bodies been so front and center in the national conversation and so at risk we are choosing between a candidate who has spent her political career fighting for reproductive rights and a candidate who says that women who have abortions need to be punished a candidate who said this week in the final debate unequivocally that she will defend planned parenthood and a candidate who promised to defund it a choice between a person who has spent her life in public service and a braggadocious businessman who rips off his workers and perhaps most tellingly were making a decision between a woman who has said that womens rights are human rights and a man who says if you want to you can just grab women by the pussy theres a feminist rallying cry online right now that i like a lot and it says november pussy grabs back now i know that so much has been made of that comment and the ensuing allegations against trump by multiple women that he did just what he bragged about doing on that tape and while some people may not see the link between sexual assault and reproductive rights those of us here in this room know better we know that there is a direct connection between those who think they can touch womens bodies without permission and those who think they can legislate our bodies reproductive rights and justice has always been about a fundamental respect or in this case disrespect of womens bodily integrity and autonomy either our bodies are our own or theyre not and make no mistake the conversation that were having right now about groping is not just salacious media fodder the way we come out of this moment the direction our culture shifts because of it will absolutely determine womens rights in the future we are witnessing a moment where our country could move backwards back to a place where boys will be boys and men will make decisions for women or towards a future where our culture and politics understand and respect women as autonomous full human beings those are the two paths right now im optimistic that were on the right one the one that brings us to the feminist future all of us in this room have been waiting for when trump said he wanted to punish women for having abortions there was outrage and he had to walk back those comments but more importantly pro choice activists and organizations like planned parenthood were there to point out that while other politicians may not say they want women to be punished thats exactly what would happen if abortion were made illegal and in fact what has already happened to women like purvi patel who was put in prison for inducing her own abortion in indiana our feminist future has no place for criminalizing women who decide if and when to parent when
donald trump photograph mark wallheiser getty imagesdonald trump said today that hillary clintons plan for syria would lead to world war three because of the potential for conflict with military forces from nuclear armed russia in an interview focused largely on foreign policy the republican presidential nominee said defeating islamic state was a higher priority than persuading than syrian president bashar al assad to step down playing down a long held goal of us policy trump questioned how his democratic opponent would negotiate with russias president vladimir putin after having demonized him blamed barack obama for a downturn in us relations with the philippines under its new president rodrigo duterte bemoaned a lack of republican unity behind his candidacy and said he would easily win the election if the party leaders supported him if we had party unity we couldnt lose this election to hillary clinton trump said as they go to the polls in a historic presidential election more than six in americans say neither major political party represents their views any longer a survey has found dissatisfaction with both democrats and republicans has risen sharply since when less than half held that neither reflected their opinions according to research by the public religion research institute a former aide to republican governor chris christie reiterated today that a now infamous email she sent saying time for some traffic problems near the george washington bridge in referred to a traffic study not a political retaliation plot trump implied today that he would be willing to fight the sitting vice president joe biden behind a barn speaking at a rally in tallahassee florida almost precisely two weeks to the minute to when polls close there on election day trump said of a fist fight between the two id love that the year old republican nominee for president also labeled the vice president mr tough guy and said of beating up the year old biden some things in life you could really love doing fox news host megyn kelly and former house speaker newt gingrich engaged in an aggressive argument tonight over lingering questions regarding donald trumps treatment of women and how it might affect him in the coming presidential election with gingrich accusing kelly of bias against trump and kelly urging gingrich to take your anger issues and spend some time working on them im sick and tired of people like you using language thats inflammatory thats not true gingrich shouted i think that is exactly the bias that people are upset by i think that your defensiveness on this may speak volumes sir kelly deadpanned what i said is if donald trump is a sexual predator then its a big story what we saw on that tape was trump himself saying that he likes to grab women by the genitals and kiss them against their will kelly continued referring to a tape that showed trump bragging about being able to sexually assault women with impunity because of his fame then we saw ten women come forward after he actually denied doing it at a debate to say that was untrue he did it to me he did it to me he did it to me we saw it with reporters people who had worked with him people from apprentice and so on and so forth he denies it it all which is his right we dont know what the truth is my point to you is as a media story we dont get to say the ten women are lying kelly continued we have to cover that story sir gingrich dismissed kellys assertion and decried the amount of focus paid on trumps sexual assault accusations you are fascinated with sex and you dont care about public policy gingrich responded and thats what i get out of watching you tonight im not fascinated by sex but i am fascinated by protection of women and understanding what were getting in the oval office kelly retorted its not about me its about the women and men of america and the poll numbers show us that the women of america in particular are very concerned about these allegations the former speaker of the house of representatives responded by daring kelly to call former president bill clinton a sexual predator which kelly ignored were gonna have to leave it at that and you can take your anger issues and spend some time working on them mister speaker kelly concluded and you too gingrich responded meekly the trump campaign swiftly responded deeming gingrichs appearance a success dan scavino jr newtgingrich just destroyed megynkelly shows she is totally biased against mr trump not very smart mr trump has long known october hillary clintons campaign has released yet another spanish language advertisement in ruby red arizona although theres no word yet whether clinton plans on visiting the grand canyon state herself families are complicated malik obama all i know is that my brother has done nothing for the kenyan side of his family i wonder if we are related sometimes october scott adams the author behind the once popular dilbert cartoons has published a blog post in which he offers his qualified support of donald trump but vows to assist in his assassination if trump does anything that looks even slightly hitler ish in office in a post titled the crook versus the monster adams argues that the public conception of trump as a monster are misguided but that if they prove accurate adams vows to join the resistance movement and help kill him calling it an easy promise to make adams continues i hope my fellow citizens would use their second amendment rights to rise up and help me kill any hitler type person who rose to the top job in this country no matter who it is what could be a more suitable ending to this awful campaign than a fistfight between donald trump and joe biden donald trump photograph jonathan ernst
