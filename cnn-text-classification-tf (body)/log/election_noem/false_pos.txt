monkeyball is on the steep decline people would rather watch a super violent show about a masculine white man destroying his enemies deadline even after one of the bloodiest and darkest episodes in the amc series history the walking dead really does have something to celebrate about its season debut and were not talking a fantasy sequence with million watching the october premiere to discover who negan would kill and million among adults for an rating the zombie apocalypse blockbuster had a very good night as the no show on broadcast and cable how good well twd knocked the stuffing out of the often dominating sunday night football demo wise this weekend left the season debut of big heavy hitter empire season in the dust and solidly bested its own season premiere last year add to that the show based on the robert kirkman comics basically matched its all time series highs of the season opener of october in both viewers and the demo and with maybe a slightly aging fanbase after all these years pile on that the season opener set a series high among adults making it clear that the walking dead is alive and kicking at this point deep into its run when most other shows are doa nfl ratings are collapsing completely awful announcing the nfls downturn in ratings has been the dominant sports media storyline of the fall of and unfortunately for the league its not getting any better especially when it comes to the primetime windows and while there are a number of factors at play in whats ailing the nfl right now the quality of the primetime games isnt helping in spite of featuring the games most storied rivalry in bears packers thursday night football was down versus last year the abysmal tie between the cardinals and seahawks was unsurprisingly down from last year proving that not all close games are guaranteed to drive viewership the monday night football matchup between houston and denver was also uninspiring and down from last year fox sports exec michael mulvihill has been tweeting out numbers throughout the season and through seven weeks now its obvious that fox and cbs coverage on sunday afternoons are being affected much less by the nfls ratings challenges than in primetime with all three primetime windows dropping this week tnf snf and mnf are all down at least in viewership from this time a year ago this is a massive drop massive though the kike media is coming up with all sorts of excuses none of them are looking at the most obvious thing that has changed in america over the last couple of years and that is race relations sportball americans aka the blacks have become insanely hostile toward the white population of this country so it makes absolute sense that people are now less interested in watching these vicious apes throw balls at one another nigga ah be botta frow dis ball over der dat oder nigga botta be catch dis ball din he gunna run ober der nigga nigga nigga fugg wite ppl muffugguh ah keel u nigga fu shii t the colin kaepernick hate protest against america itself which many of his fellow apes have joined in certainly isnt helping the situation any yes mr grossman please please take it to the next level i simply cannot express to you how much i want you to do exactly that as i have always said racial tension is good for the white movement polarization is always good for revolutionaries black lives matter is doing our work for us when white people see blacks rioting and attacking whites when they witness this hateful rage against them it triggers an instinctive tribalist reaction hence collapsing monkeyball ratings for their part jews are totally incapable of understanding the concept of going too far as long as there is room to push it further they will keep pushing it further and they are oblivious to potential backlash we see this with the sexual liberation some people would have chilled out once gay marriage was solidified but they moved on to trannies and now theyre headed for pedophilia because we are the underdogs in this race war against the kikes it is necessary to always understand and exploit their weaknesses they biggest weakness is this incapacity to stop pushing everything as far as it can be pushed this is why they were kicked out of over european nations territories and why they will eventually be rounded up and expelled from the united states of america look for rap music sales to drop next you can take that prediction to the bank the walking dead as implicit fascist propaganda okay so nobody liked seeing rick f that n last season i get that at the end of season i was working on a very long essay about the show and then ended up canning it because i knew there would be outrage over the season six sex act but even with that element the walking dead remains a type of implicit fascist propaganda due to the themes themselves it is almost like they have to include these multicultural elements in order to avoid open accusations of fascism the setting is one of survivalism during a zombie apocalypse where the only way to survive and protect your people is to be ruthless and the hero who began the show as a bright faced golden boy trying to help everyone is now an unrepentant mass murderer who will kill anyone who messes with his people if you ignore the racial element the show is utterly fascist as it denies the concept that jews have pushed in their media since they founded hollywood that the ends never justify the means and unrepentantly shows its hero a masculine blue eyed white male justifying the most violent of means to the end of protecting his people this is i believe why the show has been so overwhelmingly popular it
legal insurrection by leslie eastman about one year ago gov jerry brown signed the states assisted suicide bill into law it fully went into effect this june with the opening of the first clinic while there is no data on the number of california assisted suicides oregon recorded over last year as part of their legalized physician assisted death program now one young mother says her insurance company denied her coverage for chemotherapy treatment after originally agreeing to provide the fiscal support for it but indicated it would be willing to pay for assisted suicide instead stephanie packer a wife and mother of four who was diagnosed with a terminal form of scleroderma said her insurance company initially indicated it would pay for her to switch to a different chemotherapy drug at the recommendation of her doctors but shortly after californias end of life option act which authorizes physicians to diagnose a life ending dose of medication to patients with a prognosis of six months or less to live went into effect ms packers insurance company had a change of heart and when the law was passed it was a week later i received a letter in the mail saying they were going to deny coverage for the chemotherapy that we were asking for ms packer said she said she called her insurance company to find out why her coverage had been denied on the call she also asked whether suicide pills were covered under her plan and she says yes we do provide that to our patients and you would only have to pay for the medication ms packer said packer attends meetings with others suffering from terminal illnesses she indicates that the tone of those meetings have changed since the california assisted suicide law was enacted as soon as this law was passed and you see it everywhere when these laws are passed patients fighting for a longer life end up getting denied treatment because this will always be the cheapest option packer attends a support group for terminally ill patients she said legally sanctioned suicide has changed the tone of the meetings which used to be positive and encouraging with patients under new societal pressure to kill themselves she said meetings became negative and it started consuming people and then they said you know what i wish i could just end it concerned about the enormous potential for abuse a the national organization patients rights action fund has created a website for patients like packer the online resource offers a place for patients family members concerned friends to report possible coercion failure to identify depression or other patient mental health concerns and complications that arise from the overdose prescription or other aspects of the assisted suicide process were you or someone you know pressured to use assisted suicide misleadingly known as death with dignity or aid in dying did you or a loved one have a chronic life threatening illness and personal circumstances where you they felt like suicide or assisted suicide was your only option did a doctor advise you or someone you know of a prognosis of months or less that was wrong by months years or even decades were you or a loved one denied coverage for a life sustaining treatment or medication by your hmo or insurance company during his gettysburg address describing the first days in office if he is elected president donald trump indicated he would work to replace obamcare with health savings accounts remove barriers to purchasing health insurance across state lines allow states to manage medicaid funds and speed up drug approval inside the food and drug administration however his election would be too late help many terminally ill californians who are now experiencing the unintended but quite predictable consequence of yet another feel good progressive policy
the presidential election has left the country more divided than ever as many continue to celebrate donald trumps victory others are fighting their way through the five stages of grief surrounding hillary clintons defeat and president obamas departure as much as some would wish otherwise many of the wars that have stormed social media have extended through families and friendships with thanksgiving just a couple of days away people are concerned that opposing voters may find it difficult to enjoy a long meal together however politics should not ruin thanksgiving there is always at least one person who arrives at the family gathering ready to talk politics and express why their view is the right one these are the worst kind of guests politics should be the uninvited guest to thanksgiving festivities as people from around the country celebrate the many reasons to be thankful this year anyone that brings up politics over thanksgiving dinner with an aim of convincing another or adding insult to injury should be dismissed and possibly not invited back president elect trump has done many distasteful things throughout the recent campaign but ruining thanksgiving should not be one of them families work hard to set up the perfect holiday gathering so they can rehash old stories bond with the newest additions watch their favorite football team win or lose and celebrate life over a table filled with favorite foods politics should not ruin thanksgiving instead of a deadly spiral redirect the conversation back to what really matters truth is without the likes of a tumultuous election season holidays have the potential to produce large amounts of anxiety relatives and friends near and far all gathered into one location hashing out competitive family updates can be stressful enough add some spiked cider to that mix and it becomes a recipe for a potential holiday meltdown so there is no need for politics to ruin thanksgiving dinner families should remain a family long after trump takes the oval office so politics should not accompany the turkey at the dinner table somewhere down the track attendees will be split along bipartisan lines instead of joining in why not bow out before blowing up more than politics preserving important relationships should be the focal point post election emotions have already complicated life as many americans have known it navigating thanksgiving dinner should not be an added stress as such many who are already bruised by the election are now dreading what should be an entertaining and eventful family gathering of food and fellowship this is a time for expressing thanks while making new memories not overshadowed by the results of a turbulent electoral season politics should not ruin what has been noted as one of americas favorite holidays with multiple personalities and beliefs at the dinner table the only safe way to handle politics at thanksgiving dinner is by avoiding it not only is it neither the time nor the place but avoidance protects everyones health and sanity the holidays intent is to bring people together peacefully and to celebrate this great countrys resiliency and diversity mercury news families dread holiday after trumps election wintop image courtesy of bart flickr licenseinline image courtesy of louish pixel flickr licensefeatured image courtesy of freaktography flickr license family holiday stress thanksgiving
the dallas cowboys seem to be doing well this season ezekiel elliot set a new record for the most rushing yards over tony dorsett for the franchise record quarterback dak prescott threw over yards and completed percent of his passes dorsett who had held the record since and helped the cowboys win superbowl xii was present to congratulate elliot dorsett made history with yards rushing of which resulted in touchdowns and he managed this feat in carries he also added almost receptions for yards with one resulting in a touchdown sunday nov elliott was a big part of the cowboys win over the baltimore ravens who did not make it easy for the dallas based team he came into the game two yards shy of tieing dorsetts record which he did on his opening run of the game as the no pick in the draft and the only year old rookie makes his accomplishment that much more amazing backup quarterback prescott was sent in to play for tony romo who voluntarily stepped down for the good of the team prescott is only two years older than elliott the ravens are one of the top defensive teams in the league the cowboys win over the ravens proves they can win when they are having a stroke of bad luck winning nine consecutive games then defeating a team they have not been able to beat gave over fans who were in attendance at the game something to smile about especially after a controversial election that left america divided football fans all over can rejoice in this accomplishment however this does not mean the team is unbeatable the best team dallas has faced this season is the new york giants who gave them their only loss and currently hold a record of the dallas based team has a winning record against teams playing under and only one win against a team above nevertheless it is exciting to see a team approaching the playoffs first place in their division with a record the finest game they played all season was against pittsburgh which they pulled out a win because of some superb moves from elliot the rest of their wins are due to the schedule of teams not exactly playing to their best ability the cowboys did what was needed by beating the teams they were capable of and holding their own against the teams that were equal to them they played well and earned their nine consecutive wins there are six games left in the season including a rematch with the giants at the meadowlands stadium when they played baltimore they managed to control the clock and forced their opponent to use their timeouts the cowboys pulled off their ninth consecutive win against a team which has proven to be one of their toughest opponents the ravens could not hold on in sundays game and took a loss against a team they had conquered many times the momentum is with dallas for an exciting end to the seasonfox sports the dallas cowboys are beatableespn ezekiel elliott sets cowboys rookie record for rushing yards in a seasondallascowboys com game recap cowboys beat ravens to win ninth straighttop and feature image courtesy of keith allisons flickr page creative commons license dak prescott dallas ezekiel elliott
by on fri oct at pm as megyn kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her share on twitter print this post earlier this week friday fox follies under the assumption the explosive and bizarre battle between megyn kelly and newt gingrich would be this weeks lede i had already tricked up an opening paragraph in case you missed it thats when he got personal accused her of being obsessed by sex and she told him that he should work on his anger issues this weeks column would have been about how the fox audience continues to splinter as they take sides in the presidential election the nyt calls em megyn moments i call them fissures in what had been assumed to be the bedrock foundation of the fox news channel its unthinking audience then came word that rupert murdoch was playing hardball as kellys contract negotiations break out into the open that paragraph lovingly crafted went out the window but lets see what this fight was about because heat is always better than light for ratings as trump congratulates newt gingrich for getting his butt kicked by megyn kelly watch as kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her her contract expires next year and rupie opened up to the wall street journal of which he is owner to partially cajole kelly and partially to threaten her into extending her contract million in contract talks with fox news if they are going to make a network that is going to be a post ailes post trump it will be around megyn kelly chris wallace and shep smith and they are going to have to throw hannity and oreilly overboard said andrew tyndall a television news consultant of other hosts at the network that isnt going to happen promised mr murdoch were not changing direction that would be business suicide he said mr oreillys contract is also up at the end of next year and mr murdoch said were going to want bill to stay with us mr hannitys contract isnt up until ms kelly has forged close ties to mr murdochs sons particularly lachlan murdoch who is co executive chairman of fox and has taken an active role in contract talks people close to the situation said fox would like to settle this before the election and before kellys book is released both of which could only strengthen her position in the negotiations if all goes well from the the power of megyn kellys feminismeven if she doesnt call it that by the daily beasts tim teeman imagine then her mix of satisfaction and maybe ennui as she scrolled across some of the praise ridden screeds out today how megyn kelly became an improbable feminist icon megyn kelly has become the biggest example of white feminism at work and aw crapheres proof that megyn kelly is kind of a feminist role model now note the grudging headlines because of kellys employer and because she has not fought the good feminist fight in a conventional left wing context throughout her career to date the f word mantle is being conferred upon her with something of a scowl this in itself reveals a kind of blinkeredness on the part of kellys critics it is perfectly possible to work for a right facing institution and not be percent right wing yourself or spout the prevailing dogma of the tv station you work for aside from the fact that when she tilts right she tends to tilt alt right the biggest knock on kelly is that shes too hard edged marshall mcluhan spoke of the medium cool of tee vee but kelly comes across as the opposite of warm and fuzzy this makes her less attractive to other networks shes hoping to change that impression when she co hosts live with kelly ripa the morning after the election think of her as a designated hitter trying to knock murdochs hardball right out of the park still watters still a few weeks back fff reported on a racist watters world in which the white privileged pencil necked geek made fun of asians this week asian american groups meet with fox news personnel over awful jesse watters segment paul cheung president of aaja told the erik wemple blog that the meeting was productive i think they heard what the communitys reactions are he said of the session at new yorks museum of chinese in america approximately asian american groups and allies have signed an open letter to fox news regarding the unfortunate episode said cheung ron kim a new york state assemblyman in attendance told this blog that a representative from the oreilly factor and a senior representative from the news side of the channel attended the meeting together they played a good cop bad cop routine said kim the gentleman from oreillys show was defending what they were doing and trying to explain that this is a part of the opinion section of fox news and sometimes edgy humor can go too far said kim once again the specter of fox newss vaunted news opinion divide presents itself as weve noted before this is a convention borrowed from the newspaper industry to justify fox news hosts such as sean hannity openly campaigning for donald trump steve doocy of the morning show fox friends spreading harmful innuendo into the public square and oreilly allowing his protege to spread racist stereotypes all about chinatown
chicago cubs first baseman anthony rizzo stepped up to the microphone during the world series rally in grant park and choked up as he spoke about what it meant to be able to be on a team with the year old catcher david ross who was a mentor to him rizzo ross and center fielder dexter fowler stood shoulder to shoulder singing that silly jingle the one that goes go cubs go go cubs go hey chicago whaddya say cubs are gonna win today it all really hit home for me as a cubs fan life is full of things that bring us joy but carry unsavory aspects to them the cubs team is owned by tom ricketts a man who donated million to donald trump and bears a frightening resemblance to ted cruz so much that one might think ricketts was his brother the cubs also signed aroldis chapman a closer who served a game suspension this year for domestic abuse cubs executives and city officials are responsible for some pretty rapid gentrification in the area of wrigleyville with that said almost all of the cubs players had fun with each other and never let the pressures of fan fueled folklore around curses defeat them that made the postseason truly blissful this is where i wrote thomas g my fathers name on the wall i had to squeeze it in near the brick sidewalk i live about seven blocks from wrigley field i went down there multiple times in the past week the day after they won i went down to wrigley field to write my fathers name on the stadium wall and join thousands of other cubs fans in paying tribute to family who died before they could see the cubs win a world series in the immediate hours after their sweet victory i took my life into my own hands and went down to the area around clark and addison to snap a photo of the stadium sign with world series champions emblazoned on it on sunday right before game down in the series i stood outside the friendly confines and said to myselfand to my father even though i dont really believe in this kind of stuff this was going to be the game where they turned it all around that they could still come back also i bought a copy of the chicago sun times after each game even the editions with the devastating headlines on game and game because it was important to have the full story i can now put those papers side by side and forever see the journey the chicago cubs took and relive the heart wrenching and euphoric moments that took place this seismic sports eventending the longest championship drought in american sports historygripped me like so many other americans it taught me once again the importance of slowing down life and reveling in these kind of experiences which i know is easy for me to say i did not have a boss who told me i had to work a night shift or else i would be fired i did not have to worry about what i was going to do to feed my children or prevent my home from being foreclosed i did not have to be concerned about an array of disadvantages people should not have to confront on a daily basis but all too often we just go go go and lose sight of those little things that can make us feel a bit more content in life or we reject slowing down to appreciate something amazing that magnificently disrupts our routine additionally during an election that has smothered and shaken many of us the perfect antidote was watching this team play baseball players like rizzo let their guard down and made themselves vulnerable in front of us they were on a world stage where they perhaps may have thought they needed to maintain a level of toughness or masculinity rizzo on the other hand as he now famously told ross during game was an emotional wreck and he did not seem to be ashamed of making that confession many of us were emotional wrecks everyone watching this series felt like emotional wrecks at some point not everyone watched all moments of the games unless you happened to be in the select group of people that possibly had tickets to all the games ill never forget how ross told rizzo it was only going to get worse in the inning he was right the cleveland indians tied the game in the acrobatic second baseman javier baez had a mishap with a bunt that could have been costly in the and fans had to bow their heads and hope chapman would not make a mistake even though manager joe maddon clearly overworked him the past few games statue outside wrigley field of ernie banks the weather went from great to pouring rain there was a delay that delay gave the team a kind of gift a bit of a halftime to find their composure to go out and win in the inning so rizzo the emotional wreck stepped up to the microphone during the rally and gave this very real and human tribute to a mentor grandpa ross who played his last game on november gramps and i sat down a few years ago in an offseason before his last season with boston he was a free agent and we just talked rizzo shared we had the same agent were talking and i say to my agent man this is what the chicago cubs need he is exactly what we need to bring everything together obviously a lot of pieces came through with that but he taught myself personally how to become a real winner hes like a brother to me fighting back tears rizzo continued hes taught me a lot in lifeon the field off the field how to be a better person im forever grateful
by november we got the very sad news today nov that dave mcgowan passed away from cancer at p m truth and shadows we missed the anniversary of mcgowans death which was yesterday but he was one helluva a writer exposing in brief books thedirected history of the modern era so well remember him today weve written about him before here he died of an extremely aggressive form of lung cancer which made some of his fans speculate that hed actually been assassinated unfortunately much of daves work is no long freely available on the net though some is available here the following is daves last post here from his blog center for an informed america just nine weeks ago on april i presented a lengthy video deconstruction of the boston marathon incident through the caravan to midnight radio show podcast about a week later the nearly four hour video presentation was uploaded to youtube not long after that someone using the username phoenix archangel posted an interesting comment john wells the host of the show always signs off with some of the best advice ever speaking of advice this david mcgowan fella really ought to quit smoking with all the elitist feathers hes ruffling hes likely to come down with a spontaneous case of hitherto undiagnosed stage inoperable pancreatic cancer mr ms archangel wasnt too far off though ive been told that its actually incurable small cell lung cancer that has already spread to my liver and bones and no thats unfortunately not a joke its my new reality as of just a few short weeks ago when my entire world was turned upside down and i suddenly found myself being admitted to the oncology ward at glendale adventist medical center four days later i was beginning my first round of chemotherapy infusions the second round begins tomorrow on monday june more from truth and shadows the first thing i read from mcgowan was his series on the apollo moon missions called wagging the moondoggie this amazing part series is what finally convinced me that the moon landings never took place what struck me was not only his insight but his wit very dry which is the best kind in addition to what became a whole series on i was also blown away by series on the boston marathon bombing and dark side of the music scene in laurel canyon in the other books he has written include programmed to kill understanding the f word american fascism and the politics of illusion and derailing democracy the america the media dont want you to see we ran into mcgowans work very early in the when we were researching an article on the peak oil hoax at the time libertarian analysis was mostly theoretical but we were trying to focus on a synthesis between free market theory and directed history we could hardly believe mcgowans comments on peak oil without apparently a deep background in austrian free market economics he nonetheless fully grasped the idiocy of asserting that the modern world was running out of oil and that since alternatives were not going to be developed in a timely manner the only solution was drastic government action he even mentioned abiotic oil see here as we recall when we read his short books we were further impressed mcgowan moved far beyond simplistic assertions of conspiracy to show you clearly how modern history seemed to work for us the book on the mid laurel canyon music scene here was perhaps the most brilliant who knew that jimi hendrix was in the military here prior to becoming a rock star who knew that many of the musical stars of the early to the mid were somehow gathered together in laurel canyon prior to their fame here and that many or most had military ties or came from military families mcgowan didnt state everything some things he left up to you but it was hard to come away from his books without understanding his main point that society was directed purposefully from above and that before the internet you would live your entire life unknowingly according to someone elses plan his short book about laurel canyon not only shows how directed history operates it makes the point resonantly that society and even culture can be shifted according to elite strategies in other words in not very many pages it shows how western social manipulation actually works likely it has worked this way for thousands of years before mcgowan it was easy to believe that social manipulation must inevitably be a clumsy affair imposed brutally as it was in the ussr mcgowan presents ways cultural reconfiguration can take place secretly and powerfully without anyone but a handful knowing it is happening for instance the standard story of the is that young people got upset over the war and in the process of protesting quickly created an entire counterculture that opposed much of what corporate america stood for the trouble with the counterculture was that it never adequately defined the real problem nor did it fully explain the solution the hippie ethos blamed much of what was wrong with america on corporate greed and the like this led to the conclusion that government itself could rectify what was wrong but both modern corporations and todays massive governments are the result of monopoly force wielded behind the scenes in reality as mcgowan showed the movement was likely painstakingly created to generate certain results mostly by reinforcing social chaos thus blaming problems on corporations and looking to government for solutions was only to be expected though it was wrongheaded on numerous levels as we know today from internet information government is seemingly supported by a handful of unfathomably rich individuals those who likely control central banking to provide solutions that inevitably generate more problems not less we know from austrian economics that almost every law and regulation is surely a price fix that must drain prosperity from society
email the arizona market is the poster child for the problems the obamacare exchanges are experiencing nationally milliman inc actuary tom snook told the wall street journal it would be difficult to argue with snooks contention while individual insurance premiums are rising by an average of percent across the country next year arizonas premiums are set to grow by double or triple that with some locales experiencing rate hikes topping percent meanwhile for all intents and purposes arizonans have but one insurance carrier from whom to purchase coverage and one county nearly ended up with no carriers at all it wasnt supposed to turn out like this arizona was originally the poster child for the affordable care acts success the first year the aca exchanges opened for business the state had eight insurers offering a wide variety of plans at low prices in part because of an expectation that the federal government would bail them out if they suffered losses a society of actuaries report suggested that the arizona individual insurance market could more than double growing to consumers with more than of them buying through the exchange wrote the journal the health care costs of the newer customer base would be around higher than the old one it suggested instead as has been the case throughout the nation americans made health insurance decisions based on their own needs rather than following the best laid plans of politicians and bureaucrats those with pre existing conditions took advantage of the acas mandates that insurers cover them at rates comparable to those of their healthy neighbors while those neighbors balked at buying coverage that was more expensive and less generous than they desired the result enrollment fell well below expectations with only people buying exchange plans this year while the cost of covering those enrollees was vastly greater than expected around higher on average than individual members before the health law jeff stelnik senior vice president of blue cross blue shield of arizona told the journal to make matters worse the bailouts never came through the federal risk corridor program was supposed to transfer profits from successful insurers to unsuccessful ones but so few insurers made money on the exchanges that the program could only cover percent of losses congress refused to make up the difference from general revenues in arizona as elsewhere this could only have one outcome fewer insurers and higher premiums although the number of insurers increased to in it returned to eight last year insurers were forced to raise rates each year blue cross blue shield hiked premiums by percent in but it still wasnt enough to break even let alone turn a profit the states obamacare co op went under in and major insurers began pulling out of the state en masse this year unitedhealth group and aetna left entirely blue cross blue shield and health net both announced they would exit the exchanges in maricopa county home of phoenix and pinal county that in turn would have left pinal county without a single exchange insurer but after state and federal regulators expressed their concern for pinal residents blue cross decided to remain in pinal county after all stelnik told the journal for every arizona county will have only one insurer on its exchange save for pima county home to tucson which will have two however according to the new york times only health net is offering a full range of plans in pima county while blue cross is solely selling catastrophic plans for people under considering that the aca also allows people to remain on their parents insurance until age it seems likely that few will take advantage of blue crosss offer there are no choices really for anybody in maricopa county phoenix resident ken hoag told the arizona republic the lack of choice is like having empty shelves no food in a third world country do i live in cuba of course with mounting losses and no competition its hardly surprising that premiums for individual plans are skyrocketing blue cross blue shield is raising its rates by an average of percent health net an average of percent in phoenix premiums are going up a whopping percent republic columnist laurie roberts notes that a typical year old arizonan buying the second lowest silver plan will see premiums soar by percent if that year old makes a year hell pay nearly percent of his gross income for insurance even with an obamacare subsidy if he makes over hell pay a jaw dropping a month for insurance up from this year that subsidy as usual is the ace obamacare supporters always have up their sleeve the rate hikes while huge arent so bad because the subsidies will cover most of the extra cost they argue that may be so roberts observed but how sustainable is a system in which insurance premiums rise by percent in a year or even percent a year besides subsidies dont cover all the added expense hoags wife had to buy a new plan for because her old one is being discontinued while her new plans benefits are comparable to those of her old plan she is going to be stuck for an extra a month in premiums despite her subsidy and what of arizonans who earn too much money to qualify for subsidies for them the times admits the price increases will be excruciating the paper cites one example leslie rycroft of scottsdale who works in human resources is paying a month this year for a united healthcare plan that has a deductible for her family of four their income was a little too high to qualify for a subsidy she said when she looked at her options on healthcare gov last week she said she was absolutely horrified to see only one insurer health net offering plans that started at a month its beyond ridiculous she said all of a sudden you are paying a year ms rycroft said just for catastrophic
recipient email donald trump grabbed a new lifeline speaking at a rally in charlotte north carolina on october he raised a hand as if to take an oath and declared i am a victim the great business tycoon the one and only man who could fix america and make the place great again was laying claim to martyrdom and spinning another news cycle i am a victim he declared of one of the great political smear campaigns in the history of our country they are coming after me to try and destroy what is considered by even them the greatest movement in the history of our country i am a victim that pathetic line echoed in my head which is why im writing this in my long life i had seen a large white man stand up in a public arena and proclaim those words the shrill self pitying complaint of the remorseless perpetrator only once before that was in a courtroom in lower manhattan in the man was joel steinberg a new york lawyer who over a year period had brainwashed and beaten into oblivion a woman named hedda nussbaum once a successful young editor of childrens books in the early years of their relationship she had run away several times seeking help and every time a doctor or friend had called steinberg to come and get her at that point time and again steinberg would administer punishment breaking her bones and her spirit she took on what police would later describe as a zombie like quality two lessons lurk in this story one old and one very up to date first its a reminder of how much women at that time even after a great wave of feminism still blamed women for whatever happened to them at the hands of men second a man with a character like steinbergs is not the kind of guy you want to choose for high office or any office at all joel steinberg stalked a far tinier stage than donald trump and he did more deadly damage but the two men seem to be brothers under the skin sharing common character defects well described in psychiatric texts extreme narcissism a taste for sexual predation and very similar views of the women on whom they prey like steinberg who was incapable of seeing himself as the judge accurately described him trump seems blind to the real nature of his own behavior neither man seems capable of taking responsibility for the harm hes done and when their own actions finally call down retribution branding them as losers ah then come the conspiracy theories and the vindictive wail of the victim last june i published a piece at tomdispatch venturing to explain why candidate donald j trump was getting rock bottom ratings in the polls from women voters nearly of them reportedly couldnt stand the guy i pointed out what seemed to me to be the obvious trumps behavior perfectly fits the profile of an ordinary wife abuser in a sworn deposition introduced in divorce proceedings his first wife ivana swore under oath that he had torn out her hair and forcibly raped her raging at her because he didnt like the results of a scalp reducing procedure performed on him by a plastic surgeon she had recommended about one in three american women are survivors of some version of such treatment euphemistically called domestic abuse thats roughly million women voters who as i wrote last june know a tyrant when they see one i raise this subject again because the now infamous tape of trumps open mic hollywood access bus ride in added a new page to the rap sheet of this particular abuser in that piece of mine i traced the history of the principal tactics of coercion used by controlling men like trump some of those tactics including steinbergs favorites involve physical force but most when used by a skilled abuser require no force at all trump applies the handiest tools to his targeted victims regularly leaving no physical marks behind threats intimidation degradation put downs humiliation insults trivial demands occasional indulgences the lesson is simple and clear the mind can be bent and the spirit shattered without battering the body i neglected however to mention one of the most insidious tactics of such abusers perhaps because its so obvious that it regularly hides in plain sight in the military its called pulling rank high status is itself a powerful coercive force that can stifle resistance in a lower status victim and so silence him or her status is trumps brandished weapon his open carry on this he couldnt have been clearer in boasting of his pussy grabbing skills on that hollywood access tape when youre a star they let you do it you can do anything the most chilling moments on that tape however occur after trump emerges from the bus in all his orange splendor followed by his escort billy bush now a former nbc personality who could be heard on that tape laughing as trump recounted his compulsive assaults bush then greeted his television colleague arianne zucker who like so many women on american tv was less fully clothed than the men around her and whom trump had been ogling from the bus while sucking tic tacs to freshen his potty mouth for a possible kissing attack billy bush asked ms zucker how about a little hug for the donald in that short bus trip across the parking lot bush had learned just what to do to get in good stead with his high status guest and so without missing a beat he threw his lower status co worker to his peppermint salivating pal he then collected a hug from her too as trump is heard exonerating himself with the bizarre remark melania said this was okay it hardly seemed to matter what arianne zucker wanted or believed to be okay billy bushs question wasnt actually a question but
print fairfax county virginia voter jena jones told wnd and radio america she found this democrat insert included with her absentee ballot among others democratic party officials in fairfax county virginia are categorically denying that pro democrat campaign materials were included in the same envelope as a voters absentee ballot arguing that pamphlets were sent in a separate mailing to absentee voters from the fairfax county democratic committee or fcdc earlier this week jena and david jones shared their story of finding more than they expected in the envelope that contained her ballot i found a letter from the governor of virginia asking me to please vote democrat and help keep virginia blue this year jena explained then i got a letter from the fairfax county democratic committee giving me a step by step yes and no what i should vote for as far as the meal tax and all those other things on the ballot in recent days at least two more people contend they received the same materials in the envelope with their absentee ballots after the report was first published and shared on facebook by david jones fairfax county democratic committee executive director frank anderson replied to davids post to dispute their account of what the ballot envelope contained these materials were not sent in the same envelope as the ballot the ballot is mailed separately by the office of elections political parties are free to mail items to voters who request absentee ballots the two envelopes arrived at the same time commented anderson that triggered a quick back and forth between david jones and anderson i hate to tell you but youre wrong all items came in one envelope jones said impossible that letter came out of my office we never have access to other peoples ballots replied anderson then it seems those that sent the ballots have access to your letters said jones who should i believe you or my lying eyes anderson then stated that political parties are informed when anyone requests an absentee ballot and mailings are sent to those voters to promote democratic party candidates and positions on ballot initiatives i am literally sitting down the hall from the place where those envelopes are stuffed we are a political office and have no business handling anyones ballots you can believe what you want to believe concluded anderson the virginia department of elections did not respond to repeated attempts for a response but after seeing reports from wnd and radio america anderson protested the premise of the story please stop spreading these absurd allegations that are just hearsay from a misinformed voter who cannot verify his claim stated anderson in an email in which he also explained why he believed the jones account could not be accurate he shared a photo sent by state sen scott surovell showing his absentee ballot envelope next to a separate envelope containing democratic party advocacy in a formal interview fcdc communications adviser bruce neilson told wnd and radio america the jones version of what the ballot envelope contained cannot be true its not possible said neilson who then explained how absentee voters are approached by the local democrats voting is a sacred privilege and a right of every citizen he said the activity of voting is also a public record the fairfax county democratic committee receives a notice of everyone who has requested an absentee ballot we get that information as public information on the day the ballot is mailed the same day the ballot is mailed our volunteers prepare materials to advise voters what the fairfax democratic committee knows to be democratic positions on the ballot said neilson noting the materials include fliers on candidates and ballot proposals like the meals tax listen to the wnd radio america interview with bruce neilson however he insists those materials are never sent with the ballot itself that material is mailed in a separate envelope labeled with our initials fcdc and our return address in fairfax virginia and would be received either the same day perhaps the day before or the day after she received her official absentee ballot from the government neilson said its a separate mailing its a separate stamp its a separate envelope its very easy to confuse where they came from if you have all those materials on the table at the same time while youre filling in your votes he said jones is standing by her story percent as is her husband david says its a very clear memory jena opened the envelope that contained her ballot the green sample ballot the two sided letter from the governor and card with kids on it saying go vote or something of that nature there was also the return envelope which i signed david said the coverage of jenas story has also elicited similar stories from two other fairfax county voters both of them commented on reddit i can confirm this i live in herndon va and also received these materials in my absentee ballot i thought it was fishy at the time but didnt look into it stated a comment by a reader using the handle thisisaterriblename get the hottest most important news stories on the internet delivered free to your inbox as soon as they break take just seconds and sign up for wnds email news alerts another under the reddit handle nightingale nights said the same thing happened to them and posted similar photos to the ones david and jena shared last week neilson said there is no way the county government which sends out the ballots could be including partisan materials in the envelope containing the ballot they dont have our materials he said our materials are printed for us by our printer and we have complete control over our materials in our office and they come from our office in our mailing they dont go anywhere else its not possible that the county government is distributing partisan democratic materials its never
