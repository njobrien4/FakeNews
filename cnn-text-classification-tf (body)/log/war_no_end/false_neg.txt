last week the new of all ran an opinion piece in of hereditary monarchy under the consider a argued unlike elected heads of monarchies offer continuity and a focus for national togetherness quoting the historian advantage of monarchy is that the institution the hopes of by rising above the toxic partisanship of competing parties and vying elected as thousands march on trump tower chanting my you can rather see his the crown on as a distraction from the nightmare of the a similar thought struck that there may be considerable advantage in having something beyond the ballot box to appeal something transcendent around which to when the immanent is so hopelessly fraught and i reference the transcendent advisedly as the depiction of coronation makes perfectly the coronation is a theological transaction the queen was anointed in an abbey and not appointed in a government building and anointing has been the manner of conferring divine office at least since the priest and the prophet anointed king in ancient in other we just live in a constitutional monarchy in the united we live in a constitutional theocracy get me i want our monarchy to have zero executive authority but the idea of retaining something like the crown around which to something that stands apart from democratic has rarely seemed so compelling citizenship and immigration website crashed within hours of victory time for us to move to new suggested us supreme court justice only and the new immigration website has experienced an increase of traffic from the us not that thousands of good republicans have finally decided to return to the royal bosom but no coincidence that these places have the queen as their head of the still small voice of calm at the of the many and new want a foreign queen as their head of state either but it is a testament to the political value of monarchy that even in such proudly independent countries they have still found it impossible to dream up a more acceptable alternative and in both places progressive politics flourishes similarly in the idea of an elected head of state has been frequently scotched with just two president who directed the is no fawning courtier and his politics are clearly on the left he and i both worked in the now destroyed camp in he with a that he helped to i with st which the have now bulldozed we had a discussion once that they performed similar roles both being places to come together when produced the opening ceremony of the he was again telling a compelling story about our national togetherness and the same thing again with the own church for is as diverse as it in in social in ethnicity outside of they probably have very little in common not not the food they not their choice of entertainment but they will sing god save the queen with and none more so than those who have emigrated from former commonwealth countries where the queen represents a fixed point of national solidarity when she is prayed for on it is with a sense of genuine affection that could never perhaps should never be directed towards an elected official and before you say the royals represent no threat to progressive reform indeed arguable that without steady presence introduction of radical ideas like the and the welfare would have been hugely more difficult to an age where the money god has now become incarnate in the person of this man we should thank our lucky stars that our head of state worships at a very different elections

the it has been rapturous enchantment followed by despair right are in the disenchantment phase of the as are the you tell many colorful anecdotes of and in contact with each other which one do you think best reflects the wider one of the main goals of the book was to bring to light stories of unchronicled influence on both sides the first minister to the court in was a young republican named was a radical abolitionist who was dispatched to by the administration believed that the west needed to give china time to develop and modernize and stop pressuring china to change he believed that the west had no right to for the way china treated and he argued that western officials should tolerate the habit of maintaining that their emperor actually ruled the entire world to encapsulates one side of the view of one that reappeared in the and lasted up through the beginning of the administration the or rather the bet that china would liberalize and become more like us as long as we facilitated its rise in opposition to other believed his views on china as one of his successors in put a that also has formed a key part of the perspective on china your book discusses the way governments in the two nations have interacted with each but you also go into detail on the roles that notable nonpolitical figures have played to what extent does the united relationship depend on the attitudes of each leaders versus those of other whether they are from the elite classes or the grass in many we and the and our elites and those from the grass are captives of our past in the beginning of the individual and created the relationship and imbued it with much of its meaning merchants and missionaries saw china as a vast market for stuff and for souls saw as a place that could save china from the depredations of other imperialist nations with its educational as a model for china to emulate at the same other groups of feared the starting in the late oppressed workers in starting a long history of fearing the industriousness of the had their own prejudices against and ideas as viewing them as sexually deviant and dangerous many of these dreams and fantasies and biases we have about each other have resurfaced in subsequent decades in claim that china has been the united states when it comes to one can hear the populists of the party in late railing on the streets of against heathen in your many years as a journalist in what were the most notable changes you saw in the united with is less willing to bend to will than before and more willing to aggressively pursue its whether they involve trade or the south china sea spent decades arguing that as china strengthened it would become more like a liberal western nation it turned out that and as such the has stopped doing china any favors much more than it is blocking the sales of western companies to firms and strengthening its alliances with nations around periphery the careful balance of containment and engagement that defined policy toward china is now heavily skewed toward containment what are your thoughts on president xi and how the united states fits into xi has said he wants to rule which i think can be translated into a desire to see china rule in this the is an interloper and would do best to retreat to and let china handle the western pacific china benefited greatly from the in the but now xi feels that china does not need the to protect it anymore it wants the out of not next not the year but one day soon with the election of trump as the next united states where do you see the relationship trump is not an when it comes to his views on china they are but so were and those of many of his predecessors during the trump seesawed between accusing china of the united states on threatening to walk away from alliances in east and thereby ceding the western pacific to and mulling the idea of some type of with china where the would accept rise if china did not endanger the status quo in trump will enter office against a backdrop of an facing a dictator in north and a china eager to capitalize on missteps how he juggles and his own competing mix of disappointment and realism about china will help determine the future of the relationship and the future of the globe if i had to i think he is going to be more pragmatic than many initially but prognostication is a tough especially when it comes to china and trump
prime minister of japan is planning to sit down with j trump in new on in what would be the first meeting with a foreign leader since his election wants to find out how serious trump was during his campaign when he repeatedly criticized japan on trade issues and for not paying more of the cost of its own defense and since the establishment was expecting to win the wants to assure trump that he is willing and eager to work with him the prime minister is concerned about commitment to protecting japan the united states is most important and is legally obligated to defend it against attack there are around troops stationed in a powerful deterrent against the rising threat of north and an increasingly assertive china during the trump suggested he might withdraw troops not without resistance from members of officials at the state diplomats and military advisers the united alliance has been in place since the end of world war and has a lot of backing on both sides of the pacific ocean maybe there are signs that japan might be willing to pay or do but many experts contend troops are not only defending japan but the united own interests in the pentagon is budgeted to spend about billion to support troops and bases on and elsewhere around japan this year japan is set to spend billion to support the in addition to at least billion on related including compensation for the communities that host the bases and funds for relocating troops under its which was written by occupying forces after world war japan can keep an army for defensive purposes but has said he wants to revise the constitution and expand the military in his government requested the latest in a series of increases in military spending japan has committed to the nuclear nonproliferation and will probably remind trump of that on the campaign trump decried the cost of providing a nuclear umbrella to allies such as japan and south that do not have their own nuclear arms in trump told the new times that he was open to those countries building their own nuclear but on twitter this week he denied having said so has reaffirmed his commitment not to develop atomic weapons any move to do so would face severe public opposition in the only country that has suffered a nuclear attack he has been one of the biggest enthusiasts for the partnership or as it is known though japan was the last of a dozen pacific rim countries to join the sweeping trade pact trump repeatedly criticized the during the presidential campaign made politically painful concessions on agricultural imports to close the deal and get manufacturers access to export markets in the united states and elsewhere the trade partnership could bolster the limp economic growth rate in his country and serve as a counterweight to the superpower acknowledged after victory that the partnership was in a difficult but his government still plans to have parliament ratify the and he has not given up on selling it to trump may also seek to soften angry campaign in which he accused japan of crushing the united states on and manipulating its currency to gain an economic advantage trump says for free trade in but wants a for the united states what that for remains a mystery

every soviet schoolchild was taught about the heroic feats of the last members of which in late fought to the death to stop a tank assault on in one of the best known episodes of the soviet war is but there is nowhere to retreat is behind one of the red army armed at the end with just cocktails and said as the attack was as a film about the opens in this controversy rumbles on over the fact that many of the details of that last stand both in the film and versions it appear to have been over the upcoming film and the mythology around the episode in general began last when the director of state gave an interview stating that while there had indeed been a bloody battle outside it was not as many had understood it his words provoked such outrage that over the summer the archive posted a internal soviet military report into the which came to the conclusion that a journalist from the red newspaper had made up the particulars of the inventing quotes and ignoring the fact that some of the soldiers had survived and one was believed to have surrendered to the the legend was cooked up to fit in with the soviet demand that soldiers should fight to the death rather than surrender twitter whole world is watching us with bated because right here we are defending says a soldier trailer for the the culture reacted furiously to the saying it was not the job of archivists to make historical and if wanted to change he should do so shortly was nationalist politician said in recent weeks that he had called at a government meeting for to be fired he claimed his uncle had fought in division and said those griping about the exact numbers were missing the point unacceptable for someone from the archives to start telling the whole country that there were no he said later went further in his of the film and his disgust for those who questioned the story my deep conviction that even if this story was invented from the start to the even if never even if there was nothing at a sacred legend which simply impossible to besmirch and people who try to do that are total said he would like to send such who their greasy fingers into the history of back to the war period in a time machine and leave them in a trench to face tanks armed with just a hand division included many central and last month and president watched the film together under victory in the second world war has become the main building block of modern and criticism of the red army or mentions of the darker sides of the war effort are huge place in the national psyche is given the soviet union lost more than million citizens during the war years but some are uncomfortable that the mythology has overtaken the a history teacher and the chair of the editorial board of a magazine on the teaching of history in called the film a and said the war would only confuse children he told should try to tell the of course there was a yes there was heroism this is what they should have made a film about but as it watch this go and find a whole load of different information about this and it will undermine their trust in these kind of world
somehow trump manages to dumb down everything somehow he manages to lower the bar to the point where he can play by a different set of rules and somehow the media and elected officials just shrug their shoulders and walk his own the is negotiating business deals at a time when his predecessors you filling cabinet positions and transitioning to power he met with his business partners and the trump organization signed a deal last trump tweeted earlier this to the election it was well known that i have interests in properties all over the world only the crooked media makes this a big explained this in more if not entirely in his interview with the new built a very great company and a big company and all over the world people are starting to when they look at all these different like in and other number a job like that builds great relationships with the people of so all all is indeed approach to mixing his business and political affairs law is totally on my he the president have a conflict of be profiting from the presidency would not be a quaint conflict of is not about whether trump favors one country or president over gives a contract to one company or or spends more time making money for himself than he does boning up about policy there are laws on the books about us businesses influencing foreign officials with payments or other inducements the law is called the foreign corrupt practices act and its goal is to stamp out bribery by any us is what the law calls favors and payments given to foreign officials in exchange for business deals not a conflict of and favors going the other way into the pockets of the president are so clearly corrupt that they were forbidden by the founding fathers in the constitution the emoluments clause prohibits gifts and titles from foreign powers as person holding any office of profit or trust under without the consent of the accept of any or of any kind from any or foreign this clause that leads to exceptional red tape around any and all gifts received by the white house and every other from a homemade quilt to a watch everything is declared and surrendered officials can only keep the gifts up to a value of if they repay the us process will be hard within the world of international real where foreign powers can grant gifts ranging from planning permits to investments from sovereign wealth funds the list is almost we know if trump discussed his investment with president of but we do know that his daughter now running the family business was on the call we know if there was any suggestion that president could expect any benefits for himself or his country spokespeople for president and trump have denied reports about the mixing of trump business and politics on the we do know that the project is now moving news that emerged just three days after the call between and trump for a president who has refused to release his tax the need for transparency is not exactly any the fact that even having this discussion tells you something profound about the trump presidency before it officially begins promise to his voters was that he was incorruptible because he was so independently wealthy that nobody could touch him he knew how to drain the swamp because he had lived in it for so buying off begging politicians for so many years that it made him argument was always a but clearly many voters bought into his pitch just two weeks since the obvious that trump has no interest in separating his personal wealth from his political agenda the damage caused is not confined to public confidence in the united states government being leader of the free world is not a casual concept that cold war phrase encapsulates the notion that the united states is a beacon of freedom and democracy for the world as his own transition came to an best summed up the notion in his final address in in have been guided by the standard john set before his shipmates on the flagship years as faced the task of building a new government on a perilous frontier must always he we shall be as a city upon a hill the eyes of all people are upon eyes of the world are on the trump transition right now they see a who lost the popular vote by more than million votes and almost percentage is a difficult notion of democracy to explain to a world struggling against authoritarian regimes where votes are routinely ignored and discounted the work of democracy promotion by the national endowment for established by is immeasurably harder as a result of the work of spreading government has become just as hard as a result of business dealings if a sitting president can enrich himself while in then why a president of a developing country set up his own businesses to do the why should they not do after as trump told the theory i could run my business and then run the country corruption the seeking of personal profit by government officials derived from their roles is a plague that condemns the most vulnerable people in the world to poor or public services if the us talk credibly about the need to stamp out conflict of the world will struggle to eradicate corruption and improve life for the poorest people on the

until as late as a joint diagnosis of autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was not permitted by the most influential psychiatric the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders the is an essential tool in psychiatry as it allows clinicians and researchers to use a standard framework for classifying mental disorders health insurance companies and drug regulation agencies also use the so its definition of what does or constitute a particular disorder can have consequences one of the reasons for the prohibition of a diagnosis of autism and was that the severity of autism placed it above in the diagnostic so the inattention that is normally present in autism did not seem to merit an additional diagnosis that was an odd state of as any clinician working in the field would be able to quote studies that point to anything from to of patients with autism also having more problematic still is the fact that patients with both sets of symptoms may respond poorly to standard treatments or have increased side effects the fifth edition of the opened the way for a more detailed look at this and just a year after the new guidelines were a consortium i am a part at the university in called published a paper which showed that autistic traits in participants could be predicted by complex interactions between and white matter volumes in the brain structures of the brains of participants in the study the which was found to be able to predict levels of autistic traits in is shown in red et ala more general finding from that work was that autistic traits were significantly raised in a curious result given that a diagnosis of clinical autism was an exclusion criterion for participation in the study raised levels of autistic traits in participants in the study reflect the fact that autism is a spectrum disorder distributed throughout the entire population research from last year shows that autistic traits are also much higher among scientists compared to the general population a paper i published at the of this month in the journal looking at scans from over participants in the project has moved on to examine in detail the brain structures involved in the overlap of and autism one structure in called the was able to predict the level of autistic traits in but similar to the earlier a complex interaction was shown to be at work with another the also influencing results both of these structures are located in a part of the called the that operates as a monitoring system for with the guiding the selection of goals and the updating the reward value depending on the outcome of an action with this kind of the plays a key role in and motivation the results showed that autistic traits were highest when there was a coupling of higher volume with lower volume the statistical tools used in the paper were devised and by a zoologist who has used similar models to study the transfer of information in flotillas of vultures as they their search space while scavenging for food the latest findings add to a growing body of evidence that suggests that problems in the reward circuits of the may lead to diminished motivation to attend to social such as a smile or a frown or a voice an earlier study in autistic children found a striking pattern of between areas of the temporal lobe and nodes of the reward pathway suggesting that autistic children may not find voices inherently interesting the first account of autism in the modern published by in noted that one patient not register any change of expression when spoken seminal paper contains many poignant descriptions of such as the case history of a who did not look at a face when spoken was rarely never played with children but instead moved among them a strange as one moves between the pieces of furniture in a a consistent thread in autism research has been the inconsistency of results some groups have shown a larger in autism while others have shown the opposite small sample sizes are partly to but another problem is that levels of in autism are often ignored this is a serious as the degree of present in autism can have a large impact on the results the latest publication in one goes some way to addressing these problems by drawing on a sample size of over participants and more importantly by looking at the subtle hinterland between the two disorders rather than separating them into binary units there are many debates about the usefulness of the since it first appeared in the first edition contained pages and diagnoses edition runs to over pages with almost leading to criticism from who was once the chairperson of a task that the handbook has led to the of of the population who may not have any serious mental health problems outside of this it cannot be denied that the has a large positive and on the way research is conducted but at least some of the changes to the fifth edition may lead to better clinical management of patients with both autism and from a research point of the fifth edition of the will certainly provide a better scientific framework for studying the overlap of these two disorders in more detail deficit hyperactivity
an unusually wet spring and floods throughout have delivered a mosquito infestation to and have taken to social media to describe encounters with swarms of the insects in their homes and and while cycling to work very bizarre and unusual is happening in i take it too many someone with the to be a swarm of in and around south east is there a anybody got any i thought the was looking dirtier than normal but perhaps that is just a river virus therapy hailed by scientists as read user not just seen them around area and also even in chief health prof said the increased numbers were due to a particularly wet are starting our efforts to control mosquitoes early this year as heavy rain has provided perfect breeding guest than mosquitoes are a nuisance most people should ensure there are no pools of stagnant water on their health department said surveillance and control initiatives had started one month early in seven council areas hit by including swan hill and heaps of around the area and around too my house is right next to the fucking so yeah department advised people in those areas to take steps to protect themselves from bites to prevent contracting river which is spread by mosquitoes and can cause muscle pain and and the much rarer forest which can cause joint pain and a a department spokesman said the mosquitoes in the were of a nuisance than a direct health there had also been an increase in the number of hover crane flies and midges in he which sometimes people mistook for mosquitoes the head of la department of environmental management and said she doubted dumping out buckets of stagnant water would be enough to address the noticing a shit ton of in the like i just drove from east to north and they still there not a bad habit to to not keep standing water around your but when the park next door still has huge puddles of standing water it may not make much she said has been covered with standing water for weeks and weeks due to rain and and the water has warmed up and the mosquitoes have subsequently with warm weather forecast for over the next she expected the to move on within a couple of will also be hit hard by spiders and people slapping she said is actually great for the because the bugs are like this lower biomass and all sorts of creatures will free so many in like afraid of and is currently infested with them like there are swarms of them hovering anybody in noticed a ridiculous amount of popping never had them at home until now i love i really but you making it so hard with all these and pollen right time to fumigate the whole

been three years since protesters gathered on the streets of to demand an end to a government they believed was no longer fit for demonstration triggered a chain of events that led to annexing and war in eastern thousands have been killed and million people as foreign policy interests shift to and the we have asked young how the past three years have been for and what they think the future i knew i had been ready for it all my i knew i had been ready for it all my life a solution to rotting more than million of us gathered in central square and together we felt strong enough to make a country where people would choose to joined the protests and spent day and night in the headquarters of the where it felt like the future of depended on whether our wooden shields would withstand the attacks of the government riot translated news into from the barricades and helped coordinate media efforts occasionally i would go home and sleep i opened my own to tell the story of what was happening i wanted to provide an alternative narrative for the one different from the press who branded us the and called us and three years i am left feeling that is treated as no more than a diplomatic pawn a country that has always been by both former soviet occupiers and modern global powers the western media also treats as an the that made relations with go sour but there are other stories to be like our citizens still having their rights oppressed and the daily information war we continue to fight with refuse to hate the people who want to separate from am originally from in eastern my mother is a native who speak and has never been to a city my father is a traditional and has vowed to be first in line to volunteer if an army if the rebels comes to town my town was speaking and i grew up feeling that and were two countries with a common and culture but after the war i am no longer able to understand the situation as is so much propaganda trying to pit one side against the but i refuse to hate the people who want to separate from the rest of the from the i understand not that they think is just that they believed their lives would be better in think one day we will be brothers and sisters again we most frequently misunderstood thing about relationship with is that one day we will be brothers and sisters city of witnessed a big tragedy on may when attacked a march i was on my way to a football match but i stopped by to see what going on i had a camera as i was running between the two stones and cocktails started to the corner of the main street in someone called me by name and i took a few steps towards him moments later a man was killed on the spot where i had been standing by the end of the the death toll had exceeded more than two years have passed and the official investigation cannot determine who was responsible for sparking the or why the authorities did nothing to stop it spreading journalists have tried to make sense of what as have independent but we still have official shows us that it is difficult for people recover from conflicts if there have been a large number of especially if those responsible have not been held to account but without how can we be and are seen as dictators who killed and are identical both bloody dictators who killed millions of and is a heavy user of these are two commonly held beliefs among who rely on sites for their i was a student we learned about the propaganda of and the soviet but such propaganda is now an everyday reality in my a native has recently retired from the merchant navy after years he used to listen to western rock music and travel the world now he believes and the terrible were great leaders who should have monuments erected in their i suggested was responsible for millions of he claimed that was a dictator has banned state on the basis of the disinformation and propaganda it promotes a move called a violation against freedom of speech but everything is available anyway my friend has just returned from the conflict in where he says no one only stuff from and the it feels likes is creating a fantasy narrative to destroy but for others a version of events they have come to believe as journalists often every situation can be seen as truth from one point of and a lie from the conflict has destroyed many families including soviet times it was popular to move from one republic to another so my uncles and aunts left to study in where they have lived for the past years the conflict has destroyed many including mine twitter family without personal mending ties with will not be easy war they came to visit every year they loved our country not now we stopped talking to them in after a few conversations where they would say things like can save you from we disagreed about and they came to regard their as the enemy my story is not and i know that one day we will have to forgive each other because without these personal any cooperation with will be very difficult we know is being a three cups of three but one is empty the third family a son or a has disappeared the eyes are full of pain this scene in was replicated outside the embassy in last month to draw attention to the plight of families living on the a fate befell the family of who was kidnapped in the city of five months ago and been heard from since
at first the election of j trump would seem to be bad news for but there is a chance that on things could work out surprisingly well for the clerics leaders stress that they pay little heed to what happens in the united that they pride themselves on their independence makes no difference for who the next president the supreme ayatollah said in a speech last week yet he could hardly miss promises on the campaign trail to the landmark nuclear agreement reached last which he frequently described as the worst deal ever in ayatollah said recently that if trump tore it will set fire to but trump also presents new opportunities for many analysts say while he has criticized the nuclear he has also said that the united states should stop backing rebels in and focus on the state militant group effectively shifting its support to ally in president if that said an associate professor of north studies at the university of will be good for the region and the with its ally has supported throughout the which started in morally financially and militarily over and afghan soldiers have died in the according to official statistics such a change would come from of all it would be professor said in the larger is waiting and hoping for the day the united states packs up and leaves the middle closing its military bases in the region and moving its aircraft carriers out of the gulf while that seems trump has demonstrated an isolationist streak in questioning the value of and the nuclear umbrella over south and japan should stop threatening professor said the united states under trump is more he will find that will respond in even with the nuclear things could ultimately break way last national security experts signed a report urging trump to keep the deal and even some republicans in congress and groups that had opposed the deal urged trump to go slowly and consider other ways to pressure on the house of representatives did just voting overwhelmingly to extend some sanctions for an additional years even if the agreement is eventually ripped might still stand to gain it has already received tens of billions of dollars in frozen is selling oil on the world market and is cutting deals with businesses if were to reimpose sanctions on it is doubtful that the other world powers that are signatories to the deal would go along the one area where both and the united states stand to lose ground is in personal something that was virtually nonexistent after the revolution during the two years of negotiations on the nuclear secretary of state john and the foreign developed a strong personal relationship in front of the cameras at they slapped each joked and seemed to get along very a breakthrough for two countries that do not even have embassies in each capitals trump has not yet decided on his secretary of but with people like w a former mayor of new and john r a former united nations being it seems unlikely that the same level of personal rapport will be matched face the honeymoon is said an economist close to president two guys and their teams have talked for hundreds of in a period of two years who can replace an analyst close to the reformist movement of and knew each other for years is of descent has hosted in his home in new when he was an ambassador to the united nations you can be sure such relations are now a thing of the past with the names that are being mentioned out of does stand to lose a lot if the nuclear deal is rescinded since the has returned to world oil providing income for who also have gotten access to some of their frozen funds abroad business delegations are pouring and is even planning to purchase aircraft planes that will also bring business culture to at the same large international banks are still not providing any line of credit to nor are they allowing bank transfers out of fear of trespassing unilateral sanctions on although the administration is working to clear up ambiguities that are holding back a republican administration is likely to halt those efforts some analysts adhere to the traditional saying that enmity toward has never only the conditions surrounding the relationship difference is now that because of all the regional there are chances for both of us for in and for said a political analyst means that because of our any president has to keep dealing with be it normal have their own ideas about many seeing him as a harbinger of chaos the of countries that have suffered at the machinations of colonialism and western power plays is conducive to grand policies and conspiracy theories in power behind the scenes have brought this trump to solve the greatest said a wealthy farmer will see bloodshed and chaos with this man at the mark my

j trump said on that he had no intention of pressing for an investigation into use of a private email server or the financial operations of her dropping the her pledge that became a rallying cry for his campaign for the white house who branded his rival and said she would go to jail if he were said in an interview with reporters and editors at the new times that he was no longer interested in pursuing in part because he wanted to heal the wounds of a divisive campaign want to hurt the i really trump said during the interview went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different and i am not looking to hurt them at all the campaign was his reversal on prosecuting was particularly striking given the outsize role the issue played during the presidential in which her use of a private email server as secretary of state became a prominent and one she has blamed for her loss to trump trump said he wanted to from the subject without he said that have people that do perhaps a reference to the or republicans who might continue to press for prosecutions in the email or foundation cases but the made clear that he would not seek to pursue an investigation himself nor make it a priority after he assumes office the decision angered some of his most fervent who immediately criticized his seeming change of heart blared the headline on a conservative news site that has strongly backed trump not something that i feel very strongly trump said at the unlike health care or immigration has been a very painful period of aides did not respond to a request for comment about remarks during their second trump turned to and i i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your because never been so many so much after turnaround on the conservative commentator one of his staunchest supporters during the suggested on twitter that trump was overstepping his role i thought we elected she wrote we make him the his job is to pick those not do their tom president of judicial a conservative advocacy group that has been a relentless critic of said on that it would be a mistake for trump to drop the threat of appointing a special counsel to look into her email use said that although the had already investigated the matter that inquiry was flawed his group has gained access to thousands of pages of state department emails through lawsuits and is pressing its case in court even after her defeat representative a republican who leads the house oversight and government reform said last week on fox news that his committee would continue to investigate the matter as well because got to get to the office said on he was unavailable for comment about statements although the email investigation is the agency still has an open inquiry into the foundation that inquiry began after the publication of a book by peter that asserted that some foreign entities had given money to the foundation in return for state department favors when was there the have denied the assertions the and justice department conduct their criminal investigations largely independently from the white so trump cannot tell agents to close their cases a president ordering the to stop a politically sensitive case would be a major scandal does seem like an extraordinary breach of protocol for him to get involved in that glen a a former federal prosecutor in new said of the know of no recent circumstances when the president ordered an attorney general not to pursue a criminal as trump were to order the b to close the foundation could choose to rebuff him directors are given terms to insulate them from political but the president still has the power to fire a as president bill did with s sessions in after a justice department investigation uncovered ethical abuses by sessions in an interview last week with trump said he had not yet decided whether to dismiss over his handling of the email saying the director have had very good reasons for doing what he as a practical remarks will probably have little impact the investigation into emails is already closed while the one into her foundation remains senior officials and career justice department officials have said there is little evidence justifying moving forward with a case when the case comes up for senior agents and prosecutors may decide to shut it but it will not be because of remarks while the decision is likely to frustrate investigators at the who are fiercely protective of their independence to follow the facts they some legal experts applauded decision to not pursue investigations into emails or her family foundation k a professor at the university of hastings college of the said he was inclined to support both moves by trump a decision to shut down an he not out of step with constitutional as the constitution gives the president the power to issue pardons for federal crimes

do you remember playing pretend when you were maybe you were a a dinosaur or a princess normal when and usually harmless most children know the difference between pretending to be a superhero and jumping off the roof thinking they can fly but adults often forget for we may stop pretending to be but a lot of us seem convinced that we can pretend to be investors dangerous pretend investors think that financial pornography is so the ticker tape scrolling across the television screen all day represents actionable information real investors know it might be like going to the but they would never make a decision because of it pretend investors think it makes perfect sense to change their investments based on what they hear in the a new so he like the federal so he criticized so buy bank real investors know that they make changes to their investments based on what happens in their own lives if their goals change or there is a fundamental change in their financial then they consider an alteration but they would never make a change based on someone yelling or on television pretend investors think they need to monitor their investments all the time the little supercomputer they carry around in their pockets makes it so easy real investors know that it takes a long time for a tree to and it will not help to dig it up to see if the roots are still there the same rule applies to investments and because watching things get big slowly is not very real investors tend not to talk about that tree all that much pretend investors talk about their investments a lot they say things long or short they use jargon that often does not make though it sounds kind of impressive if you listen too closely sometimes they cheer for things like increased consumer higher or in some war real investors understand the difference between the global economy and their personal economy and choose to focus on the latter pretend investors will worry endlessly about the news in some part of the world or the impact on their portfolio real investors focus on the things they can like saving a bit more next keeping their investment costs not paying fees unless necessary and managing their behavior by not buying high and selling again when prices are low pretend investors complain endlessly about volatility in the market and external actions that have impact on the big bets they have made on individual stocks real investors have enjoyed the benefits of a market that is up more than percent in the last years so ask yourself it finally time to stop pretending
j trump has yet to hold a news but he released what aides said should suffice for an video in which he asserted that his transition was going efficiently and he outlined his top priorities for his first day in including beginning the process of withdrawing from the the partnership trade deal and revoking president environmental regulations on the production of coal and natural gas here is the latest on the transition and what he hopes to accomplish in his first days the right extremist the is exulting in victory at a conference in its leading ideologue railed against quoted propaganda in and celebrated election he saw it as a sign that white people were to their own and said that now up to the to formulate policies have a realistic chance of being a spokeswoman for trump said the disapproved of all hate groups the depth of one of the factors that played into the election is still the role of fake news some of it is produced from people seeking to make money off advertising but false stories can also build off misinformed social media posts we look at how one mistaken tweet by a man with just followers exploded through the law enforcement officials in north used in weather against protesters fighting the access pipeline the local office defended its accusing encamped native and environmental activists of conducting an and setting fires the fallout from revelations of doping program is rewriting the record books for the and summer the retesting of stored urine samples for specific banned substances has incriminated at least medal the majority from and other eastern countries medals from the winter are also likely to be called into question was fired as coach of the national soccer less than a week after a humiliating defeat that damaged the chances of qualifying for the world cup soccer did not immediately announce a replacement pope extended local authority to grant forgiveness for the of making permanent the power he gave them on a temporary basis last year is no sin that mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant he wrote the largest and most authoritative study of dementia rates confirmed that its prevalence is dropping that is remarkably good as an estimated four million to five million develop dementia every and very expensive to treat researchers will now try to solve the many like why people who are overweight or obese have a percent lower risk a brain scan showing signs of more than five years into chaotic civil the capital is relatively undamaged and bustling with markets and restaurants but the war has warped the city on a recent our correspondent recorded short video where you can sometimes hear on and people fear random shells falling more than people signed up for a yoga class with baby goats on an farm wander around with their collars and name looking for or a bit of grassy kibble many they are and seem entirely by the sight of or so people posing in our correspondent reported after taking a class should you quit social media to benefit your the advice of a professor who says a distraction and harms our ability to concentrate serious about making an impact in the he down your close your browser roll up your sleeves and get to
successive governments have reason to be proud of their achievements in the area of open data to remain there is a need to continue to invest and extend and develop marks the fourth open data institute annual summit at the in convening data innovators from around the world to share challenges and solutions at last minister called on the to be a critical friend for and bring the voice of data businesses and innovators to the cabinet year here are three areas where action by the government can help to support and promote a flourishing open data our data are used to thinking of areas like transport and energy requiring physical infrastructure from roads and rail networks to the national grid and power we understand that investment and management of these vital parts of an infrastructure are essential to the economic wellbeing and future prosperity of the is no less true of key data assets our data infrastructure is a core part of our national infrastructure from lists of legally constituted companies to the our data infrastructure needs to be in some cases built and in all cases made as widely available as the benefits to the economy and to reduce costs in delivery of public the data we rely on needs to be and as open as data infrastructure consists of data assets and the technology to share and use the that operate and maintain the processes by which they are and guides describing how to use and manage the data trustworthy data infrastructure is funded and managed so it can be used in ways that benefit infrastructure is simply there when we need it at the too much of our data infrastructure is inaccessible or only available if you can pay for access data innovators struggle to get hold of data and to work out how they can best use while individuals do not feel that they are in control of their we do have some excellent examples of infrastructure data from the likes of companies land ordnance survey and core parts of the data infrastructure that we need within the are or of a low quality the government must invest here just as it invests in our other traditional and promote data we are to make best use of we need a bridge between academic private and third and a thriving startup ecosystem where new ideas and approaches can have learned that properly targeted challenges could identify potential savings for government similar to prescribing an startup which used publicly available data to identify in prescriptions savings per year for the more translate that potential into procurable products and services that could deliver those data challenge series run at a larger funded by innovate openly contested and independently would stimulate the creation of new products and services it would also act as a forcing function to strengthen data infrastructure around key and raise awareness and capacity for those working to solve them the data needed to satisfy the challenges would have to be made available and bringing data innovation into government and bolstering the offer of the startups and who take in data order to take advantage of the data businesses and citizens need to understand how to make use of data in other they must become data literacy is needed through our whole educational system and society more generally policymakers are going to need to be informed by insights that can only be gleaned through understanding and data have to move the dial here it is an investment we cannot afford to shirk strengthening our data supporting and promoting innovation using that and investing in widespread data literacy will be the only way to succeed as a nation in the tech data
as the technology industry came to grips in the last week with the reality of a presidential election that did not go its many in silicon valley landed on the idea that widespread misinformation spread was a primary factor in the outcome on both and altered their advertising policies to explicitly prohibit sites that traffic in fake news from making money off lies very likely a worthwhile even if it comes too late the has loosened our collective grasp on the and efforts to fight that dismaying trend are obviously worth pursuing yet it would be a mistake to end this investigation at fake news in the dangers posed by fake news are just a symptom of a deeper truth now dawning on the with billions of people glued to and other popular social media has become an increasingly powerful cultural and political to the point that its effects are now beginning to alter the course of global events the election of j trump is perhaps the starkest illustration yet that across the social networks are helping to fundamentally rewire human society they have subsumed and gutted mainstream media they have undone traditional political advantages like and access to advertising and they are destabilizing and replacing institutions and established ways of doing including political transnational organizations and unspoken social prohibitions against blatant expressions of racism and xenophobia most because these services allow people to communicate with one another more they are helping to create surprisingly influential social organizations among groups these ad hoc social movements range widely in from white supremacists in the united states to in to in the middle east to the hacker collectives of eastern and but each in its own way is now wielding previously unthinkable resulting in sometimes destabilizing geopolitical spasms now have billions of people on the and most of them are not that happy with the status said the president of the a research firm that forecasts global risks think their local government is authoritarian they think on the wrong side of the establishment aggrieved by identity politics and a middle many factors accounted for economic anxiety in the industrial an inchoate desire for some kind of change in the national and some mix of latent xenophobia and sexism across the electorate but as even trump acknowledged in an interview with aired social media played a determining role in the race in the the concerns of supporters might have been and his candidacy would almost certainly have foundered after he was universally written off by just about every mainstream and he faced disadvantages in organization and access to traditional political expertise yet by putting out a message that resonated with people trump hacked through every established political order this new people are now empowered to express their grievances and to follow people they see as echoing their said it for social i see trump for people who like an predictable this is the scariest thing about not that it may be full of lies problem that could potentially be but that its scope gives it real power to change history in unpredictable ways but where we are time to start recognizing that social networks actually are becoming the forces that their boosters long promised they would be and to be rather than by the huge social changes they could uncork this should come as no surprise in a we are now living through a kind of version of the utopia that some in tech once envisioned would be unleashed by social media over much of the last we have seen progressive social movements powered by the web spring up across the world there was the green revolution in and the spring in the middle east and north in the united we saw the occupy wall street movement and the protests social networks also played a role in electoral politics first in the ultimately unsuccessful candidacy of dean in and then in the

are a lot more on my way home today i walked passed a patrol of armed and i was suddenly surprised by how normal that has become to me definitely become part of the scenery in and are part of a new at vocabulary along with national security alert levels in public places have been heightened and i think people and perhaps still a lot more wary about two months after the attacks a car and people threw themselves to the ground i had a hard time going out to concerts and big events for a and even i have to scout out the fire escape when i get there my friend was killed at the last year and i still get used to that he was a kind accepting of everyone and brimming with potential not a day where i think about that and feel sad and bereft attacks are being used to often spend nights near the republic square the and i was shocked to see how empty it months after the attacks i also surprise myself i go as i prevent myself to stop at the square for a moment and to feel did change my relationships with especially with some friends as i come from a town in the suburbs which has a lot of immigrants making up the with of origins debates about what happened and what is still happening are part of our daily life and some friends have the same opinions as me some people i thought i knew started to call for or to call refugees animals because they thought they were having really racist thoughts and talking to some very good friends of mine because what they said really hurt me my father being i got personally offended by been said by some people i think the attacks are being exploited by politicians to win the upcoming presidential elections they just scare people and hope to win like and now no difference between the parties as they just all target nationalism is is in an utter mess and has been for a long time the front national have made gains the country so in on the magnanimous fear since the and the left is too to do anything about it the fact that veteran leftist is putting himself forward once again for the next elections speaks volumes about the lack of progress made by socialism in the past few years here people are exasperate by the their handling of the travail protests was country is currently having an identity crisis politicians have been saying that is the home of secularism in the same breath as saying that is a catholic what they really seem to be getting at is want levels of nationalism being stoked by even the politicians is scary obsession with referencing the as the is as nauseating as it is historically inaccurate i really tell if resilience or simply hard to say been a real change the country has rocked and but its foundations are solid it feels more like what a or the crash of strong reactions at slowly dwindling out one year you deny something did but the scar is if not the is poised to the various cafs already people have resumed their normal lives looks the same it was before those appalling events it has may be seeing more cops and soldiers patrolling in the but not that striking if a change has taken it is happening at a deeper level and while true the emergency state has been there been any report of real though some may have flared up every so really tell if resilience or simply numbness and resignation as a matter of if the purpose of the attacks was to spread then it panned out people are both willing to resist and if something must it will and hardly anything you can do to prevent so the best course is to carry on as before and be oblivious of the danger which is the right path to tread has changed dramatically since the has changed dramatically since the attacks during there was this fear of mass gatherings and the possibility of an attack politically has changed politicians had been making a discourse out of what it means to be for years but since the every party and every politician has something to good and for bad the whole political debate gravitates around what defines the fundamentals of society and on what kind of social contract we all rely my biggest hope for is too stay united and not to get lost in adversity i wish that we can continue to live with different especially in a city as mixed as most relevant think is the rise of the every day i hear conversations about whereas it was not the case before when i talk about politics with my the first issue they mention is immigration the migrant crisis which is facing has bolstered this atmosphere the most relevant thing is the rise of the national front takes advantage of it in the little town where i live near of the inhabitants voted for them at the last regional election it is a democratic town i was at the counting after the election with my father and the mayor told us believe of the population i administer vote for them taken we also were and it is far worse in other regions in the wake of the a released a song in which he says have no choice we have to live together or to die it is exactly what i feel if our country is divided then they have won the terrorists want the national front to win the election next they want to divide the nation quite the i would like to see a united country

through the state as is according to a department official aides did not respond to questions about whether the had used his own interpreter in the meeting with and calls with other or whether he had relied on interpreters provided by them order that the calls are done in seems like a silly protocol issue but one that people really think said a senior fellow at the center for a new security and a

lurking behind the turmoil and the jockeying for advantage in j effort to assemble a national security team lies the more fundamental question of how he will address the immediate and complex challenges he inherits upon taking office trump has never articulated any detailed foreign policy vision beyond the vague slogan the diverse and shifting cast of potential appointees under consideration for top administration jobs has only highlighted the deep splits among conservatives about how the new administration should confront threats involving north and among and how it should manage relations with allies in and trump said in a march interview with the new describing for the first time what the phrase meant to him have been mocked and ripped off for many years by people that were from his personnel appointments to his first major meeting with a foreign leader it came in new with prime minister of japan trump faces a series of decisions that will begin to flesh out his approach to the world and provide some clue as to how he might respond to whatever crises confront him as commander in chief does mean he will use military and to wipe out emerging from rogue nuclear states to terrorist before they can do harm to the united or does it mean he calls troops back building them into a retaliatory force that can lash out if the nation is at moments during the he suggested both approaches he said he would the from areas of and he criticized president for pulling troops out too soon but he is also the man who rejected and is it always the united states that gets right in the middle of he some we cannot be the policeman of the no one knows what response to expect from a man who said he prided himself on following his instincts and has little patience for careful legalisms of his predecessor but while presidents the challenges do not here are some places and issues where will first take trump called the agreement reached with in intended to constrain from building nuclear of the most incompetent deals of any kind ever and he promised to fix it because the deal is an executive not a the new president has great latitude to alter or scrap it but two can play that the are deeply unhappy with the arguing that they never got the relief from sanctions that they were promised any effort to reopen the bargaining will also give military officers and conservatives a chance to alter the pact or threaten to resume their race for nuclear capability to the deal was not only but also badly negotiated he said of secretary of state john and his negotiating team trump said he would have left the negotiating doubled down on and never agreed to give back billions of money that belonged to and was frozen in financial institutions but when he struggled to name any part of the deal he would have walked out of the negotiations to alter with some he finally settled on a common that after will be free to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium in any quantity in decision about what to do with the deal will be an early test of his willingness to act unilaterally the nations that joined the united states in the negotiations and china not only support the but are rushing to take economic advantage of it by building commercial ties with if trump wanted to abandon the deal or reimpose they would almost certainly refuse to go along the hold a few too in they shipped percent of their nuclear fuel out of the disabled a plutonium reactor and took thousands of which enrich out of service if the deal were to be declared they would be free to their nuclear infrastructure and rebuild their now frozen until by administration it would take about a year for them to produce enough new material for a weapon longer to produce the weapon itself one option for advocated by many is to simply reimpose sanctions on for including its activities in and its continued support of terrorism the would say that violates the spirit of the agreement and leadership has already threatened that such action would nullify it it is hard to say which has sounded more confrontational in recent years about north the which has regularly warned of a to any north use of its expanding nuclear or the who spent much of the bush years plotting ways to make the regime collapse but if there is likely to be an early test of reaction to north is probably it the nation has accelerated its nuclear and its arsenal is it could have to weapons during term in his security trump will be hearing the latest estimates for how long it will take the north to build a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the public figure is five years or though some intelligence officials believe it could happen significantly sooner trump has at various times described north young as even while expressing grudging admiration for toughness so the early choice will be should trump confront the north with more missile defenses and perhaps a naval blockade to stop all trade that does not go across the perhaps that is what trump meant when he said that should use our economic power to have them should he reopen negotiations with a nation that has made clear that its nuclear arsenal is perhaps that is what trump was suggesting when he said he was willing to meet one on one with over a hamburger as yet another should he pull back forces in the pacific and let the and the deal with the he suggested just that in a interview with the new saying that if countries did not pay their fair share for he was prepared to tell you will be defending trump made

in a little over two trump after his shocking victory last night will control a unaccountable national security and military apparatus unparalleled in world history the nightmare that civil libertarians have warned of for years has now tragically come instead of dismantling the surveillance state and war the administration and democrats it and it will soon be in the hands of a will go down in history as perhaps president most catastrophic administration could have prosecuted torturers and war criminals in the bush administration and sent an unmistakable message to the torture is illegal and unconscionable instead the president said they would not basically turning a clear felony into a policy dispute trump has bragged that he will bring back torture and he has talked about killing the innocent family members of openly telling the world he will commit war that trump will take the reins of our various middle east wars in going to stop him from following through on his heinous promised to close the stain on our bill of rights known as prison in his first week in office yet to this it remains with dozens of prisoners still in legal limbo after being held without charge for almost years not only has trump pledged to keep it he has said he is with sending us citizens arrested on us soil to face unconstitutional military who once campaigned against government secrecy and the mass spying instead entrenched the incredible surveillance apparatus when he came into office and then defended it in the face of the revelations modest changes were enacted due to public but the surveillance state as we know it argument we have these powers that are almost exclusively exercised in complete but they are only used judiciously they the ability to potentially spy on countless who are suspected of no crime is in the hands of a person who has already been accused of listening to the phone calls of his own and who the new times said just this muses about all the ways he will punish his enemies after election trump has even previously in response to a question about the ability to hack his political wish i had that power that would be us has elected its most dangerous leader we all have plenty to fear read bush secret and unaccountable drone has only been further entrenched under the administration it has dropped bombs in more than half a dozen and even asserted the legal authority to kill us citizens abroad without due process at the same the white house with the help of a spineless house of representatives and senate has dramatically expanded the authority to unilaterally wage war all over the world without congress having declared as the constitution requires who has promised to the shit out middle east countries and can be goaded into fits of rage by any perceived will soon be in control of that awesome power as trump will also be in charge of a terrifying nuclear which he alone can activate while the blame for continuing to sit on a large nuclear stockpile that could destroy the world traces back promised to work towards a yet has shrunk the us arsenal less than any modern president he was also rebuffed by his entire national security team when he proposed even modest changes to the system a few months horrors are in store for us during the reign of president trump is but he will have all the tools at his disposal to wreak havoc on our rights here at home and countless lives of those abroad we should have seen this and we should have put in place the safeguards to limit the now it might be too elections national

last week i was at the launch of the university of biological anthropology research network and website at a panel discussion called biological possible futures the expert panel of academics not only speculated about the future of the discipline but reflected on the difficult past too biological anthropology or physical anthropology is the scientific discipline that studies the biological and aspects of human beings it may also be the inspiration for the girls aloud biology there have been definite periods of waxing and waning of the subject at biological anthropology departments and degrees have come and gone and come back again an interesting subject but one that spans disciplines so sometimes struggles to build up a critical mass of pure biological anthropology academics to form a department it is also a subject that is producing more students than can ever be employed in biological anthropology this got me thinking about palaeontology as a scientific which has many similarities and is one of the disciplines that feeds biological anthropology depending on who you talk palaeontology has always been a discipline on the fringes of earth sciences or as a part of geology along with palaeontology may be the sexier side of geology even the prettiest of lenticular bedding grab the headlines quite like volcanoes or earthquakes do but it is a subject that has a relatively small community of people who can make a professional career out of it this raises another as deep into the age of the the sixth mass and as hope becomes an endangered species itself why should we continue to fund and communicate in the first it be better for scientists pursuing a career in palaeontology to instead switch to the more pressing and equally lucrative field of biological why should palaeontology be funded at all when clearly all the funding should go to vaccine and antibiotics are extinction rates in corals really as high impact to society as medical who cares where life came from if we know perhaps palaeontology the subject should stop trying to compete with other science funding altogether and become a humanities just hypothetical concerns either others have felt the need to answer why palaeontology is respond to proposed cuts in federal funding for supporting research or question if the subject itself is going extinct the vinyl records not the zoological got the answers covered from resolving fairly niche dinner party debates to finding the wording for justifying why you need the next research a comprehensive list of why palaeontology should be can inform modern biological because studying the squashed and remains of distant relatives that lived millions of years ago in a different climate are definitely the most reliable proxy for conserving modern species it can inform modern human because studying the squashed and remains of distant relatives that lived millions of years ago in a different climate are definitely the most reliable proxy for understanding human health better value for money than the costly war last month saw yet another failed attempt in ongoing efforts to incite interplanetary war the latest called barely made a dent as it crashed into the surface of mars at tens to hundreds of millions of pounds a these missiles seem to be very if there is intelligent life out our occasional bombardment is more annoying more than threatening that same cost could finance research for the next forever instead i know which one is core to being human philosophers and wellness book authors alike have noted that the thirst for is a key human trait this is why all humans are endlessly curious about palaeontology less the or anatomy bits of palaeontology and more the century ideas of what looked like bit but you could never hold back that value for money than most arty stuff remember back in when that long model of was set on fire to burn to ashes to commemorate the anniversary of the great fire of you probably could have funded a researching with field trips for what that and it would have had a lower carbon the living as a goat or being paid to stay in for a these are all things that have received research funding that palaeontology that same funding could have been three new species of mesozoic one new and at least four new on speculate to accumulate palaeontologists may make some amazing discoveries that may not seem to mean much now but may have as unforeseen importance like or someone needs to suck the fun out can you imagine how deliriously happy all be were it not for the background pedantry of palaeontologists complaining about inaccuracies in or that or that birds are or that you use the term living it even matter that palaeontologists told us most of those things in the first place without being kept in check be so happily ignorant and confident without fear of being wrong all the time be future generations important to inspire the next generation of palaeontologists so that they too can pursue a career in palaeontology we want to be too inspiring because then there be enough people to tirelessly correct about arcane information important to understand where our species came from so important that you need to be prepared to study three degrees to get a good grasp of the current array of overlapping and conflicting theories about where our came from life is too short you know got a limited number of heartbeats in this world so if only truly happy researching fossils and can make it work for you go for it if it make you happy then find something that does and worry what other people are doing between now and the heat death of the shedding new light these are the only two acceptable journal article titles in science worlds

the design issue as an architect and a nurse i was drawn to the redesign of the hospital gown i wonder if the designer consulted with the two most important users of the the patient and the nurse hospital gowns without backs may contribute to decreased rates of bed because they can be spread apart and can prevent masses beneath the patient it is unfortunate that the current as noted in the often calls for a second gown to maintain dignity when the patient is moving around perhaps a better closure that would allow the gown to be cleared from under the patient would have been a more pertinent design solution the redesign looks cumbersome and difficult to access for patient and it has no apparent means of donning while the patient is attached to an intravenous line i am a doctoral and my main area of research is design interventions that can improve patient outcomes i support the gown but this project would not have passed a critique in a design or in the ward where i work my father was in a coma for weeks in a hospital the only thing he could do was involuntarily kick his raising his hospital gown and leaving him naked from the waist down i traveled from new city to every weekend to be with him and give mom the support she needed we tried safety pins and loose but the staff removed these my father was left for the rest of his short life with no dignity and a family who had enough to think about other than our loved one lying vulnerably naked and exposed thank i hope your wonderful designs catch on nationwide in hospitals and nursing facilities the noted the opposition of designers to opening design competitions to nonprofessionals territorial governor in persuaded that legion to hold a design contest to create a flag for the territory the contest was open to all children in seventh to grades when the winner was announced the next it was a seventh grader design later became the official state flag when attained statehood in thank you for the very inspirational issue of the magazine it reminded me in the aftermath of the apocalypse that there is still a future to look forward to that is full of brilliant the innovator of an inexpensive sanitary pad is a creative man grant i am fascinated by his understanding of reverse you take an object or service that people identify what it is they need or can get the most benefit from in that and figure out how to extract just that from more elaborate things so many of the bells and whistles add anything to our enjoyment of living result in throwaway highly impressive in theoretical knowledge and credentialed has been uncreative and officious for too long but it is finally though not in the corporations as much as in the at the grass roots of a as it is in this where the innovations will be used inventing backward by stripping the ideas behind an existing product down to its bare bones and offering what remains what called of the marketing will do more for markets and the democratization of not to mention the political health of the than any other thing inclusive markets are social and political stabilizers

ever since us presidential candidates railed against free and parties made sweeping gains in the question has been are we witnessing the demise of a trend that has dominated economics and trade for decades appears to be coming to an end as a percentage of global world which have been on a slow steady decline in the past two have peaked fines on multinationals have reached record levels breakneck is probably over a nation famous for building its empire on will exit the biggest area by the end of this decade an opponent of deals all his public is about to become president of the united states these signs point to the slow death of the form of that the rich world has refined and patrolled since the end of the second world war for the period from to marks the mark of such policies a period that came to an end with global financial crisis there is a worry that these years resemble the previously most integrated period of world the gilded age between and this ended with the first world history does not necessarily repeat itself it is important to note that global prosperity is bigger than any one nation some of the reason for the flattening off in the trend is poorer economies are growing faster than richer and they import less as developing share of global the effect will be to shrink the ratio of trade to global income others could take place as a driver of worldwide is probably the only country that has the potential to mount a transformation of similar scale and global consequence also a number of nations could the pattern of global growth the international monetary fund suggests that annual growth in a dozen countries with a combined of would add more to the global economy than the growing at full these feel like the wrong questions and answers we need to settle whether in its current incarnation aids or relieves poverty in an equitable way given the worldwide revolts on the right and left of the answer would seem to be that it fairer arrangements will help poor nations get richer trade is not a all should benefit from engaging in it but the world that exists has not been designed this way the thinking that has dominated recent decades comes from classical theory which holds that although imports do cost exports will generate new ones and competition keeps prices over everyone gains recent academic research tells a different story when economists at the institute of technology looked at the impact of the trade relationship between the united states and china they found a heavy cost to workers when jobs the paper the workers would bounce but many workers did not losses in manufacturing are magnified by being geographically concentrated and entire communities were punished little wonder perhaps that protectionist message has been central to the populist campaign that has made him the trick is not to retreat behind walls that would see a return to policies and the threat of war policymakers must go back to watching the numbers that matter to the trade deficit international prices must be fairly set so exports are not artificially expensive and imports are not artificially cheap imports from nations where rights are trampled need addressing these are concerns that sensible thinkers on the left have raised for years most notably the who has long worried about the corporate capture of trade deals his warning that president partnership operated under rules that would harm the economy and us workers was a call that went unheeded by democrats until it was too late work must be done to resolve the tensions between the nation state and global economic integration trade deals need to show nations are open for business by putting not corporate at their heart we may be at a turning point in the nature of capitalism that may not be such a bad elections
united states citizenship and immigration services sent green cards to people that contained incorrect information or were or mailed them to the wrong according to a report released on by the department of homeland office of inspector general the immigration which is part of the department of homeland told auditors that it had received more than reports of cards that were not being delivered to approved applicants the report also found that more than immigrants who were approved for conditional resident status were instead given cards that were good for years the report was a to a march review that found the agency had possibly sent hundreds of green cards to the wrong addresses the latest report said the problem was far worse than originally believed in the last three it the immigration agency produced at least cards that included incorrect information or were issued in duplicate homeland security auditors said the immigration agency had instituted several methods for addressing problems with erroneous or duplicate green cards these methods manual production controls and system enhancements have not proven adequate to ensure quality across the volume of cards produced and issued each auditors wrote director of the immigration said in a statement that it was taking steps to address the problems raised in the but added that some of the findings the report correctly points out instances in which there were errors with the data on a card or duplicate cards did not issue green cards to any individuals who were not eligible to receive he said is therefore and potentially for the to indicate that green the report released on came after an inquiry in that found the immigration agency had used incomplete fingerprint records to grant citizenship to hundreds of people who were to have been deported that also from the office of inspector found that nearly people had been granted citizenship because neither homeland security nor databases contained all of the fingerprint records of people who had previously been designated for deportation nearly older fingerprint records were not digitized or simply not included in homeland databases when they were being the report said in other fingerprints that immigration officials had taken during the deportation process were not forwarded to the the immigration agency is supposed to check the fingerprints of applicants for citizenship against a number of databases to make sure that the applicants do not have criminal records or pose a threat but because the fingerprint databases are the report the agency had no way of knowing if the individuals were y who they said they were as naturalized these individuals retain many of the rights and privileges of including serving in law obtaining a security clearance and sponsoring the entry of other foreigners into the united the report said

on the eve of the final before the presidential the candidates are focusing their attention on key swing held a rally in alongside jay and chance the spoke to a packed crowd in a hockey arena in his he said that had screamed at a when in fact had told his crowd not to boo the man at a rally in north wall street journal revealed that the national enquirer paid for a story about an affair between trump and a playboy model just to kill the story to protect his associated press revealed that trump worked illegally as a model in the us before obtaining her work a judge in issued a temporary restraining order against members of the trump campaign to prevent them from intimidating voters at trump campaigned in and in send an message that love trumps finishes is what my says have a woman who is an inspiration to so many others i thank for standing up and showing the world we are strongest when we look out for each and i thank jay for addressing in his music some of the biggest challenges in this on stage with and jay z is what is my i want to be a president who helps everyone their and i cannot do that until on we decide what kind of country we want to be she is introduced by jay and stands between them on holding hands with she her voice hoarse what an incredible performs run the and closes with quote about how she have stayed home and baked comment has some history every presidential election cycle since the magazine has published a cookie recipe from the wives the latest recipes were released of course with a twist this since is the first female nominee of a major it was her who was asked to furnish a cookie along with exactly win points for creativity this year the campaign submitted the chocolate chip a reprise of earlier oatmeal chocolate chip submissions and star readers will vote on the recipes in a poll on the this so much a story about cookies as it is a story about back in was something of an a political spouse with her own who set it aside to stand by her husband when bill became governor of her career became an issue in the democratic primary there were questions about whether bill had funneled state business into her law asked about her career in a press i suppose i could have stayed home and baked cookies and had but what i decided to do was to fulfill my which i entered before my husband was in public life and i tried very hard to be as careful as and all that i can tell some video of arrival in much awaited entrance at the rally backup dancers are wearing with was a time a opinion did not says than years ago women did not have the right to vote look how far come from having no vote to being on the brink of making history by electing the first woman with she concludes takes the stage in wearing an enormous hat is she says you so much for being here documents obtained by the associated press from years ago show that trump was paid for modeling jobs in the united states worth before she had legal permission to work in the the associated press reports the documents provide the most detailed accounting yet of first months in the she has said she followed all immigration laws as she moved from to new in august and obtained a work visa about seven weeks documents show she was paid for modeling assignments between sept and before she would have been legally allowed to be is highly unlikely that the

earth is warming due to the release of greenhouse gases scientists are working hard to measure how fast the planet is how much warming has occurred over the past few and how this is affecting coastal and fisheries by understanding these scientists can better project future climate large component of warming involves the which absorb excess heat the difficulty of gathering measurements in the oceans is that they are and often hard to reach also costly think about if you wanted to take the how would you do ocean measurements were made with buckets dropped from the sides of ships over measurements have become more numerous and more partly thanks to technology advances a global array of floats that take continuous profiles of the upper ocean monitors ocean temperatures at more than locations to depths of meters this array was put in place in prior to the backbone of ocean measurements was a device or probe called the expendable for these deployed from gather temperature data to depths of to meters as they descend through the water were designed as a inexpensive way to obtain temperature measurements from virtually any ship these were originally used by navies to determine the depth of the sound where sound waves can travel thousands of miles they were first introduced in and immediately adopted by scientists worldwide since their several million have been with some launched annually in all ocean basins a very important and critical component of their success has been the excellent relationship established by the scientific community with commercial shipping companies commercial vessels aid scientists by voluntarily deploying along routes that are continuously often in remote regions not sampled by other types of oceanographic use dating back to the these measurements offer a unique historical perspective on temperature change in the which is often associated with global warming or even varying location and the intensity of ocean currents together with those of other observational tools later put in are crucial for determining how fast the ocean is warming an essential factor for quantifying our effect on climate data are also used to measure how ocean currents change and how heat is transported across ocean both of which are linked to extreme weather events worldwide background information and photos of devices are provided at several such as through the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration oceanographic and woods hole oceanographic institution my own research has been partially focused on how to make measurements more accurate as part of this i recently attended an international meeting on hosted by the japan agency for science and technology in at the i met with colleagues from around the world to discuss how to refine and improve data from the various models of this probe an oceanographer at and of this reminded me that despite their basic probes are still relevant for scientific are simple to and provide unique data that more measurement systems still cannot retrieve i asked to summarize the role of in measuring the ocean research institutions make decisions on the type of measurement equipment they develop and and decisions made now will impact efforts of the globe for decades to come we invest in marine weather and other measurement platforms the is a device that has already successfully measured our oceans for years if other instruments have consistently delivered the and type of information about our oceans as the simple in our current uncertain state about the future of organizations like and and with great uncertainty about what measurement tools will be the reminds us that cheap instruments have their consensus the

countdown to pearl twelve days to the pp as we approach the anniversary of the attack on pearl the story of how could have been caught by surprise on remains one of overly vague bureaucratic breakdowns as with the equally audacious attacks that came years a failure of imagination when the navy department in sent a to the naval forces at pearl harbor days before planes appeared over the only direct order in the short was for the admiral in charge of the pacific fleet to an appropriate defensive that husband had been more focused on planning for an eventual move against the elsewhere in the pacific he largely ignored the broadly worded instructions after the assumption among government and military officials was that the would attack a united or territory somewhere in the southwest pacific not thousands of miles to the east in there would be neither fully functional radar nor any reconnaissance planes to detect the raid that came early on a morning nor would there be any metal netting in the harbor to protect the fleet from the torpedoes that would claim ships for a the all of assumptions proved faulty pearl harbor was not too shallow to be at risk of torpedo the were not constrained by the knowledge that they were unlikely to win a long war against a greater industrial and despite the crude racial stereotypes of that there was nothing in the ethnic makeup of the people that somehow made them incapable of piloting planes off aircraft carriers to unleash a punishing assault tutors had as one newspaper report speculated even in the days after the been needed to instruct the how to plan the attack had never been anything remotely like it in the history of naval writes of the warplanes sent aloft from aircraft carriers just years after the invention of flight they would claim over lives infusing a story with to pearl reconstructs the glaring errors of the secret effort to intercept encrypted communication and the fruitless diplomatic negotiations between and a former post veers between the attack pearl harbor and while adhering to the chronological order of events the effect can be dizzying at as introduces an enormous cast of at least one major new figure seemingly brought forth in every chapter but his narrative is gripping he does not uncover any fresh documents or offer a revisionist account he relies heavily on the nine official inquiries into the assault and the oral diaries and other papers from the actors who were unable to prevent what franklin decided to call date which will live in wisely altered the original draft from date which will live in world the record is damning in the week leading up to the of something massive had made their way to pacific command the changed their radio call signs at an irregular their ships were on the move and military intelligence had lost track of four of their carriers and by the navy department was conscious enough of a threat that it radioed officials at pearl harbor authorizing them to instruct other military bases in the pacific to destroy secret documents but the prospect of an airborne attack on unthinkable after a few days on had asked his war plans officer if there was any chance the would be so bold the officer replied
i am concerned about the planned move towards paperless receipts to trial paperless receipts on there are still shoppers who do not and perhaps do not a phone the most important function of a paper receipt provided at the till is that it proves the customer has paid this is doubly important given that large supermarket chains can ban from their stores anyone they believe has left without paying i leave a shop without a paper the shop makes a mistake and accuses me of how do i prove that i did i have never been in this but always ask for a receipt as proof this also means that if i then go into another shop selling the same item i can prove i bought it a situation i have and building

scientists have warned that central faces a serious risk of suffering further devastating earthquakes in the near future the region in central north of has already been struck by three major tremors over the past few weeks seismologists believe a further earthquake could soon strike the what we have discovered about these three related there is a real chance that there is going to be another significant quake in the region in the very near said a lecturer in earth science at university is well within the bounds of are caused when enormous amounts of energy are released as sections of subjected to intense pressure miles move abruptly this energy is released in the form of seismic which cause the ground to sometimes with highly destructive western the region with the highest seismic hazard is the mountainous backbone of peninsular the it has a long record of earthquakes spanning back to roman of quake now know that the region is prone to earthquakes because it is being stretched in a direction at a rate of about a year is roughly a tenth of the rate at which your fingernails said of this geological stretching is due to the underground tectonic plates on which sits and which are moving apart in it is thought that mantle under the crust is pushing upwards and this also leads to pulling of the crust across leads to the of elastic which is suddenly in earthquakes we do not know the exact timing of when this is going to added a sequence of including six that had magnitudes of between and on the struck the region and killed people more than were left homeless and in the city of was struck by a quake which left people more than injured and more than the most recent earthquakes have been the most dramatic on this there was a earthquake near that killed more than people this was followed by a which struck on one man died after a heart days the village of was destroyed by a earthquake two women died of heart attacks during the three earthquakes were closely said earthquakes occurs when there is a slip at an underground fault which releases energy but it transfers stress on to a fault this effect can trigger other now believe that the august earthquake at damaged two nearby geological known as and the latest earthquakes on and have further broken portions of the fault so only the top segments of these faults appear to have been but the deeper regions soon could be opens up the prospect that the lower part of the fault could still fail and we would get another big said was a he added in there was a quake in when there was slippage in the shallow section of geological fault ten months the deeper section suffered a similar triggering a new earthquake could be a possibility said would not like to rule that seismologists have found no signs on the surface to indicate where and when that underground slippage will occur techniques include measuring strain rates in looking for changes in electrical signals from and examining alterations in the of ground searching for chemical or thermal anomalies in a or electromagnetic variations none has proved know there is a real risk of another but cannot say exactly where it will strike or disasters and extreme

in the to the presidential new city was hardly trump territory and every time put another display of trump campaign signs up on the lawn of his sizable white house on road in last they were stolen or knocked actions that would later set off a series of events as unpredictable as the election itself infuriated by the as well as an obscenity about j trump that had been on the public mailbox in front of his installed a security camera it captured a grainy image of a and a real estate then printed fliers bearing the image and a reward offer for information leading to the arrest of the sign thief he hired some local teenagers to post the signs around the neighborhood with tape when the tape ran he the teenagers used a stapler to post the fliers to trees on the streets the hubbub made the and the stapling method was mentioned in the weeks that a team of enforcement officers from the parks department arrived at he and issued him summonses with fines totaling and citing unauthorized posting and tree to trees to his real transgression was supporting a which he claims annoyed democratic city officials call it said who calls himself a a proud gun owner and a fan of and john a supporter of democratic would never have been cited in this he and said that official parks department signs are often affixed to trees with similar staples in new city like he said wanted to teach me a lesson about being and about who i believe in so they found something to hang their hat said he paid the summonses because want the of fighting nor the expense of hiring a lawyer instead of backing he splurged on a larger trump banner to hang in front of his and he called the prominent civil rights lawyer to see if he had any grounds to sue the city for damages claiming political bias in an said that he thought the summons was wild by the but that a suit by claiming enforcement based on his trump leanings would be difficult case to a parks department spokesman dismissed the claim that the summonses were political and called them a routine penalty for damage to the trees fine had nothing to do with the content of the signs posted and everything to do with the fact that staples can damage and even kill the said in a statement he added that the fine was determined by the administrative court and based on the amount of damage or the cost but rather on the rule the order to cite set off something of a parallel episode within the parks department an enforcement supervisor ordered a sergeant to write the tickets but the arguing that it was improper to write summonses weeks after the signs had been with no witnesses to the violations were bogus said sergeant a veteran with years on the job might as well hit every dog owner who puts up a he said he also consulted a superior he told out of it too a rookie officer wound up writing the said sergeant who has had previous with the agency as an outspoken member of his local of the characterized department officials as using the officers as for their political in this case sergeant said he was included in an email conversation about possibly forcing to pay in damage for the staple a proposition that an agency lawyer replied to in the email chain as for victory is a bit of revenge last he bought and hung a larger banner told you the banner reads trump trump

over the past president v of has received two starkly different messages about hacking into computer networks from the current and future presidents of the united you and not even sure it was you the white house confirmed in a statement on that eight days before the presidential the united states the government directly regarding malicious that was state it sent the message over a rarely used a connecting the nuclear risk reduction centers in both which they had agreed three years ago could also be employed to deal with major the warning only the latest after verbal cautions by president his defense secretary and the director of national intelligence was reported by the post the warnings to against further hacking into polling or registration or any further effort to affect the outcome of the are being hailed by the administration as a success in deterrence after they a year and a half of hacking activity seemed to or and there is no evidence that voting or counting of ballots was disrupted on election day but more than a few experts in deterring take a more skeptical view they say the had already achieved their main to demonstrate how they could disrupt the electoral process with the leak of hacked including from the democratic national committee and campaign john d suffered nothing worse than a they note no no counter no embarrassing revelations engineered by the united states and he now has the satisfaction of dealing with j who during the campaign praised promised to build a more productive relationship with and maintained there was no evidence that the were behind the hacking anything wrong happens they like blame the trump said in an debate with know if the doing the hacking maybe there is no trump contended that the allegations of activity were intended to for advocating a new relationship with he frequently repeated similar sentiments in the last weeks of the suggesting the hacking was a fabrication the leaks of emails worked largely to his embarrassing democratic leaders like representative of who was forced to resign as the chairwoman of the democratic national committee larger strategic message is that the united states and need to cooperate on a range of issues but for now the situation underscores the uncertainty around the world about the direction of foreign policy and gives the opportunity to exploit differences between the current president and his successor until trump is inaugurated on it is also raising the question of whether the white house pushed back hard enough when intelligence agencies concluded on that officials could have authorized these a a computer expert at the center for strategic and international studies in dismissed the claim that it had deterred hacking seems a little bold to claim this is a success for since the deterred from doing he said hacking work was mostly complete the issue now is whether they will be deterred in the and the guessing is they will not strong private warnings enough to constitute in the appear to have paid less of a price for their hacking around the election than north did for its attack on pictures entertainment in that attack melted down about percent of computers and servers at its wreaking considerable and embarrassed many executives it was in response to the release of a that imagined a plot to kill the north leader after the the united states issued more sanctions against north and encouraged china to limit the all of which runs through switching centers many experts had expected the white house to follow a similar path with the white house concluded that the and the unstated suggestion that the united states had the power to reach inside networks and see the origin of might suffice it is not clear if the administration plans any other actions against before departure from but that seems less and less likely the warning did not deal with the hacking of the democratic national committee or which r clapper the director of national had previously said was conducted with the knowledge of the leadership it referred only to the concerns about hacking around the election process and the fear it was originating from though it stopped short of saying it was a attack
is promising the people a deal that is and according to the dutch finance minister and delivered a scathing attack on after the foreign secretary claimed the would probably be leaving the customs union while also seeking free trade with the and extra immigration controls told the think offering to the people options that are really not available for to say we could be inside the internal market but be outside the customs this is it just exist the opposite does exist we have a customs union with turkey but turkey is not part of the internal saying things that are intellectually politically so i think not offering the people a fair view of what is available and what can be achieved in these as a would be in my interests and in and interests if the would stay in the but i think going to happen the next best option is to have as good an agreement as possible but the will be outside the single market and there will be some the customs union would allow the to strike trade deals independently with countries but has told cabinet ministers that it could seriously harm the economy by causing extra border checks and strategy also came under fire on from an who described it as chaotic and slammed the for holding the hostage to conservative party infighting needs to tell us and it needs to be something that makes the economic development told say that sensible to say we want access to the single market but no free circulation of people obvious that make any sense a former envoy to lots of chaos and we understand what the position is all becoming an internal which is not the government to sit put its cards on the table and he further negative comments on personal said the foreign secretary had told him during a recent meeting that would grant access to the single market you want to lose basically want free movement of people but i want the single said he sell less i sell less fish and but sell less to one country and sell less to putting things on this level is a bit insisted he understood the vote to respect the england is to me a source of great inspiration as you can see from standing he pointing to a cardboard cutout of in his office according to the figure holds a sign reading in capital is the ability to tell someone to go to hell in such a way that they look forward to the you make a you need to be clear in bill the finance told radio today that would not be negotiating a trade deal with the until it was out of whether the pending free trade deal would automatically result in a free trade deal on the same terms after he going to respect the agreement that the has with and stand ready to work together after the also appeared to be standing firm on defending the fundamental principle of free movement within the on but conceded there could be room for further discussion around whether welfare benefits should be immediately available for life if an citizen moved to another member

senator chuck of new planning on being leader of the senate minority and by extension the democratic opposition as the trump era dawns in the capital i regret what said who was hoping to be president right hand as senate majority leader before both he and came up short of their election day goals moments at do i think what could have i am fully occupied with the job at said in an interview in his senate office on just a few days after being formally chosen by his colleagues to succeed his senator harry of as leader of the senate democrats that in is to serve as the bulwark against a unified republican government led by his former campaign j to use the power of the senate minority to try to force compromise when and to stand in the way of republicans when necessary are the said noting that the rules of the senate at least as they currently exist give democrats there much more power than their house counterparts to hold the line against republican policies they oppose he is going to agree on issues like trade and transportation infrastructure in a very real way with we have an obligation to pursue said about who quickly reached out to by phone after his presidential victory at the same we have an obligation to oppose him on all the places where he tramples on our travels with racism or just dismantles things because the right wing tells him to do so that is where we are it is a delicate balance and talk of cutting deals with trump and senator the republican and majority has already alarmed some democrats who want no cooperation whatsoever with trump or the senate republicans who sat on president supreme court nomination of b garland would be a dereliction of our responsibility if we said who munched casually on a frozen three musketeers bar as he laid out his vision long as we sell we have an obligation to the millions of who are those are at the center of emerging strategy he believes that trump won by appealing to the middle of with what was essentially a democratic economic message on trade and job creation he is convinced he can leverage that with the new president are president you have two work with us and you will have to alienate your republican or break your promises to he said believe that voted for trump mainly because of democratic issues like not for republican issues like tax cuts for the that any legislation that can entice democrats will have to be substantial and not be used to chip away at other or they will not hesitate to oppose it for he noted that he had quickly issued a statement skeptical of the nomination of senator the republican and occasional senate gym workout for attorney and would be giving all nominees thorough scrutiny and he said some issues were simply such as reversing wall street and banking reforms enacted after the economic collapse it comes to repealing any of as they say in said the who also said democrats would not cooperate in any way with overturning the affordable care act democrats did pick up two seats with wins in and new narrowing the republican majority and making it that much more difficult for to round up the votes needed to overcome or perhaps even muster a simple majority though we get the those two votes will be invaluable in stopping republicans from doing bad said does not believe republicans will be eager to eliminate the ability to mount filibusters against preserving a chief minority weapon he hopes that any supreme court nominee can win bipartisan but if republicans threaten to eliminate the ability to filibuster he has an argument ready said to you come before this with clean hands because of what you did with who even get a hearing and who was clearly a mainstream said after an increasingly strained relationship between and believes he can negotiate with the top republican wants to make things work and i want to make things he said we will certainly both stand for our principles and each side will respect the we can get a lot more done than has been done in the but it will definitely be a challenge and it was not the one had hoped to face

director set off a torrent of criticism late last week when he directly inserted himself into the presidential campaign with a vague letter to congress about the reopening of email case his conduct has shocked many observers across the political but the only thing truly surprising about this episode is that people are only now realizing how and dangerous actually his stints in the bush and administration has continually taken authoritarian and factually dubious public stances both at odds with responsible public policy and sometimes the law the case is not an part of a clear were once enthralled when appointed the republican as chief in they talked about as if he was above reproach because of his role as acting attorney general under w when he threatened to resign over an aspect of the illegal wiretapping explained at the time of confirmation in this story is incredibly misleading did curtail a small part of the sprawling surveillance program in that occurred before the public ever knew of the existence of any domestic program the version of illegal wiretapping that the new times revealed in which sparked a firestorm of liberal criticism and widespread accusations of illegal was the program that was totally fine with and signed off he is celebrated as anything close to the hero is baffling during the bush also aggressively defended the arrest and due imprisonment of a us on us soil he was held as an and refused a lawyer for three and half years to this one of the most egregious violations of the constitution by the bush administration in also gave his legal on torture techniques during the bush despite harboring personal taking over at the speaking up without all or any of the facts has become a specialty he has led a fight to essentially outlaw a vital tool that protects privacy and security he has done so freely admitting he know what talking while his demands fly in the face of the opinions of many prominent computer who have argued mandating in encryption is impossible to do safely and a recipe for having failed to convince the public despite claiming it was vital the public debate the issue he then went to a judge to try to force apple to its own encryption using a law written in the as previously a for former attorney general wrote in politico in steamrolled his white house and pentagon colleagues even scuttling an encryption policy that was under development by insisting that apple be forced to unlock the phone for the last wholly without promoted the discredited arguing that crime has increased because police were afraid to do their jobs now that there is a slightly higher chance that citizens might film them shooting an unarmed person not only do studies show this theory is false that crime has not markedly an insult to police officers ought to stick to what he o executive director of the national fraternal order of told the new referring to basically saying that police officers are afraid to do their jobs with absolutely no as president and many politicians in both parties have called for a reduction in harsh mandatory minimum prison sentences that have made the us by far the largest jailer in the publicly spoke out against any such criminal justice reform know from my experience that the mandatory minimums are an important tool in developing he said evidence shows the mandatory minimums have never been shown to make anyone safer or increase euphemism for threatening defendants with decades in jail so they forgo their constitutional right to jury trial and take a plea but facts have never gotten in the way of and his does the when it suits him in the was told by the bush justice department that it needed a warrant to gather email records and web browsing about but under the agency has continued to disregard the justice legal and to this demands tech companies hand it all sorts of data under free national security two months wrote in is a growing consensus that has wielded the powers of the directorship more aggressively than anyone since to the and even of some of his evidence against has been available ever since president nominated him all changed is that people are finally paying elections
a recently leaked memo from a consultancy firm has highlighted cabinet divisions over withdrawal from the while suggesting that the government may need six additional months to settle on a plan and to recruit tens of thousands of extra civil servants the document identified tensions between enthusiasts for including the foreign and the international trade and those fighting to preserve closer economic ties to the such as the the enthusiasts believe has to make a clean break with the while the more cautious types want to preserve access to the market by maintaining membership in the customs union or the single or perhaps some combination of the two as prime minister deadline of march for starting negotiations on withdrawal with the union draws this clash is emerging as the primary sticking point but it is proving remarkably difficult to resolve both the customs union and the single market eliminate tariffs between member states the customs union sets tariffs with so members share a common trade policy with the rest of the world the single market removes trade for instance by maintaining common product standards unlike most free trade the single market also covers some which are crucial for with its big financial sector for without single market banks based in could not offer many services to clients in continental nations has considerable not access to the single market without being part of the or its customs through membership in the economic area the downside is that has no vote in making rules it must follow a maze of rules and regulations aimed at leveling the playing field and harmonizing product standards infuriates and helped fuel the campaign to leave the known as more leaders of the union are adamant that all members of the single market adhere to the four free movement of goods and services yet control of immigration was seen by many as the driving force behind the vote so that chasm needs to be bridged the question is how to secure full single market would most likely have to contribute to the union accept the free movement of workers from the rest of the and accept rulings from the court of justice or a similar body such as the free trade agreement court that would be a tough sell to hardened supporters of in conservative party it might be not all members belong to the for is not a union member but is in the customs union would be able to trade freely in goods within the which would free it of the burden and inefficiency of checking the origins of all the products coming to and from the bloc but would have to comply with some union regulations quitting the customs union could mean significant new for example for automakers the is reported to want to retain customs union membership as little as possible accused of lacking a it refuses to give a running saying that would weaken its negotiating position but officials had not prepared for before the referendum and are having to examine its impact on every sector of the economy a huge exercise in doing they appear to be uncovering more questions than answers in she stressed the importance of regaining control of immigration policy and of freeing from the court of justice comments that suggested she was aligning herself with the proponents of a clean break that set off a precipitous decline in the pound but she has since tread more saying that does not face a choice between maintaining a formal relationship with the union either in the customs union or the single or some combination of the two or a complete divorce that implies that she wants some kind of hybrid settlement this might mean then opting back into parts of economic for example those that help finance and the auto while offering some budget contributions in exchange nations are not so sure to many it sounds like a variant of statement as far as the union is he is pro having his cake and pro eating it president of the responded to that by inviting to undertake an a eat and see if it is still there on the decision to quit the union was fundamentally a political rather than so it is logical to assume that politics will shape the negotiating position of its too many nations will resist any agreement with that undermines the fundamental particularly the movement of or its basic economic structures the fear is that this would prompt other countries to copy the which could be the beginning of the end of the entire postwar drive to greater integration though is a big the rest of the union collectively is and therefore the survival of the single market of the is more important to most nations
ask detailed questions about executive the duties of directors and the composition of boards and you can expect to be overwhelmed by answers that cover little common ground that is the experience of the business select committee as responses arrive to its corporate governance inquiry the may regret setting the terms of reference so best throw the technical tweaks in the bin and concentrate on the simple ideas a proposal on pay that starts from admirably straightforward premise that executive remuneration system is seriously discredited and needs substantial says the institute of business ethics it says cash should be restored as the essential currency of paying executives in other abolish share performance share deferred awards and most of the padding of modern remuneration schemes the law should be changed to forbid payments that cannot be valued properly at the time of would go but the institute proposes a few executives would have to spend an agreed portion of their higher salaries on the shares and then hold that stock for even beyond retirement any salary increase or cash bonus become effective until shareholders had voted if the executives still wanted big cash bonuses than of have to give the same award in proportion to all which would be main advantage of this approach is that executives would build up a shareholding over time and receive dividends on those which should encourage more thinking in boardrooms which the outside world rightly regards as a racket because zero is awarded only when catastrophe would become a and shareholders would be directly on the hook for what executives are practical difficulty is that the public might not like the notion that a chief salary could become or more once the carrots are scrapped but the virtues of the system would be simplicity and which are currently woefully as the institute did not there would be another benefit the small industry of remuneration which has grown rich by peddling baffling pay schemes that produce perverse could be made redundant few would mourn its the booze a bit rich for the chairman of pub chain to complain about how the result of the referendum has created uncertainties for his his customers and his suppliers he might have considered the possibility before distributing beer mats promoting exit from the not be too churlish about lively rant about the and bullying adopted by and the man he calls unelected behind the rhetoric lies a serious punters drink an awful lot of continental champagne and beer and cider are extreme claims if consumers take at the idea that the country must be punished for leaving the he is surely matters in expecting a patriotic rebellion by consumers but the tariff system on wine imports to the single market was designed to protect the industry like the powerful agricultural lobby will also be very keen for trading in food and drink to on persimmon says the referendum had no impact on its sales over the summer but the line that will annoy may as she attempts to boost the number of homes built in the the second biggest says it is turning on land purchases because of uncertainty surrounding the potential impact of the referendum result on the in land and house construction are not the same of but nor are they unrelated the government would rightly be miffed by any sign of a by a company that enjoyed a profit margin last thanks in part to those help to buy and is overflowing with cash but what could may actually do to give persimmon and its peers a if she has the she shared on drink
despite overwhelming scientific evidence that the climate is the of the united j has long been on the side of the deniers in he posted on twitter a couple of messages that asserted that climate change was a hoax that china had devised to secure an unfair trade presumably because the administration was seeking to curb coal consumption in the united states concept of global warming was created by and for the in order to make manufacturing trump wrote that message has been more than times and nearly times on a deputy foreign minister of told reporters at a climate conference in that starting from the the administrations of republican predecessors presidents and bush supported climate change negotiations under a united nations panel that was apparently an important moment in realization of the onset of climate change said that president xi brought up the issue in his call with trump on saying that china would continue its struggle to curb climate change the according to news lecturing the united states on the need to fight climate change is a reversal from the usual roles and a sign with the united states governed by china may have to take the leadership position in the global campaign under president the united states government persuaded china to announce important pledges in the fight against climate change in xi stood next to in and said that china would ensure that its greenhouse gas emissions peaked by and that percent of its energy would come from fuel sources by that year pledged to greatly reduce coal use by diplomats and climate negotiators have been meeting in this week to discuss steps needed to carry out the climate which was negotiated last year and which china and the united states signed this year there has been much anxiety over whether trump might try to withdraw the united states from the pact after he takes office but the agreement now has enough countries as signatories to make it legally and trump may have a hard time extricating the united states from the deal in other countries have said they intend to go ahead with the plan on their own is a new world the executive director of the united nations environment said in on climate change policy has now gone to the developing china among having the united states on board would be hugely helpful in trying to meet the ambitious goal of keeping the future increase in global temperatures below degrees the united states is the emitter of greenhouse after china researchers say greenhouse gas emissions have leveled off for at least three years mostly because of a drop in coal consumption in china a major reason is the slowing economy but it is still unclear whether emissions have hit a well before the deadline china is already grappling with the direct consequences of climate like melting glaciers in western mountain ranges and expanding deserts

hiring him they it was driven by breaches during admiral tenure at the and his leadership of the agency the white house and the pentagon declined to comment on admiral fate reached by phone on admiral rogers declined to comment the effort to force out admiral which was first reported by the puts trump in the position of considering whether to as the man who would brief him on intelligence matters each a admiral whom the white house is considering relieving of his posts it also raises the question of why would consider firing one of the top intelligence officers in the last days of his administration admiral replacement would not be confirmed until after trump takes over one senior intelligence official argued that letting word of the effort leak seemed more about politics or vengeance than about effecting any real change representative of the chairman of the house intelligence committee and a member of transition strongly defended admiral rogers in a letter to carter and asked them to testify before his committee to explain why they want to push rogers out not by accident that admiral rogers meets with the and two days later this which is completely built on said in a short interview carter and clapper had submitted a formal recommendation to the white house to split the which conducts foreign surveillance and secures military from the command but there are questions inside the giant complex at fort where the and command are about whether the military is ready to survive on its own it relies heavily on the talent of the which dates back to the early who has begun filling the top echelons of his national security team with met with admiral rogers on at trump tower in new senior defense department and intelligence officials were surprised that admiral while on personal had paid a visit to trump first major disagreement with admiral rogers dates to the fall of when he expressed mounting frustration that which is responsible for offensive action against was not acting aggressively enough to disrupt the networks in and in the carter said for the first time that the united states was using its against the state but the effort was moving too slowly for the pentagon and carter went to fort several weeks ago to give admiral rogers and his team kick in the one official said top national security officials had also come to see admiral rogers as lacking leadership at a moment of wrenching change for the he took command after the disclosures of widespread surveillance by j the former and the efforts he directed to seal up the agency proved they said that perception was underlined by the disclosure in that the had secretly arrested a former t martin and was investigating whether he had stolen and disclosed highly classified computer code developed by the agency to hack into the networks of foreign governments martin was charged with theft of government property and the unauthorized removal or retention of classified documents administration officials had planned to relieve admiral rogers of his duties after the election and announce a plan to create separate chains of command for the and command but the supported by carter and stalled in part because of opposition from senator john republican of who heads the armed services committee under the command would remain under the armed services but oversight of the would shift to the senate intelligence committee victory complicated the planning on one major trump and admiral rogers disagree quite publicly while trump has insisted that no one knows whether was responsible for the hacking of email accounts of the democratic national committee and a range of prominent formal admiral rogers has said he has no doubt he recently said that was not something that was done this was not something that was done by this was not a target that was selected purely he was a conscious effort by a to attempt to achieve a specific coming into the admiral rogers said one of his top goals was to make sure that on the united states had consequences for the attackers in he proposed a series of possible options to respond to the which intelligence in a public said the leadership had to have been aware of but the white house rejected the fearing that they could start an escalating that the united states might not be able to win decisively

each dozens of families pick their way some carrying white flags even as they come under mortar or sniper fire from the state billowing black clouds from oil wells set on fire by militants provide a background to the scenes of it is so bad south of that the sheep there have begun turning black the military campaign to retake is in its sixth week and bogged down in a grueling fight seeking to escape the more civilians than ever are taking the risk of hoping to find help if they can make it past the gun range the numbers tell one almost people have been displaced so roughly half of them according to the united nations but the exodus is really only getting started there could be a million more people still in most clustered on the west of the where the fighting has not reached for those who have been able to reach the aid camps miles outside the there has been an initial glimpse of hope and relief like these displaced at the camp outside find that aid workers and soldiers are quick to offer handing out cookies or traditional bread but it is a particularly hazardous journey for men fearing that state fighters will try to escape by posing as the forces are separating men from their families for questioning in past the process proved ripe for the word of an unnamed informant can be enough to send a man to leaving countless families wondering what happened to their husbands and sons these men were questioned by intelligence officers outside south of as the war against the state has more than three million mostly are now thought to be displaced with most of them still unable to return to their homes even in cities long ago reclaimed from the like and aid camps have had to serve as home amid the there are still touching scenes of reunions at the as family members who had left two years ago are brought together with loved ones who had stayed behind until like this group of relatives at the camp a few weeks from the village of near saw her husband for the first time in more than two years she even been able to talk with him over those as the state had banned communication with the outside world told we find a cellphone on we will behead she said but just as there is more families cut off from one another amid the chaos of battle last who had left an area south of and lives in a camp near was because he could not find his parents have not heard from he said am always as he an older woman approached with a sad story of a lost daughter knows where she she said when the battle everyone hoped the state would abandon the as it had in it dug in for a last stand with the fighting becoming ever more brutal and drawn humanitarian workers are concerned that forces will adopt more aggressive putting civilians at greater risk when the fight officers worried the state would destroy the bridges over the that connect east and west cutting off trapped civilians now coalition warplanes are knocking the bridges out themselves to prevent the state from bringing supplies and car bombs into the east there is talk of an siege of the city center and the united nations is busily expanding some camps and building more to accommodate perhaps hundreds of thousands more displaced like in the rapidly expanding camp below some fear that the increasing number of and their could bring another wave of sectarian revenge in a country rife with it extremists who would later identify with the state forged their identity with the widespread killing of during sectarian civil war last and again when the militant group blitzed across in when and other cities were seized but the sectarian focus did not keep it from oppressing civilians under its rule now hundreds of thousands of them are flowing into areas like where they are met with suspicion and where memories of abuses under oligarchy are still fresh the fighting drags and each day there are more families trickling out of the battleground in a new ritual of coming and going when the offensive began in in some officials quietly expressed hope that it might be wrapped up by the end of president term but most public estimates envisioned a fight stretching over and that appears to be coming true many officials now predict the fight could stretch on until the most likely making the and its effect on part of j inheritance
is riding a stallion instead of a unicorn into the revolution despite no stated cost the percent premium the electronics group agreed to pay for a is reasonable companies like are investing heavily to invent the automotive future as general motors and others bet on risky this deal suggests there are safer ways to play a in the making the billion price looks opportunistic and fair for a company that will presence in what it expects to be a billion market by shares hit a low in reflecting concerns that car suppliers face tougher times as the long boom in auto sales fades general motors last week underscored the worries by announcing a reduction of jobs at factories in the united after news of similar cuts by ford motor despite the has been trying to position itself for the longer term while it is best known for its features like communications and car safety accounted for nearly half of sales in the last year they are likely to grow in importance as computers take over from humans at the wheel a lack of advertised cost cuts probably means that which plans to run as an independent will have to rely on revenue gains to recoup its investment it would only take slashing costs equivalent to percent of next sales to cover the but it is also reasonable to think that combining products with brands and customers could result in faster growth than either company could manage separately that makes a more sensible way to gain exposure to the next generation of cars than building technology from scratch the way apple and are doing investments such as the million gm made in the and its acquisition of cruise the software offer huge but with accompanying risk should be a good ride down the middle of the road
gen t the designated national security adviser for the incoming trump once wrote on twitter that it was to fear but that does not seem likely to cause him any grief with even though it is led by a religiously conservative has paid far more attention to general support for and especially its wish to extradite the scholar from his sanctuary in the mountains of general wrote an article published in the hill on election day calling on the united states to be more sympathetic to the concerns of a and embracing position that is an extremist who was behind the failed coup against his government and his supporters deny and depict him as a moderate more concerned with building thousands of schools than with toppling government was once an ally of but they had a falling out general as politico did not disclose that he was a paid lobbyist for a consultancy founded by a who is also the head of the business council denied in a telephone interview on that the council was a government entity or that the contract with general had anything to do with the article in the hill assumption that general wrote that in the context of a lobbying contract with me is completely said never consulted with me i would have advised against and he said the notion that would pay to have the article published was citing its criticism of the which has supported in the past the discussion of general connections has occurred in the context of j promise to prevent officials in his administration from lobbying for foreign governments once they leave office spoke warmly of trump in a speech after the one in which he also accused of receiving campaign contributions from the camp said he had hired general company to consult on the security environment in connection with a commercial venture he was considering one of general associates suggested that the company also advocate for better relations between the united states and which would require registering as lobbyists with the united states said the company did register as lobbyists on behalf of but not even sure any lobbying got added lobby for the government i lobby the government of general he is not a guy who would be influenced by a contract he wrote what he declined to say how large the contract was tens of thousands of not hundreds of thousands of he said a commentator writing in the daily a contended that general article would not have been commissioned by the government knows that you change a former senior opinions by hiring his firm with a wrote a commentator for a point of appointment is a globally he exactly what we mean by extrapolating from extremists to all you would expect to see that concern but quite the is quite a respected figure now in government just because he wrote that should be extradited to turkey was greeted with great happiness said he added that supporters had reacted to it somebody in who understands
double toil and that time of year when green face paint and black pointy hats are small children will be knocking on doors carrying little plastic which hopefully will be filled with sweets and treats rather than eye of newt and toe of modern idea of witches is a complex mix of cultural influences from to the wizard of oz and many things in between many of these influences are fictional and created purely for but only a few centuries ago witches and witchcraft in and were seen as a real threat it has been estimated that there between and witch trials were carried out in and between and spates of accusations often occurred during times of plague or the failure of harvests but there are many other reasons behind these trials and they are often linked to the particular circumstances at a specific location midwives and nurses sometimes came under suspicion because of their knowledge and success or failure in treating those who were sick these healing roles were traditionally taken on by women until around the turn of the nineteenth were excluded from formal medical training many still practiced medicine in their homes and and what they had learned came from shared knowledge and trial and rather than accepted official sources a medical education might not have been a great help in any case in the days before germ theory the causes of sickness and the reasons for recovery were not obvious any recoveries could be seen as miraculous or the result of witchcraft treating sickness and disease theory was largely guesswork all sorts of noxious compounds were administered to ailing and if they produced any effect on the be it or it was seen as a good thing and that was the practice of the professionals it is not hard to see how images of unofficial healers and herbalists men and stooping over boiling pots of roots and could become a template for the image of a especially when many of the concoctions they produced had such unpleasant effects on their said herbalists and traditional healers should not be dismissed as completely ignorant of the medical benefits of some of the plants and poultices they used some of the ingredients associated with traditional healing and potions have been found to be hugely beneficial to medicine once they have been tested and modified science has enabled us to identify the key components of some plants and test them to determine how and when they should be administered safely and effectively chemists have modified the structures of some of the compounds to reduce make drugs more potent or lower their toxicity for digitalis the source of heart drugs that save thousands of lives was first tested and used in a scientific way by withering in the but withering found out about using foxgloves to treat his patients from wise woman of withering was using concoctions from the whole plant rather than isolated giving hugely variable results because he could not accurately control the doses of the active ingredients his medication would still have contained many other potentially harmful compounds from the plant work was a huge step towards effective trials of drugs and monitoring of their both good and bad digitalis is not an isolated effective treatments for pain and a few medical conditions have been albeit in crude for centuries even some of the additions to the cauldron in have since been shown to have medical benefit

one of the reasons behind the witch though others have cast doubts on the are many other plants that have been linked to witches potions but one of the most significant is belladonna or deadly is just one plant of the family that contains an important drug used in medical applications as varied as ophthalmology and treating slow heart rates or can also cause difficulties keeping track of time and feelings of dissociation from the ground under the influence of some of those accused of witchcraft in centuries gone by may have genuinely believed they have hardly scratched the surface of the

it happened so one moment i was running the next i was staring a sow in the so close i could smell wild and pungent and and i knew it could smell my fear i was in the middle of a rainy run in far north bicentennial park on the outskirts of where i live it was late a time when grizzlies sweep down from the mountains to feast on the salmon swimming up creek but i was miles from the water i had planned my route away from the and i seen bear scat in more than an hour as i crested a a crash sounded from my and i instinctively moved to the expecting a moose but it was the sow with three cubs the cubs fled up a tree the sow paused in front of as if waiting i backed into the fortifying myself behind a skinny grove of alder moving never taking my eyes off the bear when it veered as if to leave i felt such relief that my throat loosened and small gasps escaped my lips then it abruptly turned and charged directly at me impossible to run the trails around without thinking about bears there are piles of scat dotted with blueberry and cranberry seeds that glint in the reminders that you have to be careful you have to be versed in bear bear etiquette and bear protocol headphones are a and going alone is discouraged making noise and carrying bear spray is recommended i often ran alone i preferred it that way i liked the serenity and the liked the hours of nothing but me and the mountains and the trees that i wore a bear bell attached to my hydration and i whenever i came to dense areas i sang old rock roll loudly and badly i was cautious but not afraid i ran these trails all summer and the summer and while i saw bears on many other i only twice saw them on these sections maybe i let down my guard maybe i felt the way you feel when you repeat risky behavior without negative results maybe the bear was having a bad day when the bear time stood still i felt every millisecond i stood in the rain coating my face like and i did what they tell you to do if a black bear i waved my arms and yelled i my voice rising through the birch through that silent and moment a the bear paused and ran back toward the brush a minute it charged a second time and again i waved my arms and yelled and again it this time so close i could almost reach out and touch its snout i swallow i briefly and almost if this was how i would die i wanted to talk to my who was grown and off living his own life i wanted to hear his voice a lifetime the bear turned and ran its backside swaying into the trees i had to get back to the to the possibility of yet i step away from the alders it was my only protection when the bear began circling around me in a wide arc when i knew i was in became really afraid when my son was young and nothing would comfort i would talk it matter what i he needed my the steady flow of words as i stepped from the shelter of the i talked out my voice surprisingly calm i talked to the bear to show that i meant no but mostly i talked to reassure myself as the bear circled for a second i stumbled through snagging my shorts and scratching my and i talked about the day my son was how i recognized his face immediately when i reached the i kept talking the bear but i look back a half a mile i glanced over my and the bear was gone i started running and stop until i encountered two and i collapsed at their feet for weeks i saw that face in my and i woke heart pounding i swore i would never run trails but i missed it too and soon i was out with the trees and that big sky some things are worth the though i made sure to carry a canister of bear just in case and sometimes even now when i think of that bear charging and how i stood so still and yet so alive it opened something inside of me that can never be closed it offered a taste of the at any time i might find myself crouched in the face to face with my own fragile existence so much of life is chance there are no guarantees but there are vast landscapes and dangers and wild moments of good luck

keep radical terrorists out of this trump without we will build the wall and will pay for the wall cost of the wall is peanuts compared to what talking trump says nonpartisan analysts estimate the wall would cost at least the us goods trade deficit with is about which is offset by the us surplus in services of not for the open border policies of this trump would be alive us does not have and has deported more than million a record as trump himself noted at final presidential has pledged open trump supports sanctuary does not support open borders but does support sanctuary cities and reform to let people pass background checks and pay back taxes in order to stay in the and she supports executive actions to shield some such as people who were brought to the us as children like she

tax policy and most families below the top of earners would have income gains of less than trump linger long on the affordable care act though he leads the crowd in a chant of the his new catchphrase for taking on corruption in percent of children under the age of are in trump says citing outdated the poverty rates in question were as high as trump says they were at the depths of the great but they have since to somewhere between percent and depending on which income threshold you use the rates for children are disproportionately so trump has a point even if his statistics are too old and exaggerate the scale of poverty in that age group on we rate the statement half two million have fallen into poverty under the he also the own fact use of is misleading on two he starts counting from when w bush was still in office and from right before the financial peak and he ignores that the population has grown dramatically in the eight years since then almost million people fell below the poverty line between and census poverty numbers but the number of people in poverty has decreased during the recovery in it fell to down from in will be very hard to leave your farm to your children

premiums will increase by varying amounts according to each some will be quite as trump others will be far then correctly notes that misled about whether they could keep their doctor under the

controls the economy and the media analysts who track extremist groups in the united states have expressed alarm at the use of the word by the they say it carries multiple meanings from benign to sinister and often serves as a for and conspiracy theorists is a principle driver for the fears that animate the radical right in the united said the editor of a published by the southern poverty law center is the globalism is often used as a synonym for the system of global economic interconnection that has been critiqued for decades by liberal groups like labor environmental organizations and opponents of the international monetary fund and the world bank but for the far the term encapsulates a conspiratorial based on xenophobia and according to mark a researcher at the league a host on

reaffirmed the status of marijuana as a schedule the most dangerous class of which also includes heroin thousands of cannabis companies in are now weighing whether they should register with local pay local taxes and be regulated like all other or continue to operate in the gray market the plight of which despite the raid has had sales of million so far this has been closely watched by other companies in the marijuana business here because of the way the company began openly courting state and local lawmakers and applying for licenses like any other business this the company moved into offices in a corporate park in that were once occupied by a company that manufactured heart and it obtained a business tax license as a cannabis company and permission to operate agricultural processing machinery zoning was good the choice of building location was said a member of the city council were certainly using an in the company hosted nearly lawmakers and regulators from the state to demonstrate the process it uses to produce the capsules and other products that do not involve smoking as technicians in white lab coats operated machines designed to detect impurities in their hunter demonstrated to lawmakers the extractors that produce oils from the plant cannabis has a stigma around we really needed to come out and change image of what a cannabis company looked hunter said during a recent interview at the headquarters knew we were going to be one of the first through the so we wanted to set a good example for the industry that looked professional and was but two weeks after the visit by around officers and agents wearing tactical and representing multiple law enforcement raided the headquarters and four other facilities the officers broke down doors according to the seized around in machines worth million and million worth of cannabis products hunter was arrested and held on million which critics of the raid said was an unusually large amount of the police investigations bureau said the police had acted on the basis of a safety caused by the cannabis manufacturing which he described as and this huge desire to make a place for this industry to lieutenant said then a lot of these businesses operate outside of the scope of state or federal the raid prompted lawmakers in to enact regulations in to clarify that the extraction procedure was legal lieutenant said that he was aware of the change in the but that his investigation was continuing hunter was released two days after the and the bail requirement was dropped when the district attorney decided not to press charges against according to lieutenant but the equipment and cash have not been returned the raid has been criticized by some local officials who said it sent the wrong message to other companies that were seeking to shed their clandestine past ms the city council described the raid as an overreaction to what amounted to suspicion of a permit violation there is an issue with a manufacturing process being we normally break down doors and take the she said almost as if law at multiple are like the soldiers on an island still fighting a war that is bob the independent auditor of the police described the raid as not happy guy was trying to comply to the extent he referring to hunter a spokesman for the drug enforcement confirmed that agents had taken part in the but would not comment on the specific reasons for their involvement the position is
if you are a close observer of the new as you might have noticed a headline about the fox news anchor it suggested that she had at age leaving us without favorite news this a news story written by a times reporter and it is alive and exceptionally so but it has with some on the times as an advertisement pretending to be a news story in other fake or at least a version of it a times reader from has been noticing the ad awhile and wrote me this week to complain or keeps popping up on various new times pages she said is unacceptable please stop these which frankly make me feel like the times is no better an outlet than the horrifying feeds with all of their fake news how could such fraudulent content wind up on the times through something called programmatic which essentially means that computers and algorithms conduct the transactions between advertisers and publishers rather than people machine to like a stock market matching buyers with sellers both the newsroom and its advertising department have rules that forbid misleading or otherwise worrisome ads from appearing on the site but it is difficult to apply those rules when computers are serving up the ads without a sales rep on the other end of the transaction screening out the misfits a senior vice president in says the times works aggressively to squash ads like the one that made the false claim but the nature of the mechanized system means that most of the policing is done after the fact once the ad has already appeared the ad has now been reported and taken down says another ad that fell into the same category was also removed recently says the times has one of the cleanest ad experiences in the publishing business i agree relative to the size of the site and the volume of the times have many ads that tout the premature demise of newscasters or make false claims about remedies when fraudulent ads do pop up and especially true now that the firing squads are out trying to punish those responsible for publishing during the election and are the prime because critics say they recklessly let their platforms be used by the who create fake news mark hoping to hose down the says his company is taking steps to curtail the flow of fabricated content onto its in an editorial this the times piled warning that its proposed changes go far enough and warning of the danger that awaits if to let liars and con artists hijack his as measured by sheer there is no comparison between a handful of ads on the times website and an endless gush of fake news stories that get shared by millions on one is a the other is an ocean but there are similarities too both organizations find themselves in the position of unwittingly publishing fake content that misleads and annoys and that can diminish a brand ads like the one may not be rampant at the but still worth taking a good look at whether the times is really doing everything it can to eliminate them particularly true at a moment when fake news is such a flash and when the times is dispensing advice to another publisher on how to solve its problems
countries such as would be not to pick up on the ideology of the former labor prime minister has at the university of for the launch of his biography the first he has cooperated on in more than years also said that while should understand it should not blindly follow the lead of the got to know what policy sees the the general international responsibility the us has taken on since as being too large a burden on the us too unfair an relieving obligation on countries like and ourselves and he is therefore our the turn to worry about time for to zip it nick read is a pretty appealing message for to start worrying about themselves that the us should be thinking about itself on its own terms is a popular notion how silly would we be not to pick up the that the us is refocusing on not described relationship with the us as great asset for he said in charge of foreign policy regarded the relationship with the us as having a sacramental it means is that obliged to consult each other in the circumstances of strategic he want a clever foreign policy instead we have the dullards basically leading us into the alliance as though sacrament will always be important in the pacific ocean but if you have a treaty with the us and a long then it you to think about a policy thats got got this group that says the let our hand please hold on to comments on came during a discussion with troy the author of his the leader did not take questions from the alliance will remain strong even if trump says read pair discussed political and reflected on rise to become prime than two decades laid out his vision of becoming a republic he described the continuation with a constitutional monarchy as a republic would send the message we are a nation confident in ourselves and able to represent ourselves around the world as he tells us who we are and what we are we make our way in the world and be taken really particularly in these great states like china and by the our head of state is the queen of great told the audience that to enter and succeed in public leaders needed a deal of got that from my who thought i was the absolute of the he big investment in love in you carries you and i had that like the tin suit you can move on not worrying about incoming missiles you should have the inner said it was also important to when more qualified and effective people came along who could do the job better inside the mind of trump read have to say to it better that i drop back and let someone else get ahead because they have something more to offer than he said said he had enjoyed the leverage public life had given him along with the ability to big but he said he had never cut corners during his time in positions of and believed that diplomacy was the most effective means of achieving success move your little finger this the world moves that he said many people get that chance but if you get that got to be aware of the and with the leverage comes

ill a decade agricultural scientists at the university of suggested a bold approach to improve the food tinker with the chemical reaction powering nearly all life on earth the idea was greeted skeptically in scientific circles and ignored by funding agencies but one outfit with deep the bill and gates eventually paid hoping the research might help alleviate global poverty after several years of work funded by the the scientists are reporting a remarkable result using genetic engineering techniques to alter they increased the productivity of a test plant tobacco by as much as they said in a study published by the journal science that is a huge given that plant breeders struggle to eke out gains of or percent with more conventional approaches the scientists have no interest in increasing the production of their plan is to try the same alterations in food and one of the leaders of the work believes production gains of percent or more may ultimately be achievable if that prediction is borne out in further research it could take a if not to know for sure the result might be nothing less than a transformation of global agriculture the findings could also intensify the political struggle over genetic engineering of the food supply some groups oppose arguing that researchers are playing god by moving genes from one species to another that argument has gained some traction with the in part because the benefits of crops have so far been modest at best but gains of or percent in food production would be an entirely different potentially offering enormous benefits for the poorest many of them farmers working small plots of land in the developing world here because we want to alleviate said the officer at the gates foundation overseeing the grant for the research is it the farmers and how can we help them get one of the leaders of the p a crop scientist who holds appointments at the university of at and at university in emphasized in an interview that a long road lay ahead before any results from the work might reach fields but long is also convinced that genetic engineering could ultimately lead to what he called a green that would produce huge gains in food like the original green revolution of the and which transferred advanced agricultural techniques to some developing countries and led to reductions in world hunger the research involves in which plants use carbon dioxide from the air and energy from sunlight to form carbohydrates these compounds in the basic energy supply for almost all animal including those of humans the mathematical description of photosynthesis is sometimes billed as equation that powers the for a long had argued that photosynthesis was not actually very efficient in the course of several experts mother nature had focused on the survival and reproduction of not on putting out the maximum amount of seeds or fruits for humans to come along and pick long thought crop yields might be improved by certain genetic changes other scientists doubted it would but with the science long and his collaborator k who holds appointments at the university of and the national laboratory have gone a long way toward proving their point much of the work at the university of was carried out by two young researchers from abroad who hold positions in of the and of no one plans to eat of nor does the gates foundation have any interest in increasing the production of that crop but the researchers used it because tobacco is a particularly fast and easy plant in which to try new genetic alterations to see how well they work in a recent interview and showed off tiny tobacco plants incorporating the genetic changes and described their aspirations hope it translates into food crops in the way shown in said you only know when you actually try in the initial the researchers transferred genes from a common laboratory known as cress or into strains of tobacco the effect was not to introduce alien but rather to increase the level of certain proteins that already existed in tobacco when plants receive direct they are often getting more energy than they can and they activate a mechanism that helps them shed it as heat while slowing carbohydrate production the genetic changes the researchers introduced help the plant turn that mechanism off faster once the excessive sunlight so that the machinery of photosynthesis can get back more quickly to maximal production of carbohydrates it is a bit like a factory worker taking a shorter coffee break before getting back to the assembly line but the effect on the overall growth of the tobacco plants was surprisingly large when the scientists grew the newly created plants in fields at the university of they achieved yield increases of percent in one percent in a second and percent in a over normal tobacco plants grown for comparison because the machinery of photosynthesis in many of the food crops is identical to that of theory suggests that a comparable manipulation of those crops should increase production work is planned to test that in crops that are especially important as dietary staples in like rice and cassava two outside experts not involved in the research both used the word to describe it but they emphasized that the researchers had not yet proved that the food supply could be increased does it look in rice or corn or wheat or sugar said l val a senior fellow at the information technology and innovation foundation in and a longtime advocate of crops got to get it into a handful of the important crops before you can show this is real and going to have a huge impact we are not there d of the university of at who studies pointed out that the genetic alteration might behave differently in crops where only parts of the such as seeds or are harvested in by the entire aboveground plant is harvested

congressman of has formally entered the race for chairman of the democratic national committee after a brutal election day loss that left the party leaderless and in shock win when we harness the power of everyday people and fight for the issues they care said in a statement on afternoon is not enough for democrats to ask for support every two years we must be with them through every lost every tuition and every time they are the victim of a hate crime when voters know what democrats stand we can improve the lives of all liberal who started his career as a community has emerged as the clear choice among progressive democrats after their stunning loss last weekend many from the sanders wing are seething over their decision to run a legacy candidate in a year when the electorate demanded think we need a chair who is going to go lead some around this country in the so people get to know him and get to feel that this is a party of working men and working women around this said on a conference call organized by the liberal group democracy for who is black and would be a symbolic rebuke to presidency throughout his the republican antagonized black and voters with his incendiary rhetoric and policy the chairmanship is a test of the future as it rebuilds in the coming years had she would have selected the probably someone from her inner circle the formal selection of the chairman will now be conducted by party many of whom were strongly in favor of over sanders ahead of the sanders endorsed an early supporter of his candidacy the senator sent a petition to his supporters backing that has already garnered a few hundred thousand signatures resistance and progressives urge democratic party to stand up and fight read friend is a terrific leader and a strong progressive who knows how to get things said senator harry the outgoing minority in a statement is the time for new thinking and a fresh start at the now is the time for senator chuck the probable incoming democratic minority also backed for the post on warren said he would make a chair on rolled out several dozen more endorsements from elected state party chairmen and labor leaders among the most prominent democrats on the list were senator of and senator of faces opposition from the former governor who previously served as the chairman after his run for the nomination in former governor martin who ran for the democratic nomination this said last week that he is a hard at the role whoever becomes the next chair will replace the interim who assumed the role from congresswoman in stepped down on the eve of the convention after hacked emails revealed that party officials had explored ways to hamper sanders in the primaries as support for the former said he believed the congressman would make a messenger for the party but said experience is know the mechanics i just want to make sure we get this dean said in on night he very happy to let somebody else be the face of the dean said
a student in in western state of said he had to stand in line for six hours to exchange rupee notes banned by the government this month by the time he got to the the bank had run out of new bills a software engineer in the capital of said had to stand in but he felt it was worth it least for some black money holders will live in fear for coming next for he wrote prime minister move to ban and notes about and was an effort to crack down on corruption and tax avoidance but it caught the country by surprise and forced many to scramble to exchange their bills and secure enough cash for their daily needs some affluent who had stockpiled large amounts of cash have resorted to creative methods to quickly spend their money we asked to tell us how the move affected them and their families more than people responded here is a selection of the which have been edited run an ad and my clients have stopped all work there is an air of uncertainty and desperation i had to pull my staff away from other important work in order to make them stand in queues day in and day just to be able to get some cash to manage of my transactions are or using my debit so in terms of been little change dealing with street vendors for is a whole different story we now have to buy where prices are far higher and quality is not necessarily move was a rude shock to those who were comfortably sitting on their pile of black for essentials has become a parents are both above the age of and do not own credit or debit cards they withdraw large sums of money at a time and use them for household expenses so as to limit the multiple trips to the bank they both are not physically able to even stand in a but they did cannot buy things from nearby shops anymore because they have bills of higher denomination so we head to malls or supermarket where we can pay using credit card and debit cards small businesses have taken a at least are able to manage some emergencies by making payments but to think of the plight of all the laborers and workers is highly my it was bit of a discomfort my father had to take one full day off from his work to deposit and exchange old bills that he had same goes for my grandparents local vegetable vendors stopped setting up stalls as they have cash to buy from farmers even though they have new bills of they use them unless the other person has enough cash to return the my family has not been affected much yet we managed to deposit the or so we had in cash into our local as the bank queue had already grown large live in a rural with a small town about four miles away where everyone goes to do most of their weekly shopping as of the shopkeepers are still accepting the old notes as a and we have done most of our shopping either through those or on credit problems probably start coming some time though as we near the deadline of shops will stop accepting the old cash usage has always been minimal i was barely affected my parents who live in a smaller city faced very few problems the lines outside banks disappeared within a couple of days and things are back to normal most small shops have started accepting digital wallets or credit am not a very big fan of but i totally support this move as we see everyday how corruption cripples our main goal of this move is to bring the shadow economy inside the mainstream economy needs to expand its gross domestic product to lift people out of poverty the shadow economy yield taxes but any transaction done leaves an audit and it becomes impossible to hide illicit wealth is moving to the future where payments will be made i agree with prime minister and this move is such a decisive act of considering all the political risks and economic variables i voted him in to take tough and he is doing just cost of doing illegal business will i agree with the motive behind the i really question whether the government was prepared to implement the new scheme the government seems to be changing the policy every which feels like making it up as they go along better preparation would have made this so much easier the worst affected are those who even have bank making it so much harder to change their money to get hardly any grocer has electrical payment methods are we people bearing this we are not keeping stashes of money under our bed no bad deposited all my old notes into my account at a private bank and then withdrew an amount for meeting my daily cash expenses the process was relatively and quick move seems unlikely to change the practice of relying on cash the systems and sources that give rise to untaxed wealth remain the same as before once the immediate cash liquidity situation is things will revert to the earlier in due course it is the people who are used to corruption and tax avoidance scrapping notes will not change basic

last the chief medical sally launched a strident of one of the controversial obesity policies from the outrage it inspired in some you might think that the government was sending thousands of oliver robots into the homes to chuck out the turkey and stand over parents while they cook dinners that actually take two what some parents are up in arms about are local authority letters informing them if their child is overweight or obese cue angry media interviews and social media threads where parents tell each other to throw them feel particularly pleasant to have that letter drop on your but the has issued templates to local stressing that they should be and the potential to perceive judgment can never be entirely some parents clearly feel that their parenting choices are being inappropriately questioned by the it seems ridiculous to suggest that we refrain from giving parents critical information about their health for fear of upsetting them one in five children leaves primary school obese one in five who faces a lifetime of increased risk of serious health issues and premature death due to dietary and lifestyle choices they had little control over in their childhood parents have written off the chalking it up to puppy fat or their the measure the government uses someone very muscular and carrying little fat can show up as obese but far more likely to be a problem for the cycling team than a chubby has become the new we seem to have lost the ability to judge when children are overweight a healthy ribs should be clearly but many parents would perceive this as being underweight studies show that parents are rarely able to spot obesity in their own children and even health professionals tend to obese children as being of healthy weight based only on not just the responsibility of parents the government has shamefully backed away from effective measures such as bans on advertising and forcing manufacturers to reduce fat and sugar levels in foods but parents must play a role and are common one upset that her child was classified as fat kids sit on the couch eating fried she even like fried is perhaps an intuitive view if not a nutritional expert but excess sugar is just as much an obesity risk as fat the idea that childhood obesity is restricted only to couch potatoes indulging their love of fried chicken is dangerous to our health and it should be challenged if governments warn parents that their children are at how are we supposed to do are other areas where the state should be more muscular parents have the right to their children they are not obliged to register with a local authority or enter their child for any sort of qualification and local authorities have very limited rights to check up on families to ensure these children are getting an adequate education no one monitors their even know how many there the number of children registered as being has increased by over the last six years to almost but one government review suggested numbers could be as high as may be getting an adequate education we just know but it is clear that some parents are subjecting their children to ideological nonsense that they term or in which there is no structured learning or children are encouraged to through this is an outrageous state of affairs we rightly argue that children worldwide have the right to attend so why not should be banned in all but the most exceptional of should also be braver when it comes to vaccination immunity through vaccination is one of the greatest medical advances of the last two should parents really have the right to deny their children the health with impacts for other yet in some parts of the vaccination rates remain too low to prevent breakouts of these diseases and the vaccination remains controversial among many despite the fact that it dramatically reduces the risk of girls developing cervical cancer in many including the and it is compulsory for children to be vaccinated before they start school why not proverb takes a village to raise a contains a fundamental wisdom children are not for individual parents to subject to their every no matter how dearly they are the idea of a state by nosy peering into every corner of family life is dreadful but fear of that dystopia has made us too leery of overruling where there is overwhelming scientific and educational evidence that they are acting against their best have a moral right to ignore warnings that their child is to keep their child home from school to play with plasticine or deny their child a potentially lifesaving vaccine as a we should back a more muscular state that tells them comments will be opened

according to the socialist academic the reason that rich western liberals talk so much about racism and sexism is so they have to talk so much about economic inequality he published the trouble with diversity exactly a decade but it feels like a tract for our perfectly suited as a provocation to thought as we approach the summing up of great western want to challenge the economic structures that produce inequality because that might seriously impact on their own standing and wealth instead they insist on the elite being as diverse as the as a way to justify the very existence of the elite as long as the top class at shows a proportionate distribution of social one can happily ignore the fact that all the students come from money not just that this focus on diversity distracts from the deeper issue of economic inequality because the very diversity of the elite is asserted as justification for the nature of capitalism diversity has become the moral alibi of not that is against diversity per he absolutely but he thinks it misses the bigger picture when the struggle to achieve wage equality between men and women at some warehouse job is touted as a major victory when neither the men nor the women can actually live off what the warehouse is paying them when a battle is won for women at some merchant bank to earn the same as the a victory but both victories leave the most fundamental injustice perfectly the civil rights movement in the the us has become a much fairer society in terms of race and gender no doubt there is a way to in some places a very long way to but the progress has been considerable nonetheless but during this exact same the us has steadily and become more and more the gap between rich and poor widening to a level that now threatens the very stability of these disunited states and in this gap that trump has turned his of is capitalism and that the mainstream of both political parties refused to pull at the thread of its failures democrats and bush republicans subscribed to the view that global was a good with democrats combining this commitment with a civil action tradition and republicans with a socially of the it is the democratic pairing that makes the more natural fit for capitalism may produce winners and but it is nevertheless an economic system that is indifferent to gender or creed which is why capitalism is sometimes held up as a means of affirmative action the pink pound if a woman is better at doing the job than a white the logic of capitalism is entirely she rightly gets the job thus capitalism is applauded as an agent of social progress and yet the poor get poorer and the rich get took two political outsiders to say sanders and trump the former said it respectful of the many moral gains that the era of liberalism brought about the latter saw a gap and viciously exploited turning the resentful white poor against other poor minorities who are themselves as much a victim of the machinery of capitalism a decade the critics of thought he was doing something playing women and people of off against poor white middle why social justice mean a commitment to both social diversity and economic it can and it should but only when wealthy liberals appreciate in and of the struggle for diversity does little to benefit the pay and

las a few days before ward and stepped into a boxing ring here to battle it out for light heavyweight promoter said that this would be the super fight that everyone wanted between and but never got she was right dominated the early rounds of this and then ward sprang to life and came away with a close but unanimous decision victory here in las all three judges scored the fight in favor of ward with the ward improved his perfect record to and made a strong case for recognition as the best boxer in the world the victory represented a resounding return to prominence for who had not appeared in a marquee fight in about four years a period marred by and defined by sporadic matches and a dispute with his promoter was a beautiful ward said after which allowed him to take the and light heavyweight titles from did baby a lot of hardware but the fight was so close and so exciting that ward will inevitably face again if he wants to prove decisively that he is the best light heavyweight in the world in said after the fight that they would take advantage of a contractual right to a rematch who absorbed his first defeat in fights as a appeared stunned by the outcome and it was hard to blame him although the late rounds were very with the fighters trading had dominated the early rounds and knocked down ward in the second won the first six how the hell does he lose the said being that this is a she grudgingly conceded that even a loss could be a win happy we had a great she said really needed a great established control early with a powerful left jab that stunned ward on several occasions ward appeared to be measuring opportunities to hit and then get inside and smother him before he could return fire but every time ward ducked would swat him off with about seconds left in the second power caught up with ward ward threw a looping right but before it could get to answered with a short but powerful straight right fist that sent ward to the mat ward stumbled around the ring for the rest of the round and was saved by the bell but what seemed most impressive is that ward refused to cower after getting knocked down happy about that but i ward said was at peace now it was time to really get to clearly was imposing his strategy of punishing his opponent with his heavy hands but ward managed to start getting in close on in the middle of the fight he would lunge in with a and as tried to ward would grab his arms and wrestle him toward the ropes as the pair they also attempted to fling each other and poke shots at close range as the match wore stopped throwing the jab that was so effective early in the fight when he did throw it was and ward made him pay in the ninth when flailed his left ward easily bent out of the way and fired a jab that landed squarely on face think after the he realized i going anywhere and i was stepping on the ward said drop in activity allowed ward to lock him up so he could not throw his big punches when he could get had trouble connecting cleanly in the second half of the fight he would swing and ward would duck leaving looking as if he was grabbing at the air but even as the momentum appeared to the match remained the fighters seemingly reading each minds and countering each other effectively midway through the for ward connected on a sharp but almost immediately ate one from a short time ward came forward again with a looping right and a but there was raking head back with his stiff left fist in this both fighters surpassed milestones that were long overdue for boxers of their talent before neither man had headlined a fight card on which is a chief indicator of a prominence and this was first time fighting in las home of marquee contests and second the new arena that hosted the fight had plenty of empty seats with an attendance of the fight break any records and most likely will not be a either but with their ward and have almost assured themselves another turn on biggest and that it will be even more heavily anticipated

the world health organization declared an end to its global health emergency over the spread of the virus on prompting dismay from some public health experts confronting the epidemic an agency advisory committee said it ended the emergency formally known as a public health emergency of international concern because is now shown to be a dangerous like malaria or yellow and should be viewed as an ongoing threat met as other diseases sometimes with help committee members repeatedly emphasized that they did not consider the crisis over are not downgrading the importance of said peter executive director of the health emergencies program are sending the message that is here to stay and the response is here to like all is seasonal and may repeatedly return to countries with the mosquitoes that carry added individual countries facing serious new outbreaks could still declare local said l chair of the advisory committee but other experts worried that the declaration might slow the international response to an epidemic that is still and lull people at risk into thinking they were safe s director of the national institute for allergy and infectious which is funding efforts to find a suggested that it was premature to lift the state of emergency since summer is just beginning in the southern hemisphere we going to see a resurgence in and he asked they pull back on the better be able to reinstate it why not wait a couple of months to see what his agency would not slow down its vaccine he said since the first declared a state of emergency on the virus has spread to almost every country in the western hemisphere except thousands of babies suffer deformities caused by the and more are expected recent outbreaks and related birth defects have also been detected in southeast although scientists believe the virus has circulated there for decades the most severe deformity is a tiny head with a severely underdeveloped but fetuses have also been killed by the and infected infants have been born with clubbed feet and permanent limb rigidity scientists also fear that many infected babies who appear normal now may suffer from intellectual deficits or mental illnesses later in their lives the centers for disease control and prevention expressed no opinion about the but noted that it not change the urgent need to continue our the agency also reiterated the warning it issued in that pregnant women should avoid traveling to areas where the virus was being transmitted other like were more critical the decision is said o director of institute for national and global health law although the virus is not killing or deforming as many babies as originally international response has been said action to call off the global emergency has provided reason for governments and donors to pull back even he said even if the outbreak no longer meets the technical definition of an emergency under international health there is an important psychological component to declaring an emergency headlines suggesting the crisis is over may lead people to take fewer precautions against sexual and experts said are still not out of the said c a virologist at the university of medical branch in who was among the first to warn that the virus threatened the the disaster in northeast where more than babies have been born with will probably not be weaver said and he not be surprised if the disease had run its course in central and the he think the worst is yet to come in southern places like and some places in the amazon seen the virus at all when a large portion of a population has been infected with a virus and has rising usually ends the transmission of a virus for several until enough susceptible victims are born i a epidemiologist who has worked in northeast for said he understood the rationale but felt the agency had acted too soon the full extent of the damage in is he because many infected babies are yet to be born governments are just beginning to realize that they face a he and may now take fewer countermeasures when the declared an emergency in it was intended in part to get scientists to explore the connection and to make countries cooperate in fighting the epidemic at the it was unknown whether surge in babies was caused by the which had been discovered in and was considered a mild disease officials declared themselves satisfied that was the main cause of the outbreak in a later officials decided that the risk was not sufficient to justify canceling the games in but was high enough that pregnant women should avoid traveling to the area
i love telling people from maybe my defense mechanism for when people accuse me of being a coastal out of touch with real i like fulfilling all the stereotypes i love cheese and cheese of course i love our sports teams out of a vague sense of and my accent hard comes out in full force after ah beers mostly i love my who has called home for years her parents immigrated to from and she started public school without knowing a word of she forgot most of the her parents taught her years but taught me the words to the that we would sometimes hear when my family would go to a night fish fry up until i still believed my moral baseline bent toward empathy the i thought i where i lived for was filled with complex but fundamentally decent people who recognized that everyone is deserving of respect and could disagree without being disagreeable the state did elect walker as governor in and the legislature gutted setting off huge protests in the capitol but i think that state would vote for j turning its electoral votes to a republican for the first time since come we even voted for as much as trump won the election in lost it her which prided itself on employing all the data wizards and ground game gurus money can did not do nearly enough to lock down the upper particularly and and instead treated those states as a given is the mayor of capital in cerulean county he supported senator sanders in the democratic and said he talked at least once a week with a field organizer from the sanders campaign during the primary but once locked up the it was radio silence from the campaign i first held elected office in the early virtually every presidential been either by the candidate or by a he told me not saying this to say important but the point not only she in the but i never got a a anything after the president by made two campaign stops in during the including a huge rally with on the before election day frustration with the campaign was apparent understand the strategy never seen an explanation for other than assuming that they wanted not just a but a smashing victory the kind that trump he said voter turnout in was the lowest been in years roughly fewer democrats voted in county this year than did in the drop in turnout in county might be partially attributed to a voter identification law in the state in a federal judge found that roughly registered voters in lacked the necessary photo id card to vote under the new and a of those voters were low income election watchers have said the voter id law alone could not have flipped the state in favor did not visit once after the democratic national convention in neither did president or sanders made multiple trips to the state on behalf of but that was not enough to gin up enthusiasm like most of the my friends and family in were shocked that trump won the and the election my mom says still in my dad has progressed comfortably to anger my has been coping with the election result with characteristic wit listening to trump speeches about i was convinced to she emailed me i hate throughout the general the surrogates appeared reassured to the point of hubris that they would be able to convert moderate republican voters in suburbs every democrat we lose in western we will pick up two moderate republicans in the suburbs in and you can repeat that in and and new senator chuck said in this line of thinking was not just but disastrously so in won of counties this counties voted for trump republicans successfully built on the map that helped to elect walker to the mansion while the campaign was looking to run up the score in states like and a triumvirate of republicans also helped elect both actively and passively there is who worked his way up from republican politics in to head the republican national and to serve as chief of staff then there is house speaker d who now has a historic opportunity to pass his agenda through congress recovered from his own failed presidential will now oversee the republican governors association is a longtime radio host in who became a voice on the right for the movement after years on the he will retire from his radio show this year along with being a vocal opponent of the trump he has taken on a new role as chief apologizer for media he expressed frustration with his he had gradually grown immune to any inconvenient fact presented to them while he read news from the politico and national review throughout the his audience seemed to glean most of its news from fox talk radio and their feeds on his radio program last played a sound bite of s current head of the national security suggesting the government had made a to sway the election in favor asked his we all agree that this is a big deal and we ought to do something about he opened the phone and the first call was from who believe it i believe any of sighed break through he said is way harder to knock that stuff down than you would he says he is but not to see conservative media falling in line and supporting cabinet picks is the monster he said of the worst elements of the conservative media have now been empowered every one of them has got a strut now has a pipeline to the white house i think about spent half of arguing that conservatism was fundamentally incompatible with what trump was offering his party conservatism has been i in being aggressive but and very and also proving that you can do things and be rewarded by the he said trump
when i worked as an adviser to the even the smallest of infrastructure projects became and overshadowed by corruption when the ministry wanted to provide clean water to it was sometimes only possible if private companies belonging to local power brokers usually district administrators or police chiefs were given the construction contracts if they win the they would take their share through extortion the facilitating partners lost their or found them on fire while working on our road projects because they paid a bribe to the armed groups that controlled the project area my the ministry of rural was the most important arm of government we were involved in nearly of the roughly villages across the country in the we provided around of afghans with vital such as midwife training or solar power projects this was genuinely important work for genuinely needy people and yet it was often disrupted by the corruption of the political who one way or find a way of getting their hands on the money twitter a man installs solar panels that charge car batteries to provide mainly for light bulbs and geographic where was the money was coming it came from the pockets of the taxpayers in and have since left but i was recently reminded of my former life when leaders gathered in to give to the alone announced in aid for the coming three years as a former government and a former staffer in i have concerns about how this money will be spent what safeguards are in place to ensure that the money benefits will a farmer in a remote village benefit from these donations after they seep through various corrupted layers of will it help a deported asylum seeker to build a new i worry that has given the afghan government a blank current political elite in took power years ago after international coalition forces toppled the regime since the world has poured hundreds of billions of dollars to most of what was pledged was meant to bring build and rebuild institutions that would work for all afghans after so many years of wars and devastation much of that money has been wasted you could even argue that the dangers posed by and the who now control more land than at any point since the western are ultimately less damaging than the was ranked out of countries on transparency corruption perception index government has often become a means of enriching the political class several politicians have built up business empires that overshadow any attempts to bring about positive change to lives the political elites have ethnocentric exacerbate tribal rivalries and political erode political and increase impunity for the donor community has allowed this dynamic to emerge donors do highlight corruption epidemic but they never link their aid to any kind of genuinely effective and as result they have ultimately failed to hold the afghan government to account for how they spend the bank scandal was an obvious example it saw lost to fraud at biggest and was described by us officials as biggest per capita fraud in the shareholders were mostly from the political and included cabinet and warlords the executives spent alone on luxury villas in many of which were registered in the names of shareholders but those to blame for this massive money laundering have ultimately proved untouchable the former executive of the was sentenced to five years in prison but last year he was released in order to sign a property deal with the afghan government twitter an afghan man prepares tea for refugees displaced fighting between afghan forces and insurgents since corruption goes unpunished afghans feel betrayed by their and insurgents have fed off this disappointment shah kind of corruption indirectly exacerbates conflict since corruption consistently goes afghans feel betrayed by their leaders and insurgents have in turn fed off this widespread sense of disappointment the enemy sees a vacuum to fill just last insurgents attacked the last stronghold lost by the in this is the second time in two months that the have attacked they first briefly seized it last all aid is only conditional on agreeing to all refugees deported from this is a condition that will do nothing to stop and do everything to endanger ordinary who will be sent back to a war zone according to the recent united nations assistance mission in report on civilians were killed during just the first six months of this year and between and civilian casualties reached another report shows that half of territory experiences war and violence on a daily aid be conditional on something other than the money will definitely be wasted unless donor countries encourage the afghan government to implement a real strategy that is supported by law it must be conditional on fighting corruption and the afghan government should also show the political will to end impunity for corrupt officials in order to create an effective and transparent government in the donors who pledge their money should draw specific red lines for spending this pledged money these will be as blank as they have been in the in and
never forget the in one of the republican primary when trump looked into the camera and declared that destroying political correctness was his no campaign issue his fans went both in the crowd oh my i even then courting the troll over the subsequent i watched as wildly disparate groups of men from the slimiest corners of the white gun good old boys coalesced into one frothing hydra behind trump when mainstream news outlets started churning out about the mysterious the wicked green engine of i wanted to and other social justice activists already know what the is a roll call of the angry men been abusing and trying to silence us for years the only thing they have in common is a fixation on the of a vaguely pejorative for king social and in trump they found their the alpha male who was finally going to give these bitches what they deserve adequately convey how sickening it has been to watch groups of men who have posted my home address dug up photos of my husband and and threatened to rape and murder me lie and steamroll their candidate to the excruciating we were expected to entertain the fantasy that a person could vote for trump without voting for for for rape culture when that very slogan vowed to drag us backward to a time when the us was a time before people of and women and had in our few protections into law on a galactic people are terrified of what lies ahead we must look out for one another read know that seems like a shiny new but trump win the election because of new he won because of old ideas call it whatever you like social basic respect and decency but is our our watch keeping those old ideas at our avowal that our humanity matters as much as white our insistence that you cannot simply erase the line between racist actions and our hope for building a more inclusive is planning a in north next month hate crimes are at their highest since more than a dozen women have accused the president elect of sexual i had to listen to supposedly leftist men not trolls this time insist that victory was at least partially a result of and and correctness gone too this is the consequence of one man told me on twitter always a backlash from he admonished as though any movement in history got anywhere by asking politely and taking a seat as though there was some magical moment in the past when reached a perfect stasis no no sexism and white dudes could still have a chill time but those greedy feminists just had to keep is no such thing as a social movement a movement is acquiescence a movement is not a movement at all it is stillness it is the status quo the trump campaign counted on that stillness on the of being a dork to give hate speech and sexual assault the space to grow and what if validated us instead of helped us firm boundaries against oppression instead of letting hierarchies reassert correctness blaming political correctness for president trump is like blaming the civil rights movement for or feminism for rape or stonewall for hate crimes every battered wife who has been murdered by her husband when she tries to leave have to hurt you if just a disingenuous peddled by people who know they did nothing to help when of hate was gathering steam and are suddenly terrified because the stock market is crashing now now welcome late you spent eight years obsessing over college opinions on comedy and now a racist clown is is a man who believes in registering restraining black protesters with building a wall on the border and grabbing women by the genitals and you think he has a vested interest in tamping down the dissent of black immigrants and he is institutional silencing personified are you sure political correctness went too are you sure we were what do you actually want us to do on a shrug at when black churches are accept being when trans women of are murdered at staggering smile at when only of rapists in the us are ever never defend our boundaries until they shrink down and garrote not an option political correctness is not you consider yourself a good but you spent the past eight years parroting the troll party line and tittering at the silly activists mocking baiting treating us like eroding our credibility and now pointing at black rape immigrants and everyone else who is petrified for their lives under a trump and insisting that we brought this on ourselves by fighting too then screw you you fight at all and you will suffer the rights
bloodbath of an a friend emailed me watching someone get another said over the phone and this in an email from a veteran of the third draft dodger is now commander in to the full flowering of the era of which began with that now glide down the escalator at trump where trump commenced his candidacy with these historic when sends its not sending their best sending people that have lots of and bringing those problems with us bringing drugs bringing crime rapists and i are good ever a monument is erected to the trump then surely these words shades of will be carved into the marble along with coming out of her bucks a and would bring back a hell of a lot worse than in true demagogic trump bypassed the head and spoke directly to the to the biles and bubbling acids of raw emotion he said things that many temperate hardly dared to admit we carried in ourselves were hardly aware of just how deeply we resented our own how angry our interior lives with all this stuff bottled years and years of internalized from a culture that kept insisting on tolerance many discovered just what a drag political correctness was all these and to be free of freed from this code that was jamming us that was relief akin to a primal scream from the start rallies had the air of the tent that same hot thrum of militant exorcism and not fool a friend wrote stand anything but cold honesty right now this is not a winning the which would be bad enough this is white supremacy tempted to say really not that bad stances are things get said in the heat of a and we could take heart in the newly conciliatory trump on display for several days after the election then came the news that the erstwhile chairman of the trump campaign who bears a striking resemblance to the town drunk on the old was named counselor and chief for the incoming trump administration the mainstream press still feels compelled to explain the term but we know we we we white aka honky dig too deeply into the family along with glistening of apocalyptic and a style sense that falls somewhere between for and eye for the straight prior to his gig on the trump spent four years as chairman of which he proudly declared to be

the have to remember that actually all on one a character is his as and what a twisted fate indeed that ever seeking to reconcile and accommodate an pastor in once his presidency is will no longer have to be the least threatening black man in has had to deal with an opposition that very much regarded him as not on the team there was the for starters the conspiracy theories the terrorist founder of teenage crack dealer hanging out on the corner this damage done to is said during one of the republican which is a laugh if wanted to trash the all he had to do on taking office in was sit on his hands and let the hot mess of the bush economy continue its meltdown to the issue is bigger than any particular president after his on one the is that we all go forward with a presumption of good faith in our fellow because that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant and functioning goes to the heart of the matter the system of constitutional government is founded on deliberate fragmentation of the of and and that we all learned in high school civics for government to be effective for government to meet the needs of the people the us constitutional order requires a healthy measure of good faith cooperation among the players this good faith began to fray in the early as leaders in newt and tom delay chief among declared war on all efforts even from those in their own party to govern from a stance of bipartisan cooperation in world of moral were enemy of normal and his allies were fighting no less than a with and as he declared in a speech to the heritage war has

government shutdowns of and over budget and the impeachment of bill for lying about a in more recent there was the famous dinner at a steakhouse on the evening of the day of inauguration at which

items previously supported or even proposed by the all rooting for said of trump when they met recently in the oval office if he senate republican leader later summed up the stance when he publicly

the united states is a leader in technology but it may well be a laggard when it comes to using technology for political mischief the role that fake news stories on sites in particular played in last presidential election continues to be a issue did fake news tip the balance in the can do more to prevent fake should executives dispute the notion that fake news on the social network might have swayed voters but political analysts say the warning signs of this debate could be seen in other countries years ago take the where a spokesman for its shared on an image of a girl believed to have been raped and killed by a drug dealer checkers later revealed that the photo had come from and mark write the role of fake news posted to in the recent presidential election is likely to be debated for even years but there is little doubt that the social media network has had plenty of influence in a reminder to register to vote contributed to significant increases in voter registration across the according to officials in nine states in that did not dispute their conclusion
the emails currently roiling the us presidential campaign are part of some unknown digital collection amassed by the troublesome but if your purpose is to understand the clique of people who dominate the emails that really matter are the ones being slowly released by from the hacked account of campaign chair john they are last scandal in a year running over with but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere they are a window into the soul of the democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party class to which i refer is not rising in angry they are by and large pretty pretty contented nobody takes road trips to exotic west to see what the members of this class looks like or how they on the they are the ones for whom such stories are written this bunch have to make do with a mountebank for a for this the choices are always pretty and this year they happen to be are the comfortable and mainstay of our modern democratic party they are also the grandees of our national the architects of our the designers of our the high officials of our banking the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or the middle east with precision droning they they not a class at all but rather the enlightened the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselves twitter learned to fight dreamers campaign against us turn the magnifying glass on them for a by sorting through the hacked personal emails of john who has been a power broker for decades i admit that i feel uncomfortable digging through this stealing email is a after and it is outrageous that personal information has been since seem to have redacted the emails in any way there is also the issue of authenticity to contend we know absolutely and for sure that these emails were not tampered with by whoever stole them from john the supposed authors of the messages are refusing to confirm or deny their and though they seem to be there is a small possibility they all that taken into i think the releases furnish us with an opportunity to observe the upper reaches of the status hierarchy in all its righteousness and personae of the liberal class are all present in this amazing body of financial innovators colleagues attempting to get jobs for their children foundation executives doing fine and noble things of and high academic industries loom large and virtuous here ingratiating speeches to wall street are well known of but what is remarkable is in the party of and and smiling financiers now seem to stand on every constantly proffering advice

billionaires who give to democrats the miscreant in question was said to spinning donors who have supported democrats john and have both given to and others he is also attacking every billionaire that donates to many whom support other democrats as in the year it one of the correspondents appears to and political malpractice of the party to allow this to are wonderful things to be found in this treasure trove when you search the gilded words or but it is when you search on the dump that you realize these people truly inhabit a different world from the rest of us by of they mean the ritzy

for an independent security expert to examine without the special permission of the developer can be sure by looking at the code that not doing anything weird with your said the idea behind the is to make privacy and communication as simple as said moxie the founder of open whisper the organization that developed signal the popular chat uses software to encrypt its messaging and in messenger and

hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide such attacks are often spread through malicious email attachments and a practice known as so make a rule of not clicking on anything when you do not know where it will take even if it appears to come from someone you know make sure to update your software particularly your operating system software companies will release updates that patch bugs and vulnerabilities when they are discovered but outdated or unauthorized copies of the software may still contain the security flaws this is a particular problem with computers using the most popular

extra layer of security backups will protect your documents and other data not only from a technical but from and other malicious hacking just make sure to test or check your backups periodically you know this by now creating strong passwords and never using the same password across sites is one of the simplest things you can do to protect yourself from digital invasion not everyone agrees about frequent password changes most say you should use really strong passwords and no more than one password per then use the password managers but making up new combinations all the time is irritating and tempting people to reuse them or make them too simple that is one reason some experts object to frequent password changes far better to create really strong ones for every login and new passwords can pose security because hard to remember complex so you are tempted to write them down that can lead to a lot of passwords to keep track of recommends password which help store many with one master password he said he uses but knows plenty of people who use and and he have a strong reason to recommend one over another as far as making passwords up be precious about it use a random word object near for scramble the letters and sprinkle in numbers and punctuation marks if writing passwords down or using a password you have to worry about making them memorable when you turn on anyone trying to sign in to your email from new devices will have to go through a secondary layer of a code that is sent to your phone via text message not through a link to turn on authentication for accounts one for yahoo and one for outlook accounts you should also set authentication for social media accounts and other sites where available but email is the most important since many sites use email for

global economic system waging war against is making case a former head of the division at the international monetary argues that the long term china comes out a winner no matter economy would surely suffer if the united states were to impose a percent tariff on nearly billion worth of imports the united states absorbs only percent of but it is healthiest export market fears of protectionism are

lying more closely linked with the former told me trump talking about withdrawing from trade deals and making allies pay for it will be tough for countries to resist and if actions against china start to disrupt supply the united states could quickly become the economic pariah the question to what it simply be about stopping currency manipulation an outdated fear instead of working to lower the value of its currency to improve its china has spent about trillion lately to prop up the value of the in the face of capital flight if it the currency would drop like a enhancing trade competitiveness slapping trade barriers against china would do little to narrow the trade deficit companies building things in china bring much manufacturing in most cases they would go to some other

with all eyes focused on and military buildup in the middle the sharply deteriorating security situation in has been all but ignored by and trump whoever wins the us such insouciance will be hard to justify beyond inauguration day as this killing of villagers in province has a way of forcing itself into the political headlights learned this lesson the hard way he promised to end the war he then lost interest afghan supported by then the us secretary of sent an additional troops to the country but the reinforcements failed to end the insurgency in said the war was ending but he has had to eat his words as he leaves us soldiers and a large air force contingent remain behind the afghan supported by elements in are still the deadliest and most numerous foe recent estimates suggest they are gaining territory in where troops once did battle repeated offensives around in the north and audacious attacks on have been beaten but with great difficulty the reason the us entered in remain active in at least seven while has gained a foothold in rival ethnic warlords further complicate the picture is now longest war its anniversary fell on more than us troops have died there the conflict has cost us taxpayers an estimated yet despite tentative peace it is far from over has become the dirty little secret of the us presidential campaign that neither candidate cares to discuss across all three presidential was only mentioned by and then only in passing the already under fire for her support for the invasion and the us intervention in has little incentive to draw attention to unfinished business in she knows the war is deeply unpopular with voters for his trump seems to understand little and care less he once said the war was a but has no known policy even the feel affronted a quoted by analyst commented after the first debate that trump says that comes to his and is this shared indifference cannot wrote the the silence about is a genuine shame since the future of the long war there will be one of the first major choices that a president trump or a president would have to make the next president will need to decide whether to leave the troops send or bring even more of them abandoning is probably not an however much western countries would like to wish away the problem despite the failure of many rural reconstruction donor countries recently pledged another for the next four years while humanitarian needs are undoubtedly such generosity looks like a triumph of hope over experience the security situation is dire in many afghan government in is weak and official corruption is endemic violence against women continues despite strenuous efforts to counter it more than cases including murders were reported in the first half of this year opium production is up again afghan refugees continue to head for in large numbers the conflict further fond hope that the afghan army and police would effectively replace western troops and provide adequate security has proved illusory according to us the now controls more territory than at any time since so far in nearly civilians have the says many were killed by government forces child casualties are up whatever and trump may is not a problem they can duck for and central

to find himself his heart uneasy in his chest he can feel that involuntary hope as he anticipates can predict the ensuing low spirits when ward as portrays casement built of a tough exterior and a tender his constitution only remarkable by the extent to which his inner life is kept that inner life encompasses not just love affairs most notably with a and forays into the dim and dangerous homosexual subculture of the late century but an allegiance to the cause that baffles whose obliviousness to feelings for him goes hand in hand with his john bullish denigration of which he sees as degraded form of why should the cause of home rule so exercise given that casement himself as ward and even this question is the tuning fork to which novel vibrates her casement is a man driven to

victory over have been possible without the support of white evangelical voters for nearly four white evangelicals have been a mainstay of the republican and no small matter by some one in four voters fit that meaning that white evangelicals constitute one of the most reliable voting election was no exception to the rule exit polls suggest that four out of five white evangelicals turned out as usual and cast their lot with trump what seems different this is the candidate for whom they voted since jerry founded the in white evangelicalism has sought to position itself as the moral voice of the nation for the most that has translated into unwavering support for socially conservative politicians and by a strong sense of individual piety hence the designation of white evangelicals as by most deviates sharply from this norm as the has succinctly put trump is and until all of which flies in the face of professed evangelical standards combined with his and trump seems more than a far cry from the whom evangelicals claim to love and his campaign and now the apparent contradiction between trump and evangelical values has been the focus of much of the some prominent evangelicals to their credit sought all along to raise the red urging their flock to think twice about lining up behind trump less sympathetic observers have understandably charged white evangelicals with blatant partisan criticisms make some but they take us very far in understanding white evangelicalism as a social and political phenomenon evangelicals may very well consider themselves but the emphasis has never really been on the perceived moral uprightness or religious bona of the candidate in question always nice when the two appear to line but the heart of contemporary white evangelicalism lies in advocating for a set of social policies more important than individual proclivities is stemming the tide of what they see as widespread cultural promise to great hit the right note in this respect for many white a great is a and a is one whose laws are socially conservative and geared towards evangelical much of the focus has been on politics and issues related to family values and religious and trump sounded all the right notes here he also smartly solidified himself as a friend to evangelicals by choosing mike a socially evangelical as his running racially charged rhetoric played right into the hands of white evangelicals as well although white evangelicals may often express a desire to love their as in reality the commandment is selectively applied anyone considered and deemed a threat to evangelical which includes a narrow vision of what looks is on the other side of the fabled at the end of the that war is based in a particular conception of filtered through the lens of religious identity and social conservatism not that four out of five latched sure most white evangelicals would balk at the charge of racial but the overall motivation in backing trump has never been much of a secret safe to say that for many trump never represented any sort of and most under any illusion about the direction of his moral compass but for white god works even through the and work must and will be involved this time around is as old as the moral about protecting some modicum of evangelical identity and social values against a perceived onslaught of antagonistic liberalism more specifically in regard to this white evangelical support for trump was and is all about appointing judges to the supreme court also about enacting laws that they hope will put a stop to what they consider as threats to religious even if the latter border on discrimination white in other are playing the long and that has nothing to do with who trump is as an may all sound but just what white evangelicalism is in the us although laden with the rhetoric of personal it is primarily a social and political and we would do well to view it in such terms as this election has made white evangelicals will also stop at nothing in their attempt to establish their version of a that includes supporting someone like who told them exactly what they wanted to hear it was a match made in elections

president of condemned by the administration and much of the west for waging a brutal war of suppression against opponents in his said this week that j trump could be a in the fight against terrorism the comment underscored the degree to which the new approach could reverse central tenets of foreign policy in an interview with the broadcaster published on whom president wants removed from office welcomed the prospect that trump would make good on his campaign promise to focus exclusively on fighting the state and to align the united states with a close ally of in doing so the also known as or is one of an array of moderate and extremist groups seeking to topple the statements by a leader who secretary of state john has said should be investigated for war crimes along with highlighted both the complexity of the foreign policy challenges awaiting trump and the extent to which he has signaled a break from especially in the middle east in trump will inherit an especially tangled set of alliances and a situation that has bedeviled in a region where the united states military is acting in support of efforts to contain or destroy the state while allowing that what he called forces within the could cast doubt on whether trump deliver on his said that if he fights the it is clear that we will be a natural together with the and many other countries who want to defeat the his while were the latest evidence of a growing expectation among both opponents and allies of the united states that trump will reverse policy on which lays much of the blame for the civil war at his feet a diplomat said that officials in and were bracing for an on and diplomats expressed a similar worry in an interview last week with the wall street trump signaled as suggesting that once he took office he would drop support for certain opposition groups that have been fighting both the state and the and focus solely on bombing the state attitude was fighting is fighting and you have to get rid of trump said but foreign policy both republican and say such a move will probably leave the new president with a very different deciding how to finesse the battleground of the civil war which will still be going on without putting back in place all of the factors that led to the rise of the state in the first place the state is in retreat regardless of trump the campaign to retake the last state stronghold in the city of is well underway in the coalition has been gaining ground on the stronghold of while may not be retaken by when trump is sworn pentagon officials say that probably will be and that could fall not long afterward but the battleground defeat of the state is almost the easy part administration will then have to confront hard choices on the other war in namely balancing the competing forces of traditional opponents and with traditional allies these include a and the like and the united who want to arm and bolster groups opposed to the government and are fighting not only the but also any groups opposed to the including those backed by the united states and the countries if trump abandons that alliance for the he will effectively be strengthening government that is the same government whose policies are blamed by and governments for fueling the rise of the state and other extremist groups to begin with might win the battle against in but you win the overall and achieve a favorable balance in the middle unless linked to addressing the civil war with said g a former top pentagon official with and implicitly with and the would be a strategic blunder with our some rebel long frustrated that the administration has not given them greater military say they are bracing for a complete cessation of but they express hope that allies like and turkey will continue to supply even in defiance of the trump administration a scholar at the international institute for strategic said had long calculated over western countries would either adopt his view that the rebels were all radicalized or prioritize fighting terrorist groups over support for the moderate forces challenging rule was a waiting game par one perfected by his father and now and one that seems to be paying give up feed and survive the and wait for the others to cave or said in an interview expressed fondness for deal making could open the door for the return to the united states of a journalist and former marine officer who disappeared in in is believed to be held by the which has yet to publicly acknowledge that it has him but it is doubtful whether trump will get a clear pass on capitol hill at striking an alliance with and even from republicans senator john republican of and chairman of the senate armed services this week called the bombing campaign by president v of and and warned against any attempts at reconciliation with
how is everyone ready for i was asked to speak about a vision for the next hundred years of reproductive choice and justice such a wonderful frame to think about what a feminist future might look like but i bet like a lot of hard to imagine what the next hundred years will look like when so much of for women will depend on what happens in just is no overstating how important this election is not just about the next four or eight years this decision is about sending a message about who we are as a and setting a very particular course for the women who live here look back on this time as a watershed a moment that in shape the next hundred years of first i want to share a personal story a little over six years i was pregnant with my and when i was weeks i got incredibly ill i developed which some of you might know is dangerously high blood pressure during was admitted to the hospital and within just a few i developed another complication called the short version being my liver was in danger of and i was in danger of dying if my daughter was not had an emergency and was born weighing she stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first two months of her undergoing medical interventions to save and protect her that to this day i try to avoid thinking about but i was and she was and today a wonderful healthy and i feel grateful for that every share this story because this was something in my life that changed me that shaped who i am when i think about this what i think about most often is how fortunate i was that i got sick far enough along in my pregnancy that i faced with the reality of needing an abortion to save my when i think about those days in the hospital the the the the stress the idea that the government could ever become involved in my most pivotal it horrifies one thing i want for the next hundred i want for no to fear that their most personal life choices will be made by someone want for no to be afraid that her scariest life moment will be made even more difficult and traumatic by government the next hundred i want to see every woman be free from the fear that her body is not really her why i want to talk about this election tonight because at before in politics have bodies been so front and center in the national conversation and so at are choosing between a candidate who has spent her political career fighting for reproductive and a candidate who says that women who have abortions need to be punished a candidate who said this week in the final debate unequivocally that she will defend planned and a candidate who promised to choice between a person who has spent her life in public and a businessman who rips off his perhaps most making a decision between a woman who has said that rights are human and a man who says if you want you can just grab women the a feminist rallying cry right now that i like a and it pussy grabs i know that so much has been made of that and the ensuing allegations against trump by multiple women that he did just what he bragged about doing on that while some people may not see the link between sexual assault and reproductive those of us here in this room know know that there is a direct connection between those who think they can touch bodies without permission and those who think they can legislate our bodies reproductive rights and justice has always been about a fundamental respect or in this disrespect of bodily integrity and our bodies are our or make no the conversation that having right now about is not just salacious media fodder the way we come out of this moment the direction our culture shifts because of it will absolutely determine rights in the future we are witnessing a moment where our country could move backwards back to a place where will be and men will make decisions for women or towards a future where our culture and politics understand and respect women as autonomous full human are the two optimistic that on the right one the one that brings us to the feminist future all of us in this room have been waiting for when trump said he wanted to punish women for having there was outrage and he had to walk back those comments but more activists and organizations like planned parenthood were there to point out that while other politicians may not say they want women to be exactly what would happen if abortion were made in what has already happened to women like who was put in prison for inducing her own abortion in feminist future has no place for criminalizing women who decide if and when to trump claimed that what he said on that access tape was just and later when former new city mayor said that all men talk like men across the country came out to is not normal this is not acceptable men are better than this the feminist future that fighting for has men fighting alongside of men who refuse to be insulted by antiquated and sexist ideals about what it means to be a trump claimed that the women who have accused him of sexual assault were not attractive enough to warrant his unwanted when he called women when he called women the media who can so often get things wrong took him to our feminist future is not one where misogyny will go unchecked women have been disparaged and harassed for too many and not going to take one more minute of it course this feminist future the
it is less than a week since trump was elected as the next president of the united states so it is hardly surprising that such an immense shock to the us and to the global political order is still only sinking in to add to the trump himself is now making almost daily statements in some mark changes of direction or few of which can yet be treated as definitive the trump triumph is an immense and immensely but there are still more than two months before his inauguration it is likely that some of the instant response to his however passionately may prove to be ephemeral and in some cases is certainly true in and it is particularly true in where reactions have fallen far short like so many most of leaders were caught on the hop by last result they had expected and wanted to prevail it therefore made sense for union foreign ministers to meet on to discuss the implications of the trump victory there was and is use in such and the foreign secretary was wrong to stay and especially foolish to other for what he dubbed an just because acted it does not follow that is right to get on its high horse about trump has plenty of problems of its own its underlying approach should be that of which is that and are linked by values of democracy and respect which they should cooperate to uphold it made no sense to use the meetings to give the impression that is a place of political virtue and one of political turpitude neither thing is true and saying it to the new however alarming he may be bad reaction in especially on the has been more absurd and still much of it is driven by the triumphalism of the press and the isolationist right in it does not matter whether may was ninth or in the list of heads of government to speak to trump nor does it matter whether and his entourage got to see trump before an elected politician did diversions of this kind only matter to those who live and breathe in the bubble what matters to the rest of is the kind of relationship that will be possible with and with the the rest is froth lets down by treating both the trump danger and the response so may began to bring things back to earth in the prime traditional speech at the lord banquet not for the first she gave an interesting but flawed speech to her may at least understands that election was caused in part by some voters feeling left behind by the unfairnesses of the liberal global order she gets it about the in ways that too few politicians can emulate she sees the need for politicians to understand and respond to that kind of anxiety and she grasps that the overarching public policy question for western countries in the early century is how to give voters the confidence that and liberal values work for them not against questions she posed in speech are important and serious the prime minister is attempting to resolve the tensions that exist between the nation democracy and in the modern age this is more important than speculating over whether may will be thatcher to but problem is that she does not have the answer to her own big public policy especially in the destructive context of the trick is to effectively manage ideally this would be done in as democratic a way as possible it involves responsive controls over goods and within the frame of trading within which governments work together to set rules that businesses must follow but that is not the answer towards which government is groping its way she is right about the goal to manage in ways that preserve liberal values and that work for everyone but she does not know how to get above all because makes that task infinitely elections
sixty years along with i was in for our airborne and land invasion of on we had been told that we needed to help little against the bullying tactics of and of course we were a generation of young men for whom the holocaust had real meaning and parallels were drawn between the and we were told we were protecting canal for the world hence we all went willingly as young men with some macho we believed what we were told as there was a censorship from to we heard nothing about the political controversy raging in the hence my surprise on returning to proud with and mementos of conflict to be no better than the took me years before i learned that the and governments had arranged for a joint attack on maturity brings reflection and i now appreciate that i was part of a war an unprovoked planned attack i wonder will servicemen and women have the similar reasons to regret their unquestioning patriotism as active service will have taught them that war in a east and north

early this a disabled former automobile body worker named explained to lawmakers in new how medical marijuana helped his chronic back pain state legislators were considering a bill backed by compensation insurers that would have exempted them from paying for medical marijuana but and another patient described how smoking the drug let them escape years of stupor caused by powerful prescription narcotic drugs known as the lawmakers ended up dropping the and expenses for buying marijuana are covered by insurance would recommend that people use medical marijuana over any said in a telephone interview for businesses and a string of ballot victories this month for marijuana advocates are adding to an intensifying conundrum about the drug and issues such as insurance employee drug testing and workplace safety voters in and approved initiatives legalizing the recreational use of while voters in and north passed proposals for its medical use in states now permit or will soon permit medical use of marijuana while eight states have approved recreational use are entering this conflict between a social policy decision and a workplace that is highly said the chief executive of the compensation a research organization a major part of the predicament centers on unclear science about the benefits of marijuana or the dozens of known as that are found in the plant for its the food and drug administration has approved only a synthetic version of a and a similar drug for narrow such as to treat nausea in chemotherapy patients or to stimulate the appetites of patients with aids health insurers will pay for drugs only for uses but state medical marijuana laws usually give doctors permission to recommend marijuana to a patient with a a phrase that can encompass problems including cancer and chronic pain patients pay for the drug themselves and several states have explicitly exempted workplace compensation insurers for covering such costs but as a result of recent state court rulings in new workplace insurers there are required to pay for treatments if they are recommended by a doctor and lower courts in and have issued rulings directing workplace insurers to do so the number of patients receiving such coverage is small and because marijuana is illegal under federal insurers paying for the drug must use a financial workaround to avoid violations one strategy is to reimburse patients for their costs rather than make a direct payment to a marijuana dispensary legality of this has not been tested in said the general counsel of the compensation institute state marijuana laws vary but broadly in states that have legalized marijuana for recreational it is not a crime for residents to possess small quantities of the drug and it is legal for licensed dispensaries to sell it patients approved to use the drug and dispensaries enjoy similar protections in states with medical marijuana laws all states have retained laws that protect the right of employers to have a workplace an employer can withdraw a job offer to a candidate who tests positive for marijuana on a drug screening or fire an employee who tests positive but several states with medical marijuana laws contain provisions that bar an employer from making an adverse decision in cases where an employee approved to use the drug shows evidence of it on a screening said a senior executive at quest one of the largest companies in the united states those same protections extend to a person who qualifies as a caregiver be fired for testing in such said who is the director of

marijuana legalization there are also concerns about its effect on workplace safety some studies suggest that marijuana use can impair a though little data exists to compare the effect with that of other drugs like in states where recreational use is the problem for employers becomes one of determining when an employee used because detectable levels of it remain in the body for days afterward as

the election of j trump gives the republicans in congress a chance to act on their desire to get rid of a wish that trump mostly says he shares e and the health policy analysts for the then i think safe to say few in congress thought they would have this opportunity but like the proverbial dog who has finally caught the after untold futile republicans have finally come within reach of repealing the affordable care act now comes the essential will they actually do been promising it but i am still skeptical that it will happen i believe you disagree going to let you go first why do you think do i think do it because they so thoroughly own the idea of having passed bills to partly delay or the in the house something like times just the other day senator endorsed repeal the house and senate also agreed to do in large in a budget reconciliation bill earlier this year the only thing that prevented it was that president vetoed it i doubt trump would do the same if given a similar opportunity i know that a budget reconciliation dismantling of the law is not a full because according to the rules it can only touch provisions this excludes things like requiring insurers to take all comers for premiums that vary only by age and smoking status or preventing them from imposing coverage caps and lifetime among other measures i also must add that much less confident of a repeal partial without agreement on a replacement but turn it back to do you think the has to offer a full replacement to get its members to sign on to or can it offer something that would cover fewer people and with fewer i think they can get away with slightly fewer people and somewhat skimpier but not too much a part of me that thinks many in congress were always so willing to vote for a because they knew it had no chance of being signed into law they got credit for the vote without ever having to face the downside actually repealing without replacing would mean effectively stripping more than million people of their health without anything in return this would be an unmitigated political disaster the stories of people with diabetes and more who were suddenly stripped of their insurance and left out in the cold would very likely dominate our discussion for months that leaves more than enough time to lead to significant repercussions in the midterm elections with no democratic leaders in any branch of government to i think this would be akin to what happened in the but in reverse if they can coalesce around a plan that leave too many people then i think they could move forward but in all the years since the was republicans been able to do that do you think they what do you think that plan would look one way to get from repeal to replace that minimizes immediate political risk is to pass a plan that call for repeal for several at least after the though possibly after the election between now and there would need to be some kind of transition to whatever replaces that just dump people off coverage with no alternative but the alternatives could just be not as comprehensive or costly absolutely there will be bad stories but keep in there will be bad stories under too rocketing huge cost sharing and markets with few choices is not a recipe for political success republicans now own the task of fixing those things and doing so in a way that does not look as if making better actually in a tough policy spot get the blame if they fix or repeal the and get the blame if they replace it with something people like better health policy is a very difficult and thankless task i think opt for something they can call repeal and but they could also just let struggle and die neither looks good one other way to get out from under the issue is to kick it to the states do you think a trump working with a will offer greater flexibility to states to design their own coverage plans that could diverge from if what are some ideas states might i think very likely those in congress could punt to the states for been trying to change funding to a block grant that they can then constrain over time this will be enticing for them because it will allow them to reduce spending in the while forcing states to make the tough decisions and take the blame for cuts in either beneficiaries or services fixing the markets for those who are getting health insurance through the is a different story without some sort of market which generally been opposed the same problems that existed with respect to conditions and individual ratings will exist many people will become uninsured annual and lifetime limits could reappear lots of people will have problems getting insured i have yet to be convinced that a significant number of republicans in the house might coalesce around such a plan maybe for but not sure about the exchanges even if they likely the democrats in the senate would try to filibuster either of these plans you i think democrats would filibuster anything they could the filibuster is not set in stone a senate majority can change and some are already calling for the to do so but that appear to be what the senate will do retain the filibuster this could play to their since they can propose things they let the democrats filibuster them and take the blame when repeal kicks in with no replacement perhaps another way for republicans to get out of their political bind sure have more to discuss as president administration comes into power
people are gay get over that slogan was posted on buses in it was aimed at some groups who understood human sexuality not as a spectrum of many shades but as a stark choice between right and the permitted and the of us are prone to this kind of binary but it is amplified and exaggerated by because its discourse is the adversarial you are either for it or against it nothing in from anything this is a very boring way to look at the world got it when he tragedy here is not just the absurdity of trying to purge the world of its crazy but in the pain and hurt it causes those who or force themselves on to our reductionist latest collision between the glorious variety of humanity and the dreary compulsion to split it into opposing pairs is in our attitude to gender now we that like is fluid and plural and in some people it may never be permanently determined it might even shift during a single lifetime humans are incorrigibly plural if got a problem with time you got over it humans are incorrigibly plural if got a problem with time you got over also time the leaders of faith and their equally passionate that human approaches to religion are varied there are those who are firmly in and those who are firmly out of religious institutions there are those whose belief is strong and those whose unbelief is equally unyielding and like the majority of the population whose gender and sexuality are clearly they are the ones who claim to define the territory for the rest of us but there are as many hues on the religious spectrum as there are on gender and sexuality we should acknowledge that and come to a more generous and comprehensive understanding of this aspect of human are those for whom religious observance is a way of guaranteeing comfortable accommodation in the life to come after death their gaze is mainly on the other world and how to get there but for an increasing number of us life after death has no attractions and we doubt that it exists it is life before death we want to concentrate our attention religious energy has shifted from belief to action and from creed to compassion and we find that listening to the wisdom of its wisest teachers helps us to do that we think of ourselves as rather than believers but we want to persuade believers out of belief any more than we want them to persuade us into it what we want is to join them in making life better for everyone and let what happens after death take care of gulf between us is not so wide those who believe in life after death warn that its quality depends on how we have lived in this life doing good while we are on our earth may secure us everlasting habitations in the world to but it will also leave this world a better place than when we entered it and that is exactly what those of us with no interest in eternal life too our motives may vary but the result will be the in my experience if you take this approach to religion you get caught in a withering crossfire both the champions and of religion attack you with equal fury that old binary game you have to be one thing or the they yell you cannot be both or anything in between tough some of us are get used to little history of and

if you were to be presented with a scene of unimaginable where several of your were being hacked to death and their entrails and vital fluids scattered liberally around the your immediate reaction would presumably be to run away from this and try to find safety you busy it would be a bit alarming if you were to offer to pay to watch this possibly while eating popcorn or nachos may also lead to vomiting if taken to and countless people technically do exactly that the saw franchise alone has grossed close to a billion dollars at the box and just one series of horror just at the cinema there are far more options and formats out all dedicated to presenting people with scenes of intense gore fear and people lap it up that would be the point clearly a huge market for things which should logically scare or repulse best example of this is which is going on around us right now a celebration of all the things that should scare us the fact that warped into an occasion dedicated more to sugar consumption and questionable attire is we created an occasion to celebrate things that by scare us twitter a and the inevitable loss of freedom and crushing weight of responsibility such a thing would stock do people get such a kick out of looked at one it makes no logical sense fear is an unpleasant evolved to make us wary of and to avoid dangers this is obviously a vital survival and as such very deeply entrenched in the workings of our brains humans are very quick to fear and from phobias to social even the most seemingly innocuous occurrence can trigger an unpleasant fear reaction the vomiting reaction to gore also underscores our fundamental disgust again a very powerful reaction supported by fundamental brain processes these things have evolved over millions of to keep us healthy and alive thus they seem to be doing a good do the same brains that induce these intensely negative also motivate us to seek them there are a few possible explanations at the most basic the theory being scared and triggering the response is incredibly having a number of definite effects on our workings theory argues that the stimulation experienced via fear is essentially transferred to other which may not be similar in any way scary things make everything else more and this is exciting and appealing this is quite a simple explanation and humans are more complex than that another argument is that we all have these dark impulses or and having some form of outlet for this is a good thing people regularly wonder about and worse if ever stood next to someone by a high drop and thought would happen if i just pushed them then you know what this is like some argue that indulging in horror and other provides an outlet for this meaning less likely to act on it the counterargument is that it us to such meaning we need more visceral entertainment to provoke the original reaction many people have commented on how modern horror is a far more bloodier affair than that from previous decades are we seeing on a cultural twitter or melting either disturbing possibility involves the reward pathway this is the vital region of the brain that produces pleasure and good feeling whenever we do something that the brain fundamentally of drink water when eat a sweet have an enjoyable sexual encounter with someone you find attractive up to these are things that the brain as positive so encourages you to do them again these things may not be in the moral or societal talking at a more physiological level another thing the brain probably considers a positive is when experiencing high levels of the more fundamental brain processes think in danger then not scared any more because the film whatever it was you did to escape the scary the brain likes so provides a reward and people experience enjoyment and pleasure from being and happily pay for the privilege by buying films or books that scare or join in when everyone runs around scaring everyone else some people take it beyond even putting themselves in actual danger by engaging in extreme sports or similar these people are officially described as having the personality trait more even evidence to suggest that such people have genetic properties that compel them to risk their having different expressions of dopamine which are crucial for the reward only works up to a though and this point is how much control we have of the situation even the most dedicated thrill seeker will train and use the best they randomly hurl themselves off cliffs or out of planes and the more mainstream may indulge in the most gruesome of but they know that at any point they could leave the stop the put the book down etc being in the same room as a vicious serial killer would not be a popular and genuine dangers tend to make people happy they cause things like it seems our brains do enjoy being scared as long as we can stop it at any time

is putting its considerable financial and engineering muscle into the experimental field of quantum computing as it works to build a machine that could tackle problems beyond the reach of digital computers there is a growing optimism in the tech world that quantum devices that were once the stuff of science are possible and may even be practical if these machines they will have an impact on work in areas such as drug design and artificial as well as offer a better understanding of the foundations of modern physics decision to move from pure research to an expensive effort to build a working prototype underscores a global competition among technology including and which are also making significant investments in search of breakthroughs in the exotic world of quantum has set itself apart from its competitors by choosing a different path the approach is based on particles known as which physicists describe as existing in just two dimensions to form the building blocks of a supercomputer that would exploit the unusual physical properties of subatomic particles leading researchers acknowledge that barriers still remain to building useful quantum both at the level of basic physics and in developing new kinds of software to exploit certain qualities of devices known as that hold out the possibility of computing in ways not possible for digital systems unlike conventional which can be only on or off at any one representing a digital or can exist in or simultaneously in both states if are placed in an state physically separated but acting as though they are deeply intertwined with many other they can represent a vast number of values simultaneously a quantum computer would most likely consist of hundred or thousands of began funding research in the field in when it quietly set up a laboratory known as station q under the leadership of the mathematician freedman now believes that it is close enough to designing the basic building block that the company is ready to begin engineering a complete said a veteran engineering manager who will direct the effort over the he has led various including its video game machine and the augmented reality system we get the first figured we have a road map that allows us to go to thousands of in a rather straightforward said there is still a debate among physicists and computer scientists over whether quantum computers that perform useful calculations will ever be created a variety of alternative research programs are trying to create using different materials and designs the known as topological quantum is based on a field that took on new energy when this prize in physics was awarded to three scientists who had done fundamental work in forms of matter that may exist in just two dimensions project will also include the physicists of delft m of the university of of the university of and of they will all become employees as part of the artificial intelligence and research group that recently created under the leadership of one of its top technical harry newly hired physicists say the decision to try to build a topological quantum computer comes after scientific advances made in the last two years that give the scientists growing confidence that the company will be able to create more stable magic recipe involves a combination of semiconductors and said the researchers recently made a in their ability to control the materials used to form he said most of the competing approaches involve cooling quantum computers to near absolute zero temperatures so there are relatively few proven algorithms that could be used to solve problems more quickly than digital computers one early known as would be used to factor giving hope that quantum computers might be used in the future for breaking codes that would potentially have consequences because modern electronic commerce is built on cryptographic systems that are largely unbreakable using conventional digital computers other proposed approaches might allow faster searching of databases or perform machine learning which are being used to make advances in computer vision and speech recognition more these tools might advance the basic understanding of a possibility the physicist p mentioned when he speculated about the idea of a quantum computer in for his dream application for a quantum computer would be a machine that could solve problems in quantum
a judge has rejected the settlement of a lawsuit triggered by the new city police surveillance of on the grounds that the terms did not go far settlement ruled upon was a resolution of two which stem from revelations that the was conducting widespread surveillance of that plaintiffs argued had violated their settlement resulted in mayor bill agreeing to appoint a civilian monitor of the pending approval by a presiding judge in the s agreed with the overall structure of the settlement but found that the powers of the civilian representative agreed upon in the settlement did not go far proposed role and powers of the civilian representative do not furnish sufficient protection from potential violations of the constitutional rights of those and believers in who move and have their being in this wrote in his means that a new settlement will have to be negotiated by the parties involved or take the matter to main contention in the negotiated settlement was the power and appointment of the civilian representative the settlement stipulates the representative should report violations to the police who is only obligated to investigate the but argued the representative should rather file quarterly reports to the also rejected provisions that the mayor should appoint the civilian representative and have the power to eliminate the position after five lawsuits arose following revelations that the with help from the was using undercover informants to spy on throughout new and new jersey in religious hookah bars and other his also cited a recent report by the inspector an oversight body the report examined the compliance by the intelligence unit of the guidelines a set of provisions designed to ensure the does not overreach when investigating political or religious groups the report found the department has consistently violated several regulations by continuing investigations and using informants for extended periods without authorization the report also highlighted in a footnote that of investigations were launched against to some watchdog groups and the targeting of has continued despite the disbanding of the demographics which was created in the wake of and focused on monitoring judge said the report described a near systematic failure on the to comply with these particular guidelines officials characterized the report findings as vindication that they were complying with was also the judge who ruled in favor of expanding the powers to allow it to act with less oversight plaintiffs in the cases are represented by several civil liberties including the and the new civil liberties all of which received ruling ruling is an opportunity to put stronger safeguards in place and we very much look forward to discussing the suggestions with the and with the said a law professor at school of where he directs the clear project we believe that this is in the interest of all new we hope that the reforms are implemented as soon as city law spokesman nick said they were disappointed the settlement was not the extent that the decision is based in part on an inspector report containing findings with which both the city and class counsel variously we are disappointed that the settlement was not approved as the parties originally said in a statement we will explore ways to address the concerns raised by the executive director of rising up whose group has documented the ongoing surveillance by said that even with the the settlement does not go far enough as it largely depends on good faith from the police department which they have not earned the judge points and the inspector general report the has a long history of ignoring rules and disregarding court orders and their own
the surgeon new facing is chock full of statistics intended to startle people into action one in seven will experience a problem with alcohol or other drug misuse in their and some million have current substance use disorders but with people dying from overdose every only of people with addictions ever receive any sort of help towards we should all drugs read more far too too many in our country have viewed addiction as a moral writes surgeon general in his introduction must help everyone see that addiction is not a character flaw it is a chronic hopes to spur revolutionary change the way his predecessor terry with his report on smoking that galvanized into confronting the clear link between cigarettes and lung cancer but with facing he produced a report that is radical enough to do so while it calls for welcome initiatives on many fronts such as expanding access to harm reduction including needle exchange and distribution of the opioid overdose antidote it go nearly far enough for while calling for treatment and more drug court the report recognize that we treat other diseases with punishment or criminalization while correctly noting that interventions and confrontational addiction treatment are not it reckon with the fact that they are while demanding increased access to treatment supported by scientific it makes no attempt to address the contradictions inherent in labeling addiction a disease while the vast majority of treatment programs work to get patients to accept the prayer and surrender to a higher power involved in the of these issues has led to a report that is which interferes with its usefulness this is most glaring for those concerned about opioid addiction for one of the emphasized in the report is scientific evidence shows that treatment for substance use disorders including and outpatient are compared with no this will be used by expensive rehabs to justify insurance coverage but this is not true for residential and outpatient treatment for opioid addiction that include ongoing use of maintenance medications such as methadone and which is the majority of residential care in a study of the entire treatment system showed that people with opioid addiction who underwent residential or other types of treatment without maintenance medication had twice the death rate of those who stayed on another problem that results from vagueness in the report is its use of the term assisted to refer to all three medications currently approved for the treatment of opioid addiction the report is a highly effective treatment option for individuals with alcohol and opioid use disorders studies have repeatedly demonstrated the efficacy of mat at reducing illicit drug use and overdose deaths improving retention in treatment and reducing is true of only two of the methadone and there is no data suggesting that that the reduces overdose death rates oral or implanted forms were associated with an eight times greater risk of death in research compared to deaths following not enough research to know if the injectable version could have similar only use of methadone or is linked with saving this data should have been highlighted and these medications advocated as superior the report address the problems associated with a tactic called step which is used in one form or another by at least of all treatment programs this as the report promoting that abstinence is the only pushing to a and urging involvement in a step report cites evidence showing that in the treatment of this approach is as effective as less problematic and more systematic treatments such as therapy and motivational enhancement therapy but what it explain is why a treatment that has been ruled to be religious in every relevant court case should be used when there are good alternatives and it note that there is little evidence supporting it for opioid treatment highly unlikely that the public will be convinced that addiction is really a disease when the main treatment for it continues to involve admitting immoral behavior and making amends for it and since you can attend groups for free in nearly every city around the i remain baffled as to why reports like this call for the removal of content from paid professional even if only to avoid redundancy and save is not to say that programs helpful as support groups for some merely suggesting that a report calling for improvement of addiction treatment cannot sidestep the reality that they are not professional care and should never have been sold as addiction is to be seen as a disease like any it be and it be the only part of medicine where being made to surrender to a higher power is legitimate therapy any report that confront the contradictions in the way we moralize addiction while claiming to want to cannot produce the radical changes that and everyone else concerned with addiction knows are
the significance of the agreement coming into force today is easy to it may seem like an given the travails that led up to its signing last the moment is of huge importance this is the first time that a signed by all of the functioning has laid down a commitment to limit the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere with the goal of preventing global warming exceeding above levels this figure was not plucked out of the increasingly air it is the limit of what scientists regard as beyond which climate change will run out of unstoppable in its damaging are caveats the agreement is legally binding in forcing governments to accept and cater for the limit but the commitments on curbing greenhouse gas emissions in line with that goal are not legally binding this means incoming governments can renege upon them there are no sanctions for governments that flout the outcome of the us presidential election will be key the republican candidate whose polling has improved markedly in recent has vowed to cancel the participation in the agreement has also failed to ratify the along with several other nations china has but if us participation is not forthcoming under a future trump that may be while the agreement should be hailed as a massive and historic step forward in international efforts to avoid dangerous levels of global it is potentially the signs of danger are growing increasingly strong this year is almost according to to be the warmest on following last temperatures this gives the lie to the claims of that the upward march of global temperatures has year may not set but the trend is clear we are on a trajectory that may lead to warming that is unprecedented and potentially irreversible while there are other encouraging signs the growth in renewable energy use around the the small reductions in emissions in some major economies we should be in no doubt the real work of remains to be it in the ground
in an aggressive exchange on fox the former house speaker newt accused conservative host of bias against republican presidential nominee trump as well as a with row on night between and one of most stalwart supporters began when the host brought up the multiple sexual assault and misconduct allegations against the candidate twitter during the ensuing which bordered on personal said the host was with and urged him to your anger issues and spend some time working on director of social later responded on saying had a total fool out of and what happens to her after this election is made a total fool out of herself attacking watch what happens to her after this election is tiff marked the latest chapter in the back and forth between and the trump campaign it started in august when trump suggested tough questioning from the fox news host in the first debate of the republican presidential primary was because she was menstruating she blood coming out of her blood coming out of her trump said on trump has since continued to make a target the republican nominee called her in march and even tweeted at her during after listed off a series of events on the campaign trail that negatively affected standing with female voters a tweet rampage against a former beauty a leaked tape showing him bragging about sexually assaulting women protested that the amount of media attention focused on the allegations was not commensurate with other campaign sick and tired of people like you using language inflammatory not adding think that is exactly the bias that people are upset think that your defensiveness on this may speak i said she trump is a sexual then a big story and what we saw on that tape was trump himself saying that he likes to grab women by the genitals and kiss them against their what we saw then we saw women come forward after he actually denied doing it at a to was he did it to he did it to we saw we saw people who had worked with people from and so on and so forth he denies it it which is his right we know what the truth point to you as a media we get to say the women are concluded have to cover that twitter eleven women who have accused trump of sexual dismissed this and decried the amount of attention paid to sexual misconduct accusations against are fascinated with sex and you care about public responded what i get out of watching you not fascinated by but i am fascinated by protection of women and understanding what getting in the oval not about me about the women and men of and the poll numbers show us that the women of in are very concerned about these former speaker of the house of representatives responded by to call former president bill a she replied that her show had covered those issues at length and concluded the gonna have to leave it at and you can take your anger issues and spend some time working on you elections
sharks are circling as the us prepares to on the lookout for signs of weakness and indecision around the world during the transition period until the next president is firmly established in the white house call it a window of matter whether or trump wins on bequeaths a world fraught with danger from to the middle east and eastern governments and forces hostile to us and the west may try to exploit power vacuum the problem is not new unlike in the us constitution does not allow a quick handover or trump will be sworn in at noon on until then remains in but as a president his wishes are increasingly it can still take months for the new incumbent to establish his or her authority and complete thousands of appointments the most such as national security adviser and the secretaries of and must be confirmed by congress this can be a lengthy most disastrous transition was probably in between and his during the seven states seceded from the union when came to he found the civil war already under way threats are mostly external some trump supporters warn of domestic insurrection if he north is one of the most pressing the dictatorship in has recklessly escalated its nuclear weapons in recent months north latest provocations include the testing of a ballistic missile in of attacking the western us the isolated regime has ignored sanctions and is hardening its determined to prove it is a force to be reckoned with political upheavals in south where the president faces pressure to a tougher military posture adopted by government in and the reluctance of china to crack down on its renegade ally add to a sense of growing instability if north unpredictable senses uncertainty in he may be tempted to fire a literally or across the greenhorn bows with incalculable consequences china faces similar temptations it has been sparring with the us navy in the south china where its expansionist maritime claims and have been ruled illegal by a court is also squeezing whose new government its dislikes and whose facto independence is underwritten by the us does xi calculate he can use distraction to his some analysts suggest xi would welcome a trump because he and trump think alike about national interest or he takes trump for a fool he can bamboozle such considerations also loom large in the middle where seems intent on helping the regime of win the civil war before the next president has a chance to change policy or impose peace terms in lawless where efforts to foster a unity government are more nasty surprises may be in store if state is evicted from and may become its new of operations the involving and is another powder keg could also use the us power vacuum to consolidate or advance as defined by the in and the where tensions are already high how would for to increased military activity and warfare along the border with or the alliance as look to for a lead but one might not be forthcoming trump regularly disparages suggesting he may cut us and like other macho men such as actor appears to admire for her would be to begin her new presidency with an superpower confrontation on top of all as the us transition there as the if an unforeseen international crisis suddenly the security safety net will be more full of holes than elections

wounds and propensity for public meltdowns had pushed the needle toward according to recent polls that may have changed a little in the aftermath of the renewing of its email probe last week but even the fears of many voters that a trump presidency might become a reality have fears are not unfounded failings as a candidate and a person are and he would be in a position to wreak considerable havoc if elected especially true at the agency with the judiciary and in other arenas where the president can wield executive power the aspect of his personality poses risks that be nor can anyone know the degree to which congress would be inclined to obstruct or approve his most damaging has been lost in the salacious and obsessive media coverage of the republican outrageous bigoted remarks and appeal to the worst instincts of the is a critical examination of what a administration will mean for the nation the information on tangled interests within the evidence of influence peddling and revelations detailing manipulation of media and the democratic signal a plutocratic style of governance that is all too familiar and increasingly dominant at the federal content of what has been revealed in these as well as her lengthy track record in government and policy statements as a candidate yield an inescapable represents the entrenched interests of the status quo her election will expand the excesses of global interventionism and corporate welfare that have characterized us policies for several decades at almost incalculable cost both domestically and the has engaged in the type of one expects of presidential especially democrats who seek to counter the image as weak on defense she has agitated against president on and and reiterated her belief in responsibility to the rationale used to selectively promote the elitist economic agenda that she has so faithfully pursued over the years even as the exercise of that dubious mission has resulted in widespread devastation in the middle south and elsewhere a muddled and hypocritical foreign policy has created bitter enemies across the globe and angered us yet supports the rudderless and demonstrably ineffective efforts of president without a hint of and tragic wars in and continue to extract a heavy and though opposition to those wars helped propel into the focus on ending them and preventing new ones has been blurred by the ongoing the war on terror in reality little more than an extension of other armed conflicts the us has waged around the the deadly manifestations of the war on terror have largely been met with silence approval from much of what passes for the progressive movement self destruction has provided a smoke screen for those on the left and the more moderate elements on the right who might ordinarily question unabashed for a continuation of these modified strategies beyond the historical enthusiasm for but not fair trade even while waffling on the gives credence to the belief that she will sacrifice the welfare of workers here and abroad for the unfettered profits of the business elites whom she has always served in the face of documented inhumane labor practices and other related human rights abuses around the the administration and those preceding it have steadfastly refused to demand changes as conditions of honoring trade agreements as secretary of had an opportunity to honor and promote the rights of working people around the world but failed to do so why would anyone expect her to change the inflammatory rhetoric and actions of both and trump stand in sharp contrast to the platform and orientation of the green which offers the only alternative in this election that will move decisively to draw down us military interventions abroad and reduce the military budget to a sane level while redirecting increasingly scarce resources to rebuild the frayed social safety net and help those most in need here at home this election is about far more than our collective distaste for a and trading the noxious buffoonery and personal insults of trump for the clear and present danger of corporatist logic is no at all elections
your article of war and exile stirred as speakers head touched on a subject widely ignored by the press in this despite playing a key role after in expelling million ethnic from born in as a i remember my own deportation in a cattle wagon after the expulsion decrees issued by president an act of ethnic cleansing supported by the wartime with much in the vanguard for hundreds of years and had lived peacefully together in and the growing nationalism of the century led to the foundation of the state after the first world war and destroyed that relationship the decrees are still in place so reconciliation between and people is more than overdue and the event in is a step in the right direction other encouraging objective discussions of the topic include the recent study by historian rm orderly and the expulsion of the after the second world war friendships like the one between and described in your article will help to overcome decades of misunderstanding and mistrust we need many more of these world
a survey of people has shown that most of them think jeans should not be worn by anyone over the age of the survey are a younger game and look suitable on the older man or as someone over the age of help but agree the main reason is as we the skin on our faces and hands start to sag and get wrinkly our bodies lose their shape often after only a few tend to get wrinkly and and can lose their shape very quickly and do we really as we to wear clothes that reflect the general decrepitude of our we may be collapsing but surely most of us would want to look as if our at remain older we the more important it if we want to look to wear clothes that are crisp and fresh an on a shirt looks casually messy but not disgusting on an elderly the same egg stain can looks like a glaring pointer to general decomposition so important for jeans to be successful on an older they can only be worn if they are brand crisp and spotless in other for the first five minutes after purchase such as world host carol now in her early can get away with it because she is a jeans are suitable at any age if they are worn by cowboys or purely for physical one of the joys of getting older is the ability to let themselves nothing matters any hair can go tummies can go to they are just glad to be out of the but not all of us feel the inner to go down that route and as one whose is still on the lower half of the i would be wary of to be always been wary of them only possessed one pair of jeans in my

for a that the trump transition has some organizing principle beyond the conflicting impulses of a do the first two appointments of as well as the first week of his transition to tell us about his forthcoming first trump seems to have squared two competing desires with as his chief of trump is placating and controlling his own now ruling both sides of capitol hill the chairman is perfectly plugged into the messy politics of the republican as his chief trump is placating the pitchfork mob that helped sweep him to power role inside any organization is traditionally the keeper of the ideological flame in case anyone was still confused about is chairman of a sewer of racist and sexist nothing in is that neat in the brief time the great orange leader has presided over the enterprise of his presidential we know he has a track record of tolerating the kind of internal rivalry that ends up in ritual first campaign warred openly with his second campaign and the same goes for the third and fourth people to fill those roles matter their official and is coin of the realm the only complex situation he seems to manage with some consistency are his announcement was carefully constructed with appointment ahead of such formalities do not go unnoticed in the corridors of power of the where the pecking order is the only game in the is by far the superior having turned from a cult into a powerhouse of white nationalism needless to this is not a positive development for an immensely diverse nation with a long history of racial for his has shown his house of cards talent by staging the coup that ousted his former seized the job of chair just after swept the board in the with no experience in the executive or legislative branches of is hopelessly out of his depth at a party hack who will follow the orders of his friends on capitol hill at drown as he attempts to manage the west the federal national security the venal and a president who has returned to of which makes him easy pickings for who is offensive in every sense of the word according to sworn testimony by his is so virulently antisemitic that he insisted want girls going to school with denies he ever said not for nothing as the league gone public with its opposition to his coming is only one side of the struggle for power inside the administration for the real influence lies in the hands of children and husband to has reportedly ousted the head of the the hapless and gormless new jersey ostensibly downfall was because he is embroiled in the scandal known as but the proceedings about the closure of the bridge have been rumbling for three years a more likely scenario is that could not be trusted with such a powerful transition job because he as us attorney in new over the prosecution of is so much thicker than especially inside trump so many competing the trump presidency has already sown the seeds of its own chaos can these people successfully navigate their way out of a paper never mind the confirmation process that could doom their own case people have with full control of congress and at the height of his the newly elected president stumbled repeatedly with nominees whose tax returns were questionable and who seemed too cozy with corporate power perhaps president trump can help his nominees dodge their tax questions by ordering the to audit them all as quickly as possible as for his desire to drain the swamp of corporate those promises are now being managed by a small army of lobbyists who control his transition how clueless is team according to the wall street they had no idea the entire west wing would evacuate on inauguration day next that they would have to appoint every single member of except for the permanent help tending to the building and a president intends to spend more time helping his successor understand the scale of what about to take on the first black president is going to help train the white president whose campaign was built on questioning his own citizenship started his presidency winning the peace but he ends it deserving some kind of sainthood like all good the trump presidency is presaging its own collapse at the height of its glory the disputes will corrode the west wing from within they are the manifestation of a leader who projects certainty but cannot decide if he wants to repeal all of or keep parts of if he wants to end abortion rights or force women to travel to get if he wants to bring the country together or end the wave of racist intimidation that is being across our schools and republican establishment may think they can manage trump through but they are about to discover that this dumpster fire of a campaign just turned into a brushfire of a

appearing on that most revered of presidential forums called trump released a video this week describing his plans to great again for and i mean learned not to believe magnanimous but others really want told on that we should give trump opportunity to develop the positive objectives that he may and told an audience in that he wants be respectful of the office and give the an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every forgive because about to pop off have you lost all sense of you and talk as if we have no idea who trump is or what he has been saying for months on end but trump has made it abundantly clear opportunistic words of inclusion notwithstanding that his administration will be loyal to the fringes of the united leaving even the republican establishment running behind announced cabinet choices simply leave no room for imagining a gentler at the helm of the those of us concerned about the fate of the undocumented or the environment or reproductive rights see much reason to worry with the selection of mike and general t to inner circle list reads like a roll call to the dick fan among many other troubling all these men also share a deep antipathy to views are as scary and they are well known pick for national security adviser has called a and stated that is a political that behind this notion of it being a that is not talking about the that republicans frequently invoke but about asked about current republican national committee chair and designated chief of staff told news that are some aspects of the faith that are very i realize that was a scholar of or perhaps even a a renewer of the faith according to popular comes to revive the practice of for following generations or maybe he just said an ignorant thing that would sound bigoted if it were about another religion but today sounds like comments are troubling rather than enabling establishment republicans as a moderating influence on the the trump administration is pulling the traditional down its own giving less extreme republicans about as much voice in this new administration as chair actually worse at least the chair had the good sense to stay quiet my worry extends beyond the realm of what this administration says and reaches into what it will do building a wall on the border is a near physical impossibility the immediate deportation of millions of people is much harder to execute than it sounds but the that can and most likely will secretary of state another hardliner who is in the running for homeland security recently met with trump and was photographed holding his strategic plan for first openly in his hands nobody give this man the nuclear plain for the world to see was the of an useless program of the bush administration officially called and more commonly known as i remember vividly the panic and confusion among the of new city when special registration was first enacted in this which required visa holding men from countries and north to register with the was a massive failure even the own auditor found the program to be ineffective and a huge waste of resources the cost to taxpayers was more than a year and the program alienated around the world from the united states families were torn apart because of special and the brilliant program netted a grand total of zero terrorism registration was useful only as a tool to disrupt average lives and to spend a lot of money needlessly it served no security function and trump is considering reviving it we can assume because it will make this government like doing on the backs of ordinary then this justifying a registry on fox trump surrogate positively invoked internment as a legal precedent for the program that heinous comparison led the new times to publish an by a law professor reassuring us even if the legal decision authorizing internment has never been we be worried because the judiciary now sees the legal justification for internment as constitutional that whole exercise is nuts the question is not about the constitutionality of internment the question is why the hell are we talking about internment are we seriously working through the legal likelihood or unlikelihood of holding large numbers of completely innocent people in detention racial hysteria led us down that road once to say that panic lead us down a similarly treacherous with or without a legal precedent beginning to feel like one major terrorist attack from martial law in this and the new administration even taken office yet a fiction in the us that is frequently promoted by the likes of fox news and that had a major impact on this election the notion is that in our multicultural white get theirs while every minority and special interest group gets extra privileges the idea cultivates a mood of bitterness and even if fundamentally untrue many honestly believe that are getting special privileges that some accept will lead to the imposition of sharia law in this country but this is ludicrous want special privileges we just want to be treated the same way that everyone else is treated going to get special registration hardly a fair need more than assurances from trump that thinking about the whole country when he invokes we need to know that equality under the law will be guaranteed under his administration in what we really need to be doing is proving to all that everyone deserves to be treated equally while acknowledging all of our and that the kind of equality that makes for a stronger until that day every one of us needs to be popping off while we because if we there may come a time when popping off is not just useless but illegal pop everywhere you whenever you can pop all afternoon and evening pop all

to combat terrorism was to dismantle and other networks while avoiding being seen as attacking trump has shown no such qualms has said leaders contribute to the threat of terrorism by refusing to
