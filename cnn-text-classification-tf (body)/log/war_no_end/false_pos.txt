link hello again though we are two weeks out from election day as i sit to write these words i find myself already looking beyond the eighth and at some of the things that i think will happen between now and as well as what i think the landscape will look like in the year leading up to that year election it wo be a popular opinion here on i am sure but as of today i feel confident in saying short of some unprecedented and wholly revelation or event this years election is very likely a done deal will almost certainly be the next president of the united states with just two weeks remaining before election day as of this writing the of polls shows possessing nearly an insurmountable lead while it is true that trump enjoys a very passionate and enthusiastic he has done little to successfully expand that base the potential for him to find a means of connecting with undecided and uncommitted voters is minimal and shrinks with each passing day having come to this i find myself free to look beyond the coming weeks and to try and get a handle on what a post world will look like gazing into my allegorical crystal i see dark and threatening clouds gathering on our horizon clouds that could very well bring a storm of epic proportions our way election night blues the night of the eighth could well be historic in the worst of ways this election cycle has broken several taboos and lowered the bar of political discourse in unprecedented ways it has been a season of highly divisive hyperbole and rhetoric that has a great deal of social tension we currently sit atop a very dry powder keg of anger that is seething and highly volatile passions will be flaring among many as we watch the election results stream in on our computers and phones many of those watching will be deeply emotionally invested in the outcome of this race in this climactic moment as a will be perilously close to critical mass one spark away from potential disaster four years ago a man with some degree of fame was emotionally invested in that years election and he took to social to vent his reactions in a paroxysmal spasm of emotion that minor celebrity was one j source imagine for a moment what could happen if history repeats itself and this same man goes on a similar rant this election night imagine the violence such a display could potentially trigger then stop imagining and take a deep breath such a reaction is not just possible given the it is more than likely the probable outcome trump is currently heavily invested in telling his followers that the election is that they have no voice and that he is only who can save them this is a very dangerous and unstable bit of social chemistry most trump will not lash out in violence if their candidate loses the race even if they personally feel that the outcome of the election was not legitimate however some trump those in the extremes of what the media is currently calling alt very well could take to the streets in rage given some of the fringe support that trump i would honestly be surprised if such things were not already being planned by a handful of those on the fringe the rhetoric of revolution has been abused of late and there are always the few who take such statements far too literally across the line put if election night comes and trump loses and if he takes to twitter as he did four years ago it could well result in a very long and bloody night a catastrophic night that we will look back upon with shame a night that could well poison our nation for years to come much ado about trump many pundits and wonks have mused over the fact that it truly does appear that trump has been laying the groundwork for a future media operation presumably a news network or service of some kind i count myself among those who have been suggesting so for a fairly long time however where i differ is that i do see it as being quite so cut and dry any longer while i do think that trump original thoughts or more the thoughts of those who influence trump was to create a new media conservative news venue i think that it now grown into something more i think that trump or whatever they end up calling it is too generic there no inherent propaganda value in the name i think something more like is probably more on point will be used as a device to begin a new political party more accurately to succeed where others have previously failed looking at you and beck by congealing the various and fringe right wing groups into one collective and singular entity a party firmly rooted in extreme nationalism with enough religion and conservatism thrown in to gain wider appeal my prediction is that trump will remain the focal point and figurehead of this coming movement using this new network much as he currently utilizes his twitter feed a platform for him to vent his late night angers and insecurities his name will be predominantly used in the branding and messaging and trump will be the face of it all the most frequent speaker and guest imagine if the apprentice had been a live streaming show and trump had the power to walk in at any moment to say whatever happened to be on his mind that is how i see trump however i do see trump being the driving force behind the actual message trump is a after all he has made his place in this world by putting his name on buildings he did shows that he did create and ideas he did originate trump works as a spokesperson the
link years ago i came here for the and after a small amount of time i stopped mostly due to nothing being most stuff is at least in my opinion the below is even if it not as exciting as videos my main reason for posting is about one of the times i saw back in summer of i went on a camping trip to possum kingdom lake in west with a friend last trip as a single guy before i got married the following the trip was a lot of cliff and camping out at night beneath the no just star gazing while we eventually drifted off to sleep nightly and i were best friends and also worked together one really dark chilly and moonless night about or we had tucked ourselves in our sleeping bags and had a really good spot with no to look at the night i had excellent vision then and could see pretty danged was my friend was he partook of the herb and drank beer daily and i consumed a few beers by nightfall we were tuckered out and wanted nothing more than to just go to the heat of the west day really took it out of us the campsite was only accessed by we used a rental so we paddled our way to this place that was a fairly large and very rugged rocky peninsula with some cliffs being foot high seemed a lot taller to we camped on the top of the cliffs at night and played down on the water by day so this one night i was looking at a particular spot up there above us and he was looking at i then and right he having binoculars he looked at where i had saw and got pretty excited he finally let me look at it through his binoculars and what i saw was the following slightly larger than what we normally see a satellite was a or and faint bluish looking a clear moving at a speed i remember as being slightly faster than what a satellite would be but not so much faster or slower than any traffic would in my estimation it was going south and we watched it by passing the binoculars back and forth we both assumed it was a satellite exciting but then one of us really ca remember noticed another this time coming from the they appeared to be on a course that appeared to us that would be really a close call if they were at the same altitude when they were getting a little too close for comfort least for the one that came from the east shot a light bluish light at the southbound it was at all do but it appeared more like a beam from a flashlight shot at it it lasted all of a and i am positive that it happened due to we both saw it at the same time the light flash made the southbound one turn now going almost the same direction as the one from the making them both going in the same actually the one that got flashed did make a degree it was really going more of a path more like more like degrees or just guessing now when i say that it it turned not at all anything like any plane would that struck us both as being no curving involved at all we watched them until they both grew dim from the both staying in a straight line to their destination of course we kept thinking that the one that flashed the beam would turn and follow the but nope i could be wrong on the speed and the but the rest is completely accurate the really sharp turn back then was unheard we hear it all of the time years ago though it was talked about at not even in the tabloids this is why this really stood out out to me all of these that almost degree turn to be honest i just did understand what we had just seen we finally got to sleep that i do know how long it took but we but after a few hours woke me up and and i heard that scared us pretty good we had gotten so worked up i guess we listened to the small branches and small gravel rocks moving beneath whatever it was that was about to kill we did until we finally scared ourselves to sleep have to i did partake but only a little i was into it like him but i was on that made us both very i the next morning we found our bread and peanut butter the bread plastic wrapper was there but no bread creepy a few years later my boss i had told all of this to and he made fun of told me that the same thing happened to his peanut butter and bread went missing while camped on a they determined that it was a they do this sort of i know now now to regular people that might not seem like especially now here on this forum more spectacular claims are made daily for back then it was really something my older brother and i were camping with no tent underneath the starry sky of lake in east around in the may i and we were looking at a patch of sky surrounded by silhouetted trees actually talking about when we were kids looking for flying saucers all they were known as back our entire family would look out at the sky in our it was a common thing for us to do back in the after that was its heyday as we stared at the sky in the back of my i mentioned the bluish sphere that i had seen years before at possum kingdom he being quiet through the entire he was that talkative and within minutes of me mentioning
comment the now it can be told now that is all but assured of the democratic presidential nomination for months since the former secretary of state launched her presidential her campaign logo has always symbolized quest to move with the arrow in the logo pointing to the right of dispute that symbolism because for moving forward should be pointing to the left but there is another school of thought about logo many believe that the arrow pointing right actually symbolizes moving to the right as opposed to the left the logo was a brilliant concept designed to help the democrats win over republican voters in the general elections voters who will definitely choose a rightist over a leftist candidate the presumptive is perceived by many as more leftist than which would give the edge among conservative voters who knew the placement or direction of an arrow could spell victory or defeat for an presidential rate

last issue of black agenda i argued that readers should vote for the green party this this i will outline what to expect from a presidency the great migration of republicans into the democratic party tent of has guaranteed her victory in the highly undemocratic us presidential elections corporate media outlets have collaborated with to instill deep popular fear of a trump administration fear of trump has been used to distract the many millions of people in the us who are fed up with both corporate parties this has led to a lack of investigation and analysis of what can be expected once actually takes corporate media has exploited the general population distaste for sexism and white supremacy in the process trump has made heinous statement after heinous all of which should be taken seriously by anyone who calls themselves a movement activist it is critical that the left in the us extend solidarity to those who experience the consequences of racism and sexism every day trump vile character has been used as a means to legitimize the candidacy of his characterization as a fascist has convinced many that his rule would be a greater danger to humanity than a could endlessly debate supporters on the validity of such a claim trump vulgar and putrid presentation has provided supporters with a convenient weapon of defense against all criticism of their own vile choice yet the lesser evil argument has never been weaker than in the elections it is reasonable to assume that a presidency will be far less effective than in effecting capitalist and imperialist hegemony this is why her support the entire ruling has gone into overdrive to spread fear of a collaborative threat in every sphere of us political are ten things to expect from a presidency i will leave it to readers to judge as to whether represents a than trump or just plain the privatization of social security has stated publicly and privately to her wall street friends that she will reignite conversations to downsize the program exposed support for the administration commission that originally proposed cuts to entitlements such as social security and in donors on wall street have made it clear that they would love to get a hold of social security earnings and turn them into a financial market to be traded for must be indicted how ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital voting for the lesser evil john policies will bring great aggression to the us and the world world war iii has stated in nearly every debate that her administration would consider placing a zone in that means us would rain down on and assets in such a move would place the us military in direct confrontation with the has been caught stating that the and lives that will die in such a conflict are well worth the the transpacific partnership often called on the massive corporate trade agreement that captures much of pacific region has been a major talking point in the elections has supported the agreement in the only to switch her position due to pressure from the sanders campaign with sanders firmly in the there is currently nothing in the way to stop from moving forward with the passage and making her private position on the deal a public maintenance and expansion of the surveillance state not much needs to be said here the administration vast expansion of the surveillance state has been exposed by the likes of ed and additionally revealed desire to drone for releasing secrets to the public a presidency has every intention of following up on the administration passage of bills such as the national defense authorization act of this bill gave the us government the right to militarily detain suspects trump wall was secretary of state from over this she helped facilitate the largest deportation of undocumented people in us history she oversaw the detention of thousands of central children during the great migration from the fascist coup in a coup that was drawn up by herself the border is more militarized than it has ever been trump wall rhetoric was indeed a racist but too few recognize that something just as dangerous actually exists under current us immigration servitude to the bankers has received over forty million in support from hedge funds in the elections before selling sanders made it a point to request public access into quarter million dollar speeches to banks like the deregulation of the banks with the passage of the act was a project both her current list of donors and past connection to her husbands policies make her the obvious choice for the finance capitalist maintenance of the mass black incarceration state is the enemy of black from her callous use of the term to describe working class black men to being the architect of the crime the dynasty virtually built the mass black incarceration state under bill and two the prison population rose by this was facilitated by draconian mandatory drug and the deep militarization of local police departments with her it is too difficult to assume what another four years of rule will bring in the realm of policing and austerity and more austerity it was the first administration that eliminated as we know the evisceration of aid to families and dependent children and its temporary assistance to needy families threw millions of women and children into poverty has followed up with draconian cuts to snap there is nothing on track record that indicates her administration would do anything but roll back whatever social programs and protections still exist for the poor in the a boost to the privatization of education received boos in when she urged unions and charter operators to for the greater good of students ever has attempted to exploit the rise of sanders by courting teachers unions to endorse her her position has slightly softened on the privatization of but that hardly matters receives broad support from school
anarchist political observer has over the years espoused a strategy of voting for the democrat in swing states recently with john propounded an eight point brief for evil questions the principle rejecting since lesser evil voting is designed to minimize evil as futile as lesser it is also futile to discuss there being a lesser between the two utterly dominant rightist political parties in the united states in is an equally contemptible or greater sensibly cautions that challenges to the duopoly needs to be contemplated with a full awareness of their possible consequences what are the possible trump should it will undermine the burgeoning movement centered around the sanders particularly if it is perceived as having minimized the dangers posed by the far another consequence is equally a horrendous slide to the right would spur progressives to coalesce among a leftist it might finally cause former or potential democrats to reject the chicanery of the democrats and embrace the platform of the green strategic accounting seriously pushes for on the electoral must not be the and for bringing about progressivism in the us grassroots organizing and activism must continue to oppose poverty and oppose war and and push for human rights and equal opportunity for all people during electoral periods and between election and the is a agent for part and the is a agent for part and the is a agent for part and the is a agent for part i examine and eight point brief for voting should not be viewed as a form of personal or moral directed in retaliation towards major party candidates who fail to reflect our or of a corrupt system designed to limit choices to those acceptable to corporate argument with the exclusive consequence of the act of voting in will be in a contested to marginally increase or decrease the chance of one of the major party candidates is true of the individual act of voting the individual in solitude has little sway over the electoral that is an obvious given when a consciousness sweeps across a multitude of individuals then enormous potentials emerge this desire for a change from the effete status quo what occurred with the almost breakthrough candidacy of and it is also what in a dissimilar with the candidacy of trump has framed the exclusive consequence of the act of voting as the result of an individualistic and it is but individuals can and at form a wider measurable by statistically rigorous polling that has potential ramifications on a much greater scale that mere margins an example of this would be the expression of voter disgust in the federal election of following two successive majority governments led by the a voting tsunami washed away all but two seats in the parliament the conservatives had been around since but the electoral demolition led to the eventual dissolution of the one of these denies the existence of global calls for increasing use of fossil dismantling of environmental regulations and refuses assistance to and other developing nations as called for in the the combination of which in four take us to a catastrophic tipping point trump has also pledged to deport million offered to provide for the defense of supporters who have assaulted at his stated his to using nuclear supports a ban on entering the and regards police in this country as absolutely mistreated and while having an unbelievable job of keeping law and trump has also pledged to increase military spending while cutting taxes on the hence shredding what remains of the social welfare despite of what trump stands for is anathema true there is no need to defend this man trump stakes out important positions diametrical to for advocacy of a zone over her saber rattling with her policy toward free trade cleverly anticipated such an with respect to point which some will challenge by citing the claim that foreign policy could pose a more serious menace than that of any while conceding as an outside possibility that trump foreign policy is most of us not already convinced that that is so will need more evidence than can be aired in a discussion involving this statement insofar as this is the fact of the following the logic through seems to require a vote for though it a bit hard to know whether those making this suggestion are intending it concedes outside possibility that trump foreign policy is in other posits an inside possibility assumes that is saying that there is the strongest that foreign policy is preferable without any substantiation of why this would be so he raises an unreasonable demand for that trump will follow a less menacing foreign policy than given that trump has never held political office no such evidence exists what does exist is plenty of evidence that will pursue a menacing foreign policy there is no reason to assume would reduce the number of military bases overseas or curtail military spending in it is likelier that she would increase military spending she will also likeliest resort to a us military attack to bring about in pushing the us closer to military confrontation with trump detractors compare his bombastic rhetoric unfavorably to rhetoric but toward or undiplomatic utterances are on following while the more preferable policies of trump lack by the same the more objectionable policies of trump also lack evidence for the same trump has no political track record upon which to judge what he would do if in the oval office following this logic one could not pass on hardly of trump pronouncements would he really build a wall on the where is the evidence for would trump really ban from entering the where is the evidence for effectively undermining trump by the same undermines criticisms of the political utterances by trump following logic through it seems a bit hard to know whether his suggestion is intended the suffering which these and other similarly extremist policies and attitudes will impose on marginalized
bill and his cabinet members pursued activities and as secretary of state did the same as she will no doubt continue to bully are only weeks left until we find out if we have a president trump or a president trump is perceived as the candidate who is against the corrupt while is seen as part and fabric of the establishment and as the most corrupt candidate to run for president in the history of the president in a few weeks would return us to the hostile climate towards that we saw in the overseen by her husband after he took office in the us relationship with went on a considerable for nearly a did not bother appointing an ambassador to even as he went about opposing on multiple leading to anger in the establishment initially he was intent on disarming and weakening by preventing access to technology and also mounted a sustained attack on the economy by imposing several economic senator who is now the vice president under introduced an amendment in the bill granting aid to making the aid conditional on the fact that could not sell cryogenic engines for space the administration was hellbent on hurting the development of space and technology sectors and blocked the sale of supercomputers that had been approved under the administration was also targeted for several economic sanctions and was threatened under what was called the super clause of the trade economic sanctions were specifically borne out in the way attacked the textile and carpet industries throughout the the terms and became synonyms for the us attempts to retard the economy and led to many protests in was justified in believing that relations had hit the lowest but things took a dramatic turn for the worse during bill second term in office became the new secretary of state and she was increasingly hostile to especially through her television outbursts in fact she loved attacking so much she went at it after leaving office and called for a plebiscite in justifying the actions of violent groups in the policies look like a death sentence for things to expect with a presidency must be indicted how ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital remember this is the same who advocated bombing and then got her investment firm to attempt a takeover of mines in that country like the she also knows how to abuse her power lest we also justified the deaths of half a million children and claimed that the deaths were and the icing on the cake for this particularly nasty has already threatened women in and claimed that there was a special place in hell reserved for them if they did not vote for is already talk of in the frame as secretary of state under would continue his agenda and try to thwart the development of space and other technological advancements then of course there is closest a duplicitous lady called who is of descent and whose family has links to radical elements in and could end up playing an important role in determining foreign policy and would be certainly point against is that the hawkish henry has supports her and her oeuvre as secretary of state this is the same who is so hostile against many of his racist statements are even on tape to that is in the light of this setting that many have opposed the candidacy of and have come out in support of trump in contrast to the policies of the trump has promised to make the best friend of the us and has stated that he looks forward to working with prime minister trump has also reached out to in us while there is always a risk of the unknown and it is not clear if trump can make the change he wants a presidency will certainly be a major step back for order for to build a constructive relationship with it requires people in both countries to have good intentions it is clear that cannot have a strong and forward looking relationship with the us if is running the corridors of power on the other trump has articulated the right intent and his stance holds promise for

elections by bar editor and columnist the major parties are more concerned with preserving their duopoly than with defeating each other progressives help preserve duopoly failing to understand that as long as they are complicit with the they have no power most people are actually more green than democratic in their but have a hard time comprehending that there are more than two according to green candidate flowers by bar editor and columnist the message of the green party resonates with people because we talk about real issues that they experience in their lives and solutions that they want to see the democratic and republican parties attempt to monopolize the presidential media cycle was challenged by candidates like who ran for the us senate on the green party ticket in she used the electoral platform to speak directly to working class communities flowers was profiled in a recent bar article regarding the decision of the league of women voters to deny her the right to participate in the only televised senatorial debate flowers took to the stage and demanded to be recognized as an equal participate in the electoral process she was escorted off stage by security forces under protest with audience members let her is a pediatrician and mother of three in she made the decision to stop practicing clinical which she viewed as antithetical to the welfare of working class and front line communities she decided to practice political medicine the class dynamics of health care is evident to her the wealth divide is one of our biggest health care problems and is the cause of the greatest disparity in health outcomes in she joined physicians for a national health becoming a congressional fellow and opening a chapter in she was arrested at a senate on health insurance for speaking on behalf of the single payer option said in an our first goal was to have a seat at the table we get a at least we could expose the insincerity of the current attempt at reform and show that single payer was actively being excluded views the struggle for health care as part of a broader economic and environmental justice movement she has organized campaigns to fight for state and federal single payer health care systems in provided leadership and took on corporations focusing on the issue of net the concept that everyone should have equal access to the regardless of their usage or ability to pay i met during the freedom plaza occupy movement in where she helped me organize the occupy demonstrations provides her reflections and analysis on running as the green party candidate for the us senate in what political and cultural lessons did you learn from running against the democratic and republican running for office in taught me that the major political party especially the democratic are pervasive in our state their tentacles reach deep into the the the polling organizations and the universities there is a culture in the state that is trapped in the duopoly people are so used to thinking in terms of just democrats and republicans that they have a hard time comprehending that there are more than two parties it is almost like a habit when confronted with the reality that the polls and universities were excluding our the most common responses were that this is how it has always been or that they excluded us because they could it was disappointing that the league of women which is supposed to be nonpartisan and educate voters about their choices on the imposed an arbitrary high polling criterion that was used to keep me out of debates it was disappointing that a public the university of which sponsored the only televised senate debate in shut down political discourse by excluding me even though i would have provided a perspective that was not heard in the debate it was interesting to see how the media and polling organizations create a situation for alternative party candidates early on in my when public pressure was the sun published one article on my campaign that mostly argued that i had no chance of winning and that i was mostly like a democrat their failure to cover my campaign early or to even mention that i was running when they covered the other made it less likely that i would reach potential donors and volunteers this made it less likely that i would poll especially since there were few polls that included me and they were done in as a my low polling numbers were used to justify my exclusion from events when our campaign did reach we received a very welcoming response people are interested in a broader discussion of the crises we are facing and solutions to them the solutions that i support are widely supported by the public and it was interesting to see how progressive organizations are trapped inside the democratic party and fail to understand that as long as they are complicit with the they have no power they fail to understand that their undying support for democrats basically means that they are taken for granted progressive organizations endorsed van and even though their platforms include support for and war and only partial solutions to the crises in and other human rights violations this support and undying commitment of progressive organizations to the democratic party defies logic in your how can the green party use the momentum of your state campaign as well as the national campaign to create a more effective popular it is already happening new green party locals are forming around the state of the current locals are growing many of the people who are involved in the locals are also involved in advocacy and so there is a natural synergy it is our task now to continue to nurture and grow that for the next election and to encourage greater collaboration and visibility of the green party with local movements my next focus will be

presidential campaign by no a threat to life on earth but the duopoly electoral system is a menagerie of warmongers the response to the white nationalism of trump has been the rainbow coalition of hawks has proven an awesomely prolific war maker sanders is no it is only the white nationalist orange demon guided only by his own whims and twitter feuds that is at all off script on this question by so long as there is a ruling class they shall rule by fire and blood the loathsome and shameless hypocrisy of the democratic party and the doctrine of has been laid bare this political season this same democratic party that unquestionably rigged the primaries against the sanders campaign is now selling itself to the public as the savior of the downtrodden from the threat of an right wing candidate at this point in her election run appears to be making no promises to the public other than to not to physically morph into trump during her coronation come election day is a bankrupt political ideology and the means by which the democratic party deadens any inkling towards decency or rational self interest that may lay dormant in the electorate and the democratic party intend to use the platform of least not being to install the most despised democratic candidate in a generation into the white house it is indeed horrifying that a straight up eugenicist billionaire who brags about sexual assaulting women won the republican primary it is terrifying that the cult leader of a white nationalist zombie apocalypse has gotten this far through the electoral process there is no greater threat to the future of much of life on the planet than the country is polarizing and it is terrifying to see that much of it is polarizing in the direction of trump whose campaign is defined by phrases like make great again quickly followed by will pay much of the country is also polarized in the direction of sanders it was the political apparatus of the democratic not the that prevented these two competing visions from standing before the public setting aside the for a that we do live in a it must be noted that in politics is an ideology by for and sanders are all advocates of the us war machine if any of these three warlords were to sit in the seat of power children in far off lands would still be bombed in their sleep and be reported on as collateral damage is the most bloodthirsty advocate for murder and mayhem in a political system that thrives upon such practices when it comes to dropping obliterating nations or possibly igniting a nuclear winter there is no greater threat to the future of much of life on the planet than rainbow coalition of hawks far beyond a basket of the republican national convention was a ghastly horror show of the most bigoted elements of political culture less than esteemed actor captured the mood when he so of course lets make great but lets make again that largely captured the theme of the proceedings and most speeches were some variation upon that theme the democrats in response sought to make their convention a big tent of ideas and movements and indeed from the spontaneous chants of black lives matter to leading a chant of to reminding the audience we cross the borders the borders crossed us to letting the thousands in attendance and the millions watching at home know that slave labor built the white house and the from la singing the national anthem in full mariachi garb to the khan family holding a copy of the the democratic national convention did present itself as a stark contrast to what the was offering the theme of inclusion ran high current president made his call for strength in explicitly saying and most of all i see of every every every faith who believe we are stronger black native folks with different all pledging under the same proud to this big bold country that we love one flag to rule them all the greatest and most diverse nation on earth shall ransack the globe as it sees fit general john standing before a multi ethnic group of people continued upon this theme and made the connection between a more inclusive union and explicit projection of might every in uniform or in the white house or at must be a force for unity in for a vision that includes all of every man and every every every faith and every gender orientation all of us together pursuing our common values from the battlefield to the capitals of our and the free peoples of the world look to as the last best hope for peace and for liberty for all for we are the greatest country on this planet so we stand before you tonight to endorse for president of the united states of the message could not be clearer sorry we are all here no apologies rest of the the greatest and most diverse nation on earth shall ransack the globe as it sees fit the response to the white nationalism of trump has been the rainbow coalition of hawks as chiefly embodied in the persons of barrack and the of nations is a war criminal so is john so is rice so are and the secretary of state in an imperialist nation is the immediate manager of the projected might of the empire they represent is known to be a war hawk for much the same reason trump is known as a white nationalist she is blatant and crass about it we came we saw he died on the assassination of in the next during which they might foolishly consider

email get ready for the most heartwarming story read all day if you met or on the you might think they have nothing in common is a retired is a law student has lived in the same suburb of for his entire immigrated to from when she was a teen is a devout is but if you dig a little find that they share a common both and have trump painted on their take a look at the pictures above to see just how similar these two really are when trump announced his campaign last knew he wanted to show his support by painting a large sign of the candidates name on his garage door but probably never would have guessed that one year just a few towns over from own garage would be painted with literally the exact same and may be from totally different walks of but when it comes to the name currently painted on their these two have more in common than they ever could have imagined at the end of the it matter whether their skin is white or brown it matter whether they worship god or and it matter whether the word trump has been carefully lettered or hastily scrawled across the garage in brusque spray paint all that matters is the commonality they share in having the word trump painted on their homes for the entire neighborhood to see it just goes to you should never judge a book by its cover at a time when our country feels so stories like this one give us hope for humanity on the and be more but the messages painted or across their garages are one in the same what an amazing reminder that were not so different after

the west is escalating its of media as weapons of information warfare that need but gilbert finds that accusation just another part of the wests own propaganda war one of the wests top points in condemning regime since has been his alleged suppression of democratic including an assault on media freedom and imposition of propaganda this the accusation was repeated in a resolution of the parliament calling for stronger in defense of values against information warfare from the charges that media are only an instrument of state propaganda directed at the domestic population to keep citizens in line and at foreign audiences to sow dissent among neighbors and within the union are taken as a matter of faith with almost no proofs adduced anyone who questions this group think is immediately labeled a tool of or worse president answering questions from citizens at his annual event on government i experienced this firsthand in march as one of three debaters on the a public affairs i objected to remarks by a fellow chairman of the parliaments foreign relations committee who maintained that crushed all liberties and his country has no free press based on my familiarity with the many different political lines of the print media and of the patently behind the national radio station and television station i countered for coverage of events in the was more and free than coverage in the lashed out with the slanderous and how much did the pay you to say the broadcaster then allowed this exchange to air freely i have ruminated on this exchange ever since and sought incontrovertible proof of the relative freedom of expression on broadcast media my close examination of the wildly popular political talk shows on television first as a spectator and then as a participant has provided just that i have written previously about my initial experience going back six months to when i first took part in a program on the state special correspondent i mentioned at the time the nearly permanent presence on these programs of domestic opposition figures as well as of foreigners from the and in who could be counted on to present views on the political topic of the days discussion at sharp variance with the line assessing the talk shows in early autumn i appeared on the same presenters new show sixty as well on what is probably the most respected show of this evening with another production has done television interviews with and may be considered to be as close to power as people in this medium get his personal views are probably more nationalist than the ruling united but on his shows gives time on air to very diverse and foreign views some of the estimated million who took part in immortal regiment parades across the country over three days in may in the past i broadened my experience with the talk show format by participating in shows on the other major state will and on the largest commercial television meeting this accelerated learning was facilitated by the presidential which made talking heads from like myself a rather hot commodity on television at least briefly in speaking to fellow panelists during break in interviews with i gathered some inside information about the production side of the talk including their target their technical aspects and their substantive positioning anyone looking over television programming in general quickly finds that talk shows as a format take up a very large part of broadcast time of the focus of talk shows may be highly and political talk shows were traditionally an evening as is the case with the shows cited while daytime programming more typically focuses on housewives daydreams of romance or tips for and the like in this it was a bold move when two years ago decided to launch a daily political talk show will in as the target audience proved to be women and viewers aged and although it appears there are also a fair number of viewers watching the program in the work place going daytime the ratings captured by this show typically are in the meaning that or so percent of all television viewers in at the given time are tuned to the given yielding an audience numbering in the millions on when i appeared on the show dedicated to analysis of the election the numbers spiked to as one might well understand given the very great interest among ordinary in the outcome of the race for the presidency and the outlook for war or peace a orchestra performing at roman theater on may after backed by air reclaimed the ancient city from the state from of the as time will tell presenter explained to the decision to appear on daytime television called for certain production decisions differentiating the programs from the evening talk shows the expectation of a less sophisticated audience meant that the language of panelists should be free of political science jargon and allusion to little known names or philosophies said panelists are asked to pitch their arguments as they would talking to their their mom or their lover on the other overly calm discussion is not seen as a benefit the presenter explains that his audience sitting at home at is in need of an adrenaline and the normal penchant of panelists to shout down one another in a is not discouraged in the way it is on evening programming the evening viewer is assumed to have come home from work and is seated in his armchair before the wants his nerves soothed more than excited all political talk shows on the main channels are produced in the and all feature on screen the caption live on air where and when these shows are broadcast live versus rebroadcast from video tapes is another matter for the programs are broadcast live to the far where they appear at the end of evening broadcasts then they are at local evening prime time in each of the
on both sides of the a battle is underway between largely discredited elites and sometimes disreputable a conflict over promises about the future and unsettling memories of the writes by in recent years nationalism has become a bad word in a synonym of racism and wars over the past years elites have instead embraced a concept of based on a world without physical and social borders this view assumes the gradual affirmation of a set of shared values consisting of human rights and economic that however much the remaining autocratic regimes may will inevitably become the standard for the entire world flag of the union it is essentially the argument put forward by in the end of liberal democracy and free markets have won the ideological and represent the culmination of human evolution the political events of are upending this view of the of human rights and economic liberalism the electorate has supported a series of outsiders most notably who has run his campaign in direct opposition to the political and financial invoking economic protectionism and a stronger national identity against the population of the united kingdom voted to leave the marking an irreparable break in the supposedly inevitable process of unification and across support is growing for more political that threaten not only to withdraw from the common currency the but also to seal the borders in response to economic and security threats associated with immigration establishments failure it is no exaggeration to speak of the failure of the entire transatlantic political establishment since the western economies have undergone a transformation that has favored gain over investment the notion of economic freedom has translated principally into support for deregulation and speculative finance secretary of state is welcomed by chancellor at the federal chancellery in on department public domain central banks have made unlimited resources available to the financial sector while large areas of the real economy struggle to feeding discontent among the population it is true that new economic sectors have along with widespread changes made possible by technologies that were inconceivable until a few years but the overall effect has been to hollow out the middle class and create income the principal vehicle of this process has been the economic policy of the union from the implementation of the treaty in nations have been stuck in a monetary that prevents governments from taking effective economic action in the name of market liberalization has been implemented that favors large financial interests while lowering standards of living for the middle class countries are constitutionally required to move towards a balanced with the commission and the central bank essentially having veto power over national policies this has translated into harsh including the massive budget cuts and tax increases inflicted on countries such as and in recent years despite paying lip service to the need for the economic and political elites have refused to abandon this that not only ignores the suffering of the but actually makes the problem worse in fact the austerity causes a drop in economy activity and thus exacerbates budget leading to a vicious cycle that seems unable to stop a big backlash the resulting backlash is calling into question the process of integration as a provoking a strenuous defense by the elite of institutions that are said to have guaranteed years of peace after the second world war the pix sign reads vote trump on main street in sleepy by tony it is of that there are some benefits to and that nobody wants to return to a situation of conflict among the member states but the current policies are quite different than the fruitful cooperation that existed until the when the financial elite began its move to exert supranational control the failed economic policies of the past years are no longer sustainable governments are forced to negotiate over percent of the budget deficit with the bureaucracy in while the need for public and private investment runs in the trillions the policies must change not for ideological reasons or to serve some specific interest they must change because there is no other choice people are revolting against a political class that does not respond adequately to widespread economic and social discontent in times of economic distress the population becomes more vulnerable to raising the risk of dangerous as seen with fascism and in the and there are unprepared and unpredictable political forces with growing support across that in some cases represent a threat to the democratic rights and values that the union aims to promote defending the orthodoxy of policy against popular movements that target failed economic will only further damage precisely those values on which is said to stand what to do at this point needs a return to measures that promote productive investment and rather than cut social welfare programs and encourage further deregulation refugees from wars camped along rail lines in there are two potential a wholesale change in the policies of the without modifying their essential or a step back from the process of cancellation of national sovereignty the first option seems for various reasons these include the constitutional nature of many economic and budget and the stubbornness demonstrated by the ruling class in recent a class despite numerous alarm does not at all seem ready to abandon an elitist view of the response to the vote is a glaring example representatives of the institutions lashed out with arrogance and essentially accusing half of the population of being racist and isolationist its a comforting excuse based on partial that avoids reflection on own mistakes at this point a return of power to national governments is becoming not in order to stop international or to reject shared but because the model pursued by the

an early test of whether president trump will bow to political clout may come over the nuclear agreement which prime minister wants as analyst r pillar describes among the foreign policy issues on which trump took a simple or stance during the campaign but about which he had not seemed to have devoted much one of the most prominent and important is the agreement that restricts nuclear formally known as the joint comprehensive plan of action or when the new president does get a chance to give the subject more he will see that opposition to the agreement is primarily a matter of old political baggage if he does not want to be burdened with such baggage and desires instead to set his own he will build on the agreement rather than succumb to the pressures of those who would like to kill it prime minister at the united nations in drawing his own red line on how far he will let go in refining nuclear fuel the baggage has had two parts one has been the effort by president political opposition to deny him any major achievements applicable to the in that it has been one of the presidents most significant foreign policy achievements even viewed through a crass partisan political this motivation will get more out of date with each day that goes by after leaves office the other part has been opposition of the government in with all the usual implications of how that governments postures affect politics and how the issue has thus been treated as if it were an issue prime minister opposition has been motivated by the objectives of keeping a regional rival to isolated portraying as the root of all problems in the middle distracting attention from problems that involve and its and keeping diplomacy and cooperative measures in the middle east confined to or channels approved by this opposition was maintained even though the agreement that has precluded an nuclear weapon is very much in the interests of as testified to by the large majority of senior security officials and former officials who have been free to discuss the topic a success the is a success it has been fully working for well over a year it has blocked all possible avenues to an nuclear weapon has been complying with its extensive obligations under the as certified by the international atomic energy agency those opponents who have stretched to accuse of violations have been doing exactly stretching president celebrates the completion of an interim deal on nuclear program on by kissing the head of the daughter of an assassinated nuclear engineer government regarding recent accusations regarding production of heavy for the agreement does not prohibit from ever exceeding a specified limit of metric tons the requires to make any excess available for export which is exactly what has done for the new administration to withdraw from the either explicitly by declaring or through sanctions policies that would violate the agreement would clearly be a big mistake to begin any such unilateral move by the united states would run up against the fact that this agreement involves not only and the united states but also five other including major western allies as well as and china the allies have made quite clear that they are committed to the agreement abrogation would not only involve problems with them but also would upset any early efforts by president trump to develop more cooperative relations with a withdrawal could lead to react in either of two each of which would be disadvantageous to interests if the judged the part of the economic and sanctions provisions of the to be too large to they would declare as they would be entitled to that the entire agreement was null and void this would mean would be freed from all the nuclear limitations in the agreement the could spin as many stockpile as much highly enriched and build as many reactors as they want forget the notion of negotiating a better deal that was never a possibility with an agreement that was laboriously negotiated and that was barely politically acceptable in a boon for rivals the might say that it considered the agreement still to be in force with all the parties other than the united states this would mean the getting business deals such as large sales of commercial airliners rather than companies like getting the and it would mean and china getting both commercial deals and diplomatic influence that the united states would not be getting this would be a situation that trump himself said during the campaign was unacceptable republican presidential candidate trump speaking to the conference in on march withdrawal from the would have negative implications for president trump it would an old issue that had been resolved through create a new and consume much time and attention that otherwise could be devoted to countless other foreign policy including ones centered in the middle east withdrawal also would weaken the credibility of anything else the new president wants to do that like the executive action rather than a treaty much of what trump has talked about regarding trade and other matters falls into this category not least backing away from the would kill opportunities to build on the agreement by doing diplomatic business with on many important issues where is unavoidably a major player an excellent guide to those opportunities is a report titled maximizing the opening with how president trump can secure interests in the middle east prepared by the national council and signed by national security experts and scholars the report if diplomacy could be successful in resolving the most volatile and complex point of tension between the and the nuclear dispute president trump should also employ diplomacy to peacefully resolve or manage the remaining differences between and its not just bilateral issues and remaining differences in the relationship that are at stake it is the ability of the united states to address
did prime actually read the full text of the resolution on and before he raved with i think this is a inconceivable he said it is not possible to continue with these resolutions at the and that aim to attack it is shocking and i have ordered that we stop taking this position even if it means diverging from the position taken by the rest of he added who became prime minister in at the relatively young age of knows exactly how the game is played in order to win favor with he must first please tel his country has abstained from the vote on a resolution that condemns violations of the cultural and legal status of occupied east this decision has ignited the ire of ambassador to who riled up the community in to protest the abstention in was converted into a champion of the temple the name uses to describe the holy site cravenly went on damage control mode without truly understanding the nature of the which merely condemned obvious violations of international and only calls for to respect the status of culture in the occupied city none of procedures that led to the vote on the resolution voted by with abstentions violated nor was any of the wording inconsistent with international law in was merely doing its attempting to protect and preserve the historical and cultural heritage of the world is a sacred and a holy city to a majority of simply because it is significant to the spiritual wellbeing of the adherents of the three monotheistic religions in the resolution stated affirming the importance of the old city of and its walls for the three monotheistic outburst is quite to say the for the eager politician simply tried to score cheap political points with thus the united states without a or even partial comprehension of what the resolution resolved nor did he seem aware of the fact that such text is largely a repeat of what has been discussed by the worlds leading cultural organization in and repeatedly before that date if anyone wants to say something about let them say but they should not use to say that the have no links to is like saying the sun creates he paraphrasing the sentiment displayed by the prime minister it would be rather sad if sees a mentor in for the latter is one of the least liked world leaders who has made a mockery of international forums and derided the united nations itself as and its process as theater of the absurd this is what had said in response to the resolution and shortly before he suspended his membership in using a language that is as amusing as his cartoon depiction of the nuclear bomb in his famous spectacle in he to say that has no connection to the temple mount and the western wall is like saying that china has no connection to the great wall of china or that has no connection to the pyramids other officials followed suit with a chorus of included who described the decision as an embarrassment for culture cut to the by labeling the resolution shameful and in it was neither in addition to odd the united states and other western governments reacted with exaggerated again without even addressing the situation on the which prompted the resolution and numerous other resolutions in the past in the first place even the parliament jumped on voting to condemn what they described as a sentiment i have read the resolution repeatedly to pinpoint the specific text that could possibly be understood by friends as to no avail the entirety of the text was based on past international international and refers to as the occupying as per the diktat of the conventions the anger of misdirected and is largely political theater of there is an important context that they refuse to address is working diligently to appropriate and heritage in east a city that is designated by international law as illegally occupied the army and police have restricted the movement of worshipers and is excavating under the foundation of the third holiest in search of a

other institutions will accept practices and designations in following the admission of as a member ranted and raved as resulting in the us cutting off funding to the latest resolution indicates that and the us have utterly failed to coerce what also caused much fury in tel is that used the references to mosque and other religious and heritage sites the same way they would refer to pyramids of and chinas great wall by their actual names hardly since its establishment atop towns and has been on a mission to rename everything with alternatives recent years have seen a massive push towards the of

email trump has stated on advice of his he will not release his tax returns until his audit is by has released her federal not her state or possible other language on her campaign website asserts that she and her running mate continue to set the standard for financial transparency the returns reveal much but they reflect a standard short of full financial transparency more the tax reductions the receive when donating to their foundation and the lower rate of taxes they paid compared to those who make much less reflect some of what is wrong with the tax system gross income is the gross receipts minus their business expenses and of a carried forward capital loss that started in total federal taxes is their income taxes minus foreign tax credits only years plus taxes and additional taxes due to the affordable care act taxes and taxes on investment income starting in for the the foreign tax credit came to or less each year from and arose from work done abroad for years the table below shows the reported gross total federal taxes charitable and the amount of the latter going to the foundation what follows mainly focuses on the tax return income almost all of the gross income after deducting expenses was derived from with the biggest amounts for making speeches more than million made by and million by consulting million made by and writing million made by all of their speaking income is paid by the harry walker agency under who paid the agency or to whom they spoke is not disclosed the tax return indicates that million of bills consulting before deducting was paid by gems education a article describes gems education as the largest operator of private schools in the as of has over schools in over a dozen countries in bill named gems education a strategic partner of the global initiative according to the tax in for the first gems education paid bill raising its payment each year thereafter laureate education paid bill it is described in the new times as a network of schools in laureate hired bill as its new honorary chancellor as disclosed on the tax it paid him over million from bills visits to laureates campuses were described to have inspired the nature of the advice provided is not part of the tax return business deductions both took deductions against their income these deductions are supposed to be ordinary and necessary meaning they are common and appropriate their expenses deducted for and hotels came to several times what most people earn at their jobs in bill claimed travel expenses of for his speaking an amount considerably less than the spent on travel for that business in by his total travel expenses for his consulting business for and together came to less than travel expenses for making speeches in came to another was spent on travel for her writing business in under specific details such as where they went and and for how are not provided tax income is subject to social security and taxes paid by the in social security taxes were paid on only the first of net income at a rate of resulting in a maximum tax of the portion which is of all net income had no income limits if one adds the tax to their additional tax under the affordable care the total comes to or of their total net income the returns show the gross unfairness of the tax that leaves those with high incomes paying a rate that is much lower than those with significantly less income for a person making of income after deducting expenses would pay a tax of which is over of their or more than times the rate paid by the unearned income from the reported no dividend income from stock only interest income in it came to only all but was paid by chase bank how their money is invested with the bank as allowed by the not made clear probably in the form of or bonds by in the made over million in interest income and over in dividends all of the latter is reported as coming from trusts in they also reported over million on the sale of stock held by their trusts most sales were for less than with only one for slightly more the most sales occurred on or before may reflecting very good timing since this was shortly before the financial meltdown their stock holdings were diverse they consisted of holdings in major corporations including bank of general and brothers prior to its bankruptcy at first one might see the as acting upon information that the economy would soon but they may have decided to rid themselves of holdings that might be used against in her run for the presidency in reporting no dividends from probably indicates no into the stock market after the or that they only purchased stocks that paid no dividends there is a huge difference between their total interest and dividend income in of with their interest income of and no dividend income despite the low interest how could their dividend and interest income have plummeted so given the size of their total income all these one has to wonder if they have been spending it all or investing it in ways that do not show up on their tax this raises other questions have they been making large donations or paying large personal legal have they set up an entity that handles investments and pays taxes on the income generated instead of passing it through to them individually to report on their tax charitable contributions those who usually receive the biggest reduction in their taxes per dollar donated are those with the highest income because they are in a higher tax bracket many charitable donors receive no tax reduction because they do not itemize their deductions in the donation to their foundation of million reduced their taxes of the money

email i visited on the day it fell to fighters and a small detachment of us special forces on as we drove into the we passed lines of trucks piled high with loot returning to the enclave in northern us soldiers at a over which waved the stars and were shooting at a man in the distance who kept bobbing up from behind a wall and waving the flag if there had ever been any sympathy between liberators and liberated in it was disappearing fast inside the every government including the was being systematically looted by and alike i saw one man who had stolen an enormous and very ugly red and gold sofa from the governors office dragging it slowly down the street he would push one end of the sofa a few feet forward and then go to the other end and repeat the same process the mosques were soon calling on the majority to build barricades to defend their from marauders we parked our vehicle near a medieval quarter of ancient stone buildings while we went to see a ecclesiastic when we got we found that our driver was very frightened and wanted to get out of as fast as possible he explained that soon after we left a crowd had our number plates as and debated lynching him and setting fire to his car before being restrained by a local religious leader moments before they took action the oil city of was captured at about the same time by the despite having promised the and turks that they would do no such thing there was looting everywhere and i saw two stand in the middle of the road to stop an enormous yellow bulldozer that was being driven off instead of slowing the driver put his foot on the accelerator so the had to jump aside to avoid being crushed inside the newly established i ran into whose father headed the patriotic union of the political party whose militia now held the city he stressed the temporary nature of the occupation of the city we came to control the he said we expect to withdraw some of our men in minutes some but not years later the still hold whose population is and and to which the claim an historic right saying they have only reversed ethnic cleansing by by now the rest of the world has forgotten that there was a time when the did not hold the city the leaders had understood that the invasion and the fall of had created conditions of unprecedented political fluidity and it was an ideal moment to create facts on the which would become permanent whatever the protestations of other players the current offensive aimed at taking is producing a similar situation as different parties and communities vie to fill the vacuum they expect to be created by the fall of just as in the vacuum was the result of the fall of the different segments of the forces potentially involved in seizing the and turks may be temporary but they are also rivals they all have their own very different and conflicting agendas presiding over this ramshackle and disputatious alliance is the which is orchestrating the offensive and without whose air power and special forces there would be no attack the government needs to take and hold main if it is to be convincing as the national government of to achieve rule must be acceptable to the majority

glazer and beyond the melting edition the beyond the melting the and of new city was written in and revised in but its critique of assimilation mythology is as relevant as ever and note that the term melting pot itself was popularized by the who in his play of the same name is gods the great where all the races of are melting and reforming and and and into the crucible with you god is making the what should surprise literally no one familiar with duplicity is that himself was a that is to say he wanted a territorial for people established somewhere in the world preferably with few extant which is why he opposed the choice of it would appear then that did not really believe in his melting pot in a universal sense and neither do the authors of beyond the melting who describe new as a very one of both conflicting and allied rooted in ethnic affinities one may be left wondering if any even lived in new apart from a trickle of wasp given how the slice what were the five largest ethnic groups they literally have an entire section dedicated to naming the who at the time populated a fourth of the city is that will it become and now to burst your bubble and were both liberals and though contemporary liberals and sociologists would probably hate them was a staunch sometimes even a while was infamous for a report he put together while assistant secretary of labor that criticized family structure rates of and was skeptical of providing welfare to single mothers toxic critics accused the report of blaming the a leftist retort that has since become increasingly common while he was the ambassador to the united gave a speech before the general assembly denouncing a resolution which had declared to be a form of racism not very endearing for the current year and while a senator in the he predicted that ethnic nationalism and the slumping economy of the soviet union would become existential threats to communism in eastern and criticized fears of its expansion the of beyond the melting pot were clearly liberals of an older stock than one is used to reading and that more than anything else is what makes this book so fascinating beyond the melting pot tells us a lot of things we on the already but the writers are not on our side it tells us about the alliance between elite and blacks in politics it tells us how have been heavily involved in labor higher government and and the civil rights movement relative to their and how almost all of traces through new it tells us how want religion added to the us census because they want to be able to track their numbers or influence it tells us how liberals view white as an identity group but are willing to concede or polish people exist it tells us how earlier northern migrants such as and had a much easier time assimilating into an identity and losing their old ethnic consciousness it tells us that blacks and use the most welfare per capita and are less industrious than whites and in addition to having very different family structures it tells us that white catholics have produced very little intelligentsia in new and the united states despite their large share of the population your author is part of an aspiring i am not deducing these or gleaning these points from the text they are the text this is what a sociology book on the ethnography of new written by a pair of older school liberal academics has to say perhaps most surprising is the stance that there are positive elements to the formation and existence of ethnic communities and and that the government should not try to destroy such communities through aggressive integration programs to some this is just realism regarding the conditions of new it is purely then and to say that ethnic neighborhoods exist where one group predominates but even that is refreshing coming from authors of the for whom it is so often the case that race and ethnicity are social constructs and therefore neither real nor of value it is further than that as and do not merely recognize communities but suggest they are beneficial in some ways and not necessarily products of racism can you imagine the department of housing and urban development suggesting that segregated communities are not and that the government need to break them up in the name of what would and do believe in the false idols of equality and but they totally stupid about it they know that building public housing in a neighborhood always triggers white flight once the colored population hits critical and results in ethnic succession rather than integration they have radical solutions for tackling the structural problems of ethnic diversity in a society they tend towards gradual economic improvement as the but as we all the united states by and large for most people is not a land of social mobility nor is it one where you can magically uplift radically different groups by pouring money into them what you get from a book like beyond the melting pot is a

by trump needs to pivot fast on his core economic program and embrace cutting payroll taxes for the working not income taxes for the elites that means jettisoning the campaign trillion individual income tax cut which reflects warmed over dogma about a curve that has gone missing he should replace it with a far bolder idea that is right for the present times and is based on far more compelling economics and politics

is the loneliest country in the world is it because abandoned the traditional family of all the nations on the entire the united states is the most lonely place to be we have the highest percentage of one person households on the entire and the average size of our households has been steadily decreasing studies have shown that the number of close friends that have is and we have the highest divorce rate in the world by a wide margin so why is this does this have anything to do with the fact that is abandoning the traditional family back in the the sexual revolution fundamentally changed the way that millions of viewed sex and love by throwing out all of the old many believed that they would ultimately be able to have more sex and more love this manifests itself in a hookup culture that is constantly being promoted as healthy in our popular in our television shows and in our movies but instead of this hookup culture resulting in more sex and more most are discovering that it leads to just the opposite we have become a nation of desperately lonely people that have very few real ties to others never in the history of our nation have been so isolated from one another most people get up in the drive to work or perhaps do a little shopping and then drive home again the rest of the evening is typically spent in front of the television or on some sort of electronic device in most spend precious little time attending social gatherings of any sort these days church attendance is at historic lows and most people take the time or the effort to get involved in other types of social groups and even when do go out and try to meet the relationships that are formed are very much on the surface at best the truth is that most have very few close friends just take a moment and consider how many people outside your immediate family actually love you and would be there for you no matter what for most that number is depressingly low in a desperate attempt for human love and an increasing number of have turned to social networking websites such as to fill that void for the desperately some human contact is better than none in a growing number of people are so desperate for people to talk with them that they will pretend to be someone else many will even use an attractive picture of someone else in an attempt to try to lure others this has become so common that this phenomenon has even been given a name it is known as and it has grown to epidemic levels other deal with their loneliness by recklessly indulging in shopping or other addictions we are a fundamentally unhappy and this is reflected in the fact that we lead the world in antidepressant use in the total number of taking antidepressants doubled between and could a lot of this have been avoided if we would have just fully embraced the traditional family structure as a most of us be doing a lot better if we lived in homes that were filled with healthy just consider what the consequences of free love and the hookup culture have been for has the highest percentage of one person households on the entire planet years were living in the average but now the average household only consists of people in percent of all households in the united states contained a married couple that number has declined to percent marriage rate in the united states has fallen to an low right now it is sitting at a yearly rate of marriages per people an low percent of in the to year old age bracket are married to the pew research only percent of all that are at least years old are currently married back in percent of all adults were married the united states more than half of all couples move in together before they get married divorce rate for couples that live together first is significantly higher than for those that do not has the highest divorce rate on the globe by a wide margin the average woman had her first child when she was years old now the average woman has her first child when she is years old birth rate for women in the to year old age bracket has fallen to births per women that is a new record low one out of every three children in the united states lives in a home without a father women under the age of living in the united states more than half of all babies are being born out of wedlock for most marriage has come to be viewed as a temporary agreement that can be abandoned the moment that it no longer makes them happy any longer this approach to love and marriage has had a whole host of negative consequences for us as a nation as the national marriage project puts a marriage in now depends for its survival on the happiness of both spouses over the last four many have moved away from identifying with an institutional model of which seeks to integrate economic and emotional intimacy in a permanent union this model has been overwritten by the soul mate which sees marriage as primarily a vehicle for personal emotional and shared consumption that depends for its survival on the happiness of both spouses thus where marriage used to serve as the gateway to responsible it has come to be increasingly seen as a capstone of sorts that signals couples have both financially and are on the cusp of arriving and our young people are no longer taught to value marriage they are told to put off marriage and to go out and have some fun this message is constantly being reinforced by popular culture for posted below is an actual ad
the danger why greatly fears last few months in office latest video is more men than ever want to watch their wives and girlfriends have sex with other men by on virtually every great society throughout history has descended into a state of utter sexual depravity before completely and it looks like the united states is not going to be any exception whatever sick and twisted perversion you can dream there is probably a thriving community for it on the right at the beginning of this i want to make it clear that what i am about to talk about is extremely disturbing and so this article should not be read by anyone that is not an adult so why discuss this type of stuff at the truth is that we are under a mass delusion in this country today we like to think that we are so moral that we are an example to the rest of the but the truth is that has become an overflowing cesspool of wickedness and filth just about every form of evil that you could possibly name is absolutely exploding in our and if we hope to have any hope for our future we have got to take a long look in the mirror and be honest with ourselves about how far we have fallen what i am going to write about today is just one example of how far we have declined morally we have become a nation that is completely and totally addicted to watching other people have sex i often quote the studies that show that approximately of all men look at pornography on a regular and there is one kind of this filth in particular that is becoming extremely popular just a few days i came across an article in the independent that discussed the fact that the number of men that want to watch their wives or girlfriends have sex with other men is absolutely soaring communities dedicated to the topic are with searches for the fetish peaking this having more than doubled in the past years one man explained how been married to his wife for two years before confessing that he about watching her with another man meanwhile a married woman detailed how her husband even her messages of encouragement when she was trying to seduce the man agreed on this practice is known as and there apparently is a tremendous demand for material related to this practice according to psychology today even a cursory search on amazon will turn up hundreds of books on such erotica and that the resoundingly echoes this huge demand for graphic depictions of such sex talk about sick according to the phrase cuckold originally comes from the cuckoo alluding to its habit of laying its eggs in other birds nests in our society everything is being turned upside down good is being called evil and evil is being called good once upon a the practice of adultery was greatly condemned in this but now we have turned it into a spectator sport and at this point even the most trusted members of our society are doing things that were once considered to be unthinkable for just check out what police in new have been e was at a auto dealership last month when his was arrested on felony charges as they tried to use a fraudulent check to purchase a jaguar according to arrest records but the arrest of who has a lengthy criminal record and was recently on has triggered a much police investigation into allegations that gay officers may have hosted or taken part in sex parties called breeding parties that allegedly were attended by teenagers who were not of legal age to drink alcohol or consent to having sex with adults when people run around having sex with whoever they feel it is inevitable that diseases will start to spread like and a new report that was just released found that is precisely what is number of reported cases of sexually transmitted diseases reached a record high in the us last year figures as officials warned that stretched services meant people were slipping through the public health safety net in its latest the for disease control and prevention said the sharp rise in syphilis was of particular concern we have reached a decisive moment for the a director at the said the says that there are approximately million new std cases in the united states every single year just let that sink in for a moment million new cases a year and somehow we have come to the conclusion that we are good somehow we have come to the conclusion that we deserve to be and of course it just sexual sin that is exploding either violent crime is way up in and this is particularly true in big cities such as me be very clear is never going to be great again until we change what is in our own hearts our biggest problem has not been that we have had the wrong political party in control of the white house our biggest problem has been our own behavior if we want to have any sort of a future as a we need to turn from our wicked ways but even in most churches you will not hear this kind of message these days the truth is that the vast majority of want to hear about how evil they and they certainly have any intention of changing their behavior but unless we start making major changes there is not going to be any hope for us no matter who we send to
it was supposed to be an edgy thriller that made statements about upper echelon while also utilizing the real world sex life of tom cruise and as a kind of doorway bridging the gap between reality and fantasy something that does come up in other such as a space odyssey in this we have a statement about who runs the show the show is both the film as well as and wants viewers to realize that reality is run by our present of the the viewer is supposed to reflect upon the decadence of the eastern elite but also notice that viewing the film itself is homage to present social since the film is a wannabe voyeuristic step into the sex lives of others in this it functions as an initiation none of the other analysts and have really noticed this virtually every review i have read sees it as some elaborate mind control thing is supposedly everything on those while other reviews from professors and academia see it as a social or psychological commentary i think it has elements of all but the real goal i an initiation process the viewer is watching the film because he or she is curious about secrets and elite lives think of all the silly gossip magazines we have the average went to see the film for a glimpse of and wants the viewer to see the hypocrisy in such an given that most people will judge the films secret society cult eyes wide is a descriptor of the as well as the characters in the who really understand the power base that runs things the power base is according to the average politician or wealthy doctor or lawyer in new this is precisely and cruises characters they are unwitting inductees thus throughout the the viewers eyes are wide shut to the reality of the power just as and cruises characters until the when they have their eyes as they both say at the end let us proceed the opening scene shows us between two pillars this is the doorway to the in other words the two pillars figure prominently in freemasonry as the entrance way to the as borrowed from stands between two pillars and setting the initiatory tone for the film the two pillars of freemasonry borrowed from indicating the doorway to the mysteries the viewer is being told from the beginning that they are to undergo an initiation into how the mysteries and the secret societies particularly from a sociological perspective the we are having marital troubles related to sexual frustrations it is also significant that it is when the initiatory procedure takes as a kind of statement it is also important to remember that all details in a film are significant the placement of everything is meaningful and deliberate as mentioned in the picture the film is full of which are symbols of the the inner world as it as well as other worlds this occurs in in for and this as well as the wizard of both figure and are theosophical allegories most who note this point to it as some kind of control but i think that is more realistic would be the usage of such stories as allegories or metaphors for transformation the metamorphosis of initiation into the if you will both stories have theosophic undertones and and thus constitute initiatory tales as well when the arrive at the we see a clear symbol of what kind of initiation they are going to undergo a satanic as we see from the inverted the doors of their perception are about to change as they enter the party marked with an inverted pentagram invites the couple to his parties frequently under the auspices of eventually getting them to participate in the orgies as it turns there are two and old college nick plays piano for both both resist the temptation to sleep with other yet appear to have the desire given their own marital sexual problems what we continue to suspect is not that the events are randomly but rather that it has been organized it is not an accident that bill college buddy has shown up gets drunk and is then hit on by a wealthy is likely a reference to the founder and high priest of the church of i think this is a symbolic just to let us know the crowd they are being allowed to party with is ultimately an upper echelon satanic cult it is also interesting to note that the original story is written about a couple who undergoes the experience in upper class around the turn of the since is the origin of the actual members of the order of bill discovers that is involved in some shady and apparently has some connection to drugs and beauty queens a beauty queen we later is knocked out from drugs asleep and and we will find experience something similar has almost and tells her she cannot keep doing what she is we know if its a suicide attempt or not it is also interesting that the nude woman in the painting above is sprawled out in the same as if to allude to the films thesis of a thin borderline between fantasy or and reality we see the going about daily activities notice again the inverted pentagrams in the more inverted pentagrams pop up the then have a big argument over sex and the desire to and tells bill she once wanted to have sex with a young man years ago at a hotel throughout their condo we see images of gateways in indicating again that this is a film about initiation gardens also bring to mind and the expulsion of and eve due to or it could refer to their coming initiation into the garden of the so to as they are about to experience the underworld in bill then leaves to visit a patient who has passed and begins his languorous
by western science and indigenous are often seen as with the indigenous view usually being far less valued by society at large but an inside look at indigenous ways of knowing shows that they offer unique and dependable in precisely the areas where western science is often weakest i grew up in a family where bible study was mandatory despite the firm branches that shaded my there were traditional roots that anchored daily life my grandmother spoke no and went about her tasks singing she sang to things i to stones and water she spoke to the breezes that came off the sea this was not odd to me no question of sanity or need of counseling entered my mind it was simply the mechanics of of praise to to the creator she wove fibers into amazing placing them in water while singing when she finished the coarse strands would be soaked and pliable and she would sing again until the pattern was done her i came to were timers for different tasks she had no knew no indeed had been denied the opportunity to get the education that became the currency of the world in her adulthood and old age she had acquired a sophisticated methodology to transform the resources that yielded to her and her hand only there were no power no mechanical devices to ease her work there was only an elegance of skill that no machine could replicate as a she was magic to and at her deathbed the shock of her mortality severed my faith in these songs i turned to the precision of western so that such a fate would never befall me so i would know the and in that somehow control it my desire to shun those things that had no firm margins grew as i came to learn the beauty and remarkable perfection of the universe through the eyes of those scholars like the elders of my had discovered these things before as i sat in uncomfortable chairs in lecture a number in a sea of and despaired at the pain of examinations in those same a profound awe of the very molecules that composed my body and everything surrounding me settled when i realized that the ability to pursue this learning fell squarely on my ability to navigate a system of hard i panicked i had been raised in a home swirling with soft fluidity of being and my learning rejected these things but numbers too their words are clear and and their combinations were refrains of certainty the slow draining of the deep convictions of my upbringing and generations of women who had sustained children with their hands became a steady flow here lay the i could understand all things by measuring and in knowing those words i felt i could rewrite the song the profound awe i felt as a student failed me when i took a job as a faculty researcher at a university i came to realize that western science hummed the words much of the time i could see it there were too many too many times when it was apparent that and cliques were the white noise that drowned out the song like the death of my it was a sound blow western science as a way of knowing has precision and and unlike most other ways of it can be faithfully replicated of the and understood by practitioners around the regardless of their language but i was led to believe that it could explain more than it really could its limitations could be found not only in the of the world but also in the murky stupidity of and hubris and in my i found my faith in western science fall away like a rock cast off a mountain for the second time in my life in my rush to rather than the i was missing the synergy of the wisdoms of two one called traditional and the other called western the phrases traditional ecological local and folk knowledge are often associated with fuzzy the kind that comes from funneling information through a human whereas western science suggests an absolute immune from human bias in order to discern between the one must understand how different including the knowledge seekers of come to and thrive in their worlds the bottom line is that both address knowing the world using yet ultimately approaches western science excels at unraveling the medical technology a testament to this traditional knowledge reveals the dynamics of larger particularly and and the wisdom of our place among them in western science and traditional knowledge are usually perceived as two and somewhat incompatible entities why is in it is simply stubbornness and fear on both sides in practice they are very and in results they are highly because one works well at small scales and the other at large scales but in their origins they differ western science is relatively new and evolved from the philosophies of and bacon that sought to standardize information so that it could be used by groups of people who did not necessarily live in the same region people who moved from one region to another relied on this information to aid the growth of their the health of their and the survival of their not to mention the development of and trade stated that humans were separate from the rest of the natural world including and the places they this was a pivotal time in medicine was advancing and people were making connections between cleanliness and protecting food sources from competing such as which also spread disease government were providing security for more and more most of whom had descended from tribes that survived by hunting and gathering and competing for these resources with neighboring tribes through conflict less fragile treaties of cooperation with this shift from conflict to more and more centralized organization came more time to observe the components of the world not directly
donate those of you that care about about the about the beauty of queer sexual about indigenous lands and their right to and about policing practices that have led to the deaths of many black men and how do we respond to this confusing what do we do how do we by let us acknowledge these difficult feelings of these terrifying thoughts that are suddenly very alive in the air today it is as if box has not only been emptied out into the but that it has been and spread out to the corners of all lands hope now seems in short supply we are undone i write you because things have indeed fallen apart while this unspeakable insurgency of despair might goad us into rushing into the next organizational moment the itch to hit them back or do something i want to invite us to slow down and pay attention to the stark grief that haunts us now she stares us in the this repulsive visitor if we must we must return her gaze and let her do her important work with us i am a living in but like most people on the planet that tuned in to the surrealism of the presidential i woke up to the shocking news that trump was not only beating on election but that there was a frightening possibility he could win and then that distant once laughably out of the became a blue wall fell to the man who promised to build the media people stuttered as their once pristine cast of glossy pundits groped for the peso fell and in one fell it felt like the home of the brave was exactly that a place dyed in where braveness would now be required to keep on living ever since trump became the th president of the united the has been flooded with articles attempting to make sense of this moment politico published a piece with a title that must have resonated with many people around the how did everyone get it so the independent insisted that trump would have lost us election if sanders had been the while frank opined on the pages of the guardian that trump is moving to the white and liberals put him there across the fractured landscape of also surprised by their fortune laughed at mocking the that thought an admittedly troubled candidate who seem to have a message beyond insisting on her entitlement would simply waltz into the white house i will not attempt to pry open the cadaver of this moment it is probably the case that no analysis is good enough to assuage our feelings of shock what happened is not reducible to a single causative factor or a decidable active ingredient the world that simple i will however in the spirit of full disclosure the kind of radical honesty we probably need at this time that i secretly wanted this to i was so invested in the idea of a sanders presidency so mortified by what was obvious to me as an attempt to stifle his that i became possessed by a i easily exorcise i understood the dangers of a potential trump but decided even that was better off to the inertia of the status quo as embodied by a regime that argument is not easily maintained in the face of the orange predicament we now find ourselves in in an case of be careful what you wish i find not relief but a painful sympathy with many who had hoped that the morning of th would somehow usher in a more tolerant a more beautiful country a country that cares about its many and contours now because of trump and the energies he has minorities are probably less safe at a time of unprecedented racial tensions and phallic exhibitions of some folks are already dreading their next brief visit to the shopping knowing that the streets are now being painted red with white with racial acrimony and blind and blue with the authoritarian aloofness of a candidate who promised law and order the new it is to these vulnerable ones i write those of you that care about about the about the beauty of queer sexual about indigenous lands and their right to and about policing practices that have led to the deaths of many black men and women without trump or falling into the trap of disillusioned punditry and yet with a keen awareness of the likely consequences of his presidency i how do we respond to what do we how do we what opportunities are presenting themselves to us to work for a caring at the time of writing this there is news of revolt on the streets of new and other cities people are protesting the rise of trump people are angry around this same famed has suggested concerned should fire the punditry and take over the democratic party it is impossible to answer the question of what a right response or to speak as if one is situated outside the swirl and flow of things i do however want to invite you to try doing something less spectacular something for it is my opinion that with the seeds of a new politics may yet be planted when i was growing up in i was taught to think of my life only in terms of its greatness quotient i was conditioned early to yearn for prominence fame fortune legacy success awakening the giant within getting to the top lasting forever those were resonant in my developmental years the figures of bill jack and were placed before me as aspirational objects if i did not do all i can to increase my greatness my life did not really matter i suspect this story is not uniquely mine to tell we live in a world that places priority in the top and discountenances the bottom the condition for living a life of meaning and purpose was moral
donate speaks in on march la n by on trump managed to pull the biggest upset in us politics by tapping successfully into the anger of white voters and appealing to the lowest inclinations of people in a manner that would have probably impressed propagandist himself but what exactly does trump victory and what can one expect from this megalomaniac when he takes over the reins of power on what is trump political if and is a will us foreign policy be any different under a trump some years public intellectual warned that the political climate in the us was ripe for the rise of an authoritarian figure he shares his thoughts on the aftermath of this the moribund state of the us political system and why trump is a real threat to the world and the planet in general for the unthinkable has in contrast to all trump scored a decisive victory over and the man that described as a dangerous clown and will be the next president of the united states in your what were the deciding factors that led voters to produce the biggest upset in the history of us before turning to this i think it is important to spend a few moments pondering just what happened on a date that might turn out to be one of the most important in human depending on how we react no exaggeration the most important news of was barely a fact of some significance in itself on the world meteorological organization delivered a report at the international conference on climate change in morocco which was called in order to carry forward the agreement of the reported that the past five years were the hottest on record it reported rising sea soon to increase as a result of the unexpectedly rapid melting of polar most ominously the huge antarctic glaciers arctic sea ice over the past five years is percent below the average of the previous not only raising sea but also reducing the cooling effect of polar ice reflection of solar thereby accelerating the grim effects of global warming the reported further that temperatures are approaching dangerously close to the goal established by along with other dire reports and forecasts another event took place on which also may turn out to be of unusual historical significance for reasons once were barely noted on the most powerful country in world which will set its stamp on what comes had an election the outcome placed total control of the government the supreme court in the hands of the republican which has become the most dangerous organization in world history apart from the last all of this is uncontroversial the last phrase may seem even outrageous but is the facts suggest otherwise the party is dedicated to racing as rapidly as possible to destruction of organized human life there is no historical precedent for such a stand is this an consider what we have just been witnessing during the republican every candidate denied that what is happening is happening with the exception of the sensible like who said it all but we do have to do anything because we producing more natural thanks to or john who agreed that global warming is taking but added that are going to burn in and we are not going to apologize for the winning now the calls for rapid increase in use of fossil including dismantling of rejection of help to developing countries that are seeking to move to sustainable and in racing to the cliff as fast as possible trump has already taken steps to dismantle the environmental protection agency by placing in charge of the transition a notorious climate change trump top adviser on billionaire oil executive announced his which were dismantling tax cuts for the industry the wealthy and corporate sector more fossil fuel lifting temporary block on the access pipeline the market reacted quickly shares in energy corporations including the world largest coal which had filed for but after trump registered a percent gain the effects of republican had already been felt there had been hopes that the agreement would lead to a verifiable but any such thoughts were abandoned because the republican congress would not accept any binding so what emerged was a voluntary evidently much weaker effects may soon become even more vividly apparent than they already are in tens of millions are expected to have to flee from plains in coming years because of sea level rise and more severe creating a migrant crisis that will make today pale in significance with considerable leading climate scientist says that migrants should have the right to move to the countries from which all these greenhouse gases are coming millions should be able to go to the united and to the other rich countries that have grown wealthy while bringing about a new geological the marked by radical human transformation of the environment these catastrophic consequences can only not just in but in all of south as already intolerable for the inexorably rise and the glaciers threatening the entire water supply already in some million people are reported to lack adequate drinking water and the effects will reach far beyond it is hard to find words to capture the fact that humans are facing the most important question in their history whether organized human life will survive in anything like the form we know and are answering it by accelerating the race to disaster similar observations hold for the other huge issue concerning human the threat of nuclear which has been looming over our heads for years and is now increasing it is no less difficult to find words to capture the utterly astonishing fact that in all of the massive coverage of the electoral none of this receives more than passing mention at least i am at a loss to find appropriate words turning finally to the question to be it appears that

email over the course of the last six only one supreme court appointee of a president representing the party of the left has veered ever so slightly from the progressive party line on any case of significance that was named to the court by john f back in among those few cases where white departed from his voting there is not a single instance where his deviation involved a deciding vote on the other the list of supreme court appointees over the same constituting a majority on the consisted of far more individuals who us by aligning themselves with the left wing on crucial cases the list of such chronic crossovers on key cases are earl potter john john lewis warren harry day john and john by very few justices tended to adhere to the or and even within this latter group of there have been far more frequent than among any of the eleven justices that served during the same period in each and every conservative has tended to stray to the left with more frequency than the one democrat who did not stray from progressive ideology when his was a deciding vote for and seemed to intentionally take turns giving the left a deciding with one of the duo often authoring a scathing each of the two allowed their fellow conservative justice to maintain a centrist while at the same time gifting the liberal branch with wins in virtually all significant cases below is an abbreviated list of decrees rendered by the high some with the decisive assistance of these these unconstitutional opinions relied on contrived rights and tortured reasoning which defied common roe v which created a right to abort babies while ignoring the infants natural right to life whole womans health v striking two provisions of a law put in place for the safety of women and babies and to prevent the fostering of horrific clinics like that of convicted triple murderer various decisions removing restrictions on pornography and calling it free speech the eminent domain stealing private property for unconstitutional purposes the of defense of marriage act the banning of all state and local sodomy laws the legalization of flag burning overturning the will of the people and their state as in proposition welfare for illegal aliens the wild expansion of federal authority under the pretext that virtually all commerce is the conventional explanations for these discrepancies are in outcomes liberal leaning presidents choose nominees based on progressive whereas conservative presidents give more weight to judicial competence the record shows that democratic senators have let progressive politics be their guide in the confirmation thereby tending to be obstructionist when a given candidate appears to emphasize the original intent of the framers republicans tend to simply defer to the will of the given democrat presidents and ignore the conservative principles they fervently claimed when they were running for office as a both parties are actually working in tandem toward the same progressive agenda this explains why politicians will not fulfill their responsibility to rein in the high court when it clearly violates the constitution or encroaches on state and local areas of responsibility in agent investigative the invisible government convincingly details how the same individuals have traditionally chosen most presidential nominees for both parties and how the agenda of the hard left guides their choices it is this liberal ideology that has facilitated the appointment of activist judges of the two major party presidential candidates on the ballot th one was chosen using the illegitimate process detailed in the invisible government more than half of believe the process was just as the agent described in his report the opposing nominee did not appear to have been the first choice of the republican ostensibly conservative establishment by a wide the voters selected trump as their candidate in the republican primaries a much to the outward frustration of the establishment it seemed that trump was a departure from the politicians with which republican voters had become accustomed to being at least in the recent past trump later announced a slate of potential high court whom he stated selected specifically to break the mold of the stealth progressives typically appointed by republican presidents he vowed that his list of supreme court candidates and approved by the heritage foundation and the federalist would base their decisions on the original intent of the framers of the constitution it is clear that an nefarious supreme court has facilitated drift to the left and away from both freedom and moral decency it has moved far away from the objectives of the framers who made clear their intentions for the high court were to only call the balls and not usurp the and the people by legislating from the bench according to the federalist papers the unelected federal judiciary is to by the weakest and most restricted of the three branches the framers never intended federal courts to have authority to strike any and everything produced by the or the executive branch as with no checks and balances or reciprocal powers at their disposal nullification was default rightful remedy for overreach read more on nullification at the tenth amendment long ago expressed fears that the supreme court monster might consume its the when in he the constitution has erected no such single knowing that to whatever hands with the corruptions of time and its members would become despots when the legislative or executive functionaries act they are responsible to the people in their elective capacity the exemption of the judges from that is quite dangerous enough i know of no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the but the people themselves went on to write in a separate letter that same the judiciary of the united states is the subtle corps of sappers and miners constantly working underground to undermine our constitution

an new study from a nonpartisan research institute the administration is using billions of dollars in banking fines to fund radical activist groups that work to elect according to an new study from a nonpartisan research institute during holders term as attorney general from through a little under billion was paid by banks under the threat of federal lawsuits all but million of that sum came from three big bank of and chase many of the cases rest on bogus disparate impact theory which government lawyers use to make sure that banks become liable for charges of racism based upon the perceived injustice of lending disparity in certain lower income regardless of the reasons for the disparity instead of being used to help the supposed victims of these the money flows to leftist allies of president adding insult to the process by which the money snakes its way to organizations is both corrupt and according to the report from the government accountability institute that is called follow the how the department of justice funds progressive activists cash author and crusader peter is president the full report is available in form here the report the of has curated an opaque system wherein appointed attorneys can legally extract money from the private sector and redistribute the funds to organizations outside of the appropriations unprecedented and extraordinary disregard for congressional authority it funds directed by the effectively replaced funding to activist nonprofits previously denied by congress much of the cash moves through the nonprofit gave more than million to the group neighborhood assistance corp of whose calls himself a bank terrorist it also gave over million to for equality an organization with communist roots and continued close ties to a very vocal north sympathizer the funds extorted from the banks also trickle down to groups such as national council of la of national urban and operation hope many of the nonprofits that receive such funding spend the money to elect democrats a data analytics company specializing in along with a group called nonprofit vote mobilize these federally funded nonprofits to get the vote out for those who tend to be reliably the report states was founded by former bill aide in following democrats electoral in activists believed republicans owed w victory to heavy spending on voter contact including databases according to a capital research center report boasts it was vital to president victory by its own over campaigns and committees used the services based on data that was loaded into the databases and then a analysis of the cycle progressive the and federal party committees attempted to contact more than million people this means that the progressive community attempted to contact over of the adult population contacts were delivered over the by mail and over the of leeching off others is generally how the activist left funds itself apart from oceans of cash supplied by like and and a galaxy of radical the left derives its sustenance by ripping off taxpayers at the and local levels the report states the evidence shows the left is using the department of justice and the power of the federal government to extract money from financial institutions for redistribution to progressive activists whose real intent is far more partisan than the housing and housing education for which they ostensibly exist in other the left plays by a different set of rules than the rest of there is no level playing field in electoral politics in a sense the system is rigged there is the parasitic left feeding at the taxpayer trough versus everybody else conservatives knew about this travesty already but few studies have been put together that follow the money trail for a half the left has been using taxpayer dollars to fund efforts to advance subversive causes in the united states changes in federal social policy in the helped lay the groundwork for this insidious leftist under the profoundly antisocial war on the federal government has been handing out taxpayer money since to liberal and radical community organizations to help them agitate against the status quo one could say declared war on itself and conscripted pressure groups to do the fighting in recent decades those on the left including groups like acorn and con artists like have also become quite adept at working outside the public sector to shake down banks and other businesses to fill their war chests conservative groups receive no such from uncle in many such organizations would likely reject government funding on principle if offered this corruption will undoubtedly continue if becomes president secretary of labor tom no stranger to the shakedown business is said to be a top contender for the attorney general post in any new administration who previously ran the civil rights is also a past president of a notorious advocacy group for illegal aliens funded by and the late strongman the scam described in the report the only way groups fill up their bank accounts activist groups were encouraged to agitate by the community reinvestment which enshrined in law a kind of lending protection racket banking regulators who had come under the influence of groups like acorn had the power to make trouble for banks that failed to lend enough money to borrowers in communities banks that paid enough whatever that means got left but banks that got their legs broken few serious economists doubt that the mortgage market debacle and the economic collapse of were caused by the deliberate weakening of underwriting standards carried out in the name of ending discrimination leftists played both sides they called banks racist and demanded more lending for minorities and then when the loans went bad called the banks racist for supposedly targeting minority borrowers it was pure through the magic of the once sought after lending was transformed into the shaking down of lenders intensified when secretary presided over the administration effort to put the on steroids banks began to make risky loans and and mac aggregated them for

the bloc may have won the but did win the by now it should be clear to all but the blindest rabidly that the united nations is an organization that has been by the nefarious interests of nations and their despotic third world allies it is an organization rife with prejudice and hypocrisy an organization that can undeniably and without equivocation be described as today greatest purveyor of historical revisionism and conspiracy theories this fact is best illustrated by three resolutions passed this year by united nations and cultural organization that deny the indisputable nexus to the holy city on the body voted in favor of an asinine and wholly resolution that referred to holy sites in exclusively by their names and designated the temple holiest as a holy site of worship to add insult to the resolution also adopted wild conspiracy theories including a claim that was planting fake graves in other spaces of the cemeteries the which was submitted by seven passed by a wide margin with votes in six against and abstentions two nations were absent for the vote and shamefully supported the vile resolution that the resolution would pass was never in doubt given the large number of and despotic third world nations that constitute the makeup of but it was hoped that the resolution would fail to garner support and could thus claim a moral victory with its past and proclivity to kowtow to the worlds despots did not disappoint and predictably voted with the rabble but following the a crack appeared in the of invective so prevalent at the it appeared that was having a case of buyers remorse in an address to the prime minister termed the resolution clumsy and unfortunate he then added in rather sharp and pointed terms that will never deny the presence and history in it would make no it is absurd to deny this history is one of strongest advocates for the the authority and their allies at should have understood from statement that future resolutions with similar toxic content would no longer enjoy automatic support instead of declaring victory and moving they pressed their luck by introducing another vile resolution in the resolution sponsored by the usual suspects contained nearly identical language as the resolution it condemned for various contrived transgressions and again severed the nexus to the city this time the bloc was in for a rude awakening while the resolution the bloc was unable to garner a majority in the body of the nations that voted in favor of the resolution later withdrew support lowering the final tally to were composed of states with majorities while a is percent making passage of the resolution a forgone conclusion what was notable was the fact that this time the resolution failed to garner a single western concurrence other developing like which had hitherto supported drafts also abstained political offensive aimed at exposing the lunacy of the initiative was paying dividends following the resolutions the and their allies suffered additional political reversals asked for a because it wished to withdraw support for the motion secretariat of foreign affairs said in a statement that his governments changed position reiterates the recognition that the government of gives the undeniable link of the people to the cultural heritage of east soon followed suit echoing position in a the government noted that it would no longer support such resolutions which had went one step further and announced that it would actively oppose such resolutions in the future prime minister told an radio station that these resolutions were unacceptable and wrong he added that to say that the have no links to is like saying the sun creates darkness even voiced disapproval by stating that the heritage of is and each of its communities has a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city she later received death threats for voicing objection to the motion on the authority and introduced a third draft resolution to world heritage committee seeking to generate further political terrorism the proposed resolution once again attempted to sever the nexus to the city and its holy sites the body was expected to pass the resolution by consensus but in a surprise and asked for a secret ballot which infuriated the bloc instead of the motion passing by the vote was in two eight abstentions and one nation absent the two nations opposing were and the of the seven were it was a victory at best given the large number of countries represented at the and the hostility that most of these nations harbor against it is a virtual certainty that toxic resolutions of this nature will continue to be sponsored and passed but as evidenced by recent political gone are the days that the can rely on automatic and support has been effectively reaching out to the nations and it is having a significant positive impact part of the success lies in the fact that the state has much to offer these nations in the fields of water warfare and arms this outreach has translated to political dividends at the the resolutions serve to highlight the noxious nature and malevolence of many member states it also underscores the need for the united states to maintain its commitment and assurance to that it will never allow the to impose terms and dictates on there have been rumors circulating that in his twilight months would seek to impose a deleterious settlement on utilizing the security council the white house has remained uncharacteristically mute on the subject raising fears that there may be some merit to the speculation the administrations objective would be accomplished by actively supporting a proposed likely introduced by or by choosing to abstain rather than exercising a veto in addition to betraying commitments to and running counter to strong bipartisan the notion that the united states would throw under the bus and allow those who

mysterious universe as the season draws stories of strange experiences and supernatural hauntings ride and popular interest in haunted phantom other things deemed paranormal abound so far as the serious study of apparitions opinions about the concept of ghosts remains manifesting in a number of different folkloric motifs since earliest days ghosts are most often represented in cultural traditions as being spirits of the and legends often conjoin ghosts with death and the afterlife in equal traditions pertaining to belief in ghosts often view them as the stuff of or perhaps even as harbingers of to come this and the fear associated with belief in has especially been the case with ghost stories in we have little doubt that thanks can be attributed to tales of popular hauntings the likes of the horror to account for much of this such though supposedly based in some element of fact is often upon further are further vilified on the big making them the lasting stuff of horror cinema the attitudes more the biases that begin to emerge toward our ideas about ghosts in relation to cultural standards become once consideration beyond these lasting stereotypes is given in butler the the famed poet retold a number of ghostly legends recounted to him by the people of particularly an older gentleman identifies as an acquaintance named paddy in the chapter on village describes the belief that to have a ghost living within ones home is actually good a stark contrast when paired alongside the modern horror stories of the last few the house ghost is usually a harmless and creature it is put up with as long as possible it brings good luck to those who live with it i remember two children who slept with their mother and sister and brothers in one small room in the room was also a ghost they sold herrings in the and did not mind the ghost because they knew they would always sell their fish easily while they slept in the room harmless and usually the first terms that spring to mind in relation to ghost stories today go on to describe that some of the ghosts of were viewed as appearing before the death of or in the very most classic returning to fulfill unfinished

relationship with the some time ago i received an email from one of my who shared his own story of what he perceived may have been an encounter with the ghost of a i have a friend near who used to have a black cat the cat was old and eventually died in the house one after having drunk a cup of i was standing at the rinsing the coffee and out of the corner of my eye i saw her black cat deceased charging my like a kitten would i called to my friend and told her that her cat had just attacked my ankles she started laughing and assured me that her cat was dead i i told her her cat know she was yet somewhat in keeping with this idea of animal went on to discuss in the twilight how some traditions in hold that believed to be the spirits of dead may return in the form of various in the surrounding villages they adopt strange disguises a dead old gentleman steals the cabbages of his own garden in the shape of a large rabbit a wicked stayed for years inside the plaster of a cottage in the shape of a making the most horrible noises he was only dislodged when the wall was broken then out of the sold plaster the snipe rushed away whistling nearby on the isle of which lays between and there is a strange bit of folklore about a family named who had been haunted by a voice which emanated from within the walls this occurred during the and the case was even investigated by the famous ghost researcher harry price around the time of the disturbance the strange twist to the story had been that the voice claimed it had belonged to a which had as a stowaway from and had been trained to

mysterious universe do other realities brush up against our are there parallel dimensions lying just beyond through some untraceable veil separating the idea of parallel realities beyond our own is not yet what if this phenomenon were to come bursting forth from the realm of theory and speculation and come crashing down into the are there perhaps some people who have stepped over that barrier into domains we have not yet to see and which we may indeed not even be meant to i have covered such alleged excursions into the horizon beyond our known reality here at mysterious universe before and here i will revisit this topic with a selection of other cases that seem to imply the possibility that not only are parallel dimensions but that they are destinations to which we can be whisked whether intentional or not in the issue of fate magazine there was the curious story of a woman who apparently shifted into another parallel universe in according to the in the fall of that year a woman by the name of golding had a profoundly unusual experience while riding an elevator with her in the elevator was and when made a mistake and got off at the wrong floor she found that she could not push her way back in past the throng of people and resigned herself to waiting for the next one that was when she looked around and was startled to realize that she was no longer in the store at but rather an expansive train station the enormous railway station she found herself in was allegedly bustling with fevered with throngs of travelers rushing to their trains and booming announcements of arrivals and departures echoing through the air there seemed to be no way this busy place could have any connection whatsoever to the music store she had been in moments before the confused made her way to an information booth to ask where she but found that the woman working there completely ignored as if she there at all followed a series of signs pointing the way to the street and she emerged out into a sunny afternoon that seemed to be in the midst of summer rather than in a place that was most certainly not she wandered about in confusion and noticed that everyone around her seemed to completely ignore her and walk on by as if they did not even see her at some point she claims that she saw a confused looking boy standing in the sidewalk similarly being passed on by people who seemed to have no idea he was even and approached him wondering what was going on the boy was able to actually see and respond to and looked in her the first time anyone had acknowledged her presence in this surreal place as she the boy seemed equally relieved that he was visible to smiled slightly and purportedly i guess they let you off at the wrong too the two lost people walked together down the street in the whole time completely ignored by those around and the boy told of what had happened to him he claimed that he had been playing tennis in in the united and had gone to the locker room to change his shoes when he had gone back to the courts to play some more he had found that the tennis courts that had been there moments before were now gone and in their place was a huge train which had turned out to be the exact same station into which had enigmatically entered from the elevator the two allegedly kept on walking until they reached an open area that led to and over the waves they could apparently make out a sand bar with several women upon it chatting and seeming to act as if nothing was beyond the ordinary to one of the women was oddly her sister the women out on the sandbar seemed to notice them and began waving and shouting to and her companion this encouraged the boy to try and make a swim out to the which did not seem so far and which he was

forest reserve near top showing significant illegal clear cuts while the bottom shows the beginnings of cutting tony editor note the and tribal homelands are under growing threat across and south the indigenous peoples are taking strong stands against the illegal as well as the government sponsored intrusions into the reserves it seems that they are virtually the only ones willing to stand in the way of the decimation of their and of the wild on which out planet depends the is essentially the lungs of the planet and it is being continuously destroyed a cross indigenous communities are organizing to challenge logging in the vast forests these communities are concerned with the impact that both legal and illegal logging will have on their watersheds and on the concerned residents from the highland municipality of quiche staged a protest outside the municipal building to express their concern with the steady increase in trucks leaving town loaded with lumber the action was organized by residents and members of the indigenous authority of in order to pressure the state authorities to strip the nine companies of their licenses to exploit timber on private lands residents raised concern over the fact that the deforestation affects everyone in the area following the concerned residents in the neighboring municipality of blocked and detained several trucks transporting lumber from the region for a number of hours they demanded that the national institute of or and the division for the protection of the environment cease their operations and described the amount of lumber being taken from the local forests as excessive the indigenous authorities of also issued a statement to asking them to take action but the government body declined to act and issued a statement that they are planting new trees for every one that is cut down but this response did not satisfy concerned residents we went to the government bodies and issued statements asking to cease extending licenses for the exploitation of said the communications representative for the indigenous authorities of they told us that they are sowing new but how long will it take for those trees to grow to the same size as the trees that were there the companies involved in logging operations responded to the protests by significantly reducing the number of trucks transporting lumber from mountains according to it is unclear if this will continue into the future the mobilization of communities organizing to challenge logging operations in the highlands of represent a growing concern over the destruction of the environment by companies this challenge to logging companies reflects the understanding of communities of the vital part forests play in the protection of the water sources the trees serve us and the said the loss of trees is drying up the aquifers as a youth and as i must think of my and what leaving my children other communities held similar protests following the actions taken in the region on a similar action was held in the departments largest city once again protesters were demanding that authorities stop issuing licenses for the exploitation of forests increase in logging across is home to vast forests and but these regions have increasingly come under threat to deforestation critics blame uneducated campesinos clearing land for agriculture as one of the prime culprits this does represent a but there are other bigger including lumber and organized crime the protest over logging industry activity in indigenous regions occurs at a time in of increased concern over and comes after the historic march for water in community nongovernmental and activists see a connection between forests and water the maintains a campaign of but this has not stopped companies from cutting down forests for the valuable or the razing of forests by in the northern department of to build landing strips the ministry of the economy actively promotes the investment of companies interested in exploiting the nearly million acres of forests logging companies and lumber traders have taken an interest in the vast forests of the highlands of where they can find rare hard and soft such as oak and the more common pine these resources can fetch hefty prices at market the exportation of lumber and products produced from wood from has increased significantly from to lumber exports increased from million dollars to million this continues the long trend of the increase in the exportation of lumber and wood such as furniture but this increase in export of lumber brings the companies into conflict with indigenous communities according to research by environmentalist and the indigenous regions of the country on average contain more forest cover than the regions of the country a report that skinner authored highlights that municipalities that are less than percent indigenous have forest cover of around percent whereas regions where the population is more than percent indigenous have forest cover of around percent communities are not alone in their concern with the destruction of forests the southern community of has long taken steps to protect the forests that make up their communal territory the people are one of the many ethnicities that make up the rural community in the southern department of has held their forest as communal lands since the with subsequent generations continuing to protect the mountain and the forests today the forests represent percent of the more than acres of with the remainder utilized for such as coffee and maize our ancestors left us the land and a group to protect our said a representative of the communities directive council all this was passed down through the and we continue this today in order to cut a tree you first must receive permission from the council the community leaders have also barred any logging operations we permit companies to operate in our said in past epochs companies tried to negotiate for access to the but they always wanted more how many years for a new tree to up on the mountain there are trees that you cannot encircle

those small grocers and or the of etc this creates a growing number of food deserts these are essentially areas where affordable food is available most ignored are the rural food deserts the has an interactive map of food deserts also problematic on the consumer side of the equation are the food subsidy programs most in kind subsidies are fed to or shipped out of the country even though we have a surfeit of hungry people to eat they the argument being that these surpluses would compete with the third part vendors making a profit we had food then snap the later being a true insult

obvious impact on the cuts in food stamps have also cut into food sales food producing corporations and small farmers have seen a decrease in their sales has laid off thousands of workers and closed thousands of stores these losses and layoffs can be linked directly to the snap cuts congress has recently discussed a plan that would eventually take billion out of the federal food assistance a move that would undoubtedly push a lot of food retail and meat packers over the along with many others the reductions in food assistance are not the only factor the economic sanctions against have played a dramatic role in creating the current food glut the collapse and breaking up of the soviet unions collective farm system during the era of the dramatically reduced domestic food production this opened

nuclear weapons in is not about to go to war with much of its language is no more than bluster but it does pose a threat to stability and order and the first step to answering that threat is to understand that belligerence is not a sign of but of a debilitating weakness the invader as our special report this week sets confronts grave problems in its politics and society its population is and is expected to shrink by by an attempt to use the windfall from the commodity boom to the state and its economy fell flat instead has presided over a huge increase in between and the share of that comes from public spending and firms rose from to having grown by a year at the start of the economy is now shrinking sanctions are partly to but corruption and a fall in the price of oil matter more the decides who gets rich and stays that way a was detained for three months in when he he had surrendered his oil company has sought to offset vulnerability at home with aggression abroad with their mass protests after in sophisticated urban middle classes showed that they yearn for a modern state when the oil price was could resist them by buying support now he shores up his power by waging foreign wars and using his propaganda tools to whip up nationalism he is wary of giving any ground to western ideas because political though adept at is brittle institutions that would underpin a

he could remain in charge for years to come age is unlikely to mellow him increasingly says the right things about sounded reasonably tough during a press conference this has learned that he can defy

what should the west time is on its side a declining power needs containing until it is eventually overrun by its own as the urge to lash out remains because the danger is of miscalculation and unchecked must continue to engage in direct talks with as when the experience is dispiriting success is not measured by breakthroughs and as those would be in a country as benighted as by lowering the chances of a blunder nuclear miscalculation would be the worst kind of all hence the talks need to include control as well as improved in the hope that nuclear weapons can be kept separate from other

them drifting out of orbit article next president must declare contrary to what trump has if uses such tactics against a such as or the alliance will treat it as an attack on them all separately the west needs to make it clear if engages in aggression against such as and it reserves the right to arm them above all the west needs to keep its head interference in presidential election merits measured retaliation but the west can withstand such active measures does not pretend to offer the world an attractive ideology or vision instead its propaganda aims to discredit and erode universal liberal values by nurturing the idea that the west is just as corrupt as and that its political system is just as rigged it wants to create a divided west that has lost faith in its ability to shape the world in the west should be united and firm this article appeared in the print edition with the at the is available on or at the bottom of this a recent cover and main article in the economist pictured reminds me of just how hyperbolic and ideological is the wests propaganda against president while maybe good polemical fodder as a cartoon on the editorial the fact that this demonic caricature merits front cover indicates just how programmed and institutionalized western mainstream media is westerners love to insult the press for being party organs and government mouthpieces why travel so they only need to stay home with their national new radio and to really appreciate being passed off as serious journalism in i call it living behind the great western firewall for nothing i have a friend whose email signature is blame it on for a he changed it to blame it on china but that last long and he recently changed it back as we have seen with the most depressing president and in general are the voodoo pin dolls of western racism and of another people and other religions as well as widespread and in what is so remarkable is how unhinged and psychopathic the wests racist propaganda is against compared to the attacks on chinas president xi and the people it transgresses irrational to the point of being black humor about the most polemical front cover against was time magazine in seen below making chinas leader look like a blade runner is tame and almost compared to the tsunami being launched nonstop against pretty tame compared to the racist feeding frenzy that western propaganda is ginning up against president and his countrymen has the longest border with what in now considered and there is tremendous historical western precedence to keep from forming any

the following article by originally published in the edition of socialism the magazine of the socialist party in england and wales h beings have radically altered the adapting nature in the struggle to survive and thrive the pace of change accelerated rapidly with the development of agriculture and society it hit breakneck speed in the industrial and with scientific and technological breakthroughs many now say that we have entered a distinctive geological epoch a new human the jess a member of socialist alternative in reports arriving on the scene roughly a million years and building modern industrial society as we know it only about years represent a blip in earths billion year history at each stage of we have modified nature and therefore modified our own setting the course for biological and social changes from simple farming to unearthing and burning fossil to unleashing atomic our interaction with nature has gone from local to global humankind without a left our mark on the planet we can discover what the earth looked the shape and position of the continents as they have drifted apart and recombined every million what creatures roamed its seas and and what plants covered the by deciphering the chemical or physical imprints of their existence left behind and what learned is that the planet is never static the planet as we know the earth system comprised of water and atmosphere in constant interconnected cycles of energy exchange has always had mass and climate change earths history is full of radical change scientists today are ringing the alarm bells over the rate of change were witnessing compared to that which existed prior to human society climate scientists are pointing to the rapid shift in greenhouse biologists to the rising number of species oceanographers to the increasing acidity of the and soil scientists to the depletion of nutrients and degradation of as evidence that productive activity is overwhelming the earth system the rate of increase in carbon dioxide is unlike anything seen in earths history for at least the past years climate change and economic the dual crises of have produced a growing global revolt and a search for ideas and strategy to end our misery and protect future generations mass movements against austerity demonstrate that working people refuse to accept a system that demands severe cuts to living standards to satisfy the not yet clear to the vast majority of people rebelling against the ruling elite is with what to replace this rotten system or how with the window of opportunity to mitigate the consequences of climate change and prevent further disruption inching closer with each passing winning the working class to a socialist alternative is ever more paramount only scientific socialism can arm the working class with a and strategy to unite and fight to end the rule of the transfer power to the and rapidly implement a plan to develop society along sustainable lines more more problems w e live relatively brief lives with only a little less than a century for our point of our perspective on global changes is correspondingly narrow to add further the earth is rather so we notice the accumulated effects of glacier and massive piles of trash collecting in the pacific and ocean the earths temperature rising nearly a degree has virtually no meaning to communities who daily experience larger fluctuations that we have unearthed and burned so much chemically changing the very air we that there are now molecules of for every million air molecules a level not seen the last million years up from about is generally unnoticeable regardless of our inability to perceive the radical transformation of our atmosphere and the general privilege most in the developed countries have when it comes to environmental destruction and we are nonetheless reaching dangerous tipping points the consequences of burning fossil fuels have long been known as early as published a paper detailing how absorbs light reflected from earths preventing it from escaping the earth system the greenhouse in the late keeling began measuring the concentration in the atmosphere within just a few years he made the startling discovery that not only are there are seasonal fluctuations in related to plants absorbing then decomposition returning it to the but that the overall concentration was rapidly rising every year the keeling curve which continues to grow as measurements are added to a continuous record from to today is regarded as the first proof that industrial activity was transforming the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases it is the dramatic and speedy depletion in earths ice inventory that is the canary in the the news last year that the west antarctic ice sheet has and is expected to disintegrate over the coming centuries should have elicited an immediate response from world leaders the ice sheet holds enough water to raise global sea level by about there is no way to prevent its demise we can only now adapt to the rising seas added to this is the news that a section of the ice which contains the equivalent of half a meter global sea level is also melting rapidly arctic sea ice has dramatically been as and scientists expect the arctic will be ice free in the summer as early as earths glaciers and ice sheets act as a global air keeping the planet cooler than it would be otherwise by reflecting sunlight the loss of earths ice ice that will not only raise sea displacing the more than one billion people inhabiting coastlines it will also further disrupt acting as a positive feedback reinforcing global warming as the ice the earth absorbs more more ice and so on for most climate change is about hotter summers and extreme weather events we are not just talking about our future which will undoubtedly get with more intense weather but our current state of affairs is set to be the hottest year on record we have now hit the one degree

so the band has done a group of individuals has started to write music and playing shows it is corralling friends and family in a crowded bar and blasting them with the sonic abilities of the new members of the musical group have started posting and setting up a and even a twitter account at some being a good band is not enough to bring in new fans all musical groups arrive at the crossroads where they have to make a decision on where to record their of the recording industry there are many options compared to the recording industry years ago in previous there were not many choices there were a handful of studios that catered to any all and solo artists the quality was top of the it was expensive to especially for starving artists but with the digital things have changed it seems that anyone can stumble upon dozens of small studios within the area among all the who can be trusted with original and even more what is the right balance of expense and digital recording became the industry everything was done on reels or with and it was expensive to produce an album that is no longer the case for less than with a little bit of practice and a creative music studio can be at home is this really the right option for artists the answer is simple sort artists might look forward to tirelessly editing track after track to make that perfect cut they might be robbing the band of the actual gains from a musical engineer sometimes having an unbiased ear that is not married to the guitar player is the insight needed to turn a song from mediocre to a hit most musicians forget this factor when they begin building a studio for options part of the price of using a professional studio is the benefit of an engineer who cares about the project and offers a creative element to a song the band has been playing for the last few years if the group decides not to purchase an pro tools for and learn the engineering side of there is still that big question which is the right studio for the studios will always be able to craft great sound with their they can stay on new some programs cost as much as and have access to the newest and hottest electronic toys on the market most musicians are worried that while more professional studios can produce great will it be an accurate representation of the groups style and be that have access to all the gear and software to produce great sounding demos or albums can do so because of their sheer volume of customers they may not be unable to give every project the time it deserves musicians may find themselves bound to a setting where the engineer does not even listen to the genre the band is or maybe even hates it some musicians feel that paying someone to is not enough to put their dreams in someone hands it the studio is not the right then the digital age and loads of free software like reaper and garage home studios have blown up all over it seems like anyone with a handful of microphones and a computer is a they can be found on through referrals from fellow or maybe it is even a best buddy from grade school are these small studios going to have the talent to take the band to the next to look for when reviewing a small studio is the engineer running the studio out of his living room or his parents after how can who wants to charge not able to afford an actual place to and more create the desired smaller places like this may be significantly cheaper but may not have the resources necessary to produce the desired regardless if they are a fan of the band and style is the engineer has gone to school or been involved in an apprenticeship what makes them qualified to produce an being there are many famous people who have fantastic talents behind the and the the lowest price in the world is not worth anything if the group signs up to record with a producer who has little or no idea what they are doing listened to previous work they have recorded have they produced anything like the genre and sound of the what is the quality of their there is no right answer when looking for the perfect studio for a but there are plenty of options whether it be a local staple a smaller less expensive or create a home there is one thing that is almost guaranteed to happen most musicians will never be satisfied with their the drummer could have done this the singer was or a guitar player was just a fraction out of tune most while dissecting the demo or after thousands of some sort of imperfection will be discovered it is something fans will not like a slight problem or a fade that should have gone just a little is important that no matter where the music is musicians go prepared have realistic expectations of what the end product will sound like from a qualified engineer this is the best way for the band to feel their money was not wasted on a great project that sounds experience from business music courtesy of page creative commons license bands music recording studio
by health impact staff and say they are heartbroken they say their children are heartbroken also their children are remaining in state even though there are no abuse or neglect and even though the children are suffering and want to come home the children remain in public school and state despite judge harts previous ruling to allow the children to be see previous judge allows mother to her own children denies request to vaccinate children while in state custody judge hart ruled on that the children should continue to while in state custody for purposes of consistency to keep the children in the same school setting they were in before entering state custody since they will continue to be once they go and added that the children would be going home according to when cps defied judge harts ruling to allow the children to continue to the were certain that judge hart would have no option but to send the children home on and punish the social workers who defied his ruling see previous cps defies judges order to keeps children in public school but when they went to court on the said it was like judge hart was a completely different person than he had been during the adversary hearing in and rather than dealing with cps refusal to the the hearing focused only on presenting a lengthy list of services the must complete before they can get their children home and out of public school and state custody with some of his children during a cps supervised visit and maintain that their children should never have been taken into state custody in the first and that the list of cps services they must now complete are a not only a waste of but also a waste of since there never was any abuse or and cps allegedly never even substantiated any of their allegations although there were some supervision concerns since their old escape artist got into the front yard momentarily without their the say that their daughter getting into the yard alone was an accident could happen to any and once they learned of locks were immediately added to the garage doors to prevent any further escapes the are outraged that their lives have been turned upside their children abused and traumatized in state their reputation slandered in the and the main who called cps and started this entire ordeal is not even a credible according to the caller that called cps to begin ended up changing her story several times under oath was discovered to be a manufacturer who sells is a felon with a long criminal record that may have been on drugs when she made that cps report that started this nightmare children remain in custody as recalled that at the close of the adversary hearing on judge hart declared that he saw nothing to necessitate terminating parental and that his only concerns were some supervision issues that could be easily fixed even though there was no substantiated abuse or judge hart ruled that the children had to remain in saying his hands were tied because the family left in before bringing the children in for cps even though there was no court order preventing the family form leaving the and they allegedly did nothing illegal by doing so the explain that they left to protect their children from the overzealous cps worker who was harassing them at home and traumatizing the children the also contend and they have spoken with attorneys who agree that the children were illegally extradited from back to according to the cps has defied judges broken and committed perjury over and yet they suffer no consequences the who claim their only wrongdoing was making a mistake and not noticing when their followed continue to suffer at the hands of a corrupt system are the being made an example of because they left and exposed corruption within the family believes that judge harts ruling to keep the children in state care is retaliation because the they continue to expose the corruption of cps and the family court system studies have shown that children are worse off in foster homes than if they remained in a troubled and many argue that foster care itself is a form of child causing emotional trauma for children in despair for her i think my body could make this many tears their joy is gone their happy faces are sad now oh heavenly please lord please let anything happen to are they living with genuinely abused kids that are acting out towards my husband i are supposed to just sit hands tied not help were to hang tight knowing that abused kids possibly sicko adults are living amongst them in the heavily populated group for more information on grim foster care the foster care modern day slavery and child trafficking no consequence for cps defying it was shocking to the that cps could get away with defying the judges previous ruling about homeschooling their children according to cps said that they tried to find a curriculum but were unsuccessful they mentioned something about a schooling option to do at the foster homes but that each kid had to have a laptop in order to do it so it was not an option they say they also said that they spoke to homeschooling coalition that they offer anything that would allow cps to take the kids to for their schooling they said that they find a foster family willing to the children they said that the kids are doing really well in school they said that they having any behavioral issues they said that the schools have reported that the brighten up the that they enjoy having them as students they said that the kids are enjoying except for was heartbroken that judge hart would not even let her discuss any of the options she had written down to present in court as to how to
print this post any professional who is prepared to speak the truth and go against the medical establishment in a shaken baby case should also be prepared to lose their career as a consequence image

medical council pediatric and expert defense witness was found guilty of misleading her being dishonest and bringing the reputation of the medical profession into disrepute if the thought that that was the end of the then they were because less than eight months was back to appeal their and this she was not alone over three hundred scientists and lawyers write letter of protest after she had been discredited months scientists and lawyers rallied together in her and in an unprecedented move had written a letter of protest to the medical journal questioning the decision the reporting on the her supporters believe it is unprecedented to have so many distinguished scientists writing to the in support of a doctor signatories include prof peter the doctor who cut cot sir the pioneer of and prof an internationally renowned pathologist professionals were not the only ones demanding because since their the have been bombarded with petitions and letters from parents and supporters from all over the world one extremely powerful written by protecting innocent families we are writing in the defense of a pediatric who was struck off the medical register this week for practicing outside her area of ignoring the opinions of her and bringing the reputation of the medical profession into disrepute with her testimony and written opinions in a series of shaken baby cases she helped defend between and we know from personal experience that the prevailing model of shaken baby syndrome is a fact that is also supported by literature although shaking an infant can cause serious injury and the presence of the and retinal findings now associated with shaken baby syndrome does not prove which is the vital message brings to the debate we are dismayed that the council is sanctioning her for having the courage and intellectual honesty to express her own which are not popular but which are founded on solid scientific thinking and the best available evidence many of these diagnoses are based on the presence of findings retinal and that can be associated with a number of medical conditions and accidental trauma as well as inflicted injury it is a logical error to conclude that because abuse can cause the the presence of the findings proves abuse after writing several more equally powerful the authors continued by adding the declaration also scolds unfairly for her citations of the medical research in one she cited the early research of and colleagues shaken baby a and journal of neurosurgery to support her observation that shaking without impact has not been shown to generate sufficient forces to cause brain injury the panel wrote that had completely misinterpreted what had actually a conclusion that baffles us the paper was a landmark in the because it was the first attempt to test shaking theory and the results surprised even the who it was concluded that severe head injuries commonly diagnosed as shaking injuries require impact to occur and that shaking

relieved that my honesty is no longer questioned and that i can put my name back on the medical but i feel very resentful about what has happened i have been targeted and singled out by the metropolitan police because i have challenged the accuracy of shaken baby syndrome civil rights lawyer described case as a witch hunt and told the daily mail she is still not being allowed to contest the underlying lack of evidence for shaken baby syndrome this eliminates true science from the courtroom his words are spot it is a shame that he did not mention the fact that when had previously given evidence for the prosecution years her evidence had always been readily without question it was only when she decided to examine the theory in more detail that her problems began never question

gave extensive medical explanations of medical conditions which both opined as of prematurity going in to the mothers attorney was concerned that child abuse specialist deposition had been filed months before the trial by department of services it appeared to attorney that once the judge read he had made up his mind before coming to leaving no room for other medical explanations university

print email set about to prove how foolish the whole idea of reincarnation was by conducting a scientific investigation of her own in the questioned middle class subjects from while they were under hypnosis the subjects were asked to regress to a former life if this was they were told to remember everything when they awoke from their hypnotic state not satisfied to just ask who they were or when they also made them describe their tools they their housing and even the food they the subjects frequently reported viewing the former lives much like watching a movie they said they could experience whatever the individual experienced in that particular time they heard ancient languages but did not understand them the full details of their experiences were recorded both during and after the sessions never before had past life inquiries been that specific or involved such a large population the results of her years of research surprised everyone the detailed reports were thoroughly investigated to see if they corresponded with historical facts in all but cases than the descriptions were totally accurate some of the results are as of the past lives reported were male and were female this is exactly in accordance with biological fact reported class or status was exactly the same proportion as the estimates of historians of the specific period of the former life in this was approximately upper from the middle class and the remaining from the lower class although the proportion of middle class was higher around the proportion later dropped and increased again after ad recall by subjects of type of food and utensils used was better than that in popular history books she found over and over again that her subjects knew better than most historians when she went to obscure experts her subjects were invariably correct a subject who lived around in described different types of clothing worn by the upper and lower classes the upper classes wore either a or white cotton robe the lower classes wore something like an type of pants that was wrapped downwards from the waist the researchers viewed historic records of clothing worn during the respective periods and could therefore compare it to the descriptions of these subjects the descriptions were found to be correct of the ancient population lived at or below the poverty level they wore home made clothes and lived in even abodes the majority were farmers who labored every day in the fields none of the hypnotized individuals recalled being a famous historical figure those who recalled a high social position seemed highly dissatisfied with their as if it was a burden to be alive those who recalled being a farmer or a member of a primitive tribe appeared to be content recollections were from different geographic areas and races during their prior life divided them into several blacks and middle eastern descent around only of the subjects reported that they were they lived widely dispersed throughout what is now known as the middle the and central called the central steppe during historical subjects stated that they lived in central between and they recalled living in which was common to the migrating population of that region they found themselves to have white skin color and yellow or golden at this did appear to be historically accurate as people should have black hair and darker skin recent discoveries of mummified corpses along the ancient spice route have shown that there were indeed light skinned and blond haired habits of people who lived around b c were not that bad twenty percent of the subjects recalled that they ate poultry and sheep meat between to people eating habits were rather poor the subjects recalled that the food was tasteless one young man will never it is not surprising that those who recalled the best tasting food were those who remembered a prior life in china all the died of old age and percent died violently during or some other catastrophe and the remaining died in accidents many of the prior lives ended during the two world as well as civil wars in countries these people reincarnated shortly after they died we will see more evidence for this in our next striking example found that of the subjects who had died during the were while between and only were it seems that transmigration of the different races increased after this is still not understood went on to publish her findings in the evidence under hypnosis and life before life although she began her work as a she would later and genetic memory could not account for the patterns that emerged in the results with the exception of all descriptions of and utensils were consistent with historical and in later she i do believe in reincarnation i know as we mentioned in the results suggest that reincarnation usually happens shortly after death in the next example we will see an amazing case that saw a reincarnated woman who was able to be reunited with her husband and son after remembering her former life at the age of years this famous case was thoroughly studied by both believers and skeptics of reincarnation including the famous religious mahatma

the declaration years ago marked the beginning of a settler colonial project of tragic is a painful month in the calendar it is dotted with commemorative days that have one theme in the partitioning

national council which was a reluctant national consent to notwithstanding the injustice and criminality involved in such an the end of the on the we commemorate the general assembly resolution which recommended in the partition of into two into the right chronological we can see a direct line between the the partition resolution and the document it is worth our while to wise words about the is important about the declaration that it has long formed the juridical basis of claims to and more crucial for our purposes that it was a statement whose positional force can only be appreciated when the or human realities of are clearly understood for the declaration was made by a power about a territory in a flat disregard of both the presences and the wishes of the native majority resident in that and it took the form of a promise about this same territory to another foreign that this foreign group quite make this territory a national home for the it was more than it allowed a settler colonial appearing very late in to envisage a triumphant project even before it set proper foot in the land or had a meaningful geographical and demographic presence logic of the elimination of the

indigenous people at the the inhabited their homeland almost exclusively and possessed most of its lands only with the help of bayonets could the settler colonial project of survive in its early stages through the uprisings of in army employed immense which included the royal air to quell the uprising it lasted for three years and ended with the elimination of the national either by killing or by was the main legacy of the not its hallowed text but the policy that ensued in its leading eventually to the catastrophe of were officials at home and on the ground who had second thoughts and qualms about the alliance with they had their say when the government a royal inquiry commission to examine the origins of the commission hoped to rectify some of the injustice by suggesting partition between the settlers and the native leadership urged the to transfer the from any area that would be accorded to the but this was something refused to by partition in as a with international associated this geographical arrangement clearly with the basic impulse of any settler colonial the one so brilliantly defined by the late as logic of the elimination of the such a no wonder partition and ethnic cleansing in thought and practice went hand in the cabinet announced its decision to leave at the beginning of and referred the future of the country to the the historical opportunity arose to fuse once more partition with transfer of the leadership did not seek international legitimacy for the they sought it only for the partition it assumed correctly that in particular two years after the would be accepted internationally as a moral and reasonable crime the natural rejection of the notion of dividing their homeland with the majority of whom had arrived only few a years fell on deaf western the in without the need to come to terms with what did to them in world war became the easiest corridor out of ugliest historical is clear today from the the leadership regarded the partition resolution as both international for a state in and the rejection of it as a valid pretext for the ethnic cleansing of the native world supported the rejection and hoped at first through diplomatic means to change it when it became clear during the first of months of that the ethnic cleansing of was beginning in earnest the beginning of most towns were depopulated and some wiped out entirely by the public opinion demanded more from its last straw was the massacre of in its the league began to coordinate a military operation to stop the destruction of all the leaders were genuinely interested in this and not one of them was willing to throw into the campaign a meaningful military result was a total defeat by the which without any international rebuke or the ethnic cleansing of the two areas remained outside the strip and the west bank not because at the time lacked the power to occupy but because its leaders decided that the west bank was a demographic liability and the strip could serve as a huge receptor for the hundreds of thousands of refugees pushed out south of and ever since a lobby had been operating in demanding the occupation of these last bits of the opportunity came in after it became clear at least for some of the this was not a welcome occupying the lands of millions of proved an unexpected political headache and for a while a financial the peace camp was born

from monster to democrats grovel before trump by information clearing house within a day of the election of leading democrats have moved with extraordinary speed to declare their support for the invited trump to the white house for a friendly meeting on he declared afterwards that his priority in the coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our is successful he speaking to i want to emphasize to that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you if you then the country declaration stands in stark contrast to his own statements just a few days ago then he asserted that trump appears to only care about himself and know basic facts that need to know to be president he added that trump spent years on this earth showing no regard for working was before the democratic debacle on election day now he declares his highest priority to be ensuring that trump is comments followed the statement by on that she hoped will be a successful president for all senator the supposed issued his own groveling to the degree that trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this i and other progressives are prepared to work with such the democrats are in effect abandoning any pretense of acting as an opposition party to a president trump and a proclamations of support from top democrats are made in relation to an individual whose election clearly marks a watershed in politics what is coming to power is a government of the extreme with fascistic characteristics there are reports that trump wants to appoint as his chief of staff the head of an and fascistic media outlet his top advisors and likely cabinet appointees include reactionary figures such as former new mayor and new jersey governor their rush to lend the transition of power an aura of the democrats and the media have maintained a studious silence about certain quite striking elements of the one is noting that a principal factor in the election of trump was a significant decline in voter turnout for all of the media talk of a surge of white working class voters behind the republican candidate actually received one million fewer votes than mitt received in losing the election to won million fewer votes than won in his when the outgoing president obtained significantly fewer votes than he had received in also virtually ignored is the extraordinary fact that trump failed even to win the popular vote had a higher percentage of the national but she lost in the electoral which involves a complex and antidemocratic apportionment based on victories in individual states trump will take office having failed to secure a let alone a of the overall the entire history of the united there have been only five elections in which the incoming president did not win the popular vote when this happened in the b became though he had fewer votes than the j the political conflict over the outcome was so intense that the republicans were able to hold the white house only after agreeing to the effective end of war through the withdrawal of federal troops from the a split vote in when grover lost to the winner of the electoral vote was also the winner of the popular vote for the next years in the this anomaly has now happened and again in in the former the selection of w bush as president required the intervention of the supreme court to halt the recount of ballots in trump found himself in the position of he would have taken his time before conceding his concession when and if it would have stressed that he had won the popular vote and that crooked could not claim a media message would have stressed the need for to be conciliatory and acknowledge that the majority of the voters had chosen trump one can easily imagine announcing the breaking news that had withdrawn the nomination of choice for the supreme court and invited the republicans to name the replacement for the deceased the democrats have done just the is behind this universal president said perhaps more than he intended when he declared that we have to remember that were actually all on one team this is an intramural a test competition involving players from the same united states does not really have an oppositional political system the divisions between the democrats and and between and are of an entirely tactical character they all defend the same basic of the corporate and financial aristocracy that controls the political this the democrats are always the more accommodating and conciliatory since their rhetorical references to defending the interests of working by the likes of thoroughly vacuous and insincere in relation to trump and the dangers he there is an element of complete which arises from the fact that the danger is not to the democrats or the privileged social forces for which they but to the working chief concern of the democrats is to contain popular anger their moves to circle the wagons around trump are above all a response to the danger they see of the emergence of popular opposition that threatens not only the incoming but the capitalist system as sanders and company prostrate themselves and pledge their loyalty to thousands of youth and workers are demonstrating around the country against the these protests are only a pale and politically disparate foretaste of mass struggles of the working class that are to is critical is that the lessons of the election be drawn and all attempts to keep opposition to war and austerity chained to the political corpse of the democratic party be rejected the task is not to take back the democratic party or push it to the inevitable result of that false perspective has already been demonstrated in the reactionary outcome of the sanders to break with both parties of

the foul stench of fascism in the may be shocked by the election of trump but black and brown smelt it throughout this summer and i have interviewed fellow asking them about their feelings and experiences regarding this presidential election in all of these one thing was we knew this was some of it hung like a foul smell in the air the acrid stench that generations before somehow learned to live though it choked them many of us coughed and spluttered when that suffocating air filled our lungs some of us cried out in when those of us who spoke up were heard at we were greeted with or with laughter like some i wrote about that were given the assurance that there were some for whom that acrid stench was a breath of fresh but those foolish people were few and unimportant we were told the smell would go away on its own it went nowhere it lingered and it got for some of it was more than a smell for some unlucky ones such as it became a physical parked his car in my beloved town of hood to take his dog for a walk as told the town started to get out of the and heard someone the car door smacked my head and then my head hit the door frame i lost part of my memory for about news of the assault hit our small it shocked us all we had a hard time believing especially when reported that the only other words he heard were you is not a he is a monk in typical monk his response was filled with am happy it happened to me and not to a he ca feel safe in a third of my own in my we spoke at length about the assault and what it meant by we had already seen that racism and white nationalism were on the rise the fact that an innocent monk was attacked at all was but that he was attacked for being something he for being nothing more than not was what really my town assumed it was isolated we assumed there was a small minority of people filled with assumed that the smell would go away on its news stories abounded about white people verbally or physically attacking and people with disabilities many people mostly white allies thought that it was rare not something to worry did believe that for a is a black designer who was living in in but was returning to his native white girlfriend and i are moving back to this he told me had originally planned to drive across the country and stop in new and phoenix needless to we not doing that any and his girlfriend took an plane instead too many stories of white backlash attacks in too many disparate places made them cancel their was jokingly worried about being opinionated in the south before this he said it untenable it incredibly sad that in i ca feel safe in a third of my own is not alone by many minority people in had already changed their and outlook marina an artist from began to avoid eye contact with people on the metro when someone looked at her and people are so experiences with actions and violence have existed before but have gotten the attention they getting now social media makes sharing these experiences easier than ever so things encountered kept to but with and twitter talking about with people throughout the i saw this pattern repeated minority people of various and racial groups were all doing the same were talking about the foul smell in the pointing out the real danger to anyone who would and they were all being more cautious around white people many of them changed their in subtle ways wear headphones more at work said a white lesbian woman who wants to remain anonymous for fear of a backlash at the legal practice where she works outside i just want to avoid the chance of getting into was being verbally assaulted and called because she spoke about wanting to marry her partner even in national symbol of a lesbian woman felt afraid to argue for her right to a marriage that the state had already given a black writer and actor in who did not want his real name had a somewhat similar take on avoiding arguments when he talked about the police goal is not to win the he told me goal is to get home happens to be tall and his car is fitted with special gearing to allow him to drive only with his hands it is a car that only someone his size can a white cop pulls me over one he told is looking me up and looking at my insurance and my and he asks me this your i what is that question supposed to we all know what it supposed to mean you looking at my and i have a car only i can drive i know why you asking that but not going to say because the goal is to get home so i just say sir it is white men are taking back to the i heard similar responses throughout the summer and minority people universally spoke of this election as a they spoke of being scared white people universally saw it as an accidental event that would just that could really happen warned us of exactly that sentiment a political writer who studied has written of the seriousness of this election in numerous telling us that ca happen is exactly how fascism happens her essays are like a plan for how to avoid a yet it seems that no one wanted to bring her map on this i warned us writing that are on the cusp of a historic decision in the us we can make history and transition from the first black to the first female
us bombing of is no worse than what happened in and by the bombing campaign in eastern which has ended at least for the time has been described in press reports and as though it were unique in modern military history in its indiscriminateness in an usual move for a senior us secretary of state john called for an investigation of war crimes in discussion has been lacking in historical however certainly the civilian death toll from the bombing and shelling in has been but many of the strikes may not be all that dissimilar from the major us bombing campaign in in nor as indiscriminate as recent campaigns in densely populated impression that the bombing in was uniquely indiscriminate was a result of news reporting and commentary by that there are no real military targets in east in front turned into the central hub of a massive system of conventional warfare in province in late when it sent an enormous convoy of at least vehicles with troops and weaponry into eastern a dramatic video shows what appears to be hundreds of vehicles full of troops and trucks with weapons mounted on command in has drones observing the routes in and out of so it certainly knew where many of those military sites were located opposition sources also revealed that began immediately to put the military assets at its disposal digging deep bunkers to protect military equipment and tunnels through which troops and weapons could be moved move underground explains the use of bombs for the first time in the war as the guardian reported of the think tank royal united service institute concluded that the have intelligence of the whereabouts of opposition mainly because bunker buster bombs are too expensive to use simply to destroy buildings at like fighters in in the command in has moved its weapons and command around in the tunnels that they have built so many of the and air strikes are almost certainly hitting targets that have already been abandoned and in other the wrong target has undoubtedly been health a local monitoring estimated that civilians had been killed in the first three weeks of bombing in east the united nations put the death toll at the superiority act as terrible as that toll of civilian lives the united states should drop the stance of moral superiority when the us military invaded in it made no effort to keep track of how many civilians were killed in its bombing and artillery claiming it had no way to tell who was civilian and who was the best estimates of civilians killed in us and urban wars provide any basis for moral superiority a survey of hospitals by the times in may produced an estimate of at least civilians killed in the first five weeks of war the estimate included those who had died in ground fighting and from unexploded but even with those contributing factors subtracted from the it would still be far greater than those killed in the assault on east on a weekly war on city in and the war on in were also far deadlier than the former killed according to an investigation by the human rights the latter killed according to the office of coordination of humanitarian affairs on hospitals the one feature of the air offensive on east that seems most clearly to violate the laws of war is the targeting of hospitals media accounts have referred to air strikes with barrel bombs that have hit two major hospitals in the part of the government has been acting as though it regards the hospitals in eastern as serving the front and the which are under intense pressure from the militants who run that part of have fed the governments a detailed report by doctors without borders on the air strikes that hit the hospital on the local that created a new system of hospitals in decided not to declare the hospitals openly but to keep them underground meaning secret from the of the government knows perfectly well where all hospitals in east are located the air strike that damaged the hospital shows how the government has responded it began with an air strike that destroyed a building across the street from the hospital the building was a but former residents of east who have gotten out have confirmed that associated with the command have located their offices in schools to try to hide their a few minutes of the initial according to the hospital staff were pulling survivors out of the rubble and taking them across the street to the emergency whereupon the air force dropped a barrel bomb at the entrance to the emergency killing several of the hospital including one doctor then it dropped one close enough to the side of the hospital to hit the emergency room minutes hit a building down the block where hospital staff were attacks on those who try to save the lives of survivors of bombing attacks sometimes called double tap attacks are rightly condemned as violations of humanitarian law and the belief that the staff at the hospital are operating in effect as medics for the military does not justify attacking it and the wounded sheltered such violations of the laws of war are hardly unique to or unique us drone strikes in have hit rescuers or mourners after hitting their initial targets in numerous documented cases in the the military argued that fighters were using hospitals to hide from but offered no valid evidence to support as the report showed the completely destroyed the hospital in an air strike recorded for public release after claiming falsely that it had been fired on by its wars in and in the has gone well beyond the and campaign in refusing to any distinction between civilian targets it not only targeted civilian offices in both but treated entire areas of the city as a legitimate on the premise that all civilians had been

by posted on by this columnist did not see a trump victory coming the degree of disgust directed at an awful candidate was more than i had predicted neither the corporate nor wall nor the nor the pollsters saw this either their defeat and proof of their uselessness is total those of us who rejected the elite consensus and support should be proud black people are now in fear and in shock when we ought to be spoiling for a fight all is not lost even the victory of the openly bigoted trump poses an opportunity to right our political ship not the electoral the political one for decades black have been voting for people who have done them wrong bill got rid of public assistance as a and undid regulations that kept wall street in check he put black people in jail and yet black people turn on him until he and his wife tried to defeat but gave us more of the same bailouts of wall interventions and death for people all over the and a beat down of black people who still loved him despite the fear of republican we end up losing whenever a democratic presidential candidate wins victory is ours if we dump the democrat party and their black the democrats were so entrenched in their corruption and that they see the sanders campaign for modest reform as the savior it might have been they marched in lock step with a woman who was heartily disliked sanders went along as the sheep dog who led his flock straight over the cliff the democrats inadvertently galvanized people who had stopped participating in the system and who want change from top to bottom when trump asked black what have you got to his words were met with derision but in reality he posed a good question what do we have to show for years of democratic bailed out insurance big and even but he rebuild or new the water in is still poisoned and the prisons are still full as for white people who voted for of course many of them are racists however they are not without valid complaints they want but black people either they want wars around the world and neither do black people we corrupt our own heritage of radicalism in favor of shallow symbolism while we slept walk in foolish nostalgia for and cried at the thought of him leaving white people kept their hatred of to themselves or lied to pollsters they want to be great great for them white nostalgic yearnings are dangerous for black and we must be vigilant but there may be opportunity in this crisis if we dare to seize it yes white people will strut for president trump but that mean we must submit as if we are in the crow days of old we have ourselves to rely on and we can reclaim our history of fighting for the dread of redneck celebration should not be our primary motivation right now before we quake in fear at white we must send the scoundrels packing those of us who voted for the green party ticket of stein and must stand firmly and proudly for our choice we must on building a progressive party to replace the democrats who never help us we must applaud and for exposing their corruption there should be no back tracking on the fight to build political power the black people who return to the polls be either those individuals must have personal introspection that is meaningful and political their lack of enthusiasm speaks to democratic party and black incompetence we should refrain from personal blame and help one another in this process as we fight for justice and peace the end of the duopoly is the first step in liberation staying with a party that literally did nothing was a slow and agonizing death sometimes shock therapy is needed to improve ones condition if we take the necessary steps to free this election outcome will be a disaster why not bring the disaster to the people who made it the destruction of the democratic party and creation of a truly progressive political movement is the only hope for black s freedom rider column appears weekly in and is widely reprinted elsewhere she maintains a frequently updated as well as at ms lives in new and can be reached via at
by brushing away the extreme claims and rhetoric of much election there are some observations which deserve attention these unfortunately mostly provide hard lessons and not a lot of encouragement for people who hold to principles of and the election demonstrated perhaps better than and better than has been generally been that a plutocracy it took a genuine a a man with a lifetimes economic to defeat a family which could provide the very definition of being politically a family which had laboriously constructed and carefully maintained a kind of deep well with money for their ambitions it was the well of drilled by bill with help from some extremely shady such as that made the keystone establishment figures in the democratic party it was not personal charm or exceptional political in his displayed some of both of earned the their it was the the mothers milk of politics in what is euphemistically called fund many hundreds of millions of dollars were provided for the party over the last couple of decades by bill efforts fully appreciated the fact that money buys power and influence she lacked bills superficial but she certainly more than shared his ambition on the charm when she was ready to move into running for she perhaps under bills a kind of forced clown face with arched and a smile as big as her lips would and these expressions were accompanied by little gestures such as briefly pointing to various or waving whenever she campaigned her gestures reminded me of something you might see atop a float in a parade or of the late at his most exuberant these were not natural for her they were never in evidence years ago when she spent years as a kind of bizarre executive both in a governors mansion and later in the white bizarre because she indulged her husbands predatory sexual behavior in exchange for the immense power it conferred on her behind the scenes over her far more and successful knew that gestures and simulated charm do not get you far in politics she determined to build a political war chest long and there are many indications over the years of her working towards this end of making this or that change in expressed as when running for the when sources of big money suggested another view would more acceptable she was anything but constant in the views she embraced because when she ran for the senate she spent record amounts of embarrassingly large amounts in her years of speaking she aimed at special interests who could supply potentially far more money than just exorbitant speaking fees in the appointed post of secretary of as it into personal contact with every head of government or international unquestionably played an aggressive pay for play with them all covering up that embarrassing and illegal fact is what the private servers and unauthorized smart phones were all about a second big fact of the election is that both major political parties are rather sick and fading the republican party has been broken for a very long time it hobbled along for some decades with the help of various hoping to expand its constituency with rubbish like family public prayer and catering to the and burning constitutional and now it is truly out of gas that is precisely why a political outsider like oligarch trump could manage to hijack the party he was opposed by boring men like seeking to secure an almost inherited and a intensely phony fundamentalist like and it proved to be no contest it was a remarkable political but i think it was only possible given the sorry state of the party the republican party had been given a some new by in the he had an extremely mixed record as but he was held in some and did have a clear but his effect on the party was not lasting trump could be seen as another but i think the comparison is superficial trump literally hijacked the and he was not deliriously crowned by its establishment the press was too busy attacking him from the start to take notice or do any intelligent and he was attacked precisely for the potential damage to the establishment he represented his most promising quality is his potential for creating a new coalition of interests and one excluding the continuation of the wars vigorously embraced and would expand but the democratic party is in serious too it has a great deal of internal as the material from the clearly shows us lack of ignorance of the people it has always claimed to bad and the absolute prostrate worship of money are the major symptoms the material tells us about many internal including harsh judgments of resentment over the character of daughter who is said to resemble in her behavior and and the belief of some that just should not have run she had become for many a rather figure from whom absolutely nothing spectacular in politics or policy could possibly be expected but they not only blindly supported they broke all their own party rules by internally and secretly working to defeat a legitimate and viable sanders sanders might well have been able to win the election for the but their establishment was blind to the possibility and rejected his candidacy after there were bill and beckoning to their running well of money in it might be just as well that sanders was cheated out of the nomination he proved a weak individual in the giving in to just the forces he had claimed to oppose and leaving his enthusiastic followers completely let down he may well even have been secretly bribed by money from the since he bought a fairly expensive property not long afterward in any there he out on the supporting everything he ever opposed personified in men of that nature do not stand up well to generals and admirals and the heads of massive a quality
in the world so why did the us secretary of state john going to the south as us presidential elections were being held on and why was the news provided late in the game and as an unexpected one need to keep in mind that many us states allowed early so millions of had already cast their ballots they and perhaps too did not have to be in their home districts on polling or perhaps he did not want to wait in long lines like in places like where the number of polling stations were reduced to keep some categories from voting presumably john is not one of these and his vote would have been counted it will be remembered that stood for president against w and would have beaten him if he had won which he failed to do by only a few thousand votes so you would imagine a man of such experience and seniority would be out on the campaign trail for right until the polls close in the east of the which is when candidates traditionally claim victory or concede defeat but even in the country in he was considered so important that he had been sent to of all places the south pole while the rest of his party was hard campaigning for he was chilling it at the us facilities apparently looking into something to do with environmental policy which part of his job description last time anyone looked perhaps in he knew the election results that many are now claiming was a total all the poll results were wrong and the people had spoken in rejecting the status and all what and those who stand behind her stand for on a lighter no one knows the full extent of the us footprint in as it is all classified the bases there are known primarily for drug which was once with the us itself supplying the drugs to its own employees as it did in but visit there was unlikely to have influenced the outcome of the or indeed much else unless the us is willfully changing the environment of regional countries from its antarctic bases it seems very odd that should have gone to the south and then followed up with a tour of the southern hemisphere to discuss such an issue at such an inopportune time so why was sent to the south about as far away from the election as there are plenty of many of which are credible but as the most unlikely one is the most likely to be true and it pretty poles not so far apart one day the performance artist decided she would go and visit the north just like that she managed to get near it and found it was a restricted owned by the us so she actually reach the pole itself north pole trip was in five years later a new airliner crashed into one of the antarctic or so we were told as a all civilian over flights of the south pole were also banned the us extend as far north as the north or as far south as the south but they have somehow become territory part of the vast swathe of land where the us exacts different forms of taxation without giving the inhabitants representation in novel white lama the leading character ends up going to the south pole he finds a gap in the ice and discovers a hidden colony of very tall who live in a temperate climate and grow tropical fruit trees that is only a but it is based on a real the attempted of in these characters are alleged to be descendants of those maintained by foreign powers for the own purposes for many years it has been that the built some sort of base in they are most unlikely to have gone all that way on a fishing expedition as their victims the were very and efficient we know for example that if they had invaded england they were intending to use the town of as their operations base a very sensible as it is near the geographical of the between its two main industrial hubs of the time and gives easy access to all the important transport and communications routes operation after the second world war a number of leading were spirited away to the us on ratlines so that they would neither stand trial for their crimes or have their knowledge fall into the hands of the in us admiral e led and troops in an invasion of called operation this and at least one expedition was called off because the troops came under attack by what are described as flying saucers even in the country whose citizens went running to the hills when told them that the had landed their military do not run away from flying saucers why is the us unable to describe what forces were unleashed against the invasion and by what truth is so frightening it has to be shrouded in science fiction terms in order for people to dismiss the whatever the did in the us probably found out about it the us in is one of a number of dubious former soviet facilities it has taken over and turned into restricted areas in the same way it would be in character for the us antarctic base to have once been operated by a foreign and have been taken over for scientific purposes most scientists would never those with military applications the us always denies until it can gain political capital from

in the world us foods holding corporation and the two top food distribution are laying off thousands of workers is closing stores and terminating employees as the price of and almost all agricultural products have farmers across the united states are facing financial ruin the ongoing glut in agricultural products is not merely the natural cycle of the market at work policies of the us federal government are directly linked to the low food prices while it is clear that the ongoing agricultural surplus is very bad for the us the government seems to have other priorities broken promises from politicians the agricultural prowess of the united states is known across the planet the current president of china first visited the united states in he come to see the statue of or the monument xi visited in order to study the technology and farming techniques employed by some of the most advanced and efficient farmers in the world love for the small farmers is voiced by almost all sectors of us political and almost always has been the writings of spoke at length about the yeoman and his role in an ideal republic the folk singer sang about how the farmer is man who feeds them all radio host plucked the heart strings of the public with his so god made a farmer speech in each election politicians devote special attention to the the first vote in determining who will be the major parties respective nominees as they travel across the agricultural the presidential hopefuls routinely make all kinds of speeches championing the hard working farmers while politicians are known to make promises to the and seem to recognize that agriculture is essential to the us the policies of recent most of them having bipartisan have been anything but beneficial to those who work the land in the current presidential is hotly with trump and very close in the polls the farm spawned by federal is undoubtedly a big factor in the first months of million gallons of milk were poured out due to the glut according to the wall street farmers across the us are pouring out tens of millions of gallons of milk amid massive over glut that has reduced prices and filled warehouses with cheese another article cattle and hog prices hover near the lowest levels in years as produce the largest volume of meat in history between of and of the price of milk has decreased by the price of eggs has decreased by the overproduction and of agricultural products can be directly linked to federal policies throughout his has repeatedly cut the supplemental nutrition assistance program and reduced the amount of food that low income families are able to purchase the cutting of this federal program directly takes food from the mouths of despite the fact that according to the us department of of households are now food the cuts have and hunger is rising among poor l in addition to the obvious impact on the cuts in food stamps have also cut into food sales food producing corporations and small farmers have seen a decrease in their sales has laid off thousands of workers and closed thousands of stores these losses and layoffs can be linked directly to the snap cuts congress has recently discussed a plan that would eventually take billion out of the federal food assistance a move that would undoubtedly push a lot of food retail and meat packers over the along with many others the reductions in food assistance are not the only factor the economic sanctions against have played a dramatic role in creating the current food glut the collapse and breaking up of the soviet unions collective farm system during the era of the dramatically reduced domestic food production this opened up new markets for who greatly increased their exports to the former the new sanctions imposed in which restrict us and agricultural sales to have dramatically changed the landscape of the global food market farmers have been deprived of million potential customers due to the ban on selling to those living in the federation austerity fascism leave farmers behind why is food assistance to low income families being the claim is that the us federal budget is too and that hard economic times mandate austerity the united states still has the largest military budget on the planet when it comes time to reduce rather than cutting the amount of money spent on and the politicians have opted to cut into the nutrition of along with the livelihoods of farmers and agricultural workers the thousands of military bases around the along with the billions given in foreign military aid to countries like all seem be far more important to us leaders and why has the us drastically restricted the exporting agricultural products to the sanctions were enacted in in response to the crisis the elected president of victor was toppled in orgy of street violence the new with a base of support only in the western regions of the has within its ranks many open admirers of and is very hostile to since the people of eastern have taken up arms to resist the new regime the people in the region of voted to become apart of the whose military they had been hosting since the collapse of the sanctions were imposed on and based on allegations that is supporting the resistance of people in the eastern regions against the regime us leaders tell us the sanctions are intended to punish for meddling in since the passing of the has revived its own domestic agricultural programs small farmers across are producing and other products no longer sold to them by the us and the agriculture has experienced a boom since and president is even more popular than prior to the crisis the decision of us leaders to wage economic warfare against in support of while at the same time cutting assistance to is contrary to values often displayed
in the world when countries are in trouble they always react the same way if they have economic troubles their governments take ever greater control of the public whether through austerity or spending when there is civil strife the government calls out the army and restricts liberties to regain control of the situation when wars are taking place elections are so the government of the day remains in power to deal with the conflict these measures have the effect of entrenching the whoever that may be at a given and excluding others people can only play a part in addressing the problems of the country at the whim of the with appointments replacing elections in many such scenarios only when the establishment is secure does it allow greater freedom of action and which are regarded as the hallmarks of stable countries now trump has been elected president of the united states on an avowedly platform he tapped into those disaffected by the political system and found the issues on which he could make the most noise that in itself was a virtue with the constituency he was trying to attract too many people have become disaffected with politics everywhere because someone has decreed certain views to be without giving a reason and trump was only too happy to give voice to those who have been told that their views entitle them to one but is trumps election the democratic revolution he does it actually give a voice to the voiceless and power to the in order to exercise any power president trump will have to do all the things he accuses his opponents in the establishment but worse for a while he might get away with but he will never have the resources to win in the longer term all we will have is the with no establishment oppression on a scale beyond the worst nightmares of the enforced nobodies who now think they are but are in fact trump who do you think you as it turned failed to get past a problem she would not have had as a republican if you are on the conservative end of the political spectrum you are expected to act like you belong in power when you have it people in more progressive parties claim to represent the interests of the broad mass of people who will never be rich and powerful if they stay in power for too they create a distance between themselves and that mass which erodes their natural support has been a national figure in the us for a generation her accession to the democratic nomination was seen as almost a factor which harmed senator when he ran for the democratic nomination against jimmy carter in she was referred to as the establishment candidate throughout the particularly by members of her own party who preferred socialist who complained throughout the primary process that the voting was being rigged and that the media were falsely reporting that she had won the nomination before it was mathematically certain for a all this would play except in extreme circumstances such as for a democrat it was bound to depress enthusiasm in the voter and either drive it to another candidate or persuade it to stay at particularly when enough scandal attaches to as it is due to her business and government dealings was about her nice office in not the problems of real democrats keeping her there would have solved nothing this was seen most clearly in a traditional democratic mainstay which voted for trump despite the fact exit pollsters were showing that a large numbers of voters greatly disliked both he and many of those who disliked trump still voted for him because they felt disliked themselves by politicians such as who had let them down more than a newcomer had been able to do he was candidate from early on in the primary election period poacher turns gamekeeper whether trump would have got anywhere near the republican nomination had there been a republican president for the last eight years is unlikely only as an outsider could he gain any traction within a party which thinks of itself as the natural party of and would pick an insider every time to maintain its hold on power the republican party will remain largely embarrassed by despite his victory he may be the voters idea of a but he what republican politicians see as a republican president as the post published underneath every article about trump from until election trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar rampant xenophobe racist misogynist and who has repeatedly pledged to ban all billion members of an entire religion from entering the us ask most republican who control both whether this describes a republican president and you know what the answer will though trump himself revels in such depictions well before the end of his term trump will have become the establishment himself so to achieve anything in the checks and balances system the us has he will either have to carry the party and the establishment with and become more embedded than is to do or try and purge the very many who will oppose him throughout his business if repeated robbing of contractors and tax avoidance can be dignified with such a trump has relied on bluster and a stubborn refusal to face reality to prosper whether he can get away with that with the military and intelligence staff who have ruined global reputation with impunity is another matter presidents who spent lifetimes working the system have not been able to control the or the industrial and media barons if trump he will have to exert extreme control to do and become more exclusive than the establishment itself jimmy carter was elected in as an antidote to a corrupt political establishment despite his long years of public he was discarded four years later for being exactly what he was elected to be
views gold as we approach the end of in what has been a tough environment in the gold and silver today a legend in the business sent a powerful piece about the big picture and what will translate into a spike in gold overnight golds surge to by john m placements for almost two these institutions manipulated rates for their own benefit is this the latest hedge fund rigging its the worlds leading central including the bank of japan manipulating interest after rounds and rounds of large scale quantitative easing that saw them buy up almost half of the yet despite manipulating the yield curve and creating money to buy assets like government debt and there is growing concern reached their limit to find out which silver mining company billionaire just purchased a nearly stake in and learn why he believes this is one of the most exciting silver stories in the world click here or sponsored in amassing securities through quantitative easing the central banks of us and balance sheets make up percent of global just as king could not control the setting interest rates underscores the central banks limitation now their policies and even their existence are under attack infinity has ended even japan had not but two lost decades and the unconventional policies have yet to revive their economy or inflation investors are increasingly skeptical over japans multiple forms of easing and rather than go the yen gained percent having exhausted other policy the promised to keep government bond yields at zero the were among the first to introduce quantitative easing with huge increases in bond purchases by its post office for a this worked yet the two percent inflation target was missed so each a new inflation target was created and negative rates was tried and each the government bought more paper the yield curve became flatter with bonds yielding much the same regardless of maturity or creditworthiness money became not only too but worthless consumer spending has fallen and despite the the economy remains in a funk investors too became accustomed to this printing policy and gamed the money flows generated by central bank policy as a government debt has increased to a whopping percent of gross domestic product and the bank of japan is among the biggest debtors in the world central trust me central banks in and the united states also followed japans path the bank of england cut its rate to the lowest in its year history and after sterling has lost percent of its value by targeting rates instead of base central banks have printed trillions of liquidity that have yet to boost growth or even leaving their credibility in question government deficits have become chronic and nowhere are the provisions prevalent in the private sector might be one of the early casualties almost a third of global government debt now yields negative rates markets have been skewed by our central banks heavy intervention savers have been accumulating assets for centuries but now are penalized because of their governments on zero or negative rates the evidence is mounting that the pension liabilities of both the private and government have exploded because it costs more to fund future promises by squeezing the business models of pension and insurance companies are put at as is their lending in principle these institutions are obligated to pay back cash sometime in the future this promise to pay is often backed by debt securities but when the promise to payback is less than the model becomes unsustainable central banks balance sheets hold up to a third of their own government bonds fifth largest national bank recently borrowed about million with a coupon at yielding to maturity over years that investors are willing to accept this return is mind boggling reflecting the artificial turvy environment created by the central banks recently the government sold bonds yielding a paltry percent implying a negative return to buyers for the next half century who would buy the central banks of course dueling regulators desperate for a new twist has emerged the one are under attack governments are the united states government has closed or forced the closure of multiple tax loopholes and are now pursuing global players outside its borders the truth is that led by the united states face a chronic debt problem the union has taken this quest for one step further as the commission ruled that apple owes a whopping billion in back taxes because they believe that percent tax rate is too low and against guidelines too faces million payment in back taxes that the commission does not have jurisdiction will likely be tested by the courts but this tit for tat move nonetheless come at a time when supporters criticized overreaching interventionist moves other concerned that this super tax grab is a desperate move for revenues are also concerned because it violates their sovereignty and are looking at alternatives the political capital is being threatening its very existence already buffeted by concerns and the referendum to be sure the apple judgment creates new uncertainties since itself has been usurped by overreach and at a the interventionist regulator has changed the financial landscape significantly over the next few years while this will likely be fought in the courts for the tax grab drew attention to dysfunctional tax system and the need for reform trump has already suggested a much reduced tax rate in order to repatriate those funds nonetheless whether you are an apple or bank business is under siege there is a growing political backlash against the eight years of unorthodox monetary policies that were seen to benefit debtors at the expense of causing the banking sector to suffer slow rates and a deeper malaise with their banking profits and regulators have balked at the recent committee on banking supervisions proposed bank capital rule overhaul problems are now overshadowed by heavily indebted banks raising concerns that the sick banking system is beginning to unravel ironically

by the following post summarizes the regarding production cutbacks for twelve states invited to participate in the organization of petroleum exporting countries ongoing discussions regarding a output freeze as the post failure to agree restrictions and stabilize prices might heighten the risks of terrorist attacks and political instability in some of the countries invited to participate in wider negotiations yet inviting new participants to the negotiating party is only likely to complicate the situation and slow further the implementation of an internal production reduction already delayed for nearly a year by an journalist based in morocco she completed her undergraduate coursework at the university of at and reports on international human rights issues and more originally published at last oil minister released a list of states invited to participate in the ongoing negotiations regarding a output freeze and ten other oil exporters made the though the high variation between the economic and political standings of the participants add to the already complicated and delicate orchestration of the deal if there is to be a that is this past several of the invited countries sent representatives to for consultations regarding the terms of a potential freeze deal no details have been but those who participated agreed to meet again before the summit president and energy minister have recently agreed to freeze output in coordination with if the groups members can flesh out a plan amongst themselves according to the bloc is on track to deliver a deal by the end of also said that has agreed to participate in official meeting this month as outlined by the foundation last is desperate for a freeze deal to help economic development rebound to the percent expansion rate that the former soviet republic saw when barrel prices exceeded but just because they are desperate for a cut mean they will participate energy minister said on that itself would not be doing any according to their production levels are small in proportion to some of the others at the negotiating namely and this does not expect its economy to grow more than while forecasts from the world bank predict a low increase in which recently reopened its depends on oil exports for over percent of total government revenues and a quarter of its a failed deal could mean renewed terrorist attacks and political instability for as the economy continues to spiral downwards asked what he hoped meeting would a official in attendance in desperately we just hope the price will react and it will increase that desperation is shared by many other but this desperation is also a sign that these countries are not in any position to scale back the production that generates the most revenue was also at the table halfway through a country that produced more than half of the worlds oil a century ago also announced its support of an as noted is convenient because the oil production was percent lower than its august rate and agree that some measures will be taken to stabilize the energy minister said this weekend we agreed the price of oil can be around per barrel statements revolving around do not speak to who is ready to share the burden of cutting and do little to assuage market fears that a cut is but a wispy goal buying the feasibility of cuts and before the meeting in said as stating that it did not believe in the blocs ability to solve the pricing crisis due to several failed efforts to freeze output over the past year newer reports on show that they officially support an output freeze and overall with the expectation that similar measures be taken by other countries it remains unclear if a nation currently defying production and a country trying to regain its legs now that sanctions were count as one of the other countries that expects to cut output as a net oil does not have the market power or political capital to sway the momentum of a freeze one way or another the north recent spat with the facto leader of over suspended petroleum shipments will also limit the salience of interests in the blocs proceedings sources from the parliament say the energy ministry will be asked to review agreement to supply with petroleum derivatives in the coming further complicating relations between the two nations percent of oil exports go straight to the united according to governmental data from the buyer and seller countries neither of the two north countries is part of and they have their own agreements for energy supplies so even though has been invited to participate in the freeze the country does not have the economic or political incentive to reduce output elected to observe meeting as the country prepares to increase production rates over the next few years this makes them extremely unlikely participants in any efforts to scale back production other countries present this weekend included which has spent the better part of this summer building a hedge against low oil prices for the next fiscal year producers such as and and have already turned down production over the past two which had a limited effect on market fundamentals a million barrel per day producer that has increased output by percent in and percent in declined to meet with over the weekend the geopolitics of oil within has already delayed the implementation of an internal production reduction for almost an entire year by adding new nations from previously uninvolved continents and the bloc has flooded the negotiation table with new interests creating a fresh slate of diplomatic obstacles to overcome before an output freeze can be implemented
by u plans to build relations and offer attention by gutting tenured shifting the teaching load to contingent redistributing salaries to and socking money into fancy facilities let me know how that works out by professor of economics and public university of and assistant department of university originally published at questions over the value of a university education are underscored by negative student experiences coaching is a but tool to improve student experiences and performance this column presents the results from an experiment comparing coaching with lower cost nudge interventions while coaching led to a significant increase in average course and text message interventions had no effect the benefits of coaching appear to derive from the nature of relationships and attention policymakers and academics share growing concerns about stagnating college completion rates and negative student experiences recent figures suggest that only of students who pursue a bachelors degree complete it within six years et and it is increasingly unclear whether students who attain degrees acquire meaningful new skills along the way and students enter college with those who do not study or have superficial attitudes about success performing particularly poorly et coaching to improve outcomes a promising tool for improving students college outcomes and experiences is coaching at both the high school and college an emerging recent literature demonstrates the benefits of helping students foster good study and skills through structured tutoring and coaching cook et find that cognitive therapy and tutoring generate large improvements in maths scores and high school graduation rates for troubled youth in while et show that and group activities lead to large increases in high school graduation and college among youth in a public housing project at the college scrivener and find that the accelerated study in associates program a bundle of and student success workshops in community colleges nearly doubled graduation rates and and baker show that telephone coaching by inside track professionals boosts college retention by across several institutions while support can have large effects on student it is often costly to implement and difficult to scale up to the student population at large noting this we set out to build on recent advances in and investigating whether technology and text and email messaging can be used to generate comparable benefits to coaching interventions but at lower costs among university students and several recent studies in find that appropriately timed interventions can have lasting effects on student outcomes and and relatively large improvements on academic performance have been documented from interventions that help students define their goals or purpose for learning et et teach the growth mindset idea that intelligence is malleable et and help students keep negative events in perspective by their values and in contrast to these other studies in education and economics attempt to maintain contact with students or their parents at a low cost by using technology to provide consistent reminders aimed at improving outcomes providing and phone call updates to parents about their students progress in school has been shown to boost both parental engagement and student performance and kraft and rogers mayer et while direct communication with college and university students has been used in attempts to increase financial aid renewal and page and improve academic outcomes and can alternatives to coaching be we examine whether benefits comparable to those obtained from coaching can be achieved at lower cost by either of two specific interventions and we examine a intervention designed to affirm students goals and purpose for attending and a text and email messaging campaign that provides weekly reminders of academic advice and motivation to students we work with a sample of more than undergraduate students who are enrolled in introductory economics courses at a large representative college in randomly assigning students to one of three treatment groups or a control group the treatment groups consist a exercise completed during the first two weeks of class in the the intervention plus text and email messaging throughout the full academic and the intervention plus coaching in which students are assigned to undergraduate students who act as coaches students in the control group are given a personality test measuring the big five personality traits figure our main results on course grades we find large positive effects from the coaching amounting to approximately a increase in average course we also find that coached students experience a increase in in we find no effects on academic outcomes from either the exercise or the text messaging even after investigating potentially heterogeneous treatment effects across several student including incoming high school and whether students live on residence figure main effects of interventions our results suggest that the benefits of personal coaching are not easily replicated by interventions using technology many successful coaching involve regular interaction facilitated either by mandatory meetings between coaches and students or proactive coaches regularly initiating contact and and baker cook et et our coaches initiated contact and built trust with students over in person and through text messaging through a series of the coaches could understand the problems students were facing and provide clear ending most conversations with students being able to take at least one specific action to help solve their current problems our text messaging campaign offered weekly academic resource and but did not initiate communication with individual students about specific issues help with writing or an upcoming the team often invited students to reply to messages and share their concerns but was unable to do this with the same efficacy as a nor were we able to establish the same rapport with students our inability to reach out to all students and softly guide the conversation likely prevented us from learning the important details of their specific problems although we provided answers and advice to the questions we we did not have as much information on the students backgrounds as our coaches and thus could not tailor our responses to each students specific circumstances our coaches were also able to build trust with students by
by private equity shills are readying the blame cannon for the widely forecast fall in returns who are the allies of the private equity firms attempting to as the cause of deteriorating not the masters of the who are always and every the sole cause of good things but never never to be found when bad things occur its those evil populists interfering with the proper operation of the world according to private equity that is messing up returns were not making this up from the wall street journal the rise of populist politicians in western nations could challenge the ability of firms to do business and make according to a report from one of the largest advisers to investors in the industry the backlash against may cause higher taxes on create more drive more volatility and restrict economic lanes annual review said this is utterly ludicrous if been paying attention from the first half of the average multiple for purchases was over higher than the peak of the last in even limited partners who are leery of saying a bad word about private like of described acquisitions as priced to perfection the trading prices of the private equity firms that are public shows that equity market investors believe that private equity firms will not earn any carry fees over the next couple of years and as pointed out since the second half of senior officers of prominent private equity firms have increasingly been warning that private equity returns going forward will be lower than levels of the past and none of them used um populism as the excuse for why returns were going to decline lane has more reason than most to blame private declining fortunes on external forces rather than the obvious factors of too much money chasing too many and if the fed ever pulls it rising interest rates being particularly punitive to high risk strategies like private which is fundamentally levered equity as pointed private equity has doubled its share of global equity from to lane is not just a consultant to private it is deeply conflicted by virtue of being a private equity fund of fund which means it needs to play nice with the general partners in order to maintain access to funds and the limited partners it has advised on private equity need excuses they can take to their boards and broader constituencies when private equity returns fizzle so its easy to blame those nasty rather than admit that private equity has always been a cyclical play and the end of a cycle is nigh in it should have occurred after the deal but private equity was an accidental beneficiary of central the financial system emergency and got a stay of execution in a sign that the public is getting smarter about private of the comments on the wall street journal story were not buying what lane was selling the other were general criticism of populism rather than votes of support for private equity this skew should not be surprising given some of the strained claims lane made notice in the quote above that the and presumably therefore the most important problem for private equity was higher taxes on which almost certainly refers to closing the carried interest loophole but readers are supposed to believe that that would dent their ability to make money for when those investors are almost without exception exempt from us taxes now some private equity industry members have stomped their feet and said quit if they had to pay more taxes its hard to take this fit seriously since there are not other lines of work in which earn remotely comparable pay even with a bigger tax bill at the largest the typical annual pay is eight and for the top dogs at big and some nine figures and its not as if talent makes as much of a difference as the general partners would have you believe industry data shows that no one has a secret sauce top quartile funds are less likely to perform well in the next period then by chance an investor in private equity should stop wasting time picking winners they should try to avoid crooks and otherwise attempt to index so who might leave the industry if the departures are more likely to take place at the smallest funds or ones with mediocre since the difference in tax treatment would have a bigger impact on the ability of the principals to maintain what is perceived to be an adequate lifestyle thinning out the marginal players is if anything likely to be salutary for industry performance with too much competition for the winning bid is often made by someone who is desperate to win a deal in their investors perceive them to be too slow at putting money to or not well informed but the lane is a harbinger of the sort of excuses you can expect to hear from both general partners and limited partners over the coming the tired old in new garb
by with all the big and small that goes on in private we bothered calling out a practice that is pervasive and well known in the private equity community and authorized by the agreements that the limited partners sign with the general partners yet it will likely stick in the craw of most public pension fund the taxpayers who support the payments to those as well as donor to foundations and endowments that also invest in private equity even more than the widespread use of private which is authorized not just for firm employees but at some general even their family members another routine form of private equity rent extraction is how they get the fund who are to pay for lavish annual conferences which for the biggest funds includes big ticket entertainment like conference phoenix curling and for the still another source has confirmed that john performed at the conference and as is typical in limited partnership investors are on the hook for the costs of meetings and this as part of a limited partner was on their nickel the only limited partnership agreement we have is for a credit and debt investors they obtain control of a company via chapter or an out of court do not have direct control over portfolio companies that makes it harder for them to keep various charges opaque to limited partners by laundering them through portfolio companies the opportunities partners ii puts the cost of meetings squarely on the investors from numbered page section except as specifically set forth in section management the partnership shall pay for shall reimburse the management company for its payment all costs and expenses relating to the partnerships meetings advisory committee and current form adv is even clearer on this point each fund also generally bears all of the expenses relating to its meetings and eventual liquidation than expenses resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of us or its general and the adv also specifies that can charge entertainment to portfolio which means limited partners have no idea how large the charges are in reimbursements from portfolio companies for expenses travel which include expenses for business or first class black car transportation and meals late night meals consumed at times when not we incur in connection with our performance of services for such portfolio consider what this means private jet use supposedly not because it is an egregious perk for masters of the but because their time is and sometimes those mere commercial flights get from awkward point a to awkward point b all that efficiently the other justification is the need for secrecy and the ability to work on a private jet the latter claim is pretty in light of the widespread industry practice of offering empty seats to supposed competitors if they happen to need a lift so private jet use is an practice that has become a bad norm by its hard to see lavish entertainment at supposed informational gatherings as anything other than a kickback to private equity investors as someone who is in the business of consuming and analyzing it is vastly more efficient to process written information than speeches or presentations and i both greatly prefer transcripts and can barely stand the time cost of listening to web presentations conferences are an even bigger time sink in other if the objective were to inform these events are clearly not necessary the limited partners are flattering themselves if they think they can learn anything more by seeing general partner execs or the team from their showcased portfolio companies in the flesh these are all highly skilled performers and these events are very carefully staged in advance so what are the limited partners aside from getting an excuse to visit new or other major and getting wined and the general partners are marketing to them this is an extended sales pitch to help groom them to invest in the next fund and its an opportunity to mix socially with other limited partners which is questionable as a use of the funds entrusted to them they can do that just as well at educational which are also neutral territory a former private equity fund executive pointed out that keeping private equity staff at pension funds and foundations busy with the nominally important work of running around to general partner meet and greets seriously eroded the time they could spend doing what ought to be their real of reading the financial information and other reports provided by the general partners as well as their sec form which it appears virtually no one in the industry bothers scrutinizing one academic told me that only encountered one investor who regularly read the of companies sold out of funds invested in to see if there was anything they anticipated so as to help them better evaluate future fund investments consistent with the thesis that general partner conferences were either by accident or design busywork to keep limited partners from digging into documents and this investor was in a remote part of and often go to investor confabs because the travel time was apparently too costly relative to the information yield one has to wonder how popular these general partner conferences would be if they instead featured dinners and focused on information conveyance the which by contrast are primarily networking featured long days am to with the lunch and dinner speakers covering substantive for years until the participants cried uncle and asked for a less exhausting schedule and these are people who have billions of dollars of funds at risk its not hard to imagine that if the general partners were dispensing as opposed to using investor monies to curry favor with see them using tried and true like public company quarterly earnings calls but as people trained in making presentations conventions like a darkened the use of visuals on having speakers on all give the speakers a power advantage over the audience and deter

cancer chemotherapy ineffective medicine chemotherapy is arguably one of the medical industry biggest frauds perhaps that why it recently landed on a list of ineffectual treatments drawn up by the academy of medical royal colleges list was created by top who were each asked to think of five treatments they felt provided little to no patient benefits and surprise chemotherapy was one of them doctors from the said that chemotherapy cannot cure terminal and may bring unneeded distress in the final months of life the guardian treatment is its very nature the college said the combination of failing to achieve a response and causing toxicity can more harm than more harm than you do has shown that in some up to percent of cancer patients are not from their but from chemotherapy drugs for the first time researchers actually looked at the numbers of patients who were dying within days of chemotherapy administration which could indicate that the treatment was the cause of death rather than the cancer what they found was which was conducted by public health england and cancer research found that the average mortality rate across england was about percent for lung cancer and percent for breast cancer in some those numbers were much higher for at teaching the day mortality rate for palliative chemotherapy for lung cancer was percent in the death rate for lung cancer treatment soared up to research revealed that the death rate for lung cancer patients was higher than average in several including south surrey and data also revealed that about people who underwent palliative care for breast cancer at university hospitals died because of chemotherapy the industry was quick to defend their with doctors suggesting that these occurrences could simply be the outcome of data noting that even a few deaths could skew no one really argued with the fact that chemotherapy is indeed a toxin it does it kills cancerous cells and healthy cells and therein lies the rub it may kill the but not without increasing your risks of getting cancer again in the study also found that cytotoxic chemotherapy does very little towards enhancing cancer survival rates the which was led by scientists from the department of radiation oncology at the northern cancer of the royal north shore located in raised serious questions about the actual efficacy of curative and they found was that in only contributed percent to the survival rate in and in the that number dropped to percent these findings suggest that chemotherapy truly provides very little benefit to any patient survival in their the study authors the relative survival rate for cancer in is now over it is clear that cytotoxic chemotherapy only makes a minor contribution to cancer survival to justify the continued funding and availability of drugs used in cytotoxic a rigorous evaluation of the and impact on quality of life is urgently urges doctors and patients to question whether or not particular treatments are necessary after unwarranted and harmful treatments are truly anything but medicine

please read part and i b before this chapter the horn of has the second most globally location on the continent behind north straddling the commercially vital red sea and providing international access to the worlds economy of in this the coastal states acquire a dual maritime and mainland importance through which their territories can be simultaneously used to exert influence along the waterway and the regional interior as it relates to the red this body of water occupies a crucial role in chinas grand strategy because it serves as the most geographically convenient route for facilitating the transit of goods between the east state and the which is particularly expected to climb with the completion of the silk road in a few years time due to the importance that china places on the one belt one road grand strategy and the need that it has for maintaining and strengthening its overseas markets the large and in order to sustain domestic stability and it logically has an inherent interest in preserving stability in the horn of so as to safeguard its sea line of communication to for similar it also wants to tap into the allied economy and assist in the maximization of its potential so as to acquire a strategic presence there that allows it to deepen its presence further inland into the continents interior it should be no surprise then that the horn of is the focal point of international military as evidenced by the previous part of the research which described the vast array of foreign military bases in the recent presence in and the and plans for building a base in quite naturally and in accordance with its obvious china is opening its first overseas military base in in order take advantage of the dual role in exercising maritime and mainland influence its clear how and why the tiny coastal state can be used by for flexing its maritime but its less obvious how it plans to do this in the opposite mainland direction its therefore relevant to recall the railway that china is building between the coastal city and the inland since this infrastructure project will serve as the umbilical cord between the and economies and also allow the later to finally and reliably access the global market in general the connective vision that china is pursuing is complemented by the project that its also helping to finance which eventually plans to connect with the ocean port of by rail suffice to the completion of both transnational railways and the military facility will catapult china into being the most influential country in the horn of although this seemingly inevitable reality will expectedly be opposed by the us using the methods of hybrid war this part of the research therefore endeavors to explain all of the ways in which the us could apply hybrid war strategy in order to conceivably offset chinas grand designs in the horn of region it begins by offering a general overview of regional relations that sets the appropriate context for deeper analysis after having established the state of affairs and provided a solid understanding of each examined countries interactions with the the second portion of the work then delves into a summary of these states strategic focusing primarily on their most influential determinants the last part of the regional study looks at the most realistic hybrid war scenarios that the us could possibly provoke against chinas horn of interests thorny relations in the horn the four states that occupy the horn of region and all have pristine relations with one with the most obvious problems being between on one side and on the other to explain the reason behind the abysmal relations between these two its necessary to begin by talking about bloody secessionist war against which only ended in the roots of the conflict are but they can be summarized as starting during the imperial period when the kingdom of annexed from the larger of in thenceforth giving it a sense of identity separateness from and planting the seeds for future conflict after the two entities were reunified following the end of world war ii unilateral abolishment of the federation of and sparked the separatist war that raged throughout the proceeding and even after the two countries remained at tense odds with one another over the expectation that there would eventually be a continuation war sometime in the future this came to pass from and despite ending in what has been described as a lingering stalemate it killed over one hundred thousand people and undermined the economic development potential of these two dramatically impoverished states in the years and have still remained each others primary with the two sides regularly accusing the other of attempting to subvert its stability and supporting various forces just like in the immediate years after there still exists the very real possibility today that the two countries will go to war with one another at a moments and this atmosphere of heightened militant tension is the most destabilizing interstate factor in the horn of in it will later be argued that this situation is being exploited by the powers inside the as a means of acquiring leverage over and potentially pushing into instigating a renewed round of debilitating violence although not as bad as its ties with relations with are objectively pretty poor on the surface of things there is positive and pragmatic interaction between both states at the but the primary issue between them has always been the enticing idea of greater that has captivated some on both sides of the border and even led to the war between this conflict is notable as being the last conventional attempt to create greater and also as being the only time when the soviets and switched

since we were we have been bombarded with propaganda that romantic love is the ultimate relationship ideal and literary fiction all portray romantic love as an absolute necessity in any wedding but how much of that narrative has been a is it possible that our pursuit of romantic love is actually preventing us from forming a lifelong pair began to question the notion of romantic love when thinking about its emotional root love is a fleeting and like all it comes and goes like the clouds in the sky why have i been taught to select my life partner based on an surely not encouraged to use emotion when buying a applying for a or doing my personal but when it comes to choosing a human being that supposed to spend the rest of my life advised by the establishment narrative to use emotion for the biggest decision of them major clue that romantic love is a childish strategy for choosing mates is the fact that countries with arranged where partners are picked based on purely practical have lower divorce rates that in countries where romantic love is used to select mates while there are multiple reasons for divorce in any it is rather coincidental that the countries most impacted by notions of romantic love happen to have the highest divorce rates was invented it turns out that your desire to use love as a precondition for marriage or pair bonding is an invented construct that had roots in destroying tradition and theistic authority a movement that began in the put romantic love at the not just for individuals but nations as all from a central thesis of individualism it wanted you to take the focus away from boring old rules and traditions to focusing on how you feel movement came primarily from bourgeois who used family money to fiddle away on idealistic writings the romantic movement was nothing more than a protest against bourgeois bourgeois society and morality to be extreme and flamboyant and unusual and violent even at the risk of becoming grotesque was the desire of every young romantic the romantics in bourgeois who were trying hard to escape from their own shadows source romantics believed that men and women ought to be guided by warm emotions rather than the cold abstract rules and rituals established by bourgeois society source they sound a lot like modern day social justice warriors many of whom are trust fund babies that lash out against privilege and inequality to relieve the psychological pain of being wealthy without having had to earn it combined with the fact that also trump feelings over its clear to see how romanticists were whose individualistic ideas are just what the enlightenment needed to complete its destruction of what relationships should be based on prior to the romantic love was the relationship form often described in literature and other historical love is the emotion which often gives people extreme feelings of and can also give people feelings of anguish love is the form which creates a steadfast bond between two and gives people feelings of peace scientists have described the stage of passionate love as being on since during that stage the brain releases the same as when cocaine is being used source song of songs in the old testament writers were not encouraged to muse endlessly about passionate and there is zero evidence it was used as the principal factor in forming new but its this passionate love that were told to strive of feeling like been swept up in an exciting before publishing the gory details on or in a bestseller like eat pray authored by a woman who is embarking on her second divorce of the romantic era played a big part in elevating romantic and why its much more fun to get swept up in the excitement created by alpha male than it does to do arduous daily duties before you and god women were given the chance to pick between excitement or and we know what they have works of the romantic era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period the romantic period saw an increase in female authors and also female readers source modern era has doubled down on the notion of romantic love psychologist proposed the popular triangular theory of love which is often used today as defining the love ideal this theory has caused immense harm for stating that all three forms of love are needed in equal measure for a successful who takes an introductory psychology or who reads a pop psychology will be exposed to this and walk away thinking that passion is absolutely required in a relationship if its not the presumption is that the relationship is no longer consummate and far short of that romantic love and passion are necessary in a marriage makes it that much easier to exit out of because when a woman no longer feels she will walk away knowing that experts like would agree that the relationship degraded and was no longer worth saving and this is exactly what modern women are doing in droves they have shown an appalling disregard for their wedding especially upon realizing that they initiate of divorces and the rise of nationalism if nationalism came out of the romantic and passionate love was a does that mean nationalism is also a of romanticisms key ideas and most enduring legacies is the assertion of which became a central theme of romantic art and political philosophy from the earliest parts of the with their focus on development of national languages and and the importance of local customs and to the movements that

why you should become a minimalist why you should become a minimalist comments lifestyle the most abused word in the language is need if reading this i contend there is little that you actually need beyond what you currently possess you have ample electricity to power your computer in a with running water and food in your refrigerator do you always hear people talking about how they need more humans have a drive to compete with each and advertisers capitalize on this impulse take a moment to picture the average person that you meet what do they have to take pride buying the newest thing allows them to join the club of and for a fleeting moment to be measured on an equal playing field despite their personal shortcomings the internal pain of their problems dissipates for the split second they can boast superiority over everyone who have the same shiny widget this conspicuous consumption creates a in the broken system although borrowing money for useless luxury purchases subjugates people into debt the mentality is if i paid for this hunk of metal and working overtime to pay it it must be worth it and so are other things that the commercials are telling me to buy quite we are working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we need if reading this you are likely a male aged who wants to do one or more of the quit your explore a get yourself in take charge of a and learn valuable life skills a minimalist mentality helps you do all of these things having fewer possessions forces you to properly place a higher value on experiences this will make it safer and more fulfilling to travel because you are in touch with what truly makes you happy if working on a side hustle or starting a the desire for needless possessions drains your disposable income levels and prevents you from taking risks if my business will i have to give up my car preempt this loss aversion by having less to lose if you want to move to a better city with a higher cost of having excess stuff sets a floor on how much rent pay to house your and in turn how much you can spend on leisure activities if a person like removing visual noise from your area makes you more likely to create things with your and less likely to fixate on your environment throwing or giving useless things away is a good first since possessions have a psychic weight that you may not realize until you rid yourself of them to fully embrace this you must also kill the desires that have been inculcated in you since birth cut down on your consumer impressions by watching less and trying to rationally dissect the techniques used in the few advertisements you encounter find fulfillment in hobbies and rather than chasing the rush and eventual adaptation from consuming much like a successive bouts of consumerism create a higher baseline where your overall happiness is no but you end up having a bunch of useless crap that ties you down girls can also be troublesome in this endeavor ever notice that when a girl spends extended time in your living she beings to tell you that you need a new or a replacement a good friend once told me all human beings have an innate desire to create most women so they redecorate limit your exposure to women who attempt to thwart a separation from consumerism men likely to lead a lifestyle are simply more attractive to women think about whether the starving artist or the bottle service guy throwing money around ends up getting more ass as watch how women behave rather than listening to what they say when they are protesting your lifestyle change ask yourself if your house burned down and you had nothing but the clothes on your what would you be worth to society and to how would you feel about losing all of the possessions you most people plugged into the matrix would rather die than think about replacing aunt vase or baby pictures they looked at in a decade this is an illusion once you begin to divorce yourself from this emotional investment to stuff you will implicitly place more value on your skills and past experiences minimalism is not a synonym for frugality or cheapness i wear a potato sack while pedaling a used tricycle to work every day i simply choose to allocate my money to experiences a few that will fulfill me and advance my rather than enslave myself into debt for trinkets that will collect dust somewhere taking the red pill is about learning to separate your priorities and desires from those that society forces upon you i promise that adopting this mindset will make everybody but it will certainly help to clarify what contributes to your individual sense of and will allow you to focus on the internal and external traits that exemplify a man of value
written by the bombing campaign in eastern which has ended at least for the time has been described in press reports and as though it were unique in modern military history in its indiscriminateness in an usual move for a senior us secretary of state john called for an investigation of war crimes in the discussion has been lacking in historical however certainly the civilian death toll from the bombing and shelling in has been but many of the strikes may not be all that dissimilar from the major us bombing campaign in in nor as indiscriminate as recent campaigns in densely populated cities the impression that the bombing in was uniquely indiscriminate was a result of news reporting and commentary by that there are no real military targets in east but in front turned into the central hub of a massive system of conventional warfare in province in late when it sent an enormous convoy of at least vehicles with troops and weaponry into eastern a dramatic video shows what appears to be hundreds of vehicles full of troops and trucks with weapons mounted on them the command in has drones observing the routes in and out of so it certainly knew where many of those military sites were located opposition sources also revealed that began immediately to put the military assets at its disposal digging deep bunkers to protect military equipment and tunnels through which troops and weapons could be moved unseen the move underground explains the use of bombs for the first time in the war as the guardian reported of the think tank royal united service institute concluded that the have intelligence of the whereabouts of opposition mainly because bunker buster bombs are too expensive to use simply to destroy buildings at random but like fighters in in the command in has moved its weapons and command around in the tunnels that they have built so many of the and air strikes are almost certainly hitting targets that have already been abandoned and in other the wrong target has undoubtedly been hit the health a local monitoring estimated that civilians had been killed in the first three weeks of bombing in east the united nations put the death toll at drop the superiority act as terrible as that toll of civilian lives the united states should drop the stance of moral superiority when the us military invaded in it made no effort to keep track of how many civilians were killed in its bombing and artillery claiming it had no way to tell who was civilian and who was not and the best estimates of civilians killed in us and urban wars provide any basis for moral superiority a survey of hospitals by the times in may produced an estimate of at least civilians killed in the first five weeks of war the estimate included those who had died in ground fighting and from unexploded but even with those contributing factors subtracted from the it would still be far greater than those killed in the assault on east on a weekly basis the war on city in and the war on in were also far deadlier than the former killed according to an investigation by the human rights the latter killed according to the office of coordination of humanitarian affairs attacks on hospitals the one feature of the air offensive on east that seems most clearly to violate the laws of war is the targeting of hospitals media accounts have referred to air strikes with barrel bombs that have hit two major hospitals in the part of the city the government has been acting as though it regards the hospitals in eastern as serving the front and the which are under intense pressure from the militants who run that part of have fed the governments suspicions as a detailed report by doctors without borders on the air strikes that hit the hospital on the local that created a new system of hospitals in decided not to declare the hospitals openly but to keep them underground meaning secret from the government in of the government knows perfectly well where all hospitals in east are located the air strike that damaged the hospital shows how the government has responded it began with an air strike that destroyed a building across the street from the hospital the building was a but former residents of east who have gotten out have confirmed that associated with the command have located their offices in schools to try to hide their staff within a few minutes of the initial according to the hospital staff were pulling survivors out of the rubble and taking them across the street to the emergency whereupon the air force dropped a barrel bomb at the entrance to the emergency killing several of the hospital including one doctor then it dropped one close enough to the side of the hospital to hit the emergency room minutes hit a building down the block where hospital staff were staying such attacks on those who try to save the lives of survivors of bombing attacks sometimes called double tap attacks are rightly condemned as violations of humanitarian law and the belief that the staff at the hospital are operating in effect as medics for the military does not justify attacking it and the wounded sheltered there but such violations of the laws of war are hardly unique to or hardly unique us drone strikes in have hit rescuers or mourners after hitting their initial targets in numerous documented cases in the the military argued that fighters were using hospitals to hide from but offered no valid evidence to support as the report showed in the completely destroyed the hospital in an air strike recorded for public release after claiming falsely that it had been fired on by gunmen in its wars in and in the has gone well beyond the and campaign in refusing to any distinction between civilian targets it not

the federal security service and director of the foreign intelligence service recent parliamentary elections by and a dress rehearsal for the more important presidential elections coming up in between now and members of the political establishment will be able to try on new experiment with new campaign and determine who will play a starring role within the inner circle the central consideration is how to consolidate power in a way that balances the interests of the government and the get an inside look at current political direct sat down with of the center according to the parliamentary elections provide a preview of what to expect in and to what extent were the parliamentary elections fair and in your in they were juridically legitimate because they were conducted in accordance with law the degree of the not juridical legitimacy is a debatable question because of the low it means that the representation of citizens in the parliament became even less than previously about of the population voted at the elections though the united ruling party garnered four million fewer votes than during the it received more seats in the parliament in liberal politicians are not included in the parliament at all the legitimacy of the elections is a matter of these elections were fair in the polling stations with to a large extent they were honest in the in which the central election commission controlled the electoral process in cooperation with observers a lesser these elections were fair and transparent in the distant regions or in the words of prominent political expert zones of peculiar electoral which saw an abnormally high electoral turnout i for the republic of in southern the north region etc regions were controlled by the central election commission to a much lesser extent no wonder that people were compelled to vote in accordance with the orders of local authorities the violations in these regions were likely to be common associate and chair of the domestic politics and political institutions program at the center press photo does central election commission have any tools to influence voting in the distant there are some but local authorities limit and restrict them i think the administration of the president hampered the work of the central election commission she tried to balance the interests of president and the interests of the civil society is the position and it is very difficult she just tried to take into account all positions and signals that were coming from the regions during the electoral campaign and could not ignore them there were so many of these signals that she objectively and physically could not control the throughout the in the distant regions what kinds of violations took place during the if violations took even though they were not like previously during the elections these violations included the use of administrative resources for rigged and fabricated stuffing the ballot and dirty political techniques against the liberal and communist parties during the political campaign and before election day was also orchestrated when students and governmental employees were ordered to vote this also should be taken into account all these violations took place not only in distant but also in those under the steady control of the central election why did the united party win despite its declining popularity throughout the fact the united won the majority in the state and the popularity are basically different things its popularity has been decreasing indeed it is one reality but it prevent the party from winning most of the seats that is the other reality citizens see the party as a body that deals with the problems of the population the credibility and approval rankings of almost all governmental except law enforcement agencies and the president are dropping and united is not the because people perceive it not as a but as a kind of a governmental body its rating will keep going but step by step if you vote for united it means a symbolic a sort of political ritual if you are and go to the polling you are likely to vote for united because it is necessary this is the very logic and motivation that drive average voters to elect united though some people preferred not to vote for the ruling they voted for the current because there were no real they voted either for one of the three systemic parliamentary parties or the spoiler which aimed at distracting the attention of voters and preventing the opposition from gaining parliamentary seats why did the opposition fail and what is its key the reason why they failed can be traced back to the personal ambitions of the opposition leaders they team up and compete with each other in they have different in fact i mean liberals and liberals always agree this does after all these leaders have enough political heft most of them cannot be considered powerful and influential political figures problem is that the authoritarian regime in will prevent the emergence of new powerful liberal forces in if such a party emerges and poses a serious challenge to the authorities like opposition leader it will be either destroyed or discredited and marginalized in such a it is very difficult to come up with a pragmatic solution this years parliamentary elections proved that the only political democratic force on a scale of a whole country is the party and its leader no matter how you view them it is losing popularity year after but this party remains firmly within the political landscape and if the opposition is able to persuade voters that brings together different representatives of

and the nations such as are using the migration issue to challenge the power and competences of the in the name of national sovereignty at the same the refugee wave has become a geopolitical dilemma between and the a refugee looks at riot police from the side of the fence built by authorities at the border between and in the referendum in on the migration issue in early combined with the death of a policeman at the door of a far right activist at the end of the same have once again highlighted the importance of the migration issue for there are two distinct aspects of this issue relationship with and with and it is clear that there is quite a disconnect between the went to the polls on to give their opinion on a referendum question that each political side interpreted in its own way the turnout remained well below the necessary percent of all valid although percent of voters more than three million people said they wanted the parliament to have a decisive say about any future redistribution of inside the referendum and its campaign had two separate goals the ruling party had to test the loyalty of their political thus they tried to redefine classical political fault lines and checked on the unity of the opposition prime minister used this occasion to bring forward his arguments about reshaping the competences of the especially the commission referendum question has been thoroughly debated ever since it was as it reflects both of the above goals the question you want the union to be able to order the mandatory settlement of citizens in without parliaments political and civil groups were enabled by the ambiguous wording of the question to focus on significantly different interpretations neither the constitutional court nor the national election committee declared the question despite the fact that it raised concerns among experts the constitutional rules within most member states declare that no national referendum should be held on issues already regulated by international a way of getting around this the government later claimed that the referendum did not concern the decisions of mandatory quotas already decided at the level of the council it would only concern future possible the competency of the the council is required to give the final word in any such case of distribution of resettlement or relocation among member in any case where has a way to raise its own voice or to build a blocking coalition the government decided to go against the quota system after the councils decisions of last autumn and went to the court in to dispute the legality of the measure was the final point where the government turned the migration crisis into a sovereignty question it had started in the official government rhetoric already after the attacks on but the referendum question undoubtedly raised the stakes of the debate it is not anymore about whether migrants or refugees should be welcomed or the opinion of the government focuses on the competence of the institutions whether they in enforce decisions on member position is openly on the side that the quota system violates the sovereignty of member states and unnecessarily forces a instead of paying attention to securing the external borders of the area this has been the argument already since last when hundreds of thousands of refugees crossed the country and the route towards the borders must be because if member states start the redistribution the political pressure for a sustainable solution at the border protection level would dissipate and would be left with an influx of uncontrolled deal seriously decreased the number of arriving in the though the route remains open and is under growing pressure again have not seen masses of migrants since last when the government sealed the southern borders with a fence despite this the government continued to communicate a permanent threat of uncontrolled migrants throughout the why migration represents a new

of not resistant to strong government messages that but the invalid referendum gave proof that the will of the government is not enough in itself to completely reshape the perception of the electorate while xenophobia has risen to a new high in the it is still not the general attitude of the average voter live in their own facing economic hurdles and caring about how to make a living in a country where the average salary is about half of the minimum wage in government campaign focused largely on classic media public and television and radio leaflets in the mailbox it was significantly weaker

leave a reply frank m wanderer while it has been proven that vital signs are influenced by the occurrence within the dream and that our bodies respond in some ways to what were witnessing allow me to draw your attention to an apparently surprising thing if i told you that when you are reading these you are in fact you would certainly believe that i have gone mad you are awake you are concentrating your attention to and you are aware of your environment as well you can see the furniture of your you can hear the call of the birds from the nearby forest you are also aware of your thoughts and emotions how can anyone claim that you are asleep at this very you just like everyone else sleeps at night sometimes you see dreams while you but right now it is you are awake so how could you see you imagine a whole world around yourself i believe that you do not only sleep at but also during the daytime i believe that in your present state of your greatest illusion is that you think you are awake i believe that in your present your greatest illusion is when you think that you are alert what i see is that in your present state of consciousness you are and at present you are and what you see and hear are all parts of your dream your nighttime sleep is only different from your daytime sleep in that in the night your dreams are less active during the you imagine a whole world around and you play an active role in that dream your personal history takes place in that and identifying with that world shapes your personal identity at you are dreaming that as a part of your personal history you are reading these lines while identifying with the role of the spiritual and you are outraged by what you are actually reading the question may why do i claim that you are asleep and dreaming from the state of consciousness i call i can see that you are you believe yourself to be a separate you are a captive of the works of your mind you are not present what is the evidence for me to say that you are now asleep as a citizen of a you are dreaming that you are it is because you are not present to be present means that you are fully and conscious in the present moment whatever you you do that fully you focus your entire attention on that particular activity do you feel free to declare that you are present in every moment of your what does it mean to be it has happened to all of us that we have come under the spell of a at some time during our life a beautiful a a beautiful piece of the rhythm of music enchanted us it may even happen that we are just lost in the silence of a peaceful moment the identification with the forms and shapes loosens a little bit for a short and in that we may experience an entirely different state of consciousness you live in a separate world how deep you sleep may depend on how realistic you find your how much you identify with your identity embedded in your personal history the less alert you and the deeper you submerge into your dreams the more solitary and individualistic you will become every sleeper including you has a separate only those who exist in the state of conscious alertness true lucid have a shared reality all those different and separate worlds are created by the which generates the state of the which appears as the focus of our identification with our thoughts and emotions thus everybody has a separate personal individual world view and methods of action sometimes suffering alarms you from your but then you hasten to return to and start a new a new objective in new ambition that confirms your connection with your rooted in your personal history the reasons of your sleep the reason of you sleeping is that you are not only awake only one dimension of alertness is present in you although you are able to focus your attention on your internal emotions and your in your present state of consciousness you are still powerfully identified with your mind and its functions you are therefore drifting on the stormy ocean of your thoughts and emotions day by and the space necessary for the emergence of a contemplating witness is missing from you you still identify with your thoughts and emotions these generate the dreams of the mind in which you live as a separate and try to find the ways of safely navigating your life on the stormy sea longing for freedom in this separate state of the lack of alertness may appear as a desire for freedom this desire emerges from your real as your mind remembers its origins this atavistic memory of the ancient past is the quiet attraction that will eventually take you back to silence this deep desire will only cease if you become alert that you will not be awake but also alert then the consciousness awakens to its own existence in the human form you at present call yourself only giving up the struggle with the thoughts and emotions and the recognition of the futility of insisting on them will bring you the real the freedom of independence of the functions of the mind the awakened consciousness the world of internal silence are all beyond the functions of the mind if you wish to reach beyond the identification with your thoughts and if you

from the university of and day after department comes this climate disaster movie plot wherein global climate cause the polar jet stream to go wacky and freeze us extra good in winter really no mention of what caused similar weather during the little ice age between roughly ad and except that they are sure they ruled out now the movie plot from as named jack hall is in he discovers that a huge ice sheet has sheared off but what he does not know is that this event will trigger a massive climate shift that will affect the world population his son is with friends in new to attend an event there they discover that it has been raining for the past and after a series of disasters begin to occur over the everybody realizes the world is entering a new ice age and the world population begins trying to evacuate to the warmer climates of the south jack makes a daring attempt to rescue his son and his friends who are stuck in new and who have managed to survive not only a massive wave but also freezing cold temperatures that could possibly kill them the paper press release via they even have a scientist named extreme cold winters fueled by jet stream and climate scientists agree for first time that climate change may be intensifying the effects of the jet stream causing extreme cold weather in the and us study could improve forecasting of winter weather in most populous parts of the world more accurate forecasting could help businesses and economies prepare for severe weather and make life and decisions scientists have agreed for the first time that recent severe cold winter weather in the and us may have been influenced by climate change in the according to a new study the carried out by an international team of scientists including the university of has found that warming in the arctic may be intensifying the effects of the jet stream which in the winter can cause extreme cold weather such as the winter of which saw record snowfall levels in new scientists previously had two schools of thought one group believe that natural variability in the jet stream position has caused the recent severe cold winter weather seen in places such as the eastern united states and the the other camp includes scientists who are finding possible connections between the warming of the arctic such as melting sea warming air and rising sea surface temperatures and the emerging pattern of severe cold winter weather professor and hall from the university department of together with professor e overland from the us oceanographic and atmospheric administration have brought together a diverse group of researchers from both sides of the debate the researchers have found that the recent pattern of cold winters is primarily caused by natural changes to the jet stream position the warming of the arctic appears to be exerting an influence on cold but the location of these can vary from year to year previous studies have shown that when the jet stream is wavy there are more episodes of severe cold weather plunging south from the arctic into the which persist for weeks at a time but when the jet stream is flowing strongly from west to east and not very we tend to see more normal winter weather in countries within the always had years with wavy and not so wavy jet stream but in the last one to two decades the warming arctic could well have been amplifying the effects of the wavy professor said he may have contributed to some recent extreme cold winter spells along the eastern seaboard of the united in eastern and at times over the and our ability to predict how climate change is affecting the jet stream will help to improve our prediction of winter weather in some of the most highly populated regions of the world would be hugely beneficial for and entire economies in the northern hemisphere the public could better prepare for severe winter weather and have access to extra crucial information that could help make and the nonlinear response of weather to the changing is published today in the journal nature climate change on the research was partly sponsored by the international arctic science committee and the climate and project of the world climate research it further cements the university position at the forefront of climate change research and gives geography students at access to the latest innovations in environmental science in other variations mostly account for the cold but global warming causes cold global warming stopped years and is itself a natural variation over the long term humanity better face the global climate is and ice ages happen regularly the gulf stream would probably be a better phenomenon to analyze in this fire and the day after tomorrow

mar the white house has portrayed the commodities market trading that netted first lady almost in a period as a case of an ordinary small investor who took her chances and came up a winner with shrewd judgment and a little guidance from an experienced friend but experts and officials in the volatile futures trading industry said that what she did would be highly unusual for the average small investor to pull off successfully and many commodities trading firms would never have allowed such an investor to try it for one the experts her activities involved exposure to possible losses in the unpredictable market for farm commodities futures that substantially exceeded the available that potentially could have been greater than her family net worth if the market had turned sharply against her commodities specialists an inexperienced investor with such limited assets would not be allowed to run the risks did unless she had the backing perhaps financial guarantees wealthy backer at the time she made her huge starting with an initial capital investment of just bill was a rising political star in but he and his wife had only modest assets they did not even own their own home yet took surprisingly large positions in cattle earning profits as high as had the market moved the other she could have lost huge amounts virtually according to market specialists the white house has insisted that risked her own made all decisions herself about when to buy and sell and bore full responsibility for any losses they have said that she got advice from prominent lawyer b but also consulted other advisers and studied the market through the wall street journal futures market analysts and officials who have examined the records of her question whether a responsible broker would have allowed her to trade the way she did without some kind of financial protection one commodity trader with experience who reviewed the records of market activity said that her account is highly both in the frequency and size of trades and in the small amount of capital behind them no way in the world that should have been trading contracts that million pounds of beef the risk posture is just not consistent with income and net said this who works for one of the nation biggest brokerage houses would not let either one of them trade commodities in the late we required a couple hundred thousand dollars in liquid net worth before we let them in the door to trade commodities this is not for the faint of the broker said another commodities tiger of smith described the first lady successful

small stake into with savvy trading in the booming market in cattle futures but one transaction caught his and a number of other the very first trade in when her account balance went from her initial investment to in one day there is no documentation for what was traded at what but some brokers said that she could not possibly have had enough in her account to cover the large position in cattle futures that she would have had to take to make that much profit that quickly there are holes in these records said john president of the futures industry assn and a former official in the administration who examined the trading records show the original and next day how does that would margin the cattle position on that necessary to create the profit on the next day maybe there was

polar hexagon changes color from to it like nothing we seen on any other planet in the entire and now the mysterious structure on north pole just got even weirder in just four hexagon has changed its from blue to gold so our best guess as to why this change occurred is that this is what it looks like when north pole gears up for next year summer solstice discovered almost years hexagon is a structure that spans roughly km in and extends about km down into the planet dense atmosphere as observed by voyager and each point of the hexagon appears to rotate at its at nearly the same rate that rotates on its axis along the rim of the a jet stream of air is blasting eastward at speeds of based on its size and scientists have concluded that it a vast cloud pattern generated by a perpetual hurricane spinning at the of the planet north pole scientists estimate that this storm has been raging for decades maybe even centuries while we pretty confident that we know what hexagon the big mystery is how it got there in the first place once you have a giant whirlpool of it relatively easy to keep it spinning but the force you need to get it wound up in the first place is a whole lot more difficult to explain have bandied about a number of explanations for the hexagon says q from water swirling inside a bucket can generate whirlpools possessing holes with geometric shapes there is of course no giant bucket on holding this gargantuan now we got something else to explain how the spacecraft could have observed two completely different in the hexagon between and here more of the false the best hypothesis we have right now is that this is what it looks like when changes seasons with a year that lasts earth changes seasons only once every seven and the increased sunlight over the past three years could explain the golden haze as change is thought to be an effect of seasons in the change from a bluish to a more golden hue may be due to the increased production of photochemical hazes in the atmosphere as the north pole approaches summer solstice in may so how does this it thought that the hexagon acts sort of like a preventing haze or aerosol particles produced on the outside from getting in this is evidenced by the fact that when scientists the hexagon in false seen in the they noticed differences in the types of particles that were being suspended in the atmosphere both inside and outside the hexagon the there are fewer large haze particles and a concentration of small haze while outside the the opposite is a imaging team associate at explained back in hexagonal jet stream is acting like a which results in something like earth antarctic ozone during the polar winter between and august north polar atmosphere became clear of aerosols produced by photochemical reactions reactions caused by sunlight interacting with the atmosphere and we got to see its hexagon in clear science true color photo taken but since reached its equinox in august the point where the sun is directly over equator it been gradually exposed to more and more sunlight this means for the past three aerosols have been produced inside of the hexagon and around the north making the polar atmosphere appear hazy and golden when photographed last month without more evidence this is just an educated guess and scientists at now have an investigation underway to figure out what actually going on here including changes in atmospheric could also be playing a explained this week think seasonally shifting patterns of solar heating probably influence the winds in the polar is continuing its orbits around and its and in the coming months so get ready to see more strange images of their seasonal shifts
from university why does our planet experience an ice age every deep storage of carbon dioxide in the oceans may have triggered this unexplained new research shows and from and correlated to the temperature anomaly inferred from the deuterium concentration in ice cores from dome et the main orbital tectonic and oceanic events are indicated the text for the references of each the orange box represents the start of the onset of the northern hemisphere glaciations and correspond to the cycles period this period changed from to during the transition toward ma click to enlarge experts from university have offered up an explanation as to why our planet began to move in and out of ice ages every years this mysterious dubbed the year has been occurring for the past million years or so and leads to vast ice sheets covering north and up until scientists have been unable to explain why this happens our planet ice ages used to occur at intervals of every which made sense to scientists as the earth seasons vary in a predictable with colder summers occurring at these intervals however there was a about a million years called the in which the ice age intervals changed from every years to every years new research published today in the journal geology has suggested the oceans may be responsible for this specifically in the way that they suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere by studying the chemical of tiny fossils on the ocean the team discovered that there was more stored in the deep ocean during the ice age periods at regular intervals every years this suggests that extra carbon dioxide was being pulled from the atmosphere and into the oceans at this subsequently lowering the temperature on earth and enabling vast ice sheets to engulf the northern hemisphere lead author of the research professor from the school of earth and ocean can think of the oceans as inhaling and exhaling carbon so when the ice sheets are the oceans have inhaled carbon dioxide from the making the planet colder when the ice sheets are the oceans have exhaled carbon so there is more in the atmosphere which makes the planet warmer looking at the fossils of tiny creatures on the ocean we showed that when ice sheets were advancing and retreating every years the oceans were inhaling more carbon dioxide in the cold suggesting that there was less left in the marine algae play a key role in removing from the atmosphere as it is an essential ingredient of photosynthesis is put back into the atmosphere when deep ocean water rises to the surface through a process called but when a vast amount of sea ice is present this prevents the from being which could make the ice sheets bigger and prolong the ice age we think of the oceans inhaling and exhaling carbon the presence of vast amounts of ice is like a giant it like a lid on the surface of the prof continued the earth climate is currently in a warm spell between glacial periods the last ice age ended about years ago since temperatures and sea levels have and ice caps have retreated back to the poles in addition to these natural carbon emissions are also having an effect by warming the climate
president holds news conference at the white house as an someone raised to believe truth and justice will i am appalled at the foreign and domestic policies of my country government the level and

leading authority on the technique that could help officials identify more distant relatives and track down criminals who are in the he said technology is demonstrable said pioneered the use of familial for crime solving more than a decade ago in one of the earliest detectives reopened the killing of a woman in wales and compared from the assailant to genetic profiles in database of known offenders in they got a partial match to a boy the teen was alive at the time of the but detectives used the clue to focus on his who eventually pleaded guilty to the murder despite that conviction and the technology took some time to catch on in the and was used only sporadically among its earliest uses was the arrest of the serial which came after officials subpoenaed a tissue sample from his daughter pap smear taken at a medical clinic times a familial test led to the arrest of l shown making a court appearance via video in the torture and serial murder case in by an impassioned debate on the technology was percolating at the capitol in gov jerry brown then the state attorney general began fielding letters and visits from urging him to consider using familial his were concerned approving the method might cause federal judges to shut down the whole database on constitutional grounds in brown enacted a comprehensive familial policy making the first state in the country to do so under the familial is only to be used as a when all other investigative angles have been exhausted so the state department of justice has run familial many of them repeat such as in the grim

but the growing popularity of the technique has raised alarms for some privacy such as chief attorney for the forensic division of the office of the public defender mercer successfully lobbied for his state formal ban on familial searches is the only other jurisdiction to prohibit them outright searching for relatives through partial matches is he and raises concerns about the amendment prohibition

posy view of a heavily damaged neighborhood in which had been by a series of coalition the hypocritical western heart beats for all except those the us empire drowns in blood almost everybody is under siege to a greater or lesser observes the most think the only siege in is the one imposed on by and forces but siege as a form of warfare is hardly uniquely embraced by the army and military on the the united states and its allies have been practicing siege warfare in the and beyond for and continue to do so it just that siege warfare has been concealed behind even labels while the siege warfare of countries is hostile is abominated by western state officials crying crocodile tears here how the deception sieges of cities controlled by carried out by us forces and their are called rescue or campaigns to liberate or retake sieges other sieges the ones carried out by affiliate in formerly call for convenience are ignored altogether might suggest something about the relationship of affiliate to the united and a particularly injurious form of siege economic sanctions is presented as a separate category altogether and not siege warfare at all but imposed by rich countries such as the united states and those of the on poor such as are a modern form of and have been called sanctions of mass in recognition of their devastating character in the the sieges which are identified as such by western state officials and in by the western mass are sieges of cities controlled by carried out by forces and their allies these sieges which cause kill and destroy buildings are denounced in the west as ferocious attacks on innocents which amount to war crimes bombardment backing the siege of by government notes the wall street journal created a humanitarian a security council by called for an end to bombing of foreign minister has mused openly about war crimes indictments against and yet us campaigns to drive state out of and and now have also caused killed and destroyed buildings unlike the siege of east these campaigns have been celebrated as great and necessary military but created vast humanitarian crises observes that the of like and scarcely have happened without the coalition air umbrella that the cities liberated by forces and their us patron were bombed into even though civilians were trapped inside ground forces only moved in after these cities were left in ruins by coalition and artillery as mopping up forces market in destroyed by us coalition writing in the intercept points out that ground forces laid siege to a city in northern not far from that is home to tens of thousands of civilians pounded the city over the killing up to civilians in a single attack the replicated this strategy to drive out of and leaving behind flattened to

off aid groups estimate that as many as a million people could be displaced by fighting to recapture the creating a daunting humanitarian task that the united nations and other organizations say they are not yet ready to deal writer and journalist cook commented on the utter hypocrisy of westerners who condemn the campaign to liberate east from fighters while celebrating the campaign to do the same in targeting the the guardian beloved by cook contrasted two reports which appeared in the newspaper to illustrate the western heart beating for all except those the us empire drowns in blood report the guardian provides supportive coverage of the beginning of a assault by backed by the us and on to win it back from the of an assault that will inevitably lead to massive casualties and

waging a assault on to win it back from the of and an assault that has led to massive casualties and humanitarian suffering among the civilian population members of the derived central to western propaganda is the elision of the character of the militants who tyrannize east this is accomplished by labeling them while the who tyrannize the cities the united states and its allies besiege are called or fighters the aim is to conjure the impression that sieges are directed at and therefore are justifiable despite the humanitarian crises they while the campaign in east is directed at presumably or secular and therefore is illegitimate this is part of a broader us propaganda campaign to create two classes of and bad ones the first the good comprises and fighters cooperating with

more than a few feel that as long as they can provide and basic medical needs for themselves and their nothing more is required other may feel that self power and machine repair are skills that will be required in the post crisis world many and also tend to ignore or underestimate the need to have a computer that can be used to help make it easier to survive in all these are also the people most likely to have serious problems in the post crisis world because they do not have a computer available to help meet a range of goals computers and prepping can get along a computer cannot hunt a deer for boil or make a pair of obviously on the other any computer with a connection to the can help you find out how to do these things and much more when you find good it is also very easy to store those files on your computer so that you can read them and work with them whenever you want and if you are in a situation where access is still you can use your computer to contact friends and loved ones as well as people that might be able to help you get through a crisis then you can certainly relate to the quandary of many that are finding out it is becoming impossible to make or obtain raw materials that would be needed in a major crisis scenario on the other side of the many of the items you need for basic prepping can still be purchased all you really need is a prepaid debit card and an connection so that you can find websites where you can place your orders not only will you be able to get the supplies you you will also have a much wider selection of other goods to choose from regardless of whether you are interested in the best quality gun cleaning need a certain type of fishing or need good quality vintage hand you can find them all in even if you are you may be able to find customized materials and tools that have been modified to meet your needs most people realize just how important it is to network with from diverse geographic regions and make plans for bugging out that include those friends and connections consider what would happen if an earthquake or hurricane strikes your area if you only have friends and family in a or small chances are everyone will be affected if you have friends in other states that might be able to offer temporary shelter or help you make a new then you will be well ahead of the game in these times and both money and barter systems are vital for exchanging needed goods and services a computer is very important for expanding your trade and marketing options it is also very important for securing alternative currencies that may play a vital role in remaining solvent in the face of currency collapse most people would be truly amazed at how easy it is for the average consumer to secure foreign keep a good supply of and even use them as down and dirty form of currency trading or flipping the tough choice on the best obsolete devices may still be very useful because certain older technologies are easier to work with and may be safer than newer devices that are routinely or are based on unstable hardware platforms if you are interested in newer here are some and models that you can start off with for each category of desktops if you are primarily interested in a conventional desktop my own experience leads me to believe the best option is to build the computer yourself so that you know exactly what parts are being used and how best to optimize the is where you can determine how fast the computer will whether or not the system can boot from a and other aspects of basic settings since modern computer chips tend to run it is very important to provide plenty of ventilation and cooling options inside the case if your and motherboard kit come with heat conducting do not hesitate to find the best on the market it is also very useful to add extra fans and other cooling devices right inside the case always the cooler you can keep the chips during the lower your chances of erratic or even ruining the chips insofar as other vital parts such as hard and video it truly depends on your personal tastes you will need a dedicated video card to gain access to these specialized chips that will reduce wear on the and enhance computer performance at the same time be sure to study gamer forums and video editing forums to find out which video cards work best with specific and motherboard combinations a bad fit between these parts can truly be a disaster memory cards are yet another yet vital area of the computer that you will need to think about this is also one area where only the best will do it is better to go with the fastest cards that the motherboard will and also from the best rated vendor laptops unlike desktop you will have far less control over what parts are found inside the case before purchasing a be sure to find out the model number of the and motherboard from you will need to look up the to find out what the optimal clock speeds are i have seen more than one laptop burn up at around the year mark because a mother board with a slower timing chip was paired with a faster since most buyers do not ask about the motherboard there was no way for them to find out that they basically had an system that was going to fail very quickly i can safely say that i recommend spending times as much money on a laptop when i can choose

escaped the enterprise world and now works as a consultant for when was wrapping up his senior year of he hunted around for a job that would hire an undergrad on flexible hours he knew that the kinds of companies that tended to hire on those terms could often have creative but college about to pay for itself he found a small shop that needed an extra hand extremely there was only one other was prepared to enter a tiny shop with no real practices or because with only one you expect a lot of rules and bureaucracy was only one but he was able to create enough and downright mysterious bureaucratic policies and procedures for fifty developers reading the was closer to reading a but not a good novel where there was a clear point and narrative but something meandering and like a book just opinionated about style he also had opinions on the proper use of source control are absolutely vital for separating units of work explanation came after was stunned by the sheer number of there were hundreds of branches in the repository you have to be intimidated by this we can start you just do this small change in the main then ill show you how to release it dutifully checked out master made the and committed it he sent a pull request you used the wrong branch back out your and put it in the main one which branch is the main its not master it used to but we really use master anymore use master as it turned the main branch was usually whichever branch touched last there were five or six different branches that could be the main branch at any given time maybe it was very hard for to be certain made the changes in master but that was only the start of the nightmare those changes had to be merged into the correct branch for deployment this is pretty do you want me to walk you through asked said and so sat down next to and started explaining each step that needed to perform these explanations started with pressing his fingers against monitor and click fire up the not the this branch the instructional process was recorded as a smear of fingerprints on screen changes merged outward from the main branch main happened to be that instead of merging back towards a trunk of changes were made to the and then percolated according to own twisted logic you he gotta different and some of them depend on a different version of our framework lib this main version builds against version of the framework but your framework up to version like for years but this change only goes out to the so you need to merge from main to master then to then to perky peregrine need to resolve conflicts ground his teeth hard enough to make diamonds between and fought his way through the merge conflicts a few hours one line change was merged into a releasable but had no idea how that change would migrate to any other if it ever did next assignment was to make a change to the same and since it was a larger he made a feature branch off of perky peregrine do the changes then merge right back into perky peregrine after the work was done then he could propagate the changes back to the current main this resulted in an angry visit from are you trying to mess this demanded there is a system there are policies did you even read the development guide i gave feature branches are but they have to come off the main not one of the dependent had tried valiantly to read but failed i was just going to do the merge into perky peregrine and then delete the why does it merge back shrieked delete the branches merge backwards only outwards like a tree each feature branch is supposed to be an entirely new line of development have you even used source something snapped in the back of because for a terrifying that almost made sense had been puzzling over the bizarre state of their source control and those words from put understanding it within tantalizing reach if he asked a few more he might just see the method to this madness chose the wiser path he he he complied with and moved on to the next weeks after cutting through the shrubbery that was branching system the next feature was to make a change that only impacted users of the latest version of the base framework the current main branch was back on version so needed to start by making a branch from there then he had to bring it up to version then convert a few of the into a new then finish the upgrade to this was about two weeks of hair pulling frustration then he could make his changes he spent that week asking serious questions about the career path he was on finally he could merge his changes into the actual release but never back into any master branch this resulted in tens of thousands of merge conflicts the next few weeks were spent cutting through and by the end of that discovered the semester was nearly over he was about to graduate he went to the of the small and handed in his resignation been really impressed by your she said you could stay on after if you like her tone was perhaps even a little but there was a plea in her eyes vaguely recalled hearing that was a friend of the other saw a hint that knew what was doing to their software product maybe she thought could be her ally in fixing it or maybe was reading too much into it discretion was the better part of valor i just think the right fit for this he said they made the polite she promised him a recommendation they

four triangle cases were reported to the mutual network international desk in recent months from new and a witness at recalled an incident from march when he and his wife were sitting in the living room of their apartment at rue la wife sat under a side window of the room from where you can see the rue the witness was already dark outside and there were nearly no cars in that road anymore there is anyway not much traffic in that road it was very silent outside and inside we had no light switched on as we were watching it is impossible that this is any reflection from the inside then i turned around to talk to my wife and i saw a huge triangle with three lights under each witness described the was approximately meters wide and maybe meters high the edges were rounded and there were no windows or anything to see maybe there was something on the but that was not visible from that angle the object was maybe meters or lower from west to following the witness was able to watch the object for between and speed was very but i cannot tell how fast it was it seemed to me like it was searching something like a police but it was sure no helicopter i am a drone pilot myself and i know how a helicopter flies and that it has to make a lot of sound when flying so low surface was black matte without any symbols or markings as far as i have seen witness submitted one illustration with the next week i have searched in for a triangle and it looks nearly exactly like the one described in the wave from but without the red light in the middle my wife asked me what was but before i could answer the object was gone she was making jokes of me so i talk to anybody about that until now but i am nearly sure that someone else must have seen it please let me know if there are other reports so i know i am not international team member closed this case as an new witness at recalled a event from when a about feet long moved overhead on could see the struts quite the witness was the shape of electrical pylons on its side as it passed over there was no noise i could see part of blue light upfront and two light blue lights at the new witness said the triangle had blue lights new witness explained his lived on cashmere hills quite high up after viewing this object for about i asked my wife to get the video camera i filmed it for minutes it somehow turned into a circular light jumping all over the object the moved toward the the craft passed it was a huge triangle shape with light blue discs on the rear and front there was no witness stated that he was later visited by three men in suits and questioned about the images or videos were included with the national director and star team member roger is witness at reported being overcome with fear after watching move to the ground level at on august the witness was at his kitchen table when the lights on the objects caught his witness at reported being overcome with fear after watching move to the ground level formed a the witness was a light at the corner of each of them forming a triangle these triangles that were formed were big the and what had appeared they were doing scared me they were came down to the ground and appeared to be doing something they were there for some witness watched for about stopped watching them and closed the curtains i felt that if i continued to watch that they would sense my presence even perhaps pick up on what i was thinking at first i thought that a couple of took a wrong turn and had to turn around on our property as i kept watching i soon realized i was wrong i was stricken with fear and panic as i had watched what they were doing i tried to calm myself i was so worried that they would sense my presence being so field investigator peter derrick is witness at reported watching a triangle emitting an red light that quickly disappeared about on witness said the low flying triangle shone blue light on the area below is in southwestern was awake studying for my post the witness did what i used to do every night i went out in front of the house and stood right beside the dry river that is just in front of the house that is when it happened i saw a red light in distance it came closer and closer i still get goosebumps when i think about it i move at all i mean i was just like a statue staring at that thing i am usually very brave compared to my friends and but that was the most frightening event of my witness said the object was emitting then started scattering a red light over the area i mean everywhere was red after a it came up and just disappeared in a second i the way it disappeared was even like blinking i have never said this to anyone because i think it will probably sound crazy i know what to who to tell i just found this site and reported what happened i also never went back to that spot for smoking just writing about it here made me feel better already thank international is remember that most sightings can be explained as something natural or the above quotes were edited for clarity please report activity to open minds black man made anti gravity craft is this the new footage of alleged triangle surfaces secret space craft

if the ego had an its fuel would be fear trepidation all but it certainly has its time and place fear can render us quivering and or motivate us toward change in the study of we learn how to not only overcome our but to become fearless this is called the lions roar of the lion is the living embodiment of power this animal has dominion over all he sees as well as the and might to attain all he desires his deportment is regal and never bullying and neither shrinking the metaphor of the lion is used to describe how one overcomes fear in the a collection of middle length discourses on and they are immaculate at describing the fears most of us face many teachers describe how to become regal and fearless in their discourses as well fear of the loss of life says that fear of the loss of body is usually what we must overcome first following an internal consciousness becomes aware that we are threatening the notion of being merely and we think we are frightened says we look any further than the bodily sensations that arise when we simply ponder fearfulness an empty feeling in the lower abdomen there is an immobility at the base of the and our breathing becomes restricted if we were to remove these fear becomes a meaningless thing attests that according to we aim to keep a lower abdomen full of power the breathing always the heart beat and the muscles of the whole body resilient so that if emotions like fear they can easily be encountered and dismissed fear of the loss of self some fear is even such as when we realize we must face a spiritual death in order to progress on our path although we may long to richer higher levels of we always so keen to let go of the habits and crutches that have propped up our current level of awareness as the poet once said no one will find his way to the court of magnificence until he is annihilated other types of fear make us meek and fallible our consciousness easily and we cannot attain mu or a state of let alone get on with our daily activities it is only by cultivating the states of mind that we can fill our abdomens with power and roar like a lion with fearlessness states of mind or beginners mind is the first stage in cultivating fearlessness think of a time when you were and eager to start a new endeavor there might have been but you were brimming with glee over trying something new this is the type of mind we want to cultivate with all aspects of life instead of begin nervous or we can aim to be eager and accepting all that comes our way in order to approach life from the beginners mind we need to let of preconceived and be optimistic if been able to have this feeling with one thing done in you can translate that feeling to other areas also means you have an immovable mind it mean you are but does translate to being determined in the face of obstacles does a lion run away from present hardly the animal get angry or judgmental about obstacles either he is peaceful like the eye of the storm until he is upon his prey if you can develop when you are under you will be unstoppable in life or without mind this is a similar philosophy to the taoist idea of when we are in the zone working on a great masterpiece or doing something we likely already experienced the state of when we are empty of yet moving and acting purely in the present without or other we are a force to be reckoned with by developing equanimity and learning how to focus to the point of we can cultivate the last of the four states of mind is called which literally translates to remaining mind this state of mind contains two precise elements it means you are both relaxed and keenly aware of your surroundings this is the state that marital artists aim to be in so that they can react at any moment to anything that comes their way by maintaining relaxed alertness fear cannot sway even in the face of a frightening opponent fear of suffering the taught that and ignorance are the root of all remaining fears healthy fears aside our tendency to try to avoid suffering the fear of being being etc are all caused by a single root and arise from the mind in guide to the bodhisattva way of life is is said that the the source of all our fear comes from our own uncontrolled minds or delusions in order to overcome this root cause of the and masters teach to strive for or emptiness this mean a nihilistic view for life is adopted accused of being existentialist but the taught us to seek the middle way between the mundane and the seeing objects as real but dependently and unsatisfactory instead of seeing all things as pointless and we see mundane life as meaningless but recognize spiritual goals as meaningful as the has said heaven and earth and i are of the same the things and i are of one substance after even once the gave up all his worldly possessions he realized he was no closer to achieving nirvana he discovered that exaggerated asceticism was not required to attain enlightenment by learning how to work through these we can achieve the lions roar of full realization
many of us think that we are not only the main actors of the films of our lives but also the directors of it but the more detailed analysis of the reality shows that this is only an illusion in most cases our mind directs the film of our not we previously introduced in my articles how the mind now i only wish to point out those which manipulate our film of life unconsciously type of social engineering attacks are the the consumer social the power of expectations and the mirror of opinions the consumer social pattern the most important system of social on earth today is the consumer society it means that the basis of social development is economic growth and economic growth depends on how much we consume the most important consumer is since all products obtained expensive improve the imaginary greatness of the ego the more commodities or more power we the more important members of consumer society we are if we are able to divert our attention from and concentrate on our internal development and our spiritual birth our qualities as consumers will considerably since we are no longer attracted to the things that so far fattened our egos as in the recent decades more and more people have felt a need for spiritual social strategy changed accordingly spiritual development has also been made a consumer which largely supported by the survival instinct of the ego the which has been interested in money and now turns towards spiritual and disguises itself in the dress of a spiritual ego we try to decorate those spiritual clothes by adding more and more spiritual knowledge and experience so as to make it more colorful and individual with all we hope that our spiritual progress will serve the further increase and eternal happiness of our spiritual ego consumer society is all too pleased to serve us in those needs a glance at the vivid market of spiritual methods and masters will suffice to convince us about that nothing has really the pattern of the consumer society is the only its contents have been partially replaced the power of expectations the more complex a society the more space a specific member of it is supposed to occupy in the complicated system of human relationships every such occupied status involves a set of the system of expectations that dictate how the individual occupying the status is supposed to behave in a specific how to behave as a a a doctor etc these expectations tell us how we must and how we must not behave in a specific situation and in connection with a specific person in the majority of these expectations work almost like automatic programs running in our life these deep programs have become a part of our mind in the course of our and they are activated by a specific situation in which we are or a person we get into contact with then we put on the appropriate tailored to the specific situation or person we occupy several statuses at the same so it seems that we drown in the sea of expectations it is also common that the various expectations attached to various statuses collide with each generating further anxiety and stress for us what keeps us on the forced track of why do not we simply leave it the power of the social expectations is provided by our identification with the internal and external and base our identity on them we identify with our social with the masks of our roles in our family and occupation these masks are attached to us so closely that we would not be able to exist without them we ourselves with our internal and our scruples and level of demands often constitute the cornerstone of our identity we are so deeply identified with these social we do not notice that these very expectations convert us into fake personalities the pages of our personal history are written by these external forces imposed upon us by they determine how to see the how to think about the how to think about what to believe what is good for us and what we should avoid that is how we have lost our individuality over the years and became unconsciously the victims of a manipulation based upon public agreement the social expectations have been shaped through a general agreement over the and became manipulative because we insisted on our identification with the separate state of consciousness that is how we jointly sustain this rooted in this social due to our we stick to the world of forms and shapes we are only able to imagine our personal existence in the here and now the mirror of opinions tell what do you think about what is your opinion about we have asked other people this question a number of times what we have gathered from the opinions received from we forged an image of who we are and what our mission in life is we have gradually identified with the we believed that the image is really we have pinned it up on the wall of our and proudly show it to any coming our that is me on the other the image in the mirror has also caused us a lot of since there is always a doubt in does that image really meet the expectations of do we appear religious enough in the eyes of as a we spend our whole life polishing and improving the image in order to make it look better and better for others we tend to believe that the best strategy in this process is imitating others this is a strategy that we use from our babyhood that is how we learn our native and that is how we acquire the elements of our culture when we are we continue copying since if we follow the ways of those who lead a decent and good we cannot be wrong

conflicting elements of a troubled world how would describe the world of the given he thought his own time was given the controversy that has arisen over questions of whether trump will accept the result of an election he has deemed own experience with charges of electoral illegitimacy and his approach to answering them should serve trump as an example of how statesmen administer during the

views comments guest posts by my friend roger is a staunch democrat supporter he is in his seventies and has always voted democrat him and i have had countless discussions over the many years that we have known each other his paternal roots are and he sees himself to be on the left side of but of him and i have not been able to see on the race to the issue he is with the view that has inherited a financial and military disaster and did the best he and that he should not be blamed for his failure to perform as many did after his elaborate and successful yes we can slogan he supported and other domestic reform and this is perhaps where roger and i stop to agree and start to disagree including look at the appalling record of the republican party and try to paint a tainted image of it the party that is affectionately called the grand old party or the by its own staunch supporters certainly has enough such records to put it up there with charges of global mayhem and genocide the has given birth to people like the and of who can forget is another character that comes to one that no thinking man could trust with a a federal senator who commands authority that no one seems to be able to either understand the mandate or challenge at the end of the infamous line republican well at least thus enter trump and what a character he need one say god forbid if this article may be read like a defense of the the is run by the rich and the and as described by w bush by the haves and have more it is the party of dick who saw in an opportunity to generate contracts for if tens of hundreds of thousands of had to die for him to achieve his he would not and did not blink this is the party that condones and feeds it is the party that has huge control over the media it is the party that runs the world like it is a business enterprise and whether the rest of the world likes it or until the current global status quo no political party in the world affects the rest of the world like the ruling party in the united states whilst elections in other countries are domestic affairs that affect domestic politics of the country elections have implications that are not only domestically but have a much further global reach that encompasses every corner of the world as a i am much more concerned about the wider global implications of politics than the domestic ones this is not to say that i am indifferent about and the people as a matter of not only do i have close friends who live in but also close family members and i have grave concerns for all mankind in every corner of the by my interest in politics remains focused on foreign policy and to this i am only able to relate to the choice between the major two parties from the perspective of their foreign policies as insists to be the world police and the a stature many are refusing to accept that they have already it must accept what comes with it and concede that the rest of the world is hoping that the people will choose the better candidate as the new or should i say the one who is less harmful to the world in between and who fits the this is the question enough has been recently said about health to write a horror novel her and alleged recent case of pneumonia have made headlines as if not bigger than her infamous hidden allegations of involvement in the murder of an ambassador and even selling arms to very recently the issue of the emails is resurfacing and very late in the perhaps late enough to serve with a knock out her zeal to reach the seems to have been in her mind even before bills scandal back in was prepared to publicly support appear to forgive him and move because she had a bigger fish to the she somehow managed to hush down all other sex allegations against all the and trying to score mileage from similar allegations against trump her unabated lust for power will not stop at anything for as long as she ends up at the the first female even if she has to be commander in chief from behind the control button of a wheelchair there are even observations and allegations that many people who have campaigned against her have died under suspicious circumstances whether this mystery is going to be taken up by main stream media just on the eve of the elections to serve her with yet another knock out remains to be seen her uncontrollable laughs and hysterical facial expressions leave many questions unanswered in between the two front runners and it is hard to say that she presents herself as the sane and rational choice is there a distinction on foreign affairs perhaps but not historically for some the republican party is seen as the party of the hawks and the democrats are seen as the doves but are to answer this question in an unbiased we ought to look back at history notwithstanding the history of the the father and the and what is really the history of the democratic a few landmark historical decisions make it very clear so let us start with current events before we dwell into recent history that some might have chosen to forget the war on was the brainless child of the a spring that was heralded by the visit of an president to and a speech he made to clergy at university the presidents name is and he is a democrat speech was a subtle endorsement for the and to be specific to the street
views comment analyses this article was written for the while the word was focused in rapt attention on the outcome of the us presidential did something quite amazing he arrested minister of the economy of the on charges of extortion and corruption whose telephone had been tapped by the security services since this was arrested in the middle of the night in possession of million us dollars officially fired him the next morning official sources say that extorted a million bribe for an assessment that led to the acquisition by state run oil of a stake in oil tried to threaten the president of and a person considered close to and the security and intelligence services you read that according to the official a company gave a bribe to a member of the government does that make sense to how about a senior member of the government who had his telephone tapped and who has been under close surveillance by the federal security service for over a year does that make sense to this makes no sense at all and the authorities fully realize that but that is the official version so what is going on do you think that there is a message from of course there remember the corrupt minister of defense he was first fired from his position and only then arrested but this time it is a member of the government which is arrested in the middle of the night for a few his subordinates could not even reach him they had no idea what had happened to him was that a hardly the way was detained was carefully choreographed to instill the strongest sense of fear possible in all the other th columnists still in power because in so many ways was a symbol for all the the in the who want to integrate into the us controlled international security was a known just like governor of who was detained in a arrest in for taking a bribe i would even say that could be considered the ultimate symbol of the and a faithful member of the liberal the consensus sect in the past had worked with and and who now has been brought down by the the top officials of the power ministries state the head of the economic security service of the this was immediately recognized by everybody and the main headline of the popular website could not be it the brought down and featured a photo of the key actors of this including the man thought to have brought the head of the economic security service of the on photo in i predicted that a government purge was in the making i have to admit that i thought that this would have happened earlier apparently decided to take action while uncle was busy with his problems if that is indeed the reason for the late that says a lot about the power of the still wields in some observers noticed that the arrest of took place after the telephone conversation between trump and hinting that trump might have given the go ahead for the arrest that of utter but if that can make look bad its good enough for the th columnists the list of potential candidates to be purged next is still long and includes names like the deputy prime minister the first deputy prime minister the governor of the central bank the minister of finance of prime minister was only one amongst many more he was definitely a target and the manner in which he was arrested must have sent a chill down the spine of all the other th columnists in the just the fact that his phone was tapped for so long is quite unthinkable and clearly points to the fact that nobody is safe from purges and by is truly a most welcome every member of the government now has been put on notice that life is now spent under the close scrutiny of the it really matters little what will happen to next he has be formally now his case will be further investigated and then will have his day in court now he has only be detained and he will be kept under house arrest for the next two he faces years in jail and a fine equivalent to times the amount of the bribe he took judging by the case of who is managed to escape any prison time thanks to a presidential amnesty for the years of the seem to be reluctant to inflict any form of retribution upon his enemies but even if does not get to enjoy the fresh air of the he is already finished as a power and that is all that really matters to what matters here is that in the course of one a top level minister went from his ministerial offices to a holding cell and that absolutely nobody saw it coming or could prevent this yet again we have a case of no warnings of any no hints just sudden dramatic action with an immediate result his handwriting is clearly all over the case laughing no more the reaction to this arrest in was especially after sources in the security services told the media that and were also under investigation for declared that he was in total shock even better was the reaction of prime minister who said that this development was at the edge of his understanding it will be interesting to observe the inevitable reaction from the if they really feel they will pay to the need to fight corruption on all levels and generally keep a low profile if they still have some fight in they will denounce a the return to purges and a new campaign of terror against democracy the western corporate whose only value is will write about how the secret police is cracking down on business entrepreneurs and how that will end up damaging the economy a repeat

next day this method however did not deceive another famous pair of brothers called giants quarterback manning prior to the patriots devastating super bowl this time posing as legendary manning was really smart about our source discloses was one of the first to catch on he strung discussing for a good minutes or so then started asking him personal questions with increasing specificity came prepared and nailed the stuff about favorite sandwich and the suspicious spot on his but crumbled when brought up a childhood story about a manning family reunion that ended in tragedy pretended to lose service and hung up the but he was sweating after locking up the stunning manning made sure to catch up with on the field shook brought him in and whispered dropped the turd in the that really pissed him just how many prank calls has made over the would say upwards of five that just during practice who knows how much pranking he did in his spare the source alleges that once convinced former head coach to buy into a pyramid and even tricked friend and former teammate into believing he was suffering from schizophrenia could write a book on this declared the assistant when asked if he thinks the kicker is still making these types of would bet my kidney that he still doing and i only have one kidney ca live without pranking he got dossiers on every player in the plus guys scouting for dirt on college players the guy has at least burner phones at all times i would doubt that he had a hand in wide josh checking into rehab just before they played the pats that reeks of it remains to be seen if will garner the same attention from mainstream news outlets as this team previous scandals perhaps the league will be reluctant to pick at the wounds so soon after an expensive and tiresome legal battle with tom but if further evidence presents itself or more witnesses come this story has the capacity to be the most shocking example of disregard for the spirit of the game there are no specific rules in regards to making prank phone but personal harassment of this magnitude is sure to violate the league code of personal conduct policy who will get the last laugh in probably

by on occidental observer the dismantling of the jungle refugee camp has been marked by huge scenes of disorder with at least one gang rape and much of the camp going up in flames but there has been uproar in too since the that most of the thousands of child refugees which the prime minister had agreed to were neither children nor refugees from the moment these strapping adult male migrants stepped off the bus in it was obvious that the people had been subjected to yet another massive immigration deception those who enabled and this child refugee scam are brazening it safe in the knowledge there will be no comebacks for them first they attempted to prevent any more embarrassing pictures by throwing blankets over the arrivals so they resembled state witnesses at a mafia trial then a screened walkway from the bus alighting point to the door of the reception was erected overnight for the same purpose dental tests to determine the real age of these youths were ruled out as an invasion of privacy and there is no question of having them so nothing can be done now here get over it but of it all works better if there is no from the public so the have resorted to the tried and tested method of stifling dissent anyone who sticks his head above the parapet to raise doubts is subjected to stern lectures about their moral shortcomings presenter chastised his fellow for their shameful while shadow home secretary abbot t attacked those who wanted to carry out dental tests to assess their age as racist pop singer lily became a media darling on behalf of the people of she made a tearful apology to the refugees for causing their plight let that sink in caused the plight of the refugees after voting for for ordinary who have seen their hospitals and welfare services strained to breaking a fresh influx of immigrants was not exactly what they had been looking forward to after has no legal or moral obligation to take these people they were supposed to be the responsibility of the first country they arrived at in the and why are they coming to racist its incredibly of them why not go to some or or this fresh burden will be placed squarely on the local authorities that receive the and they are going to have to dig deeply while the government is providing per annum for each young the total annual cost is around so tax increases or reduced services in other areas are predicted naturally little of this will fall on the prosperous boroughs filled with morally uplifted whites instead many migrants are being located in areas such as or poorer northern communities already thronging with such as the tipping point in the long battle to admit these bogus child refugees seems to have been a initiative in which more than religious leaders led by the former archbishop of lord and senior representatives from the and faiths signed a letter urging the prime minister to admit in a speech at a lord described the camp as a stain on the conscience but in this alleged support was not what it appeared to be it was largely by dozens of activists working through an called citizens that the casework and poured substantial resources into ensuring that the necessary amendments to the law would make it through parliament the jungle crisis has brought the community together in a unity of purpose rarely seen outside the occasion of various wars from the highest communal levels to the smallest youth it seems everyone has been in the cause of getting economic migrants into it is a campaign they have chosen to frame in entirely moral terms the loud insistence has been that not only is under a strict moral obligation to take these migrants but that there should be no upper limit to do otherwise would be to undermine our reputation as a humanitarian country that wishes to describe itself as their arguments have been formed around highly emotional anecdotes and images time and again we have been treated to stories of children struggling in the squalor at the jungle camp the iconic photographs of the lifeless body of boy washed up on a beach are frequently invoked you will notice that nowhere is there any consideration of the stress this is causing on existing especially those in the poorer areas where refugees are invariably housed nor is there any recognition of the profound unfairness this imposes on the native white community who will be required to support these strangers via the welfare health and housing services such a process is not only it makes a mockery of the basic idea that help from the welfare state is in return from previous tax contributions there is a largely unspoken reason for resentment over perceived inadequacy in admitting refugees before world war ii in admitted many tens of thousands of in the but it is an article of faith amongst many that could and should have admitted many more typical of this attitude was the speech of rabbi founder of the forum he says he lost over relatives in the holocaust and implied that wartime attitudes to refugees were to blame for this i feel obliged to ensure we make the same he said numerous references were made to the by which children from were smuggled into too has already debunked much of this greatly a veteran of that same is the figurehead for the refugee crusade year old lord dubs a veteran politician he has tirelessly campaigned for mass immigration all his life a former director of the refugee he somehow arrived in aged six in despite horrendous attitudes at the and was shown much charity since he has chosen to repay this kindness by devoting his life to opening borders to from around the globe according to refugees should have been processed at the first country they
by on reflections in a petri dish dog poet transmitting its one week until the to be hijacked elections are supposed to take place it stands to reason that at some point in the next seven days a or several are going to go off in the political landscape i do not know what these will be composed of one of them will certainly have to do with the emails but i know what shape it will take i suspect that the trump camp has got some things up its sleeve but they want to wait until no amount of following spin will possess the amount of time necessary to undo the damage i feel pretty confident saying this i have this strong impression that the are sitting on some seriously damaging information got to love the apocalypse in times like these the latest news is that is seeking immunity how real all of this is i know when i read things like has a predilection for underage it makes me scratch my head it like i put anything past these people but sometimes i get the feeling people are reaching and more than willing to believe anything whether it is true or not not saying it what i am saying is i know there is a lot of chatter going on about the emails and sundry suffice to say that we can be certain there is a lot more known by those in a position to know than we are being told i have been feeling a certain uneasiness for two days now no idea what it pertains to but i feel sure something is about to rise to the surface and it is going to be significant there are so many agendas at work and many who are employed by our oppressors and abusers have had it with the satanic behavior of their employers i know what we are looking at but its hour has come round at last we are definitely living in interesting times there are so many ways to look at the state of the world in this period if you are a a an a fear driven or any permutation of similar it is as dickens put the best of times and the worst of times on the surface it certainly has the appearance of being a time for plunder or flight on the one those orchestrating or promoting the chaos are confident that they can steal and murder at under the darkness being generated for that purpose on the other certainly some amount of people are looking for a place to weather the sum of their fears they want some place to hide i know where that might be maybe they do many are already in that bunker mentality with all those guns and certainly the agents of the dark side have got their put together none of these folk have a plan for anything lady nature may come up with for i know that the almighty is screening a movie that was written out of the combined destinies of every life form on the planet this has been going on for such a length of time that no human mind can measure or comprehend the extent of it no human mind can comprehend the extent of one go round of a is it matter what anyone thinks it is all that matters is what it really is and the essence and detail of that has been long known to those so informed of the and woof of the process it was all delineated back in the time of the the nature of existence and the protocol of existence were all mapped out and remain to the present for any inquiring mind to peruse at their leisure of course there are and will be many arguments to the contrary the separated human mind is capable of endless depending of what that separated mind wants to realize out of it it is of no importance to me what others wish to believe all that is important to me is what is true i make no claims to be in possession of this information what i can say is that i have been convinced of the divine architecture of existence and it is only important for me to recognize this and seek to align myself with it experience has proven to me that when i go along with the inner voice and rely on the certitude of the presence of the things go well for me when i rely on my own imperfect awareness of circumstance then i find out what is what and what is not it is never an easy thing to talk about what one only has a partial understanding of it is next to impossible to discuss the ineffable when it exists forever beyond the parameter of words this is the telling argument for faith faith is the substance of things unseen we are here to find ourselves and nothing more surely we can give our time and attention to all manner of pointless exercises and some of them have a long enough shelf life as to seem convincing to many the evidence of the life successes of those who have prospered in the material world stand as examples for the ambitious and those who believe he who dies with the most toys wins this is certainly not true it even be true if there were no invisible hierarchy or worlds beyond this one if you are dead forever then what is the point of the the good and bad news is that this is not a one time life on this earth the of nature is consistent in all of its productions and an unwavering theme of justice and balance runs through the whole

by on visible origami dog poet transmitting i would within the limitations of my to talk a little about yoga which for me is the only legitimate fast track to the divine that exists for the present and the least dangerous of all the options out there my life keeps going by and i step in and out of it these days i spend a great deal of my time in as well as preparation for my ongoing journey it might be awhile yet and it may be right around the either is fine with me i have come to understand that loving the divine is so very much once all the distractions that the greatest majority of us live are in pursuit or which predominates over all of the esoteric alternatives are gone without my even being aware of at nearly all of the usual human attractions and compulsions just slipped out the door and returned i find myself watching life behind some kind of glass its a movie that is being screened in the mind but once the film in the projector has been ordinary life becomes irrelevant and one can immerse themselves in more important considerations one still goes to the supermarket one still eats and excretes one sleeps and awakens in the dream one drives and walks and watches and listens to all of the sounds of the world around them but the effect of all of it has changed last night happens a couple of times a i laid in my bed and did not sleep most of the night so i did as i usually do and i love you over and over and over on this night there was an atmosphere of static and confusion and i could not seem to break through it images of the past spiraled through to haunt me over mistakes made and opportunities missed the voice entered and do not occupy your mind with thoughts of what is past these have all been paid for through your suffering they are not relevant anymore try telling that to the monkey mind the point is that regardless of the static and confusion and the seeming distance between myself and the i did not allow any of these distractions to deter me from the continuous repetition i love you i felt the obstacles that hung in the air i felt all the barriers that occasionally come and go and are sometimes not there at all and i just kept at it i studiously ignored whatever it was that was interfering with my efforts and i told myself that i would not allow anything to no matter how much it did no matter what the difficulty might be i would persevere and i did i fell asleep at some point i awoke this am and good morning lord it is another day and i do not want to forget that every day given to me is an opportunity to celebrate the no matter how far away the almighty might seem to be and no matter how difficult the effort might become the path of love is not an easy cruise to some literal or metaphorical island though we paint it as the only sure and certain route this does not mean it is also an easy route there is bound to be opposition in times of material darkness there are agents of that darkness who seek to hinder and hamper our efforts and these no real efforts are even made the world seems to be swept away in a tidal waves of garbage and noxious dreams that spin themselves out of perverted daylight humanity is there to be found in the midst at all times but it takes a concerted determination to rise and greet it at every turn where it seeks to appear to this is the real work to move through the murk of this existence and reach out to every hungry and troubled heart with some portion of the sunlight we are all given for the purpose of sharing if we are cheap with our the amount of sunlight given will decrease and further decrease until we find ourselves in darkness i refer you to the parable from the where he gave the example of the three men to whom a certain amount of talent were given so it is when you are kept awake in the night and you strive and reach for unity with the ineffable and you get nowhere you continue and continue as at any you will achieve that unity and you will not cease until you even if it is a thousand times a thousand even if you are in prison or confined in even greater distress in the houses of the rich you do not deter you do not immerse yourself in comforting distractions one day the sun will rise in your heart and there will be no further static or confusions the love of god is a consuming fire and fortunate is the one so consumed it is important to understand that such a love will demand everything of you and such a love will try and test you to discover the level of your dedication and many are called but few are chosen i am reminded of that short but powerful poem by the wayfarer the reality of this great and singular quest is precisely as the poem describes and there have been many souls who have discovered the truth of it as they went surging forward in all their temporary and unchallenged right up until they saw that every blade of grass was not a blade of grass imagine in your own life and in your own how often you forget about the ineffable and how often petty and incidental concerns arise in your thoughts to take you away later you can often not remember what these concerns were but you can certainly remember that they were of small since
by on dog poet transmitting its late afternoon and is two days if you count the rest of today or because it would then be and not away anymore then it will take all day for whatever the nonsense is to complete itself and possibly into the next day as well one thing that this election has done and which come to the attention of many people is that it has woken the public up the public has been able to see first hand the level of media bias and the cynically celebrities it has been able to see the intensity of the lies in all those political like the one that said trump was walking in on naked beauty some of whom were only years old that one amused me i have never seen the degree of vituperation that has been taking place i have never seen the media so clearly expose itself for what it is it did it in such a way and to such a degree that even the wet brain public was able to see it apocalypse is like an expensive a multiplicity of gears turning and each gear is a kind of plot construct and it seems impossible to tell which of them are turning all of the others you might term it a wheels within wheels kind of or a number of those acts of misdirection from a great magician all the while a variety of events seem to be taking place but what is happening is that something entirely is being woven out of them all the as the psychopaths and opportunists are having their their every machinations is being recorded for posterity and their every act is being choreographed to a specific end destiny is one of those one of those like karma that has a temporal meaning over a broad surface because of the varieties of interpretations given by this one or that one but these words have much deeper interpretations that according to the depth of the one giving the interpretations destiny has an individual application and then various broader applications families have towns and cities have nations have destinies and even planets have as do solar systems and galaxies the gods have a destiny the gods have karma and all of the aforementioned do as well this accounts for some of those who walked out on their families and the towns and cities they were birthed in and grew up in they were in search of something they carried with them as they went looking it matter where you are no matter where you there you are and the most priceless and valuable thing that it is possible to you are transporting from place to place as you look for it under the guise of everything else the first consideration any human being ought to make in this life is to ponder what it is that is distracting them from self inquiry what is it that makes it so difficult to scrutinize the imponderables of existence how is it that one can see the sun and moon in the sky and the glittering and countless stars and not know that there is some grand and majestic power at work how can one pass by the and gods in the antique shop window and no wonder about the tales that attend how can one not make the connection between the face of a new born baby and an old man sitting in his chair on a how can one attend birthday parties and all those other celebrations and then attend a funeral and not make the connection that since they were present at all of the other how could they not expect that a funeral would be held for there is a story about the brothers where appears as a stork to one of the brothers and asks him what the greatest mystery is the brother know and the stork that you see men dying all around you and do not think that you yourself will die was that in the not remembering it that well but its been decades since i read the major books from the except for the that always seems to be around here somewhere i cannot shake the feeling that some shocking surprises are looming in the event horizon i also cannot get around the feeling of this unshakable optimism that suffuses the atmosphere all around me there are threats of earthquakes and tsunamis there are wars and rumors of wars there is the specter of economic collapse the worst of it is the collective immersion of the human psyche in material culture without this freakish zombie obsession the self styled elite would have no power over the rest of us but it is like pouring swill into a hog trough with the certainty that the hogs will come a running it is a form of pornography even worse than the usual fare its the single most difficult hurdle of them all human ignorance and indifference are what makes all of the visible evil possible and hardly anyone even sees it its business as usual it is the daily redundancy of the dream lumbering up and down the aisles of somewhere in search of something it is the unexamined lives from cradle to grave with nothing understood and nothing to precious lives wasted and in vain few realize the value and privilege of a human birth fewer still realize the potential of it powerful invisible forces wait at the ready for any and every person who begins to show an interest in the hidden side of existence they watch to see who awakens to the joy of service they pray for the opportunity to assist in every righteous endeavor these days more time is spent publicizing a persons acts of alleged charity than the act was worth wealth is relative and so is the value of ones contributions become a cartoon in so many

by on by note t he word fascism is generally used today as a pejorative to attack any idea that a speaker happens to dislike but this word has a specific meaning and a specific historical context it

which all of them have in common to some degree goes further and examines these characteristics and assigns each of them a value on a with zero being completely absent and being omnipresent let us also see how many are trending trending and holding steady the final score on a scale will give a useful measure of the degree of fascism in powerful and continuing nationalism fascists tend to make constant use of patriotic and other paraphernalia flags are seen as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays in patriotic and flags have been part of the culture since the founding of the with the frequency of their use varying from time to time this reached a fever pitch immediately following the and while it has backed off since the sense of nationalism in remains perhaps the strongest of all nations in which the state does not directly force people into such observances steady disdain for the recognition of human rights because of fear of enemies and the need for fascists are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of need the people tend to look the other way or even approve of summary long incarcerations of etc after the bush regime and their lapdogs in the media were largely successful in convincing people that torture and indefinite detention of those who were not convicted of crimes was justifiable for national security reasons the regime has taken some positive steps on these but has murdered far more people with drone strikes than his predecessor the media has largely given a pass on this at the war on drugs has placed many innocent people into prison for decades while the people are becoming more opposed to such abuses of little real change has occurred slightly up identification of as a unifying cause the people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or ethnic or religious etc has a dark history of this over the native eastern and have all been

even when there are widespread domestic the military is given a disproportionate amount of government and the domestic agenda is neglected soldiers and military service are glamorized the united states has the largest military budget in the and spends more money on its military than the next seven nations combined despite a stagnant economy and decaying percent of the federal budget is devoted to the military this is equal to the combined budgets of and and is nearly as much as the budget for social security to be critical of the military as an institution is considered to be nearly

top three nations with elite scrabble players on the ratings list is on despite constant travel visa rejections to play in world tournaments besides countries like and also contribute players to the world top an even more astonishing picture of performance unfolds when we look beyond the countries scrabble in in an professional scrabble player from new confirmed his reputation as perhaps the greatest scrabble player in history by winning the world scrabble after memorizing the dictionary in nine weeks his goal in was apparently to hold both the and world championships simultaneously he was robbed of his full glory by the wellington in the but managed to pull off a more phenomenal victory in the language he does not is said to have an authentic photographic memory what caught my eye in all the frenzied media reports was the name of the person defeated in the finals was fully expecting a an had reached the finals of the world when i looked into the history of the scrabble world i was stunned to find that francophone countries have been even more dominant in and over a longer than have become in despite a very active expert scrabble club culture in and other native countries the full list of the top players in the scrabble championship that won gives a clear picture of this world championships final standings a look at demographics makes the scrabble achievement of impossible to explain under the present racial hypothesis has a population of million and a reported national of if the world champion needs an of just should probably be higher than given the level of gender disparity at the very then there is statistically no one in who should ever come anywhere close to the world championship three made it to the top in note that the strongest version of the genetic hypothesis is contradicted even before you do the the very existence of such high interest in a mathematical game can not be predicted from a genetic theory that claims of or human if it is indeed true that have the lowest genetic endowment in mathematical even ability is scrabble perhaps less mathematical than not at all the very fact that someone could successfully cross from scrabble to scrabble should indicate that it requires similar cognitive skills but i still looked at some profiles of the top scrabble players in just to make and found clear signs to confirm this for the entry on best player last player to keep the world championship from and the only one to have won it et est scrabble i do not know any but i can bet that there is the word mathematics somewhere in there and perhaps even an academic career in in returned to defend his world championship title and this time the vowed to keep the crown from him like the year before stole the the two finalists in were both was behind three the math professor and former world could not make it to the top ten as more dominated the world championships final standings positions are notice that the names of the top players are different from the ones in which defies the probability projections from their population and national even further which has probably had the most success at the world championships achieved this with a literacy rate of only something special about scrabble for the man who won the world scrabble championship in from also happens to be a top master player in his country this should immediately suggest that whatever he is using to win his scrabble games probably has something in common with what is needed to be a master in because it is highly improbable to be that exceptional in two different areas that require unrelated skills the question can then be if this is then why also very good in checkers at the world just as they are with checkers an even more natural field for since it is cheaper to make a checkers meet breaking world record for simultaneous play back in a expert from was visiting the colony of when he decided to watch some of the street

here something interesting from the review recipient name teaching about are not sympathetic either a quick read of the for that the passages about in the will convince anyone in need of convincing that the pharisees hatred for was not satiated with his crucifixion and lest anybody think that this is all racist drivel by here is a good article on this topic from corroborating it all order it now nowadays an uninformed observer might erroneously conclude that there is a big between and but to the extend that this is this is solely due to the fact that most modern and have long ceased to think and act in accordance to their own traditions the reality is that for traditional modern are people who have failed to live up to their election by god and who now are determined to take by force what had been promised to them by god for traditional are idolaters of the worst as they worship a blaspheming born of a promiscuous hairdresser and a roman who was justly executed for his crimes and who now forever is confined to hell where he boils in excrement and lest anybody believe that this hostility is only a matter of a long gone i would add that while the are still waiting for as their the consensus indicates that this messiah will be the very same person whom and the apostles called the western history books usually say that was sacked in and fell in the former is but the latter is completely false as it conflates the city of and the roman empire only the city of and the western roman empire came to an end in the th but that very same roman empire continued to exist in the east for a full years until when the ottomans finally captured the city of in the imperial capital of the roman empire had been moved from to the city of the new by the emperor in the at various vandals and sacked was no longer the capital of the roman empire it would be ridiculous to claim that the of modern fear hate of things can all be explained by ancient theological arguments in neither nor the west are all that religious nowadays and while there is definitely a religious rebirth taking place in it remains also true that only a minority of are truly religious or in orthodox theology there are plenty of reasons why some which have absolutely nothing to do with including the fact that and has always an unconquered military that the soviet regime has oppressed millions of people in eastern and in the soviet union and that any more or less sovereign and independent regime in stands as the main obstacle for the west to take control of immense resources and many other reasons as for and they are a small minority compared to the vast majority of largely agnostic people around them in modern has numerous independent vectors all contributing to a grand sum vector expressed in the wests current policies towards and yet there is a clash of civilizations taking place it does not primarily oppose a putative west to for one the modern west has long ceased to be and should now be categorized as the world is not united and does not have the resources to meaningfully oppose the empire until or some other civilization truly rises up to be able to challenge the current world is the only country which will dare to openly challenge the very legitimacy of the western political system and the ideology it has been built upon modern is both capable and willing of challenging the dominant western ideology capitalism to the belief that homosexuality is a normal and healthy variation of human sexuality precisely because of her position as the heir and the roman empire for the past years or has been ruled by a generally westernized ruling but that elite itself has always remained a foreign superstructure imposed upon the nation which never truly identified with it with has finally found a leader who does not represent the interests of the but rather the interests of the vast majority of the population hence stratospheric popularity ratings and that too frightens the especially the western elites who now feel that their rule is threatened by a nuclear superpower which is determined not to let them take over our entire planet it is impossible to predict what will happen next but it does appear likely to me that this ancient conflict between two fundamentally opposed spiritualities and civilizations will come to some kind of a for better or for in the near future

earlier had made rigging in elections into a big issue and undertaken at to implicate and topple the govt despite the physical assault on the pm house and the the protest fizzled out without achieving any results had to tender an apology to the judicial commission when his legal team failed to produce any evidence to prove the rigging charge covered up his embarrassment by saying that rigging was just a political stunt for point scoring he then shifted his goal post from rigging to corruption and in that panama scandal came as a godsend opportunity to push his chief rival against the wall and possibly unseat him irrespective of the fact that name was absent from the list of account holders in the offshore company in and several of his leading lights including himself were maintaining offshore he insisted that accountability should start from and his two sons based in and daughter only and none else he emphasized on immediate resignation of and quoted weak examples of pm of who had

all the intentions to move forward and organize a in front of residence of but truculence expressed by activists and reluctance of other political parties to join coupled with heating up of and threat of surgical strike by restrained and he decided to wrap it up the same night he pledged to invade and lock down on and force to quit or offer himself for accountability he built up the tempo throughout and made efforts to take as many political parties on board social media and electronic media in particular and made him into an object of hate most political parties and saner elements advised to change his plan of confrontation in the wake of acceptance of case of panama scandal for hearing by the supreme but he refused and remained adamant having discovered the foul intentions of the govt announced that all out efforts will be made to prevent the activists of and their partners from besieging on police and frontier constabulary were requisitioned to bolster the strength of police and containers from all over were impounded to block the roads leading to hawks within the ruling party also flexed their muscles and showed readiness for the combat in the annoyance over

bigger head to be rolled and their obvious target was and none else quite a few critics of are now shedding tears of sympathy the date of incursion was advanced to refusal of and pat to join up for the d day was a setback for the but it decided to once again take the suicidal plunge its main dependence was on the main effort launched from by the workers under the command of chief minister

was at the battle of when ships led by admiral defeated and capturing vessels without losing a single ship this decisive naval battle of the war stopped plans for invading england and graphically illustrated resolve one of standard bearers of analytical ferris presents a lucid explanation of what went on this month when his holiness patriarch of and all visited queen ii at palace parts of particularly must have been keenly interested as ferris patriarch is far from being an apologist for but it is his potential to destabilize the given the potential willingness of members of the officially royal family to embrace the orthodox that comes under scrutiny and to further translate this into an queen ii is currently the supreme governor of the church of england and her role is largely ceremonial the queen occupies a special pulpit in the fabric of and the preferences of the queens family subtly influence hearts and minds it is the similarities between the church of england and the orthodox church that has the and on high rather than the because if the is to seat a such as the bishop of then it will need to firmly discourage any alternatives under the orthodox the bishop of authority is no greater or less than any of his fellow bishops in the so he does not have primacy in the orthodox church before the pope could have jurisdiction within the papacy would need to be reformed in accordance with orthodoxy one of the stumbling blocks is in the orthodox papal infallibility is rejected because it is believed that the holy spirit acts to guide the church into truth for

bank part of the royal bank of has told media outlet rt that it should take its business elsewhere initially it was reported that the bank had frozen meaning it had impounded the but it now says that the accounts have merely been meaning that rt can withdraw its money provided it then takes it to another bank and the rest of the royal bank of are effectively owned by the which acquired the majority share in to prevent it collapsing as rt is also it has been inferred that this is another form of sanction foreign secretary denies but he also denies several of his several parts of his ancestry and practically everything else he has ever written or been recorded saying it has also been suggested that this which came without was connected with potential fines against the bank for holding money considered dirty by association with though the government fining itself to pay itself seems unlikely it may therefore be simply a publicity stunt the has to be seen to be acting against as part of the sanctions and may be perfectly happy for rt to take its business to a private or even another having done its bit of public posturing however the real reason for this move is not sanctions against the state it is because a seemingly unimportant event has the potential to shake the foundations of the united kingdom and those in the corridors of power have just woken up to it the closing of if it finally may simply be a symbolic but it may be the precursor to a more serious which no one thought they would ever see again the subtext beneath the subtext the patriarch of and all holds a service in cathedral of the of the mother of god and all saints in a visit to marking the anniversary of the orthodox presence there from patriarch of visited the united kingdom there is a growing orthodox diaspora in the as there is in all western and also a small but orthodox community and a number of majority parishes orthodoxy is still a very small religion there though figures are hard to come no more than of the population would currently identify themselves as despite the large community which owns the plurality of the orthodox churches the church of england adheres to a doctrine called branch theory the idea that various different as they call are branches of the same basic church consequently religious leaders in general are treated with even if people greatly disagree with their faith when pope john ii visited the in he was treated as a pop despite a few insignificant protests by protestant or groups no particular fuss is made when leaders of other faiths enter the country from despite the hysteria surrounding hate preachers who are no more radical than the who have the greatest objection to them but how was patriarch with respect by those who met him but not by the media or the political class when archbishop who had been a politician in public office contrary to the canons of the visited the in the he was shown entering churches and attracting crowds who cheered him so hard they damaged the buildings patriarch was presented as an apologist for and alleged actions in who had been sent on a propaganda mission queen ii has held an historic

by on future now rests in the hands of a man older than the supreme leader of celebrate in the streets of the coastal city of after election of former general as president the news come as much of a surprise in the end presidential posters with face were already being hung around east before the results had even been released but now its has finally elected a new a and former military was elected on making him the ending a political vacuum in the top post that had left now takes the reigns of a country heavily plagued by a massive refugee overload with refugees from various practically public constant threat of war from their southern and bomb attacks from terrorists interestingly this is the second time that has been announced the president to when he and the military government of east appointed itself in and anyone who dared disputed this was met with which did eventually occur even went on to fight a war of liberation against the army forces stationed in during which ended in failure and forced to flee his native land into exile in the man behind the poster is by his to be a strong leader with a military background who knows how to play the political field to achieve his goals on the other most i have spoken to about have offered plenty of negative feedback even from people who i assumed would throw their full support behind the old boy an overall slippery character who has been lucky enough to pick the right partners since his return to after his exile i have to the side of my personality that appreciates dark comedy chuckled at the picture of president sitting in the big chair of the presidential palace with just the slightest whisper of a cheeky smile on his face the last time held the the army under the authority of pictured at the presidential palace in being elected president of president of bombed him out in a attempt to illuminate a stubborn nationalist troublemaker yet years son of offered his personal congratulations to on his election victory just president also shares my dark which would explain his sly smirk while he sat in his prize seat despite all the he has returned to and claimed what he had always the presidency carries with him a considerable amount of political baggage from a long career full of civil war and side switching which has left many in questioning if this lord of war is the man worth appointing to end the political stalemate which some have suggested would be better off remaining politically frozen instead of appointing a man who has fought against the administration in during the late but now fully backs and in this is a totally understandable stance given the lack of honest candidates available in the fact remains that has been left completely disabled by the political deadlock which is pushing the country to the brink i personally agree with the progressive socialist party and leader who said on twitter prior to the vote that its time to elect any president to escape the presidential vacuum why elect i have a growing concern that behind closed doors some very egotistical and conniving millionaires are beginning to see the massive potential gas wealth just sitting off the coast but political class has been far too busy infighting among themselves to invest in steps towards harvesting and selling gas also have their eyes on this untapped wealth lying below the perhaps this could be why so many old adversaries of have decided to suddenly put an end to their refusal to back ally for who is smart enough to see this type of opportunity on the horizon and just about desperate enough to surrender his staunch opposition to candidacy in return for inclusion in any future plans given recent bad luck with his struggling business in i put it past him who is still eagerly perusing the trial and conviction of what he believes where who at news beside former prime minister after announced that he will back to become president assassinated his is now willing to throw his vote to candidate in order to secure the position for the second as prime minister certainly there are many more aspects to consider in what has been a leading up to yesterdays grand finale but i suspect that political godfathers are smart enough to realize they are sitting on a potential trillion dollar money maker is at risk of being high jacked if they continue pussyfooting around over never sectarian feuds what could during my last trip to i was shocked to see how even the average struggle with the lack of basic services the country is a mess and the only institution that is worth any praise is the army that has coped remarkably well under the strains of constant terror attacks from radical terrorists the rise of regional sectarianism and a huge lack of money equipment the proxy of dictator who fought a long bloody war against is now considered the candidate who confirms an political victory over its competitor for political influence in what has largely held the country back is the fact that has been stuck in a vicious game of between refusal to pick a side has left the country empty handed with no vision of a safe future has a desperately needed arms deal with a pathetic blaming the deal cancellation on a statement made by foreign minister happens to be who refused to accept a statement referring to as a terrorist group the produced statement patriarch president of also demanded all league members to condemn which both refused to do in previous attempts to remain has also refused to accept any or offers to provide free arms deliveries to the army in order not to upset the countries ties to the us or the gulf now that holds may have the guts to finally
by on in a few the ugliest and most distasteful presidential election in us history will be and we will see which candidate won to preside over the us as president this is an election that is all about groping and making us the laughing stock of the world as we all saw in this there was little of anything about the priorities that really matter to the people both candidates talk about bringing back industrial and manufacturing jobs we know well that both are liars and will never bring back the kind of industrial and manufacturing jobs that gave a sense of dignity and security the two candidates did their best to cater to the rich and the people with the money and the billionaires who always shaped our nation agenda and politics billions have poured into this year national no different from previous elections where close to billion were injected in and invested in the elections the returns are for the donors never for the voters not only black and but white as well have been neglected for a long time they are getting the shaft everywhere and from especially from that empower corporate to screw the poor at every turn and in every way and congress does that through legislation that gives incentives to corporations to locate their manufacturing jobs that allows banks and financial institutions especially the credit card companies to give the shaft to the poor what does the future hold for our next it should not be surprising that this great country of ours has such a staggering number of poor over million or of the population with the prospect that most will be part of this category at least one if they are between the age of years not all poor are unemployed living off the but there are millions of these poor who are working very hard one or two jobs to make ends with and blacks most likely to be among this category than and with women more likely than men to fall into this category of working and with white males with less than a high school education spending at least one year in this category it is hard to in this country of plentiful that million people earn less than a and million are in deep earning less than a year while our presidential candidates cater to the rich and powerful seeking their no candidates are talking about the jobs that with of available jobs paying less than annually talk about the banks and financial institutions that looted tens of millions from pension funds during the financial crisis of or the fact that congress allowed corporations to benefiting wall street and the while cheating workers out of their pensions and health care of republicans talk about eliminating entitlements for the while forgetting or neglecting the kind of entitlements the us military or the kind of entitlements corporations and rich executives get as part of the deal worked out with members of congress entitlements that are triple what the and poor gets it is true that families out of get cash but not all of them are black or as we are lead to thus causing an outcry to end the welfare system i should note here that of the entitlements goes to the elderly and the poor and retired workers on social security and amounting to billion but then let us look at how the which is sponsored and nurtured by congress screws every day let us for the interest rates charged on credit cards in most the poor are the ones who gets behind on credit card payments and as the interest rates charged is almost twice as much as the average rate and moreover if one gets behind on one payment on one credit all the other credit card companies hike the rate thus the poor pay a higher price and costs with rates charged and the likelihood of default on one then the credit ratings are forcing the poor to pay higher interests on car loans and on mortgage loans what is truly a rip off is the fact that companies like payday loans and car title companies while considered as banks receiving funds at less than can charge borrowers even unconscionable the poor also get the shafts from health care companies especially supplemental insurance because of the fact that the poor are most likely to suffer from certain chronic diseases such as high blood and their rates are much higher than the average add to that the way our schools are funded since we do not have a national tax plan that funds all the funding comes from property tax as such if you are in a poor the income to support the schools the and the fire department is much less than in affluent communities as children get less quality and most likely they will be among the poor who will live on government and most likely these neighborhoods will have higher crime rates and a higher percentage of incarceration what the government saves in support of it pays double that in the cost of crime and incarceration this simply makes no as a society i leave you with two incidents that i personally experienced supplemental health insurance i mean those of us over the age of have and must purchase supplemental health insurance to complement our i purchased a policy from through paying a month after almost a i discovered that the of earned in salary i made a simple and it was shocking to realize that i have to pay years of monthly premium just to pay his salary for one year of i dropped because of this exploitation of disadvantaged communities the other when i had my private which offered auto dealers a smart loyalty where dealers can add to the card special such as oil discount on and extended while consumers benefited from being able to keep track of their

we are change the of treason and plot i see no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot folk rhyme thanks to truth and shadows th is guy also known as gunpowder day in its the th anniversary of the gunpowder plot or gunpowder as it was first also happens to be my th birthday so been more aware of guy day than most especially happy about how ubiquitous the guy mask has become the mask was hugely popularized in the movie v for vendetta as stalwart a year in a piece entitled unmasking media why mask piece is up for vendetta may be the most revolutionary film ever made its obvious message lets get out there and visit some rough justice on the treasonous bastards who created the and media and destroyed the freedoms for which been fighting for centuries watch v for present and future it is also possible to read the film from an psychological rather than just a call to its about the psychological process of coming to terms with the and inside by allowing oneself to feel the overwhelming anger that is the natural response once one has faced the overcome and come to terms with ones own righteous then its time for revolution the real message of the v mask is we know you bastards blew up the trade center we know blowing up the economy we know lying to us we know trying to keep us poor and weak and fearful and impotent guess were not afraid of you were not afraid to die and were coming to get you no wonder the is afraid to admit what the v mask really means yet for the first years of my life i had entirely the wrong idea about the gunpowder what who was really behind and its impact on history an impact that continues to this day it was in that i read i read superb book synthetic made in right after it came off the press he introduced me to the historical the brazen events of and the that followed opened my eyes to terror frauds and the power they deliver to the dark forces that order them but i know from about the gunpowder at that time did i appreciate that it and are but two examples from thousands of false flag operations that have changed flag ops are the category of human deceit in terms of emotional even the most brilliant lies perpetrated by the most talented demagogues in comparison to a big false flag for the power to manipulate the public on this anniversary lets look more closely at this particular false flag op for some lessons as put it in his requiem for a nun the past is never dead its not even past then we will touch briefly on one of the most recent false flag ops a leading edge digital one that perversely misappropriates the the throne of england in sits the a the king who ordered the translation of the bible that bears his midnight approaches on the the eve of the traditional opening of parliament armed agents of the king raid a basement room of the houses of parliament they discover and apprehend one guy his coincides with the number of barrels of gunpowder they find with him they find a tunnel leading to the room is a known agitator for the rights of roman catholics in his possession are a pocket watch rarity in those he succeeded in detonating the the next morning king and his queen

the events of the late evening of the th the public is stunned its the equivalent of a describes it in his book gods the making of the king bible upon his according to the official admits his purpose was to destroy king and there was some kind of plot is not in doubt by the th on the names those not killed where they are tracked down are found guilty of treason later in a trial lasting less than a day they and are drawn and following the the king version of the plot is broadcast from the leading pulpit of the church of that of bishop of thunders that the meaning is satanic in its wickedness the their on the other hand characterized as an unqualifiedly good man virtually a all the pulpits of england echo the official account between and the fifth is remembered in an annual service of thanksgiving in every writes in a cultural history of guy day until it was against the law in not to celebrate guy day because from the beginning the public was giving thanks that the realm was saved and the treasonous conspirators dispatched for centuries effigies of were palace version becomes historical truth for humankind including me duped for most of our and others now cast serious doubt on that version many anomalies concerning the events have was not apprehended in a basement room but rather a ground floor one remarkably easily rented by the plotters there no tunnel the authorship of the letter by which the king learned of the plot is murky it was turned over to the king by the royal sir the earl of i would characterize as the dick of his day because plots were common at that time had an efficient network of spies seeded among roman catholic dissidents he kept tabs on all plots the spies discovered this one featured a large cast of characters from several kept the king in the dark about the plot except for the obscure letter the it turned was of an inferior unlikely to have achieved much result this was as definitely knew a thing or two about gunpowder he had developed

signs that an attempt is being made to sabotage the trump campaign latest video the new times calls for to support a resolution that would divide the land of while most are focused on the endless circus surrounding trump and a drama of importance is playing out behind the scenes most people seem to assume that we have to be concerned about anymore because his second term is scheduled to end in a few but the truth is that an absolutely critical decision is in his hands right now both trump and have said that they will not support a proposed security council resolution that would formally establish a that would set the parameters for the new and that would grant them east as their capital so at this moment there is a tremendous amount of international pressure on to support such a because the veto power on the security council is the only thing standing in the way of formally dividing the land of i wrote about this in august in and now i am writing about it again in if is going to do it needs to happen by and so for the next few months we are officially in the danger zone on the new times editorial board added their voice to the growing chorus of those calling for a parameters resolution in a piece entitled at the boiling point with the best idea under discussion now would be to have the united nations security in an official resolution lay down guidelines for a peace agreement covering such issues as the future of the fate of refugees and borders for both states in the the new times editorial board also strongly endorsed the state departments recent condemnation of plan to build new housing units in the west bank i have included the official state department statement on this matter below just like did at the recently the state department referred to presence in the west bank as an we strongly condemn the governments recent decision to advance a plan that would create a significant new settlement deep in the west bank proceeding with this new which could include up to would further damage the prospects for a two state solution the retroactive authorization of nearby illegal or redrawing of local settlement does not change the fact that this approval contradicts previous public statements by the government of that it had no intention of creating new settlements and this settlements location deep in the west far closer to than would link a string of outposts that effectively divide the west bank and make the possibility of a viable state more remote it is deeply in the wake of and the concluding an unprecedented agreement on military assistance designed to further strengthen that would take a decision so contrary to its long term security interest in a peaceful resolution of its conflict with the it is disheartening that while and the world mourned the passing of president and leaders from the and other nations prepared to honor one of the great champions of plans were advanced that would seriously undermine the prospects for the two state solution that he so passionately supported must ultimately decide between expanding settlements and preserving the possibility of a peaceful two state solution since the recent quartet report called on both sides to take affirmative steps to reverse current trends and advance the two state solution on the we have unfortunately seen just the opposite proceeding with this new settlement is another step towards cementing a reality of perpetual occupation that is fundamentally inconsistent with future as a and democratic state such moves will only draw condemnation from the international distance from many of its and further call into question commitment to achieving a negotiated peace as you can see on the official state department website that press release was issued on at the exact same hurricane was rapidly gaining and it ultimately became the first category hurricane to form in the since it proceeded to slam into the southeastern united causing billions of dollars of damage in the process the following comes from preparations began in earnest across the southeastern united states as with several states declaring a state of emergency for

extended to include and south in over million lost power as the storm passed to the with losing power in and south when will we for decades the pattern has always been the same every time we come against the consequences are immediate and they are dramatic our leaders never seem to and now we stand on the precipice of perhaps the biggest betrayal of of all time here is more from the new times about why they believe it is important to put pressure on in the form of a security council the most plausible pressure would come from leading the security council to put its authority behind a resolution to support a solution and offer the outlines of what that could be that may seem like a bureaucratic response unlikely to change but it is the kind of political pressure abhors and has been working assiduously to prevent such a resolution would not just be a bureaucratic response a security council resolution would be legally binding on both and the and whoever is elected in would not be able to go back and undo it such a resolution would permanently divide the land of it would give formal recognition to a state for the very first and it would hand east over to the and according to the times of the security council could begin discussing these matters as soon as next the security council is expected to hold a session next under the official the settlements as the obstacle to peace and a solution the initiated by the
takes out tank with tow missile by my earliest memories were of being surrounded by machinery and a constant deep mechanical humming rose and fell like the breath of fitful sleep maybe it was the or the like author of the the projects would later claim but i am inclined to believe it was the post natal care room at medical center in where i was born to a well to do family i grew up in my father had a fur business on street and seventh avenue in the city bought him and his partners out when they built the fashion institute of technology from grades one to five i attended the finest catholic school in before i was my family moved to amity harbor long island and from there the volume on the strangeness was turned up full blast my teenage years were spent working on fishing boats at point where my father had been stationed at camp hero for the war back home in we would wile away the night doing performance art for tourists milling around outside my best friends home gawking at the horror some of you may have already met me i was one of the guys throwing beer bottles at you to this day know who was up in that room with him that nobody does but i can take a real good guess by the time i was eighteen i realized that globalism had made the seas off long island barren and i would have to find a new way in life to make a living i had always wanted to be a fisherman but i opened a landscaping business with my mother who was the top woman designer in her field our clients included many celebrities and denizens of long islands gold coast back then it seemed life would always be good i remember one day while dragging trees out some stock brokers yard he pulled up his long driveway in his convertible sports car i looked at his decaying body not much older than mine then i looked down at mine salty sweat encased sinewy bronze muscles pumped full of blood from the days exertion i decided i was just where i wanted to be he would make his for the day and he had to give it to me because there was no way he was dragging that tree down his long driveway little did i know that he and his tribal brethren had a plan over the next twenty years they would flood with illegal immigrants to do my job for a hundred dollars a day things are not so good anymore even with an associates degree in architectural engineering ill never make a day again he makes more because now the government that sold me not once but three times subsidizes his job i wonder how many of his tribe are buried in veterans memorial practically every male member of my family is i ended up on the wrong side of the law when i was years old through no fault of my own i was helping film what i now realize must have been north little cocaine contra excursion into it was never aired he quit his job but i was beaten and tortured by the police then branded as a felon for the rest of my life in i was asked to remove the pagans motorcycle gang from their clubhouse a strip club named the person that asked me was who died abruptly a few years back he owned and a lot of other strip clubs on long island he was a prominent figure in new underworld financially he dwarfed people like and the rest of the menagerie of mutts paraded on as mob bosses it was during that period that i realized i was a member of a very elite unit some would call us soldiers of god others the army of you read what i write and you decide by on the human race has no worse enemy than institutional whose only real job is to dissemble its past by friends its science finally knows enough about science to disprove itself but

it is now mathematically impossible to pay off the national debt by on a lot of people are very upset about the rapidly increasing national debt these days and they are demanding a solution what they realize is that there simply is not a solution under the current financial system it is now mathematically impossible for the government to pay off the national debt you the truth is that the government now owes more dollars than actually exist if the government went out today and took every single penny from every single business and they still would not be able to pay off the national debt and if they did obviously society would stop functioning because nobody would have any money to buy or sell anything and the government would still be massively in debt so why the government just fire up the printing presses and print a bunch of money to pay off the for one very simple reason that is not the way our system works you for more dollars to enter the the government has to go into more debt the government does not issue currency the federal reserve does the federal reserve is a private bank owned and operated for profit by a very powerful group of elite international bankers if you will pull a dollar bill out and take a look at you will notice that it says federal reserve note at the top it belongs to the federal reserve the government cannot simply go out and create new money whenever it wants under our current system it must get it from the federal reserve when the government needs to borrow more money happens a lot these it goes over to the federal reserve and asks them for some more green pieces of paper called federal reserve notes the federal reserve swaps these green pieces of paper for pink pieces of paper called treasury bonds the federal reserve either sells these treasury bonds or they keep the bonds for themselves happens a lot these so that is how the government gets more green pieces of paper called dollars to put into circulation but by doing they get themselves into even more debt which they will owe even more interest on so every time the government does the national debt gets even bigger and the interest on that debt gets even bigger as you read the national debt is approximately trillion although it is going up so rapidly that it is really hard to pin down an exact figure so how much money actually exists in the united states there are several ways to measure this the money supply is the total of all physical bills and plus the money on hand in bank vaults and all of the deposits those banks have at reserve banks as of the federal reserve said that this amount was about billion dollars the money supply includes all of the currency in the money along with all of the money held in checking accounts and other checkable accounts at as well as all money contained in travelers checks according to the federal reserve this totaled approximately trillion dollars in but not all of this money actually exists as we will see in a moment the money supply includes everything in the money supply plus most other savings money market retail money market mutual and small denomination time deposits of deposit of under according to the federal reserve this totaled approximately trillion dollars in but once not all of this money actually exists as we will see in a moment the money supply includes everything in the money supply plus all other time deposits and institutional money market mutual fund deposits of and repurchase agreements the federal reserve does not keep track of but according to it is currently somewhere in the neighborhood of trillion dollars but not all of this money actually exists either so why it it is because our financial system is based on something called fractional reserve banking when you go over to your local bank and deposit they do not keep your in the bank they keep only a small fraction of your money there at the bank and they lend out the rest to someone else if that person deposits the money that was just borrowed at the same that bank can loan out most of that money once again in this the amount of money quickly gets multiplied but in only actually exists the system works because we do not all run down to the bank and demand all of our money at the same time according to the new federal reserve bank fractional reserve banking can be explained this if the reserve requirement is for a bank that receives a deposit may lend out of that deposit if the borrower then writes a check to someone who deposits the the bank receiving that deposit can lend out as the process the banking system can expand the initial deposit of into a maximum of of money so much of the money out there today is basically made up out of thin air in most banks have no reserve requirements at all on savings and certain kinds of money market accounts reserve requirements apply only to transactions deposits essentially checking accounts the truth is that banks are freer today to dramatically multiply the amounts deposited with them than ever before but all of this multiplied money is only on paper it actually exist the point is that the broadest measures of the money supply and vastly overstate how much real money actually exists in the system so if the government went out today and demanded every single dollar from all businesses and individuals in the united states it would not be able to collect trillion dollars or even trillion dollars because those amounts are based on fractional reserve banking so the bottom line is if all money owned by all businesses and individuals was gathered
prescription painkiller why do consume percent of all prescription march if are so then why do we consume percent of the entire global supply of prescription less than percent of the worlds population lives in this and yet we buy of these highly addictive drugs in the united states approximately million are addicted to prescription pain and that represents about a percent increase since if you personally know someone that is suffering from this then you probably already know how immensely destructive these drugs can be someone that was formally living a very healthy and normal life can be reduced to a total basket case within a matter of weeks and of course many make it back at all according to the more than died from opioid overdoses in those deaths represented percent of all drug

painkiller that requires a were involved in of those deaths many that start out on legal quickly find themselves moving over to heroin because it is often cheaper and easier to and the is now facing a tremendous epidemic of heroin abuse as well in the number of that die of a heroin overdose nearly quadrupled between to the federal government has started to take notice of this crisis a bill was recently passed to spend more than a billion dollars over the next two year fighting this problem but as long as doctors are writing thousands upon thousands of new prescriptions for these painkillers each this crisis is not going to go away any time soon in the these prescription painkillers are commonly known as hillbilly heroin and all of the attention that the new primaries received focused a lot of attention on how this crisis is destroying countless numbers of lives up in the northeast but one survey found that the states with the biggest problems with painkiller addiction are actually in the west the national survey on drug use and a survey of approximately people across the united found that the states with the highest rates of narcotic painkiller abuse were in the west new and unless you are about to i would very strongly recommend that you resist any attempt by your doctor to put you on these medications just consider what happened to one mother named i am an suburban wife and mother of four life had been good to me until a fateful visit with an orthopedic my chief complaint being mild arthritic pain in my toes my physician handed me the first of many monthly prescriptions for and what followed that appointment was a rapid descent into hell within six i had become a raving drug addict before too had to turn to means that were less than legal in order to

buns in anticipation of my arrival home from to scarface crushing pills on the glass top of the executive desk in our home office while thinking to myself as i heard them arrive from oh why are they home you can read the rest of her amazing story right here the truth is that we are the most drugged people on the face of the planet it has been estimated that million over the age of have used prescription drugs in and this problem gets worse with each passing year according to research that was published in the journal of the medical percent of all adults are currently on at least one prescription drug and percent of all adults are on at least five prescription drugs and the numbers are far worse for older the following statistics come from one of my previous articles according to the approximately out of every that are at least years old say that they have taken at least one prescription drug within the last month there is an unintentional drug overdose death in the united states every minutes in the united states prescription painkillers kill more than heroin and cocaine combined according to the approximately three quarters of a million people a year are rushed to emergency rooms in the united states because of adverse reactions to pharmaceutical drugs the percentage of women taking antidepressants in is higher than in any other country in the world children in

references the debate it started when an historian and head of the institute for contemporary at the university of penned an for the daily stating that ethnic cleansing is exactly what happened in to support cited the determined that most of the in the over were encouraged to leave or expelled in the first stage of the before the nations armies invaded cc that prompted a response from who wrote an of his own titled conducted no ethnic cleansing in in he contends that distorts history when he says the new state of a country facing invading carried out a policy of expelling the local and betrayed his morris further when he attributed to me things i have never claimed and distorted the events of the war central to argument is that ignores the basic fact that the were the ones who started the war when they rejected the compromise plan and embarked on hostile acts in which were killed between and the neighboring states had threatened to invade even before the resolution was passed on and before a single had been uprooted from his home even prior to the adoption of general assembly resolution which recommended partitioning into separate and they states had continuously declared their intent to attack the state when the left he acknowledges that prior to the declaration of the existence of on may and the subsequent introduction of states regular armies into the a few hundred thousand a number apparently smaller than the figure of cited by were expelled from their homes and forced to flee how can it be true on one hundreds of thousands of were forced from their homes and never allowed to yet also on the that there was no ethnic morris attempts to reconcile the apparent contradiction by arguing that at no stage of the war was there a decision by the leadership of the or the state to expel the in other its true that many were indeed but this was not the result of an official policy of the leadership its true that in the and early morris further and supported the transfer of from the area of the future state but later they supported the whose plan left more than in place its also true that from a certain point during the let his officers understand that it was preferable for as few as possible to remain in the new but he never gave them an order to expel the there was an atmosphere of transfer that prevailed in the country beginning in but this was never translated into official is why there were officers who expelled and others who neither group was reprimanded or punished in the in about remained in fifth of the population on march deputy in the future defense ministry and the head of the ordered all the brigades not to uproot from the territory of the designated state things did change in early due to the shaky condition and the impending invasion but there was no overall expulsion they expelled there they and for the most part the simply fled morris acknowledges that the leadership in adopted a policy of preventing the return of but asserts this was logical and just on the grounds that these were the same refugees who months and weeks earlier had tried to destroy the state in the making what happened in does not fit the definition of ethnic morris concludes the on the other carried out ethnic cleansing and uprooted all the down to the last from any territory they captured in while the left in place in and among other places leaving as forces enter the city public domain that the end of the discussion responded in turn with an titled did perpetrate ethnic cleansing in in he writes on march the national headquarters approved plan which discussed the intention of expelling as many as possible from the territory of the future state with regard to denial that what occurred fits the definition of ethnic quotes the prosecutor in the trial of a leader convicted for the ethnic cleansing of in in ethnic cleansing you act in such a way that in a given the members of a given ethnic group are eliminated you have massacres everybody is not but you have massacres in order to scare those populations the other people are driven away they are afraid of in the end these people simply want to leave they are driven away either on their own initiative or they are deported some women are raped often times what you have is the destruction of the monuments which marked the presence of a given population for catholic churches or mosques are destroyed in other contrary to it follow since there is no document in which the leadership explicitly outlined a plan to expel all or in which military commanders were instructed to do therefore what occurred was not ethnic cleansing what the prosecutor describes is exactly what happened in implied silent sowing fear among the population whose flight is the the destruction of the physical presence left behind quotes from book the birth of the refugee the attacks of the and the defense expulsion the fear of attacks and acts of cruelty on the part of the the absence of assistance from the world and the higher the sense of helplessness and orders by institutions and commanders to leave and in most cases was the direct and decisive reason for the attack by the or the or the inhabitants fear of such an attack the expulsions were not war says because it was the who started the war in other hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians who belong to the side that began the fighting have to be expelled maybe morris would agree that the genocide carried out by the against the in was justified after the began the rebellion against colonialism in next to weigh in on the debate was a editor and adjunct professor
