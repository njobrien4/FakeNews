email at the branch office of the pentagons military alliance in there is a whirl of activity and apart from provoking by announcing an aggressive military surge around its its latest achievement was to have issue a commemorative stamp depicting the new headquarters and its distinctive architecture on a ceremony was held to mark the new but no details were given about the price of the vast palace which will enable all allies to have the space they require and there is also space for expansion should the need arise there is never any mention by of the staggering cost overrun that took but two years ago revealed that it was more than double the original construction at over a billion ten days before the stamp secretary general left the palace to visit a more modest one in where he met pope after his some observers were unkind enough to express surprise that could spare the time for such an but all was made clear when it was announced that the meeting took place in the sidelines of his visit to to celebrate the establishment anniversary of the defense an institution that has contributed generously to the economy his holiness the pope did not of course make a public statement about the but the publicity machine large and remarkably expensive organization that also arranges stamp issue made up for the omission by announcing that he and his illustrious visitor discussed global issues of common including the conflicts in and the wider middle the importance of protecting civilian populations from and the importance of in international affairs to reduce tensions the secretary general also stressed that climate change could pose a significant security risk it is remarkable that his holiness engaged in such deliberations with the titular head of an enormous military and it would be interesting to know if the pope mentioned that he did not always agree with the policies espoused by and his directors in as he averred earlier this year it will be recollected that in patriarch of the orthodox church met with pope in and that western media headlines included pope handed a diplomatic victory which was as absurd as it was trivial but even the economist headline was similarly slanted and amusingly asked did the pope just kiss this set the tone for other but one thrust of its reporting was especially as it pointed out in shocked shocked tones that the pope had made clear in his interview before the meeting that on certain issues he agrees with and disagrees with and its allies how truly dreadful that the pope dares to be impartial and ventures to disagree with and its allies about international affairs the economist further noted that on where western powers helped to bring down former dictator the pope was the west ought to be and he continued that in there has been a convergence of analysis between the holy see and the economist did not mention the unpalatable fact that the western powers the military alliance bombed and rocketed to a catastrophic resulting in anarchy and a base for terrorists perhaps the pope had taken note of that merciless and of the fact that under the dictator the catholic community in had lived peacefully while now it is suffering gravely as recorded by freedom international the upsurge in attacks on in since the supported ouster of is of grave concern condemns these killings and attacks on property in what is becoming an increasingly inhospitable region for perhaps pope raised this with the devout a graduate of cathedral school who was prime minister of when its air force carried out about percent of the in from march to the news that the pope has had the temerity and moral realism to disagree with and its allies is not altogether but the report that on certain issues he agrees with must have shaken whose fundamental stance is that is trying to kind of spheres of influence along its borders and for me this just underlines the importance of strong of strong partnership with other countries in that are not members of believes that because wants to establish more maintain spheres of influence along its borders then it must be discouraged or even stopped from doing so this is and it is unsurprising that his holiness has made it clear that the is not an unconditional supporter of pentagon and its palatial in may not have read the address to the us congress by his holiness in when he said we need to avoid a common temptation to discard whatever proves troublesome let us remember the golden do unto others as you would have them do unto you as reported the line drew thunderous applause from followed with some hesitation by a pattern repeated throughout the address in his talk to congress pope eschewed the line that desire to maintain peaceful spheres of influence around its borders must by definition be wrong and pointed out that there is another temptation which we must especially guard against the simplistic reductionism which sees only good or if you the righteous and sinners as president observed in an interview with we are not expanding it is including military that is moving towards our borders is this a manifestation of our it is not except in the eyes of such as the pentagon and makes many visits round the including attendance at the general assembly in new where he had discussions among president dear its great to see you again and secretary general ban and another recent stopover was in the united emirates on while committing to an individual partnership and cooperation program he praised the for its role as a valuable partner in projecting international security and from to to perhaps meeting with the pope affected his memory he ignores the unpalatable facts that in as freedom house reports there has been little progress in strengthening its while verges on total anarchy as noted war on

she and her running mate continue to set the standard for financial transparency the returns reveal much but they reflect a standard short of full financial transparency more the tax reductions the receive when donating to their foundation and the lower rate of taxes they paid compared to those who make much less reflect some of what is wrong with the tax system gross income is the gross receipts minus their business expenses and of a carried forward capital loss that started in total federal taxes is their income taxes minus foreign tax credits only years plus taxes and additional taxes due to the affordable care act taxes and taxes on investment income starting in for the the foreign tax credit came to or less each year from and arose from work done abroad for years the table below shows the reported gross total federal taxes charitable and the amount of the latter going to the foundation what follows mainly focuses on the tax return income almost all of the gross income after deducting expenses was derived from with the biggest amounts for making speeches more than million made by and million by consulting million made by and writing million made by all of their speaking income is paid by the harry walker agency under who paid the agency or to whom they spoke is not disclosed the tax return indicates that million of bills consulting before deducting was paid by gems education a article describes gems education as the largest operator of private schools in the as of has over schools in over a dozen countries in bill named gems education a strategic partner of the global initiative according to the tax in for the first gems education paid bill raising its payment each year thereafter laureate education paid bill it is described in the new times as a

common and appropriate their expenses deducted for and hotels came to several times what most people earn at their jobs in bill claimed travel expenses of for his speaking an amount considerably less than the spent on travel for that business in by his total travel expenses for his consulting business for and together came to less than travel expenses for making speeches in came to another was spent on travel for her writing business in under specific details such as where they went and and for how are not provided tax income is subject to social security and taxes paid by the in social security taxes were paid on only the first of net income at a rate of resulting in a maximum tax of the portion which is of all net income had no income limits if one adds the tax to their additional tax under the affordable care the total comes to or of their total net income the returns show the gross unfairness of the tax that leaves those with high incomes paying a rate that is much lower than those with significantly less income for a person making of income after deducting expenses would pay a tax of which is over of their or more than times the rate paid by the unearned income from the

form of or bonds by in the made over million in interest income and over in dividends all of the latter is reported as coming from trusts in they also reported over million on the sale of stock held by their trusts most sales were for less than with only one for slightly more the most sales occurred on or before may reflecting very good timing since this was shortly before the financial meltdown their stock holdings were diverse they consisted of holdings in major corporations including bank of general and brothers prior to its bankruptcy at first one might see the as acting upon information that the economy would soon but they may have decided to rid themselves of holdings that might be used against in her run for the presidency in reporting no dividends from probably indicates no into the stock market after the or that they only purchased stocks that paid no dividends there is a huge difference between their total interest and dividend income in of with their interest income of and no dividend income despite the low interest how could their dividend and interest income have plummeted so given the size of their total income all these one has to wonder if they have been spending it all or investing it in ways that do not show up on their tax this raises other questions have they been making large donations or paying large personal legal have they set up an entity that handles investments and pays taxes on the income generated instead of passing it through to them individually to report on their tax charitable contributions those who usually receive the biggest reduction in their taxes per dollar donated are those with the highest income because they are in a higher tax bracket many charitable donors receive no tax reduction because they do not itemize their deductions in the donation to their foundation of million reduced their taxes of the money

email i visited on the day it fell to fighters and a small detachment of us special forces on as we drove into the we passed lines of trucks piled high with loot returning to the enclave in northern us soldiers at a over which waved the stars and were shooting at a man in the distance who kept bobbing up from behind a wall and waving the flag if there had ever been any sympathy between liberators and liberated in it was disappearing fast inside the every government including the was being systematically looted by and alike i saw one man who had stolen an enormous and very ugly red and gold sofa from the governors office dragging it slowly down the street he would push one end of the sofa a few feet forward and then go to the other end and repeat the same process the mosques were soon calling on the majority to build barricades to defend their from marauders we parked our vehicle near a medieval quarter of ancient stone buildings while we went to see a ecclesiastic when we got we found that our driver was very frightened and wanted to get out of as fast as possible he explained that soon after we left a crowd had our number plates as and debated lynching him and setting fire to his car before being restrained by a local religious leader moments before they took action the oil city of was captured at about the same time by the despite having promised the and turks that they would do no such thing there was looting everywhere and i saw two stand in the middle of the road to stop an enormous yellow bulldozer that was being driven off instead of slowing the driver put his foot on the accelerator so the had to jump aside to avoid being crushed inside the newly established i ran into whose father headed the patriotic union of the political party whose militia now held the city he stressed the temporary nature of the occupation of the city we came to control the he said we expect to withdraw some of our men in minutes some but not years later the still hold whose population is and and to which the claim an historic right saying they have only reversed ethnic cleansing by by now the rest of the world has forgotten that there was a time when the did not hold the city the leaders had understood that the invasion and the fall of had created conditions of unprecedented political fluidity and it was an ideal moment to create facts on the which would become permanent whatever the protestations of other players the current offensive aimed at taking is producing a similar situation as different parties and communities vie to fill the vacuum they expect to be created by the fall of just as in the vacuum was the result of the fall of the different segments of the forces potentially involved in seizing the and turks may be temporary but they are also rivals they all have their own very different and conflicting agendas presiding over this ramshackle and disputatious alliance is the which is orchestrating the offensive and without whose air power and special forces there would be no attack the government needs to take and hold main if it is to be convincing as the national government of to achieve rule must be acceptable to the majority

inhabited by both and thereby expanding by per cent the area of the regional government they know that once is the will no longer get international above backing to hold this expanded version of the these problems have only begun to surface because is still a long way from being besieged or even encircled the militia forces are surprisingly calm about being excluded from a military role in the

participation in the battle for by sending reinforcements some according to reports to join the army in the siege of east turkey wants to be a player as a great the defender of the of to this it has

email it was years or so when a classmate at bard college insisted that i read a short story by babel titled the reserve cavalry commander that he described to me as a cossack soldier miraculously bringing a moribund horse to its feet the red cavalry title of babels collection of short stories written when the and former was with had been confiscating peasant horses during the civil war and trading in nags ridden to exhaustion on the battlefield for fresh ones for the backward this was the sort of intrusion that would become the straw that broke the camels back in about a being forced into collective farms like recalcitrant horses drove them into open revolt for the time they were inclined to tolerate the communists who at least had come to power on the promise of bread and land it was the assault on the land that for the time being assuaged the peasants responding to an aggrieved the eponymous reserve cavalry commander who was a former circus rider described by babel as with a gray a black and wide red trousers with silver promised that he could make this lively little mare spring to her feet again the idea that the horse splayed out on the ground could be described as lively was almost an insult the cried lord in heaven and mother of god how is this poor thing supposed to get its on its last ability to bring the horse back on its feet was like raising from the dead but all the more miraculous since it likely occurred most of babels short stories were based on his experience as a war correspondent he you are insulting this my dear answered with fierce conviction pure my dear and he deftly swung his athletes body out of his saddle splendid and deft as if in the circus he stretched his magnificent his trousers girded by cords around the and walked up to the dying animal she peered at him dolefully with a penetrating licked some invisible command from his crimson and immediately the feeble mare felt bracing power flow from this blossoming romeo her muzzle her legs skidding under feeling the whip tickling her stomach with imperious the mare slowly and rose onto her legs and then we all saw slender hand with its fluttering sleeve run through her dirty and his whining whip swatting her bleeding ranks her whole body the mare stood on four legs without moving her lovestruck eyes from so you is a said to the and added and you were my dearest of throwing his reins to his the commander of the reserve cavalry jumped the four stairs in a single leap swirling off his operatic disappeared into the headquarters reading this story once again for the first time in i am reminded of how important babel was to me at the time like and he was a portal into the world of modernist literature that still had an immense attraction for young bohemians in the early i never thought once about who babel was or anything about the social reality he was trying to depict all that mattered to me was babels prose that could evoke the mysterious power of a cossack resurrecting a dying horse my early connections to modernism and my later connections to that superseded it and just about all the other intellectual baggage i carried around with me from the early converged as i watched a press screening of finding babel that opens on th at the cinema village in new directed by who has a background as a sound it is a film that will be of great interest to those whose appreciation of babel is strictly literary as was mine long ago and to those trying to come to terms with the soviet legacy given the prominence of today as a possible trigger of according to babels multiple identity as communist and critic of soviet deficiencies is worth pondering the film is structured around the odyssey conducted by who is the grandson of babel and an acting professor in the theater department of the new college of to see where his grandfather lived and to speak with people who knew him or who have studied or been inspired by his work babel was executed for treason in having been charged with belonging to a group and spying for and babels wife who died at the age of in is interviewed in the film and provides much of the information about babels personality and his travails as a dissident after her husbands arrest in the soviet cops told her to forget about him and to regulate her life according to the new times obituary she was formidable in her own right with her engineering she helped to design the subway system the obit ms recalled babels dismay at her haphazard reading which he tried to correct by drawing up a list of the hundred books that every educated person needs to read it included a volume titled the instincts and morals of insects she recounted evenings spent with soviet cultural giants like the film director m and visits by foreign luminaries like and it was babels mistake apparently to adhere to the values of the original revolution rather than to fall in line as a toady as he travels around encounters intellectuals and ordinary people who revere babel as one of their own especially for another collection of short stories that is as highly regarded as red cavalry written in and the stories focus on gangsters living in an hardly the material expect to find written by a partisan of the revolution but certainly in keeping with the original inspiration of soviet culture that conformed to homo a me or i am and nothing of that which is human is alien to me although i have never read i plan to as soon as i find the time since it is about the same sort
posted by in the world of the is often worse than the original crime it was his role in the that took down and now of her email scandal could send her to prison for a very long time when news broke that the has renewed its investigation into emails it sent throughout the political world but this time we just talking about an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents i heard anyone talking about but if the discovers that destroyed or concealed any emails that should have been turned over to the during the original she could be charged with obstruction of justice that would immediately end her political and if she was found guilty it could send her to prison for the rest of her life i have not seen a single news report mention the phrase obstruction of justice but i am convinced that there is a very good chance that this is where this scandal is heading the following is the relevant part of the federal statute that deals with obstruction of knowingly covers or makes a false entry in any or tangible object with the intent to or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states or any case filed under title or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or shall be fined under this imprisoned not more than or both if is sent to prison for that would essentially be for the rest of her life i have a feeling that the is going to find a great deal of evidence of obstruction of justice in emails but unfortunately there is not likely to be a resolution to this matter before because according to the wall street journal there are approximately emails to search through as federal agents prepare to scour roughly emails to see how many relate to a prior probe of s email the surprise disclosure that investigators were pursuing the potential new evidence lays bare building tensions inside the bureau and the justice department over how to investigate the democratic presidential nominee found on the laptop used by former rep and his estranged wife a close suggests there may be thousands of emails sent to or from the private server that used while she was secretary of according to people familiar with the matter it will take at a to determine whether those messages are from the time ms served with at the state how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the federal bureau of and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the email probe of those an inside source told fox news that at least would be of interest to the investigation at this officials have not even begun searching through the because a search warrant has not been secured yet the following comes from lawyers yet approached lawyers to seek an agreement to conduct the search sources earlier told that those discussions had but the law enforcement officials now say they have not either government lawyers plan to seek a search warrant from a judge to conduct the search of the the law enforcement officials said but the is reportedly already searching a laptop that was by and and no warrant was necessary for that search because is cooperating with the many have been wondering why director would choose to make such a bold move just over a week until election day surely he had to know that this would have a dramatic impact on the and it is unlikely that he would have done so unless someone had already found something really big in was reportedly eager to find an opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of his peers at the the following is an excerpt from a daily mail article that was written by ed the author of a recently released new times bestseller about the entitled guilty as atmosphere at the has been toxic ever since announced last that he recommend an indictment against said the a close friend who has known for nearly two shares family outings with and accompanies him to catholic mass every week some including department stopped talking to and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the said the source they felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting off with a slap on the wrist so what happens in the most likely the will not have time to complete the investigation and decide whether or not to charge before the election this means that we would go into with this scandal hanging over the and that would seem to be very good news for trump it is possible that once the starts searching through these emails that they could come to the conclusion very rapidly that charges against are and if that happens we could still see some sort of announcement before election day in the unlikely event that does we could actually see forced out of the race before once this appears to be very unlikely at this but it is still possible if was forced to step the democrats would need to come up with a new and that process would take time in an article later today on the most important news i will reveal who i believe that nominee would be in such a the democrats would desperately need time to get their act and so we could actually see attempt to delay or suspend the election the legality of such a move is highly but has not allowed a little thing like the constitution to stop him in the past this week is going to be exceedingly interesting that is for sure the craziest election in modern history just keeps getting and i have a feeling that even more twists and turns are ahead it sure seems ironic that is playing such a
the newest batch of emails released from puts in deep trouble bolling read them through and through and discovered that actually has deep terror ties from conservative bolling and his team took the time to sift carefully through the emails announced bolling on the five there are even more revelations in sent an to her campaign chairman john and are funding and the leaked also show staff debated how much outrage she should show lawmakers over at her capitol hill hearing they have lots its like in the last couple of days does it get any more disgusting than gave her personal charity the foundation million and now in her emails we have proof she knew was funding there you have it folks bolling just exposed this is the evidence that the public needed this will destroy for share it deserves to know the
email print this has been the worst week for and the best week for the people for have accepted that is simply too big to jail we began to lose hope when the let her off the hook the first but it appears director knew he had to correct a major wrong an avalanche of investigations has now occurred against her and her foundation director made the announcement in a letter last afternoon that the bureau will be reopening the investigation into illegal use of a private email server two days the opened a second investigation into the foundation as on we have reports that two more investigations have been opened by the the third investigation spawned from releasing thousands emails and documents purporting that the foundation was linked to child exploitation and the fourth investigation entails the reviewing the foundation for tax money and many other things sure does make history second time she has been under criminal investigation this year as a presidential candidate martin according to sources with the it is being heavily reported that director has ordered all agents in the field office and building headquarters to report to work immediately morning were preparing for many arrests from the top an source stated i cannot elaborate beyond that when the source was asked to elaborate on what he meant by from the top he a smart read between the lines protocol indicates that two scenarios could be unfolding in this the is either preparing to obtain search warrants where they will search any and everything dealing with the foundation or they are preparing to make arrests on any and all individuals involved they are preparing to carry out both actions we cannot confirm what documents the but an source has indicated that they are preparing to make arrests in the coming days we are unsure if that means but we are confident that many of her cronies will be arrested and charged with several crimes in the coming days the has the opportunity to right their wrongs they have more than enough evidence to charge do your job martin at this here is a list of the crimes and her team are being investigated for by the money laundering sex crimes with minors perjury pay to play through foundation obstruction of justice other felony crimes the would not open several investigations weeks before a presidential election unless the evidence was overwhelming for the first time in it appears that no one is too big to a sources with with the are indicating that orders have come down from the very top that they will be taking actions immediately against her and her foundation charges for these crimes would result in long prison sentences as well as hefty fines they would also result in losing this election in a complete landslide we very well may see arrested by the in the coming days time will tell stay tuned if you checked out and liked our please go here and do so leave a comment

yahoo news director wrote his bombshell letter to congress on about newly discovered emails that were potentially pertinent to the investigation into private email server before agents were able to review any of the material because the bureau had not yet gotten a search warrant to read three government officials who have been briefed on the probe told yahoo news when wrote the he had no idea what was in the content of the one of the officials referring to recently discovered emails that were found on the laptop of disgraced the estranged husband of top aide is under investigation for allegedly sending illicit text messages to a girl as of the had still not gotten approval from the justice department for a warrant that would allow them to read any of the newly discovered and therefore are still in the dark about whether they include any classified material that the bureau has not already seen we do not have a a senior law enforcement official said discussions are underway the and the justice as to the best way to move forward that and other senior officials were unaware of what was in the emails and whether they contained any material the had not already obtained is important because the campaign of trump and republicans in congress have suggested that the director would not have written his letter unless he had been made aware of significant new emails that might justify reopening the investigation into the server but a message that wrote to all agents seeking to explain his decision to write the controversial letter strongly hinted that investigators did not not yet have legal authority establishing probable cause to review the content of emails on electronic devices in that told agents that he had only been briefed on about the matter and that the recommendation of investigators was with respect to seeking access to emails that have recently been found in an unrelated case approved the recommendation to seek judicial access to the material that he wrote because those emails appear to be pertinent to our i agreed that we should take appropriate steps to obtain and review he told agents letter to congress has brought the director under withering criticism top justice department officials were described by a government source as apoplectic over the letter senior officials strongly discouraged from sending telling officials last week it would violate longstanding department policy against taking actions in the days before an election that might influence the a official familiar with the matter told yahoo news he was acting independently of the guidance given to said the official insisted in his message to agents that he felt he had an obligation to inform congress about the new material because he had previously testified that the bureaus investigation into the email server was completed he said it would be misleading to the people were we not to supplement the record he given that we know the significance of this newly discovered collection of i want to create a misleading impression the decision to send the letter said the senior law enforcement official and top officials debated what course to take once they learned about the discovery on laptop said to include thousands of emails in the the official feared that if he chose to move forward and seek access to the emails and immediately alert the efforts would leak to the media and the director would be accused of concealing information this was the least bad the senior official said but letter to congress suggesting that the might now revisit the email probe may have been even more some critics charged this letter is troubling because it is vaguely worded and leaves so many questions sen the ranking democrat on the senate judiciary and three other democrats on the panel wrote and attorney general lynch it is not clear whether the emails identified by the are even in the custody of the whether any of the emails have already been whether secretary sent or received or whether they even have any significance to the previous the senators wrote a yahoo news review of interview with agents last when the email probe was in full swing shows that the longtime aide hinted that there might be relevant material on her husbands personal devices but agents do not appear to have followed up on the clues who served as deputy chief of staff and held a security disclosed she had access to four email accounts while working at the state department these included an official state department email but also an account on private email server that used to communicate with and her top as well as a personal yahoo account she used both the email account and the yahoo account to routinely forward state department emails and documents so she could more easily print she said in she told the she had a separate email account that she had previously used to support her husbands political activities interview conducted by agents at the field office last was the first that the longtime aide might have circulated official state department material among her multiple accounts at one agents even confronted on one apparently sensitive email about policy towards that had been forwarded to her state department account from an aide to the late then a special state department envoy to and had forwarded the email to her yahoo account in order to print but told agents she was unaware of the classification of the document and stated that she did not make judgments on the classification of material she received she relied on the sender to make that assessment and to properly make and transmit the document there is no indication from the report on the that the agents ever pressed her on what has now turned into an explosive issue in

by health impact staff and say they are heartbroken they say their children are heartbroken also their children are remaining in state even though there are no abuse or neglect and even though the children are suffering and want to come home the children remain in public school and state despite judge harts previous ruling to allow the children to be see previous judge allows mother to her own children denies request to vaccinate children while in state custody judge hart ruled on that the children should continue to while in state custody for purposes of consistency to keep the children in the same school setting they were in before entering state custody since they will continue to be once they go and added that the children would be going home according to when cps defied judge harts ruling to allow the children to continue to the were certain that judge hart would have no option but to send the children home on and punish the social workers who defied his ruling see previous cps defies judges order to keeps children in public school but when they went to court on the said it was like judge hart was a completely different person than he had been during the adversary hearing in and rather than dealing with cps refusal to the the hearing focused only on presenting a lengthy list of services the must complete before they can get their children home and out of public school and state custody with some of his children during a cps supervised visit and maintain that their children should never have been taken into state custody in the first and that the list of cps services they must now complete are a not only a waste of but also a waste of since there never was any abuse or and cps allegedly never even substantiated any of their allegations although there were some supervision concerns since their old escape artist got into the front yard momentarily without their the say that their daughter getting into the yard alone was an accident could happen to any and once they learned of locks were immediately added to the garage doors to prevent any further escapes the are outraged that their lives have been turned upside their children abused and traumatized in state their reputation slandered in the and the main who called cps and started this entire ordeal is not even a credible according to the caller that called cps to begin ended up changing her story several times under oath was discovered to be a manufacturer who sells is a felon with a long criminal record that may have been on drugs when she made that cps report that started this nightmare children remain in custody as recalled that at the close of the adversary hearing on judge hart declared that he saw nothing to necessitate terminating parental and that his only concerns were some supervision issues that could be easily fixed even though there was no substantiated abuse or judge hart ruled that the children had to remain in saying his hands were tied because the family left in before bringing the children in for cps even though there was no court order preventing the family form leaving the and they allegedly did nothing illegal by doing so the explain that they left to protect their children from the overzealous cps worker who was harassing them at home and traumatizing the children the also contend and they have spoken with attorneys who agree that the children were illegally extradited from back to according to the cps has defied judges broken and committed perjury over and yet they suffer no consequences the who claim their only wrongdoing was making a mistake and not noticing when their followed continue to suffer at the hands of a corrupt system are the being made an example of because they left and exposed corruption within the family believes that judge harts ruling to keep the children in state care is retaliation because the they continue to expose the corruption of cps and the family court system studies have shown that children are worse off in foster homes than if they remained in a troubled and many argue that foster care itself is a form of child causing emotional trauma for children in despair for her i think my body could make this many tears their joy is gone their happy faces are sad now oh heavenly please lord please let anything happen to are they living with genuinely abused kids that are acting out towards my husband i are supposed to just sit hands tied not help were to hang tight knowing that abused kids possibly sicko adults are living amongst them in the heavily populated group for more information on grim foster care the foster care modern day slavery and child trafficking no consequence for cps defying it was shocking to the that cps could get away with defying the judges previous ruling about homeschooling their children according to cps said that they tried to find a curriculum but were unsuccessful they mentioned something about a schooling option to do at the foster homes but that each kid had to have a laptop in order to do it so it was not an option they say they also said that they spoke to homeschooling coalition that they offer anything that would allow cps to take the kids to for their schooling they said that they find a foster family willing to the children they said that the kids are doing really well in school they said that they having any behavioral issues they said that the schools have reported that the brighten up the that they enjoy having them as students they said that the kids are enjoying except for was heartbroken that judge hart would not even let her discuss any of the options she had written down to present in court as to how to

group the treatment groups consist a exercise completed during the first two weeks of class in the the intervention plus text and email messaging throughout the full academic and the intervention plus coaching in which students are assigned to undergraduate students who act as coaches students in the control group are given a personality test measuring the big five personality traits figure our main results on course grades we find large positive effects from the coaching amounting to approximately a increase in average course we also find that coached students experience a increase in in we find no effects on academic outcomes from either the exercise or the text messaging even after investigating potentially heterogeneous treatment effects across several student including incoming high school and whether students live on residence figure main effects of interventions our results suggest that the benefits of personal coaching are not easily replicated by interventions using technology many successful coaching involve regular interaction facilitated either by mandatory meetings between coaches and students or proactive coaches regularly initiating contact and and baker cook et et our coaches initiated contact and built trust with students over in person and through text messaging through a series of the coaches could understand the problems students were facing and provide clear ending most conversations with students being able to take at least one specific action to help solve their current problems our text messaging campaign offered weekly academic resource and but did not initiate communication with individual students about specific issues help with writing or an upcoming the team often invited students to reply to messages and share their concerns but was unable to do this with the same efficacy as a nor were we able to establish the same rapport with students our inability to reach out to all students and softly guide the conversation likely prevented us from learning the important details of their specific problems although we provided answers and advice to the questions we we did not have as much information on the students backgrounds as our coaches and thus could not tailor our responses to each students specific circumstances our coaches were also able to build trust with students by

comments former us attorney general holder just wrote an warning the people to disregard the director unprecedented decision to release information about an ongoing investigation during the heat of an election released a vague memo when he had little more to go on other than a mere suspicion and is now facing bipartisan calls for removal from office democratic congressional staffers now claim that their first warning of the memo was when a house republican tweeted it out with the usual spin that alone demonstrates exactly what holder wrote about preventing investigations from unfairly or unintentionally casting public which happened nearly instantly on afternoon former attorney general holder also pointed out that newly discovered emails have no known significance and that the director violated long standing policies in the department of justice which are aimed at upholding the integrity of form of electoral free from government i understand the gravity of the work our justice department performs every day to defend the security of our protect the uphold the rule of law and be fair that is why i am deeply concerned about director b decision to write a vague letter to congress about emails potentially connected to a matter of and interest that decision was incorrect the department also has a policy of not taking unnecessary action close in time to election day that might influence an elections outcome these rules have been followed during republican and democratic administrations they designed to help any particular individual or to serve any political interest they are intended to ensure that every investigation proceeds fairly and to maintain the public trust in the departments ability to do its job free of political and to prevent investigations from unfairly or unintentionally casting public suspicion on public officials who have done nothing wrong director broke with these fundamental principles i fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the justice department and the and he has allowed again without improper motive misinformation to be spread by partisans with less pure intentions we have learned that the importance of the discovery itself may have been overblown according to the director there is no indication yet that the newly discovered emails bear any significance at all and because of his decision to comment on this development before sufficient facts were the public has faced a torrent of conspiracy theories and misrepresentations high ranking former justice department officials like holder do not make a career out of slamming their former so its a very rare break in the ranks to see a former attorney general publicly slam his former subordinate the hatch act prevents federal officials from interfering in partisan elections and strictly demands that public officials refrain from doing anything that could impact an election holder wrote i served with and i know him well this is a very difficult piece for me to write he is a man of integrity and honor i respect him but good men make mistakes in this he has committed a serious error with potentially severe implications it is incumbent upon him or the leadership of the department to dispel the uncertainty he has created before election day it is up to the director to correct his mistake not for the sake of a political candidate or campaign but in order to protect our system of justice and best serve the people director knew better than to release a vague memo about an ongoing even under normal should never be done that is why former attorney general holder felt compelled to rebuke him in this scathing the current members of the justice department tasked with reviewing the bipartisan complaints read the memo and expedite their decision concerning the future of the director it should not take long for any rational investigator to determine that cry wolf memo was little more than a partisan prop handed to a failing campaign and to remove the director from his office
the trump campaign is having a collective nervous breakdown after the letter about new emails failed to swing the election in his direction of the post tweeted a view from inside the trump my read of they know the path is very narrow they see the pub and but they scrambling map many of them describe the way to not as a direct shot but a series of upsets and bank of strong r showing depressed d turnout but list of hurdles goes on and on and highly organized early vote top hitting trail news also enthusing d voters what you seeing is a small group of aides who truly believe trump pitch can put new things in in spite of data the trump campaign is now that reality detached place where a few true believers are running the show this is why trump is going to spend the last week of his presidential campaign in blue states that he has no chance of winning trump still thinks that he can win and new might be the most laughable of three delusions because trump was routed in the republican primary and support from republicans like and walker has been lukewarm at best these are the final days that all losing campaigns go through when the nominee refuses to accept the likelihood of their defeat the letter move the needle for trump it give him a surge of national momentum or make the majority of voters rethink their support for the emails save so now he is going to waste his time campaigning in states that he will lose in search of a miracle as his poorly managed presidential bid stumbles to the finish line

last night hi i wanted to reach out to say thanks for the principled and nuanced stance the secretary took last night on encryption and the tech sector leadership at apple certainly noticed and i am sure that is true though out the valley please know that apple will continue its work with law enforcement we share law enforcement concerns about the threat to citizens and we work closely with authorities to comply with legal requests for data that have helped solve complex crimes thousands of times every we give governments information about apple customers and in response to warrants and other forms of legal process we have a team that responds to those requests hours a day strong encryption does not eliminate apple ability to give law enforcement or any of a number of other very useful categories of data and apple will be featured on we expect encryption and taxes to be covered in reacts strongly to the tax investigation of apple and other companies we will amplify encryption messaging tomorrow when we publicly release our comments on the draft investigatory powers bill best wishes to you and your family and the family for a peaceful and joyous holiday season and a prosperous and bright her comments about handing over data to the government are in marked contrast to the strong statement on encryption made by apple chief executive cook earlier this year when the demanded that apple hand over data on an apple belonging to one of the two people who participated in a terrorist attack in was referring to comments made by during the third debate between candidates for the democratic presidential nomination the email was released by which has gained access to a trove of correspondence from account in that debate was talked a lot about bringing tech leaders and government officials but apple cook said removing encryption tools from our products altogether would only hurt citizens who rely on us to protect their data so would you force him to give law enforcement a key to encrypted technology by making it her response would not want to go to that point i would hope given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law that there could be a something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they not they got to be on two terrorists shot and killed people and injured others in early this there was a pitched battle between the and apple over a demand by the former that data on an be handed over to law enforcement authorities the issue went to court and the finally backed down in what appears to be an effort to stay in the good know that apple will continue its work with law enforcement we share law enforcement concerns about the threat to citizens and we work closely with authorities to comply with legal requests for data that have helped solve complex crimes thousands of times every we give governments information about apple customers and in response to warrants and other forms of legal process we have a team that responds to those requests hours a day strong encryption does not eliminate apple ability to give law enforcement or any of a number of other very useful categories of she chief and apple will be featured on we expect encryption and taxes to be covered in reacts strongly to the tax investigation of apple and other companies we will amplify encryption messaging tomorrow when we publicly release our comments on the draft investigatory powers here we go rampant this time from apple just like apple has a public and a private position the public position for the gullible sleeping consumer care about your hence our the other for the government worry we can give you whatever you and you would never have known if not for the emails
he roamed the streets of for six raping women as they walked to work or headed home from parties in the dark to keep them from fighting he smashed their heads with rocks and wrapped his hands around their necks sometimes he threatened them with a gun police became unable to identify him even though they had his from the crimes desperate for a they checked a database of convicted but came up they searched for a partial match to see whether he had a relative in the database they got lucky the man had a brother in which led authorities to the assailant the is one of a handful of cases that authorities have quietly solved in recent years using a controversial technique that scours an offender database for a son or brother of an elusive crime suspect the state early success using familial searches to identify the serial killer led police chief beck to predict that the method would the way policing is done in the united civil liberty groups expressed saying the searches raised significant ethical and privacy concerns some questioned their legality since familial has made more modest progress than beck predicted but has also gained wider respect eight other states have followed formally embracing the technique as a tool and though many opponents still express approach has won over some previous skeptics who say they are impressed with the state strict policies limiting its use and the measured successes using the method helped detectives in the state identify two including the grim and five men wanted for sexual according to the attorney general office early last authorities arrested a county man accused of sneaking into children bedrooms and cutting holes in their pajamas before molesting them a few months a man was arrested on suspicion of raping and sodomizing a woman along a bike path a county judge in sentenced a man to life in prison for raping a coffee shop employee then barricading her inside a refrigerator lab officials look for a relative by scanning genetic profiles in the offender database and looking for samples that match with a along but not markers from testing method focuses on part of the passed down along the male identifying or full brother relationships as more genetic markers for people are entered into offender the technology will become more said geneticist a professor at university medical school and a leading authority on the technique that could help officials identify more distant relatives and track down criminals who are in the he said technology is demonstrable said pioneered the use of familial for crime solving more than a decade ago in one of the earliest detectives reopened the killing of a woman in wales and compared from the assailant to genetic profiles in database of known offenders in they got a partial match to a boy the teen was alive at the time of the but detectives used the clue to focus on his who eventually pleaded guilty to the murder despite that conviction and the technology took some time to catch on in the and was used only sporadically among its earliest uses was the arrest of the serial which came after officials subpoenaed a tissue sample from his daughter pap smear taken at a medical clinic times a familial test led to the arrest of l shown making a court appearance via video in the torture and serial murder case in by an impassioned debate on the technology was percolating at the capitol in gov jerry brown then the state attorney general began fielding letters and visits from urging him to consider using familial his were concerned approving the method might cause federal judges to shut down the whole database on constitutional grounds in brown enacted a comprehensive familial policy making the first state in the country to do so under the familial is only to be used as a when all other investigative angles have been exhausted so the state department of justice has run familial many of them repeat such as in the grim sleeper case an initial search turned up but state officials ran another scan in a partial match came back to a man added to the database after a arrest for firearm and drug offenses detectives zeroed in on the man franklin who lived close to where many of the bodies were dumped in south detectives believe franklin killed at least women over more than two decades he was sentenced to death in august nabbing franklin changed things for law school dean who once condemned using to find suspects by searching for relatives argued that the method invades privacy rights and is racially discriminatory because and are disproportionately represented in databases although she still worries about the racial she said her view shifted after seeing the effect on big such as and how infrequently the technology is used it helping us solve big seems like a worthwhile eight other states and have protocols for the use of familial and the technology has also been used informally by agencies elsewhere but the growing popularity of the technique has raised alarms for some privacy such as chief attorney for the forensic division of the office of the public defender mercer successfully lobbied for his state formal ban on familial searches is the only other jurisdiction to prohibit them outright searching for relatives through partial matches is he and raises concerns about the amendment prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure is a slippery he said critics also warn that partial matches can point authorities to innocent people in the technology led police in an city to wrongfully suspect a

email director of the federal bureau of investigation is again under this time by supporters of for permitting the of the investigation into her use of personal servers to store and send classified the second round of a scandal that could prove fatal to the democratic nominee chance to occupy the oval office in republicans had their own go at when he declared after the original investigation of mishandling of classified documents and information that there was insufficient evidence to charge her with any criminal violation it has become a punching bag being worked over by partisans on both sides of the political aisle regarding the sound and fury coming out of the they do see that their candidate has fallen into a pit she dug for herself she or should have that there are rules governing the treatment and transmission of data that could place national security in danger she broke those and despite what whether she did so knowingly or not is as the requisite mental state codified into the regulation is that is to in order to be in violation of the relevant one need only fail to take reasonable care in the behavior in question it is beyond dispute that there was a duty of and behavior fell well below that bar what is also beyond dispute is that neither the republicans when was exonerated or the democrats when the whole affair was brought back into the light of investigation ever questioned the authority of the to carry on as a federal police force the larger the constitutional is why does the federal government have an armed police force with nearly unlimited authority home and and with the power to conduct most of its work in beyond the oversight of the whose interest they ostensibly perhaps has hit upon the answer to that question in an article published on the mises wire writes of the federal government law enforcement of all federal police the is the most and every agent is assumed to be the modern embodiment of a fictionalized version of and efficient decades of pop culture has driven this home with series and movies such as the untouchables the story and this is your have long perpetuated the idea that when local police the will step in to be more effective and simply better than every other law enforcement agency corruption cannot touch the we are and they apply the law equally to everyone according to a piece penned in for reporter painted a less egalitarian picture of the application of the a ripple of protest swept across the in late march after the disclosure that the federal bureau of investigation was teaching its agents that the has the ability to bend or suspend the law to impinge on the freedom of others this maxim was inculcated as part of training the exposure of the training material sparked by a series of articles by spurred the ritual declaration by an spokesman that mistakes were and we are correcting those mistakes no officials were sanctioned or fired for teaching lawmen that they were above the law at least the has been consistent since its founding in the bureau has rarely let either the statute book or the constitution impede its public service the author of a superb expos of the legacy of ashes has delivered a riveting chronology of some of the biggest crimes with his new enemies there no question that in its roughly years of the has seen its reputation rise and fall recites a bit of recent history in support of his assertion that the creation and the continuation of the as a federal secret police force is an assault on the liberty of the united the reality and the of have always been two totally different and it helpful to remind ourselves that it was the that was in charge of the massacre where children were killed it was the that led the raid on randy weaver house where an sniper shot a woman dead while she was holding a old baby it was the that spied on martin and targeted peaceful organizations for political reasons during the and it was the that came of age arresting opponents of the first world war in all of these the has actively covered up the facts and denied wrongdoing the history lesson looks further back to the beginnings of the to illuminate the transformation of the from force no less to powerful partner in the surveillance thanks to war hysteria during world war the rose to prominence as shock troops against peaceful opponents of the persecuting and prosecuting political enemies of the state would become something of the forte of the with the role of the agency being expanded ever more during times of perceived national crisis the idea of the as a organization the primary message of fawning treatments of the such as the untouchables and the story for decades served as cover for the political activities as foreign policy pointed

grant the federal government or any of its associated agencies any intelligence gathering and federal not only is the assumption of its current role as federal police force and armed branch of the

email it is especially painful for as an to see that two small cities in northern and have rent control proposals on the ballot this election year there are various other in other places around the for and against minimum wage which likewise make me wonder if the economics profession has failed to educate the public in the most elementary economic lessons neither rent control nor minimum wage laws nor price control laws in general are new price control laws go back as far as ancient and and they have been imposed at one time or other on every inhabited continent history alone should be able to tell us what the actual consequences of such laws have since they have been around for thousands of years anyone who has taken a course in economics should understand why those consequences have been so different from what their advocates expected it is not rocket science advocates of a rent control law are saying things like will prevent some landlords from gouging tenants and making a ton of money off the housing the reason there is a housing crisis in the first place is that existing laws in much of prevent enough housing from being built to supply the apartments and homes that people want if landlords were all and never raised that would still not get one new building built rising rents are a symptom of the problem the actual cause of the problem is a refusal of many officials to allow enough housing to be built for all the people who want to rent an apartment supply and demand is one of the first things taught in introductory economics textbooks why it should be a mystery to people living in an upscale community people who have probably graduated from an expensive college is the real puzzle supply and demand is not a breakthrough on the frontiers of knowledge a century virtually any economist could have explained why preventing housing from being built would lead to higher and why rent control would further widen the gap between the amount of housing supplied and the amount demanded not to mention such other consequences as a faster deterioration of existing since upkeep gets neglected when there is a housing shortage today economists have advanced to far more complicated problems it is as if we had the world greatest mathematicians but most college graduates could do arithmetic part of the problem is that even our most prestigious colleges seldom have any real curriculum requirements that would ensure that their graduates had at least a basic understanding of science or other fundamental subjects many students and their parents spend great amounts of and go into for an education that too often leaves them illiterate in economics and ignorant of many other subjects part of the problem is that many college graduates do not take a single course in economics another part of the problem is that many economics departments leave the teaching of introductory economics in the hands of some junior or transient faculty or even graduate students who get stuck with the job one of the things that made me proud of the economics department at when i taught decades was that teaching the introductory economics course was the job of a full even if not the same professor every year in all too many subjects the introductory course is taught by junior transient faculty or graduate while the full professors teach only upper level courses or postgraduate courses that may save a department the expense of staffing the introductory course with their more highly paid members it is extravagantly expensive from the standpoint of society as a when it means sending graduates out into the world unable to see through the wasteful economic hokum spread by politicians that is how you get voters who support price controls of many without understanding that prices convey economic realities that do not change just because the government changes the prices it is as if someone fever was treated by putting the thermometer in cold water to bring the temperature reading down you do get more housing with rent control is a senior fellow at the ca his website is to find out more about and read features by other creators syndicate columnists and visit the creators syndicate at please keep your comments on topic with the article if you wish to comment on another you may search for a relevant article and join or start a discussion there
email the underpinnings of a decent society are neutral laws laws that favor no particular individual or group and the impartial enforcement of those laws the supreme court job is to ensure the impartial enforcement of our laws but our two presidential candidates differ in their visions of court appointees says that she would broadly and widely for people who represent the diversity of our and that need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of women rights on behalf of the rights of the in trump will appoint justices like justice will protect our liberty with the highest regard for the limited government and rule of law are whereas justices who stand up for the rights of particular individuals are let look at a simple example of the benefit of neutral rules and their impartial enforcement football teams spend four quarters battling each other after the players and coaches shake hands and often hug one another their competitive struggle ends as well as on friendly because the whom we can think of as enforce neutral rules impartially there would be a different outcome if referees exercised compassion instead of impartial rule enforcement let be specific on the steelers and the browns will play so far this the browns have not won a single their record is on top of this sad the browns have not had a winning season since by the steelers have had a losing season since in anyone this is a gross disparity on should the referees have the empathy to understand what it like to be a perennial what would you think of a referee whose decisions are guided by let be explicit in the name of compensatory referees might stringently apply pass interference or roughing the passer violations against the steelers and apply the rules less stringently against the browns another question would you support a referee who refuses to make defensive pass interference calls because he thinks it a silly you probably remind him that the league makes the not referees most people would agree that football justice requires that referees apply the rules blindly and independent of the records or any other characteristic of the two teams they would also agree that referees should impartially apply the rules of the game even if they personally disagree with some of the rules if referees exercised football games would not end so peaceably losing coaches and players would not feel a need to go back to the drawing board and figure out how they could improve themselves they would focus their energies on choosing sympathetic referees the essence of a supreme court justice job is just like that of a referee impartially enforcing the our rules of the game the status of a person appearing before the court should have absolutely nothing to do with the rendering of a decision that why lady often appearing on court is shown wearing a blindfold it to indicate that justice should be meted out regardless of power or weakness as justice oliver should know the rules by which the game is played doubt as to the value of some of those rules is no sufficient reason why they should not be followed by the in other the legislative branch makes the not judges true justice must be settled by process such were the rules unbiased and evenly if any outcome of the game of life is just decisions based upon empathy would make it unjust please keep your comments on topic with the article if you wish to comment on another you may search for a relevant article and join or start a discussion there

views comments guest posts by my friend roger is a staunch democrat supporter he is in his seventies and has always voted democrat him and i have had countless discussions over the many years that we have known each other his paternal roots are and he sees himself to be on the left side of but of him and i have not been able to see on the race to the issue he is with the view that has inherited a financial and military disaster and did the best he and that he should not be blamed for his failure to perform as many did after his elaborate and successful yes we can slogan he supported and other domestic reform and this is perhaps where roger and i stop to agree and start to disagree including look at the appalling record of the republican party and try to paint a tainted image of it the party that is affectionately called the grand old party or the by its own staunch supporters certainly has enough such records to put it up there with charges of global mayhem and genocide the has given birth to people like the and of who can forget is another character that comes to one that no thinking man could trust with a a federal senator who commands authority that no one seems to be able to either understand the mandate or challenge at the end of the infamous line republican well at least thus enter trump and what a character he need one say god forbid if this article may be read like a defense of the the is run by the rich and the and as described by w bush by the haves and have more it is the party of dick who saw in an opportunity to generate contracts for if tens of hundreds of thousands of had to die for him to achieve his he would not and did not blink this is the party that condones and feeds it is the party that has huge control over the media it is the party that runs the world like it is a business enterprise and whether the rest of the world likes it or until the current global status quo no political party in the world affects the rest of the world like the ruling party in the united states whilst elections in other countries are domestic affairs that affect domestic politics of the country elections have implications that are not only domestically but have a much further global reach that encompasses every corner of the world as a i am much more concerned about the wider global implications of politics than the domestic ones this is not to say that i am indifferent about and the people as a matter of not only do i have close friends who live in but also close family members and i have grave concerns for all mankind in every corner of the by my interest in politics remains focused on foreign policy and to this i am only able to relate to the choice between the major two parties from the perspective of their foreign policies as insists to be the world police and the a stature many are refusing to accept that they have already it must accept what comes with it and concede that the rest of the world is hoping that the people will choose the better candidate as the new or should i say the one who is less harmful to the world in between and who fits the this is the question enough has been recently said about health to write a horror novel her and alleged recent case of pneumonia have made headlines as if not bigger than her infamous hidden allegations of involvement in the murder of an ambassador and even selling arms to very recently the issue of the emails is resurfacing and very late in the perhaps late enough to serve with a knock out her zeal to reach the seems to have been in her mind even before bills scandal back in was prepared to publicly support appear to forgive him and move because she had a bigger fish to the she somehow managed to hush down all other sex allegations against all the and trying to score mileage from similar allegations against trump her unabated lust for power will not stop at anything for as long as she ends up at the the first female even if she has to be commander in chief from behind the control button of a wheelchair there are even observations and allegations that many people who have campaigned against her have died under suspicious circumstances whether this mystery is going to be taken up by main stream media just on the eve of the elections to serve her with yet another knock out remains to be seen her uncontrollable laughs and hysterical facial expressions leave many questions unanswered in between the two front runners and it is hard to say that she presents herself as the sane and rational choice is there a distinction on foreign affairs perhaps but not historically for some the republican party is seen as the party of the hawks and the democrats are seen as the doves but are to answer this question in an unbiased we ought to look back at history notwithstanding the history of the the father and the and what is really the history of the democratic a few landmark historical decisions make it very clear so let us start with current events before we dwell into recent history that some might have chosen to forget the war on was the brainless child of the a spring that was heralded by the visit of an president to and a speech he made to clergy at university the presidents name is and he is a democrat speech was a subtle endorsement for the and to be specific to the street

entered politics and rose to assistant secretary of the navy he resigned during the organized the first volunteer the rough and captured hill elected under he became youngest president in republican was the first president to invite an booker t to dine in the white house on a southern democrat newspapers condemned him as printed in the the most damnable outrage which has ever been perpetrated by any citizen of the united states was committed yesterday by the when he invited a to dine with him at the white house it would not be worth more than a passing notice if had sat down to dinner in his own home with a car but the individual and the president are not to be viewed in the same light in the thought of modern industry in the hands of charity is a dream worth dreaming the thought of industry in the hands of paganism is a nightmare beyond imagining the choice between the two is upon us in the new bible society had write a message which was inscribed in a pocket new testament book

whereas their the have not been pacifists but militarists fear p have been subjected to wrongs far greater than any that have been committed since the close of the wars the wars of khan and in yet this government has not raised its hand to do anything to help the people who were wronged this course of national infamy began when the last administration surrendered to the peace and started the negotiation of its foolish and wicked all inclusive arbitration treaties individuals and nations who preach the doctrine of invariably have in them a softness of fiber which means that they fear to

protest when this initial wrong was committed the devastation of and has been awful beyond description and has been associated with infamies surpassing those of the dreadful religious and racial wars of the and timid policy of the professional pacifists is just as responsible as the policy of the ruthless and unscrupulous militarist for the terrible recrudescence of evil on a gigantic scale in the civilized world the crowning outrage has been committed by the turks on the they have suffered atrocities so hideous that it is difficult to name atrocities such as those inflicted upon conquered nations by the followers of and of khan it is dreadful to think that these things can be done and that this nation nevertheless remarks neutral not only in deed but in between right and the most hideous neutral between despairing and hunted people whose little children are murdered and their women and the victorious and evil trust that all worthy of the name feel their deepest indignation and keenest sympathy aroused by the dreadful atrocities i trust that they feel that a peace obtained without righting the wrongs of the would be worse than any will only be stopped by men who are brave as
