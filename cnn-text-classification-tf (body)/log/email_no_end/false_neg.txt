nails it my wife and i have just returned from across for six weeks we looked for election signs all the way the only trump sign we saw was on the trump tower he once owned in we saw one a damp print in a front yard in the lefty area of the night of the second we saw one sanders same same area we did see two feel the bumper stickers on a car at an surf beach this was the only bumper sticker we began in across the and west to we through to st then through central up into then to across and to where i mailed my absentee ballot yet most significant was what we never the word republican nor the word anywhere on any sign or poster everywhere we saw posters and signs for candidates for the for state senators and and sheriffs all avoided listing their much attention has been focused on the timing of chief letter to congress saying his agency is investigating more emails potentially related to he chose to issue the letter just days before the hotly contested election but it is the scheduling that reveals the letter to be political released as it was on a afternoon that timing guaranteed no new information would be revealed at least until giving speculation and hyperbole a head start on the facts and it teed up the issue for the influential morning political that timing is a colleen burns when was running against for the democratic the popular narrative first female president versus first president excessive personality triggered a different about two maniacs running for president the fact that some of the original narrative has been lost that a week away from potentially seeing the first female president of the united states is a shame i follow politics but seeing the us elect a female president is an important and exciting sign of progress that seems to have been lost in the elections

so just when we thought that get any more it with a trump victory i told you last week that strange happenings were afoot in the what with the cubs winning the world series and all i hear that new yorkers are taking it pretty hard are people stocking up on canned greetings from the land of duck and not sure quite sunk in but foods and subterranean real estate are in demand and sounds like a hunting club so where shall we a little weary of the conversations get right to what do you think will happen trump will set up an administration the sun will rise in the east my dog will chase squirrels the world will go on glad to hear taking it well he stayed cautiously neutral in the but a very good boy i think you once made the point to me that there are no permanent victories or defeats in politics so perhaps a good place to start a conversation about the future been since i came to at the collective failure to understand that point it is patently true upon the most cursory inspection of recent history in democrats were popping champagne over the dawn of a permanent era of progressive politics now they see most of their dreams being unraveled and republicans celebrating today will sooner or later be miserable i made a things are looking better already both winners and losers who ignore this reality make silly unforced errors the losers err on the side of excessive like the classic threats to leave the country reader email has informed me way harder to leave the country than one might think we in all that much demand and the winners fail when they convince themselves that since victory is they can set an agenda that attracts no one from the other side looking at a president trump and a house and say we are in for a stretch of dumb things presidents generally get most of their big changes done in the first year or two president did that with health care his agenda was nothing compared to w who did everything from tax cuts to getting authorization for the invasion but was certainly a big lift it was also a central campaign promise i know you think it was a bad idea i think that strategy is enormously shortsighted i remember thinking when the democrats held the white house and both houses of congress in though they have it might be wise to give a little to bring some centrist republicans into some day the republicans might be in a position to reverse everything if they have zero political investment in and sure here we are my point is that of course a president should have a vision that matches his ideology why he got elected but i think it is impractical and imprudent to forgive me for another reference to is spinal turn it up to give on a few things where you have because someday going to need friends to protect the stuff you care about most the trump administration might learn from the outgoing horror at seeing some or all of repealed we part company here my perception of was of a democratic party willing to work on compromise legislation while the republicans just stalled there was no unified republican just a ton of people who wanted to be but kept changing their mind but the bottom line is that left behind the old congress now got guys who sleep in their offices and even talk to the other side at the house gym secretly a lot of them are actually but i take your point and another recommendation i would make to president make friends everyplace that was the magic golf with the same people every week since i have no prepared to look on the bright side for a while the republican hatred of is so great that even if had gotten elected it would have been really hard to get the necessary fixes through congress trump has promised and as of his interview something better that preserves the most popular parts of the program so see what he comes up with i know a big fan his agenda and agenda really do congress is set to have a big influence on the agenda over the next and and trump will figure out how to make their ideas jibe plan includes a health care replacement plan for it will actually do some of the things liberals really like getting more people covered i realize that very disappointing for progressives to see but not like it will be replaced by nothing this is one area where the product usually resemble the recipe i remember presidential candidate saying all health care negotiations could take place in on grab your crystal ball and give me a couple of other predictions seeing a big tax cut and huge spending on infrastructure repair followed by a stupendous rise in the national debt certainly true that neither party has been great at getting the deficit under control in my lifetime nobody calls his or her congressman and just do sit only one side adds to the deficit while simultaneously complaining too big but move on obviously cranky how any other how about the early the republican establishment seems to have as white house chief of staff but is going to be chief strategist which could mean anything to me is the kind of guy democrats should learn to live with they and going to be a republican white house but is a very bad dude who represents all the worst strands of racism and misogyny in the trump crowd who do you think will really have the it looks like both will be influential after watching the i find pair of appointments too surprising they signal that in as during his trump will seek to merge traditional republican politics with his unconventional

just a week to go the overwhelming sense i get from people here in is that they just want it to be over their impatience just election fatigue feels like a kind of nervous exhaustion brought on by the clear fragility of the whole enterprise formerly known as democracy but the other thing since the email leaks on is that democrat supporters are abandoning the notion that victory will be a formality and are now trying to get their heads around the possibility of a trump victory with all the drama and hoopla possible to lose sight of the fact that after eight years of may now be set for another milestone with the election of its first female president the fact that it has achieved this later than many other western amid a campaign seeped in misogyny and should not detract from the fact that it is happening so this week i asked women in how they felt about the chance that might become president the town is divided racially and by party on the matter but the bottom line seems to be that many will vote for her even if only a few are enthused by her some loathe her but including those who are not with are angry that being judged by a double standard and believe that this speaks to a broader problem in can catch up on the project in full send us your thoughts or recommendations here and get involved on the view from

if you think back to this presidential campaign and recall a lot of articles mentioning email troubles and j various you be wrong if it seems there were fewer articles about the economy and because there were the temptation to blame news organizations for this imbalance is but there is at least some reason to resist it critics have long assailed campaign coverage as focused too much on candidate campaign strategy and assessments of instead of on policies and ideas but this the candidates share the blame i compared the content of campaign ads with the content of news articles about two specific candidate traits or and the economy or jobs both the candidates and news organizations spent more time discussing the fitness for office lack of than they did the economy and the imbalance grew more lopsided as the election approached using analytic tools provided by crimson i categorized the campaign news coverage of media outlets this consisted of four broadcast three cable news national public radio and on the two news and newspapers i specifically searched for news about campaign and her email server or her campaign and and several controversies connected to campaign things like trump the khan family and the i also looked for news about the campaign appeals on the economy and jobs this list but it gives a sense of the between coverage of these controversies and the economy the controversies received more on than their views on the economy from until election percent of the stories mentioned various and percent mentioned email only percent mentioned trump and jobs or the and only percent cited campaign and the economy closer to the from the numbers got even more lopsided this was an important date just after the release of the video and a few weeks before director b letter to congress from this percent of the campaign articles mentioning either controversies or the economy discuss while only percent mention her alongside jobs or the economy as for percent mention his while percent mention him related to jobs and the economy the imbalance in coverage of the character is as is the lack of coverage about the economy compared with the controversies moving one week past the video between and election roughly half of the stories about scandals and the economy mentioned and only a quarter discussed trump and his imbroglios a mere percent of the stories in these last three weeks mentioned and the economy percent mentioned trump and the these choices have consequences according to the reports of what they heard or read about between and were mainly references to her handling of emails during her time as secretary of state in mentions of trump changed week by tracking what was happening on the campaign trail but before anyone blames the news important to examine what the candidates themselves were talking about over the course of the campaign if media reports reflect candidate discourse then it is not merely the media choosing to report on scandals it might be at least as much the choosing to campaign on them that results in unending coverage of traits and characteristics to figure out if this was the i used data from on all the campaign ads aired between and election day i coded all of the appeals in each ad and weighted the appeals by how many times the ads ran on television made more ads than and she vastly running nearly three times as many ads as he did all over half a million ads were run in during this period the content of the ads is revealing both candidates spent most of their television advertising time attacking the other character in the losing ads did little else more than of the appeals in advertisements nearly half of were about characteristics or dispositions only percent of appeals in her ads were about jobs or the economy by percent of appeals focused on the taxes and trade since the start of presidential campaign television advertising in no campaign has made percent of its television ad appeals about any single topic on traits typically garner about percent of the appeals the economy typically generates about percent of the appeals usually much more balance of this was an unusual election with two very unpopular so the flaws may have simply been too big a story for either them or the media to pass up whatever the the criterion of fitness for office dominated the messaging and made up a good share of the trump messaging as and the news media covered it

director set off a torrent of criticism late last week when he directly inserted himself into the presidential campaign with a vague letter to congress about the reopening of email case his conduct has shocked many observers across the political but the only thing truly surprising about this episode is that people are only now realizing how and dangerous actually his stints in the bush and administration has continually taken authoritarian and factually dubious public stances both at odds with responsible public policy and sometimes the law the case is not an part of a clear were once enthralled when appointed the republican as chief in they talked about as if he was above reproach because of his role as acting attorney general under w when he threatened to resign over an aspect of the illegal wiretapping explained at the time of confirmation in this story is incredibly misleading did curtail a small part of the sprawling surveillance program in that occurred before the public ever knew of the existence of any domestic program the version of illegal wiretapping that the new times revealed in which sparked a firestorm of liberal criticism and widespread accusations of illegal was the program that was totally fine with and signed off he is celebrated as anything close to the hero is baffling during the bush also aggressively defended the arrest and due imprisonment of a us on us soil he was held as an and refused a lawyer for three and half years to this one of the most egregious violations of the constitution by the bush administration in also gave his legal on torture techniques during the bush despite harboring personal taking over at the speaking up without all or any of the facts has become a specialty he has led a fight to essentially outlaw a vital tool that protects privacy and security he has done so freely admitting he know what talking while his demands fly in the face of the opinions of many prominent computer who have argued mandating in encryption is impossible to do safely and a recipe for having failed to convince the public despite claiming it was vital the public debate the issue he then went to a judge to try to force apple to its own encryption using a law written in the as previously a for former attorney general wrote in politico in steamrolled his white house and pentagon colleagues even scuttling an encryption policy that was under development by insisting that apple be forced to unlock the phone for the last wholly without promoted the discredited arguing that crime has increased because police were afraid to do their jobs now that there is a slightly higher chance that citizens might film them shooting an unarmed person not only do studies show this theory is false that crime has not markedly an insult to police officers ought to stick to what he o executive director of the national fraternal order of told the new referring to basically saying that police officers are afraid to do their jobs with absolutely no as president and many politicians in both parties have called for a reduction in harsh mandatory minimum prison sentences that have made the us by far the largest jailer in the publicly spoke out against any such criminal justice reform know from my experience that the mandatory minimums are an important tool in developing he said evidence shows the mandatory minimums have never been shown to make anyone safer or increase euphemism for threatening defendants with decades in jail so they forgo their constitutional right to jury trial and take a plea but facts have never gotten in the way of and his does the when it suits him in the was told by the bush justice department that it needed a warrant to gather email records and web browsing about but under the agency has continued to disregard the justice legal and to this demands tech companies hand it all sorts of data under free national security two months wrote in is a growing consensus that has wielded the powers of the directorship more aggressively than anyone since to the and even of some of his evidence against has been available ever since president nominated him all changed is that people are finally paying elections

j election victory was powered in part by forceful opposition to what he described as an economic and political system rigged against the people for the benefit of shadowy forces in the news the banks and the government trump and his allies often describe that system with one globalism it is a word that conjures many none of them shuttered unchecked immigration and a distant cabal believers controls the economy and the media analysts who track extremist groups in the united states have expressed alarm at the use of the word by the they say it carries multiple meanings from benign to sinister and often serves as a for and conspiracy theorists is a principle driver for the fears that animate the radical right in the united said the editor of a published by the southern poverty law center is the globalism is often used as a synonym for the system of global economic interconnection that has been critiqued for decades by liberal groups like labor environmental organizations and opponents of the international monetary fund and the world bank but for the far the term encapsulates a conspiratorial based on xenophobia and according to mark a researcher at the league a host on the media site rebel explicitly rejected its use as a synonym for in a video she posted in she said the word meant rule by autocrats such as president former president w bush and the united nations who value false flag of and immigration from the third almost always sneer down their nose at disdain national laugh at religion and generally despise the west while holding a creepy affection for the third she added want open cheap labor and to benefit their business and political and are all too willing to shaft the little people to achieve the website run by k newly appointed chief white house frequently attacked globalism and during tenure there but no one may have done more to popularize the idea of a globalist conspiracy than a radio host who commands an audience of millions through his media empire he has been called most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary by the southern poverty law center among his the sandy hook school massacre in was a hoax and the sept terror attacks were an inside job posted his own definition of globalism to in in his trademark he described it as a digital control engineered by shadowy corporate and political elites he called it total form of the who has enthusiastically supported hailed the republican as a historical figure who appeared on his show last has in turn heaped praise upon reputation is trump said will not let you down you will be very i hope and i think be speaking a so what is trump talking about when he talks about his hope provided a definition in an email before the election last groups in the united states began to refer to globalism at the end of the cold when it replaced communism as an idea that was an danger to the said they have also referred to it as the new world and soon they saw its tentacles everywhere the shape of that conspiracy had distinctly in part because many of foes had historically seen communism as inextricably linked to said members of the far right became fixated on prominent like the businessman and philanthropist those conspiratorial beliefs were bolstered when former president bush celebrated the end of the cold war in a speech by saying it was the dawn of a world his use of the phrase was taken as proof by many that a globalist conspiracy really was afoot was very easy for especially because he was the one who said to take that ball and run with said that point the phrase became the short hand for that kind of globalism conspiracy the multiple meanings have made it a powerful political and and his frequent references to globalism have drawn in a wide and varied audience is a very efficient net to unite disparate parts of the from the mainstream to the said the director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at state professor called globalism defining folklore and narrative for the racist but said it had also a convenient to explain the various declines that the united states is perceived to be globalism was an important theme in the final weeks of for when he told a rally in in that his opponent for the had sat at the heart of a conspiracy with international bankers plot the destruction of the league criticized the speech for classic conspiratorial talk has continued after the election trump referred to a plot against him again last when he complained on twitter that protests were the work of the news media and paid protesters a trump ally and host on fox business later accused of many on the far right have celebrated election victory as a momentous blow against the globalist conspiracy last claimed on that trump had called him personally to thank him and his audience for their support and to offer to appear on his show again soon ms the trump did not reply to an email seeking comment late night then pivoted to what he

of which began with that now glide down the escalator at trump where trump commenced his candidacy with these historic when sends its not sending their best sending people that have lots of and bringing those problems with us bringing drugs bringing crime rapists and i are good ever a monument is erected to the trump then surely these words shades of will be carved into the marble along with coming out of her bucks a and would bring back a hell of a lot worse than in true demagogic trump bypassed the head and spoke directly to the to the biles and bubbling acids of raw emotion he said things that many temperate hardly dared to admit we carried in ourselves were hardly aware of just how deeply we resented our own how angry our interior lives with all this stuff bottled years and years of internalized from a culture that kept insisting on tolerance many discovered just what a drag political correctness was all these and to be free of freed from this code that was jamming us

this is not a winning the which would be bad enough this is white supremacy tempted to say really not that bad stances are things get said in the heat of a and we could take heart in the newly conciliatory trump on display for several days after the election then came the news that the erstwhile chairman of the trump campaign who bears a striking resemblance to the town drunk on the old was named counselor and chief for the incoming trump administration the mainstream press still feels compelled to explain the term but we know we we we white aka honky dig too deeply into the family along

know this by now creating strong passwords and never using the same password across sites is one of the simplest things you can do to protect yourself from digital invasion not everyone agrees about frequent password changes most say you should use really strong passwords and no more than one password per then use the password managers but making up new combinations all the time is irritating and tempting people to reuse them or make them too simple that is one reason some experts object to frequent password changes far better to create really strong ones for every login and new passwords can pose security because hard to remember complex so you are tempted to write them down that can lead to a lot of passwords to keep track of recommends password which help store many with one master password he said he uses but knows plenty of people who use and and he have a strong reason to recommend one over another as far as making passwords up be precious about it use a random word object

for yahoo and one for outlook accounts you should also set authentication for social media accounts and other sites where available but email is the most important since many sites use email for

the latest furore over alleged misuse of private emails when she was secretary of state in has thrown a tumultuous and unedifying us presidential election into even greater with little more than a

voters will deliver a possibly rejection of trump on although opinion polls show the race tightening nationally and nothing is certain as a febrile campaign is ahead almost everywhere that matters and
