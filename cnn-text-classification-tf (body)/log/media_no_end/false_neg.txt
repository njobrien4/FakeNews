trump the family plead for the white house to save him the drama is dominating the news networks a media storm what will trump nobody has a clue trump lacks military experience he has never served in the armed forces nor does he have any background in diplomacy what trump does by all is a short fuse a tendency to shoot first and ask questions later his predecessors would have played for appealed to local or pursued talks while examining options for a president trump is different unused to the awesome responsibility of the oval under fierce pressure to enraged by personal infuriated by accusations of and determined not to show it is easy to imagine trump making a hasty and disastrous call with a few translated into trump could not only lose the he could plunge the us inextricably into the quagmire of another middle east war there are grave doubts about trump volatile temperament and macho doubts about volatile temperament and macho instincts also apply in other global where a us or are always critical and sometimes lethal here are five dangerous issues that could suddenly and unpredictably test the novice cool and common sense in the first days of his and hostage scenario is not wholly imaginary in last a royal air force was captured and burned to death in a cage by the after negotiations for his release failed similar repeat incidents involving and members of the and local are becoming more likely as the endgame in the fight against the caliphate battle is being fought out on two main fronts one is the siege of northern principal city trump has the conduct of the which involves the mainly and militias backed by us special forces commandos but he has not offered an alternative the same holds true of the attempt to seize the headquarters in in northern trump says that defeating terrorism is a top priority and he will the shit out of but including appears to know what this means in practice if the battle goes will he will he cities where millions of civilians is he prepared to deploy us ground what will he do as seems both sieges become bogged or begins daily executions of is also silent about significant military intervention in and and its parallel fight with the president wants two things from an end to us support for the and the extradition of a cleric exiled in the us who he blames for last failed coup with on the back foot and the

rupture with but a reset will come with a price in the first authoritarian will want a relaxation or scrapping of punitive sanctions imposed after annexed in to dismay in trump has suggested he may also seems likely to get his way in where forces have pushed his to the brink of victory in and elsewhere trump has made no serious objection to actions in even though the says they may constitute war crimes he seems content to have remain in or even to treat him as an the renewed use of chemical for new or a suddenly escalating humanitarian and refugee catastrophe could all trigger a new crisis that blows up in forcing him to move against the idea of zones and civilian safe havens still has backers if trump goes down this he could end up directly confronting allies cannot do much about insouciance but they will strongly oppose him if he tries to run down the as he has suggested pressure on easternmost members in the and in terms of political missile deployments and military exercises is reaching new heights and operations are increasingly reported in and elsewhere in the eastern remains a ticking any of these could ignite at any time in first governments want to present a united front but trump seems more interested in buying off by acquiescing in reclamation of former cold war spheres of influence disdain for the he loudly applauded vote to leave and critical

appears to have rebounded in popularity according to a new post which shows her leading against trump another poll from the la times shows trump ahead by five percentage so the overall average support for each candidate has remained unchanged since yesterday at a point lead for measures of national opinion are poles figures are but they ignore two groups of the undecideds and those who plan on voting for a third candidate look at the who are planning to vote for someone other than or trump take a look at the in in the midst of primary there were a lot more who seemed to be still making up their minds one in likely voters said they were undecided since that figure has slowly not so declined to about one in likely according to the polling the of voters who claim to be undecided seem capable of swinging the election if they all vote for she would win the popular according to if they went for win although they all swing in the same worth considering the intentions of these a undecideds arouse cynicism could anyone in this election possibly be skepticism they keeping their the where undecided respondents in the seemed to make a decision to leave the has only deepened suspicion of these there are three possibilities the undecideds truly know who to vote the undecideds know whether to vote at and they know exactly who they will vote for but want to disclose it with nosy pollsters briefly examine each of if individuals made up their own pretty difficult for analysts to anticipate their actions some electoral theory suggests that when people they opt for the safer option of preserving the status quo as was the case in the independence referendum that would work in favor as she would preserve her vote share in states like that have been democrat for decades but which now appear to be leaning increasingly voters in might break with history a majority of us adults trust elected officials the media for that the rise of with his suggests that many may now consider the status quo a scenario turnout will be crucial in this election and there is a real chance that many of these undecideds will simply not show up in survey firm changed their respondent group to better understand undecideds of their respondents said they would not vote though did not find a substantial partisan divide among these current campaign strategies would seem to suggest that low turnout will work in favor has been repeatedly trying to boost particularly among minority whom she will need in several swing states campaign advisers have claimed the strategy is now to suppress turnout rather than encouraging potential undecideds to vote trump also mixed evidence when it comes to understanding whether undecideds are actually secret trump voters who are hiding their intentions from pollsters in the primary polling averages matched pretty closely with final results in most states but voting in the primary season and the national election are pretty different partly because the individuals who show up to pick a nominee are more politically engaged voters in respondents who say undecided are some mix of all of these three groups for early voting suggests that some black undecideds might decide not to show up on election day but the geography of being undecided also matters why visited north on where he told a fate of the republic rests on your is worth of the electoral college votes required to win the white house and voters here are deeply split about which way the state should go current polling averages show trump beating by percentage points a meaningless lead because these numbers could be wrong by a few percentage points in either of likely voters in north said they were who they would vote for in a poll conducted on but a pretty crude measure of intention polls often force respondents to pick a side by starting the question with the words the presidential election were held today a later question in the same survey asked voters how certain they were about their choice of said they might still change their minds and said they change their minds early ballots in the state have promising news for though they suggest voters in north are choosing over trump elections
as news of shocking loss sinks many supporters looking for someone to blame are pointing fingers at a familiar people who voted outside the are already trying to blame libertarian and the green party for win for concocted a scenario in which by taking every stein vote and half of could have grabbed enough states from trump to eke out an electoral college a story repeated by unwilling to accept that motivate enough voters to win the and explore the reasons many pundits are instead looking to put responsibility for the loss onto the if every single stein voter had voted for still where drops and inherits half of libertarian where does the other half in exit polls showed that only of and stein voters preferred to who preferred while the majority of voters and of stein voters simply have voted for either if we were barred from might have gained a net of those but still lost these are delusional candidates snap their fingers and make their supporters vote for someone else they support pundits may think their favored party is entitled to those but actual voters make their own decisions no candidate owns vote votes have to be for scapegoats is a way to avoid criticism and accountability after failure those who claimed that was more electable than despite his stronger polling against are now desperately trying to spin the failure of their media gives alternative parties just a tiny fraction of their election coverage when we do get smear campaigns and charges dominate the discussion pundits justify our exclusion from the airwaves and debates by saying we a factor yet after election day they declare us the most important anyone outside the system a with no right to run is it suppresses political discourages citizen participation in democracy and shields the toxic system from criticism or party voters consider it to perpetuate a system that keeps getting worse many of them make deliberate decisions to use their votes to change that system yet after making minimal effort to understand these pundits caricature them as selfish normalizing bullying behavior and threats towards anyone who steps outside the collapsing people want more not fewer some think a new major party is needed because the establishment parties do such a poor job reached a new low with the most disliked candidates in history if most of us want more the media inform us about other candidates on the instead of attacking when can we move past this trap and take our democracy into our own good voters in and elsewhere are tackling the head on with ranked choice voting this voting system lets you rank your so if your first choice your vote is automatically reassigned to your second choice ranked choice voting empowers you to vote for the candidates who best represent your values no one can tell you your vote if you vote for the in order to stop the candidate you fear most ranked choice voting also rewards both candidates and voters who find common ground with rather than slamming them with negative are the of this bitter election merely looking for a or are they willing to work constructively to fix systemic the very fact that the political and media establishment was able to ram two historically unpopular candidates down our collective throats exposes a critical need for greater democracy ranked choice voting is an obvious first said that those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat its mistakes so the real question ready to join us and get to work fixing our broken electoral
like so many with the overwhelming sense of despondency at compounding the lingering depression of as one tries to find some explanation for the spreading darkness of the tribal nationalism that seems to be pervading so many of the countries long viewed as the bastions of progressive it is too easy to offer the cloak of alienation from the or even of to those with their are welcoming the leaders of this so accentuated in recent plays a significant part what is common to the success of such leaders is their cynical and dangerous plumbing of the depths of the most negative facets of human veneer of painstakingly applied over so many years by the now seemingly distant voices of ever has become allowing those who seek to do so et to prise open the breathing the oxygen of negativity on to the malevolence which had been so precariously the hostility towards whatever factions happen to present themselves as enemies of that we hold firmly to those tenets of true the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary it is a sad reflection on the state of that the supreme court has become so as our supreme court faces its sternest test of never has such independence been more the scenario and the saga of the us election suggest that archaic systems of democracy are no longer fit for purpose in the century as unconstrained racism and demonstrable lies have become accepted as successful political the apparent result authoritarian and nationalistic systems of government and social conjures of the fascism if this does not represent the objectives of the and is simply a result of democratic reprogramming of the system is urgently letters on election victory us election result is a sharp lesson from losers and two nations divided by a common must his pledge to close bay crave politicians who actually stand for something media and politicians are out of man make grate elections supreme

somehow trump manages to dumb down everything somehow he manages to lower the bar to the point where he can play by a different set of rules and somehow the media and elected officials just shrug their shoulders and walk his own the is negotiating business deals at a time when his predecessors you filling cabinet positions and transitioning to power he met with his business partners and the trump organization signed a deal last trump tweeted earlier this to the election it was well known that i have interests in properties all over the world only the crooked media makes this a big explained this in more if not entirely in his interview with the new built a very great company and a big company and all over the world people are starting to when they look at all these different like in and other number a job like that builds great relationships with the people of so all all is indeed approach to mixing his business and political affairs law is totally on my he the president have a conflict of be profiting from the presidency would not be a quaint conflict of is not about whether trump favors one country or president over gives a contract to one company or or spends more time making money for himself than he does boning up about policy there are laws on the books about us businesses influencing foreign officials with payments or other inducements the law is called the foreign corrupt practices act and its goal is to stamp out bribery by any us is what the law calls favors and payments given to foreign officials in exchange for business deals not a conflict of and favors going the other way into the pockets of the president are so clearly corrupt that they were forbidden by the founding fathers in the constitution the emoluments clause prohibits gifts and titles from foreign powers as person holding any office of profit or trust under without the consent of the accept of any or of any kind from any or foreign this clause that leads to exceptional red tape around any and all gifts received by the white house and every other from a homemade quilt to a watch everything is declared and surrendered officials can only keep the gifts up to a value of if they repay the us process will be hard within the world of international real where foreign powers can grant gifts ranging from planning permits to investments from sovereign wealth funds the list is almost we know if trump discussed his investment with president of but we do know that his daughter now running the family business was on the call we know if there was any suggestion that president could expect any benefits for himself or his country spokespeople for president and trump have denied reports about the mixing of trump business and politics on the we do know that the project is now moving news that emerged just three days after the call between and trump for a president who has refused to release his tax the need for transparency is not exactly any the fact that even having this discussion tells you something profound about the trump presidency before it officially begins promise to his voters was that he was incorruptible because he was so independently wealthy that nobody could touch him he knew how to drain the swamp because he had lived in it for so buying off begging politicians for so many years that it made him argument was always a but clearly many voters bought into his pitch just two weeks since the obvious that trump has no interest in separating his personal wealth from his political agenda the damage caused is not confined to public confidence in the united states government being leader of the free world is not a casual concept that cold war phrase encapsulates the notion that the united states is a beacon of freedom and democracy for the world as his own transition came to an best summed up the notion in his final address in in have been guided by the standard john set before his shipmates on the flagship years as faced the task of building a new government on a perilous frontier must always he we shall be as a city upon a hill the eyes of all people are upon eyes of the world are on the trump transition right now they see a who lost the popular vote by more than million votes and almost percentage is a difficult notion of democracy to explain to a world struggling against authoritarian regimes where votes are routinely ignored and discounted the work of democracy promotion by the national endowment for established by is immeasurably harder as a result of the work of spreading government has become just as hard as a result of business dealings if a sitting president can enrich himself while in then why a president of a developing country set up his own businesses to do the why should they not do after as trump told the theory i could run my business and then run the country corruption the seeking of personal profit by government officials derived from their roles is a plague that condemns the most vulnerable people in the world to poor or public services if the us talk credibly about the need to stamp out conflict of the world will struggle to eradicate corruption and improve life for the poorest people on the needs to lead by example and that starts with the president not a conflict of interest the national

if ever you wanted evidence that we are in a bizarre economic you only needed to see that when the latest inflation figures came out on the annual growth of was deemed high enough to have financial markets all but ruling out the chances of an interest rate cut next latest consumer price index figures released yesterday by the bureau of statistics showed quarterly growth of the was and the annual rate was despite the very low annual growth the value of the dollar immediately jumped nearly from to as the market took the quarterly inflation of as a sign that an interest rate cut next month is off the a look at the figures show that inflation remains extremely low indeed so low that even months ago such figures would have had the market assuming a rate cut would almost be the jumped a bit in the quarter the growth was the fastest for the reality is that was due largely to an exceptional increase in the price of fruit after flooding in the major growing areas reduced supply if we excluded food and beverages from the the would have only risen reserve whose board meets to decide on interest rates on will pay the increase no mind at all when it comes to making its decision instead it will look at the underlying inflation growth rates of the and and both of these saw slowing growth in the targets an underlying annual inflation growth of between and and again here we see nothing that would suggest a rate cut is off the table far from it underlying inflation has now been growing below for a year and the weighted median growth of is a record underlying inflation growth did dip below for a brief period in the last the difference between then and now could not be when underlying inflation growth fell to the cash rate was at that is the real cash rate was by with underlying inflation growth currently at the cash rate is at for a real cash rate of while inflation growth is that does not actually mean the will cut rates next week indeed the strong likelihood is they will not last week when i suggested interest rates were unlikely to go lower any time the market was pricing in just a chance of a rate cut on cup day the next day this went up to figures have dropped to around a market is now slightly more optimistic of another rate cut by this time next but it is still at best just a proposition and you have to wonder given how low interest rates are right whether another rate cut would have much inflation is a symptom of both low prices via goods and services that are is their price is largely set and from the the price growth of prices is generally more the current growth of the items suggests very weak demand within the area that reflects the state of the with weak wages and tepid employment is rental prices across the rents increased by just in the past months the slowest ever outside of the recession there has also been a slowing in the growth of the price of new houses purchased by owner as it often the where you live greatly affects how much your rent is going up the national average is being dragged down by the end of the mining boom out west property and rent prices are falling rather quickly rents down and housing down in the past chart of the growth of rents in compared with and is a very good depiction of the effects of a mining boom and bust while rents in the two biggest capital cities are growing around where they were prior to the massive increases in in they have utterly rents might be cheaper than they were last but there are also fewer jobs in than last the midst of a housing a nice reminder that one of the quickest ways housing can become affordable is when an economy inflation figures reveal continuing weak demand in the and little sense of any quick return to prices growing within the target band but i suspect they cut rates next week especially while coal and iron ore prices are in these figures would have the thinking inflation is but the question remains whether they believe that with the cash rate already below the level of inflation growth that cutting rates further will do any good
lurking behind the turmoil and the jockeying for advantage in j effort to assemble a national security team lies the more fundamental question of how he will address the immediate and complex challenges he inherits upon taking office trump has never articulated any detailed foreign policy vision beyond the vague slogan the diverse and shifting cast of potential appointees under consideration for top administration jobs has only highlighted the deep splits among conservatives about how the new administration should confront threats involving north and among and how it should manage relations with allies in and trump said in a march interview with the new describing for the first time what the phrase meant to him have been mocked and ripped off for many years by people that were from his personnel appointments to his first major meeting with a foreign leader it came in new with prime minister of japan trump faces a series of decisions that will begin to flesh out his approach to the world and provide some clue as to how he might respond to whatever crises confront him as commander in chief does mean he will use military and to wipe out emerging from rogue nuclear states to terrorist before they can do harm to the united or does it mean he calls troops back building them into a retaliatory force that can lash out if the nation is at moments during the he suggested both approaches he said he would the from areas of and he criticized president for pulling troops out too soon but he is also the man who rejected and is it always the united states that gets right in the middle of he some we cannot be the policeman of the no one knows what response to expect from a man who said he prided himself on following his instincts and has little patience for careful legalisms of his predecessor but while presidents the challenges do not here are some places and issues where will first take trump called the agreement reached with in intended to constrain from building nuclear of the most incompetent deals of any kind ever and he promised to fix it because the deal is an executive not a the new president has great latitude to alter or scrap it but two can play that the are deeply unhappy with the arguing that they never got the relief from sanctions that they were promised any effort to reopen the bargaining will also give military officers and conservatives a chance to alter the pact or threaten to resume their race for nuclear capability to the deal was not only but also badly negotiated he said of secretary of state john and his negotiating team trump said he would have left the negotiating doubled down on and never agreed to give back billions of money that belonged to and was frozen in financial institutions but when he struggled to name any part of the deal he would have walked out of the negotiations to alter with some he finally settled on a common that after will be free to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium in any quantity in decision about what to do with the deal will be an early test of his willingness to act unilaterally the nations that joined the united states in the negotiations and china not only support the but are rushing to take economic advantage of it by building commercial ties with if trump wanted to abandon the deal or reimpose they would almost certainly refuse to go along the hold a few too in they shipped percent of their nuclear fuel out of the disabled a plutonium reactor and took thousands of which enrich out of service if the deal were to be declared they would be free to their nuclear infrastructure and rebuild their now frozen until by administration it would take about a year for them to produce enough new material for a weapon longer to produce the weapon itself one option for advocated by many is to simply reimpose sanctions on for including its activities in and its continued support of terrorism the would say that violates the spirit of the agreement and leadership has already threatened that such action would nullify it it is hard to say which has sounded more confrontational in recent years about north the which has regularly warned of a to any north use of its expanding nuclear or the who spent much of the bush years plotting ways to make the regime collapse but if there is likely to be an early test of reaction to north is probably it the nation has accelerated its nuclear and its arsenal is it could have to weapons during term in his security trump will be hearing the latest estimates for how long it will take the north to build a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the public figure is five years or though some intelligence officials believe it could happen significantly sooner trump has at various times described north young as even while expressing grudging admiration for toughness so the early choice will be should trump confront the north with more missile defenses and perhaps a naval blockade to stop all trade that does not go across the perhaps that is what trump meant when he said that should use our economic power to have them should he reopen negotiations with a nation that has made clear that its nuclear arsenal is perhaps that is what trump was suggesting when he said he was willing to meet one on one with over a hamburger as yet another should he pull back forces in the pacific and let the and the deal with the he suggested just that in a interview with the new saying that if countries did not pay their fair share for he was prepared to tell you will be defending trump made before and after the that he was determined to
trump has promised to build a wall along the border between the us and after his electoral triumph over many are wondering whether actually pull this or any of his other controversial along with many other minorities in the were railed against by trump during his campaign in the to the he vowed to rid the us of yet despite this adding to his record of xenophobic trump was elected the president of the united states mapping the trump countries and regions feeling the heat read real estate billionaire promised to scrap the north free trade agreement on grounds that it at the expense of us workers he has also threatened to tax the money sent home from the us by migrants to in for the aforementioned spoke to in the us and about the election of and how they think his presidency might affect their lives what they underestimate the consequences that damaging our economic ties can have on feel dismayed and deeply disappointed as bad as that the worst part is feeling powerless we have a say in an event that can have catastrophic consequences to our economy in the us we are seen as collateral damage even those opposing trump seem indifferent to the economic and human pain this situation can inflict on us i understand the economic pain that people in the rust belt are feeling successful trade agreements transfer some jobs from one country to another but are net job creators to all involved countries under the us gained jobs in the south at the expense of the rust belt north gained and the south has but this is the result of failed compensating measures within both countries boosted wealth across the subcontinent cutting ties with will also harm the us it surprises me that during the campaign no one pointed this out and perceive that trade is a game under the us gained jobs in the south at the expense of the rust belt it surprises me this was pointed as trump adopts a pragmatic the damage can be limited to a further decline in my purchasing power owing to the peso devaluation and a difficult business environment while expectations are better anchored if he feels obligated to deliver on the promises made to his voters and revokes things could be much worse our government has little leverage because underestimate the consequences that damaging our economic ties can have on them they are self absorbed and busy inflicting pain on one another of will probably send us into an even deeper power trump has over over our over our our perception of our freedom of over the way the world will see us is terrifying and he is not even the president we woke up to find the exchange rate at pesos for the dollar we went from per dollar on election to yesterday and today expected to reach by the end of the year we have been humiliated in front of the deportations of many who live and work in the united who send money home and who contribute tremendously in that way to our economy will probably send us into an even deeper recession his misogyny is worse than any machismo we have ever see we surprised how many love adore are more than willing to welcome in any who wishes to make their home for the next four bring your come live bring your help us out we are a welcoming country with amazing fantastic great cities with interesting museums and landmarks and restaurants and we hope they will seriously consider it that goes for people who want to escape the our collective the democracy was something to aspire to the spell has been broken in many ways in even the least educated among us believe this man to be a buffoon his ideas are uninspired and poorly that his misogyny is worse than any machismo we have ever seen we are surprised by how much and how many love adore are now wondering where to turn to for inspiration and what way of life and ideology will now inspire this we ask has created a dangerous stereotype of in the have a visa and i can travel throughout the us whenever i which is a lot but i am concerned of the increase of hate or that as a result of the stereotype i live in a place visited by a lot of tourists i worry that they will think that i am or that they think i am a drug dealer or a is not fair that a presidential candidate has blamed because of issues they have he has created a dangerous stereotype of in the us there are a lot of undocumented but a lot of us are living legally in the us many drugs go the us through the but what they forget is the us is the first drug consumer worldwide what they say is that they are in part responsible for the drug cartel violence in some we make jokes about it we now say that we are no longer the country with the stupidest president in the world silver lining is that perceives trump as a common politics in can find common ground to make front to his politics and maybe force the common efforts by different parties before the presidential election i really hope margarita will engage in alliances with other parties to win the will suffer irremediably if trump imposes tariffs on imports renegotiating for example or tax the remittances the fiscal situation in is already strained owing to low oil prices and corrupt politicians with vast regions of the country in hands of or crime trump adds chaos to the already dismal state of government with inept and corrupt politicians like president and the foreign trumps adds chaos to the already dismal state of government with inept and corrupt are going to inflation and currency devaluation will spike making expenses more
remember how mainstream lies and distortions were going to be corrected by people using social we have mainstream media trying to cope with fake news distributed through social add to the we have fake claims by digital moguls that they can do something positive to stop the dissemination of fake founder mark having initially denied that fake news was now wants us to believe that been working on this problem for a long so it is a problem after for its chiefs seem to think fake news will be strangled to death by removing advertising tools that enable sites to make money by spreading lies but the fake news phenomenon is not only driven by shysters seeking profit some of it is propagandistic was clear during the us presidential and some of it is simply have no right to complain down the years so many of them have played fast and loose with the truth their spin doctors turned lying into an art elections on either side of the confirmed that we be living in a society have elected a lying president in trump have voted to leave the union in a campaign noted for abundant media has been blindsided by the lying phenomenon cynics will surely say that its chiefs are upset by the rise of competing liars who appear to do the job so much better than them so be it but also consider how difficult it is nowadays for journalists who think they are being fair and balanced in a fox news in their impartiality tools just work any longer for during the the views of the overwhelming majority of scientists were in a discussion by the opinion of a spokesman for a fringe body there was no made a similar observation in a new yorker interview in explanation of climate change from a physicist looks exactly the same on your page as the denial of climate change by somebody on the complaint about is in the new media is true and nothing is in as the instance it happens across all real problem with new media is the speed with which falsehoods are spread and the difficulty of providing countervailing corrective have just faced the consequences of this phenomenon last the union at university of passed a stupid motion banning the daily mail and daily express from the campus none of the or so students currently studying journalism at city voted for the motion only one of them appears to have attended the meeting voted against the on a number of people including current and former journalists misread the stories about the vote and began to journalism students for doing something they had not my unequivocal statement about journalism students having had no responsibility for the and similar forthright denials by my the lie proved difficult to picked up on the story days later unaware of the repeated it so denials had to be ceaselessly reiterated a myth had been created and it surprise me if there are still people who believe not the fault of social media blame the but it is a consequence of because lies can be passed on so swiftly and indiscriminately of it is also about human fallibility lies that play to our prejudices are more easily believed and we pass them on exacerbating the problem quoting he said of new capacity to disseminate wild conspiracy to paint the opposition in wildly negative light without any rebuttal that has accelerated in ways that much more sharply the electorate and make it very difficult to have a common and a further irony there is a adage that lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its trousers is usually attributed to but the website quote which substitutes shoes for trousers suggests it was coined many years before got to even a quote about how lies gain currency could be false and we blame social media for can

be clear about second referendums there are ones and ones a bad one is a desperate attempt by the government of the day and its allies to negate a first referendum it did not like this was by and it which is why the now supported by tony likes the idea such a referendum was at least better than in where a vote against the treaty was simply ignored by the established with consequences that may yet prove good second referendum is quite different it seeks approval for whatever deal is reached as a result of the first one it seeks to take forward the first not negate fury in some quarters that greeted the vote on last swiftly morphed into a demand that voters be immediately as if they would then repent the error of their ways it was the arrogance of the old politics on laughably led by certain members of the house of lords it showed how thin is respect for democracy on the left in comes a different question the referendum said yes to the the and may rightly accepted that as they said they would the divorce would proceed without hope of divorce is a clumsy metaphor countries do not marry and divorce they become more or less hence the shorthand of and there is a world of difference between these two outcomes so much so that pundits vie with each other in claiming the impossibility of world must go on at some point some sort of however will have to be done between and the there is no such thing as a wall in the channel certainly the may government could fail in its negotiation it could seek a general election mandate that could trump the referendum but that is not a second when tempers have a deal will be reached that removes the from the institutions of the but trade and population movement the likelihood is that such a deal would anger the more than the but either way it would be controversial as it would best be authenticated by a second would not be an attempt to reverse the first merely to validate its outcome it would be a second

it happened so one moment i was running the next i was staring a sow in the so close i could smell wild and pungent and and i knew it could smell my fear i was in the middle of a rainy run in far north bicentennial park on the outskirts of where i live it was late a time when grizzlies sweep down from the mountains to feast on the salmon swimming up creek but i was miles from the water i had planned my route away from the and i seen bear scat in more than an hour as i crested a a crash sounded from my and i instinctively moved to the expecting a moose but it was the sow with three cubs the cubs fled up a tree the sow paused in front of as if waiting i backed into the fortifying myself behind a skinny grove of alder moving never taking my eyes off the bear when it veered as if to leave i felt such relief that my throat loosened and small gasps escaped my lips then it abruptly turned and charged directly at me impossible to run the trails around without thinking about bears there are piles of scat dotted with blueberry and cranberry seeds that glint in the reminders that you have to be careful you have to be versed in bear bear etiquette and bear protocol headphones are a and going alone is discouraged making noise and carrying bear spray is recommended i often ran alone i preferred it that way i liked the serenity and the liked the hours of nothing but me and the mountains and the trees that i wore a bear bell attached to my hydration and i whenever i came to dense areas i sang old rock roll loudly and badly i was cautious but not afraid i ran these trails all summer and the summer and while i saw bears on many other i only twice saw them on these sections maybe i let down my guard maybe i felt the way you feel when you repeat risky behavior without negative results maybe the bear was having a bad day when the bear time stood still i felt every millisecond i stood in the rain coating my face like and i did what they tell you to do if a black bear i waved my arms and yelled i my voice rising through the birch through that silent and moment a the bear paused and ran back toward the brush a minute it charged a second time and again i waved my arms and yelled and again it this time so close i could almost reach out and touch its snout i swallow i briefly and almost if this was how i would die i wanted to talk to my who was grown and off living his own life i wanted to hear his voice a lifetime the bear turned and ran its backside swaying into the trees i had to get back to the to the possibility of yet i step away from the alders it was my only protection when the bear began circling around me in a wide arc when i knew i was in became really afraid when my son was young and nothing would comfort i would talk it matter what i he needed my the steady flow of words as i stepped from the shelter of the i talked out my voice surprisingly calm i talked to the bear to show that i meant no but mostly i talked to reassure myself as the bear circled for a second i stumbled through snagging my shorts and scratching my and i talked about the day my son was how i recognized his face immediately when i reached the i kept talking the bear but i look back a half a mile i glanced over my and the bear was gone i started running and stop until i encountered two and i collapsed at their feet for weeks i saw that face in my and i woke heart pounding i swore i would never run trails but i missed it too and soon i was out with the trees and that big sky some things are worth the though i made sure to carry a canister of bear just in case and sometimes even now when i think of that bear charging and how i stood so still and yet so alive it opened something inside of me that can never be closed it offered a taste of the at any time i might find myself crouched in the face to face with my own fragile existence so much of life is chance there are no guarantees but there are vast landscapes and dangers and wild moments of good luck

keep radical terrorists out of this trump without we will build the wall and will pay for the wall cost of the wall is peanuts compared to what talking trump says nonpartisan analysts estimate the

supports deportation for people with criminal are going to have the biggest tax cut since is only true if in the wealthiest bracket of earners half of tax cuts would go to the top of according to the tax policy and most families below the top of earners would have income gains of less than trump linger long on the affordable care act though he leads the crowd in a chant of the his new catchphrase for taking on corruption in percent of children under the age of are in trump says citing outdated the poverty rates in question were as high as trump says they were at the depths of the great but they have since to somewhere between percent and depending on which income threshold you use the rates for children are disproportionately so trump has a point even if his statistics are too old and exaggerate the scale of poverty in that age group on we rate the statement half two million have fallen into poverty under the he also the own fact use of is misleading on two he starts counting from when w bush was still in office and from right before the financial peak and he ignores that the population has grown dramatically in the eight years since then almost million people fell below the poverty line between and census poverty numbers but the number of people in poverty has decreased during the recovery in it fell to down from in will be very hard to leave your farm to your children

premiums will increase by varying amounts according to each some will be quite as trump others will be far then correctly notes that misled about whether they could keep their doctor under the

writes pundits said they do most pollsters insisted they do everyone from the pope to said they do it now indeed one resounding message from the seismic electoral events of and now trump is that democracy has been badly served by pundits and pollsters in the aftermath of many voters said they would have voted differently had they known how finely balanced the referendum was going to while significant numbers of might have acted differently had they known the true strength of support when making their fateful decision to stay away from the polling stations this knowing the true voting voters are blind if provided with inaccurate they think they can see when in fact they cannot people need to be able to make important decisions in an informed manner and political scientists either get considerably better at assessing the voting intentions of the or stop attempting to do so altogether the consequences of getting it wrong are too no one can express an opinion accurately with just a single x experience in northern shows that extremists are less likely to cross the party divides thus voting often gives extremists more success than is their due the trouble with trump was that the vote in binary if the us election had been preferential stein and trump the outcome could have been a more accurate reflection of the general and trump would probably now not be the if democracy is to preferential voting is both in elections and in both in and in the country at frank claims put trump in the white house in the we have heard similar claims that is really the fault of a liberal as someone who grew up in a family on a council far from any liberal i was taught that a vote is a powerful and valuable tool to be wielded responsibly so can we stop all the liberal and grant people enough respect as adults in a democracy to be accountable for their own nobody forced anyone to vote for trump or people made their own choices and should accept responsibility for victory is being explained in terms of the political elite being out of touch and unrepresentative the ordinary people but if those people are homophobic and or are tolerant of those attitudes in their political then it be seen as a good thing they are not it is better that those who make the important decisions share those views and instead work to change those attitudes where they are held by than that they echo them and govern their country in that spirit surely in a democracy an official body the electoral should have power to prevent the serial telling of lies to gain advantage in a poll it is no good prosecuting after the event vote leave leaders may face court for such liars should be made to own up to the error of their ways or barred from further engagement in the proceedings it cannot be right that two vital decisions in two major democracies have been influenced by repeated mendacious argues that the checks and balances that the us could normally have called upon to restrain trump may no longer exist he suggests that we rely on the military to stop trump from getting out of hand i am not so sure the most steadfast modern constitutional guardians probably are the as once they were in turkey what is to prevent them from stepping we might find ourselves welcoming why are people on the left not accepting democracy any having lost the challenges go to the having lost out to trump in the us presidential the challenges are taken to the streets for good or ill the votes have to be respected or else we are all lost the alternative is mob rule or letters on election victory us election result is a sharp lesson from losers and two nations divided by a common must his pledge to close bay crave politicians who actually stand for something the rule of law and a reboot for democracy media and politicians are out of man make grate
democratic party outrage at the shock almost on the eve of the us presidential that it is resuming its controversial investigation of after declaring in that the matter was has been chairwoman of the democratic national was one of many to cry foul has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters even the faintest appearance of using the power to influence our election is deeply she the campaign also hinted at is extraordinary that we would see something like this just days out from a presidential said the statement left it unclear whether there was anything remotely new to may well be true in his letter of notification to the said he did not know whether a batch of newly discovered emails bore any relation to previous claims that acted illegally in sending private emails containing classified information when she was secretary of state from said the new emails to be but he and his officials had not yet examined them in a later he admitted know the of the but said he felt obliged to investigate and make his decision public it is not even certain that the emails came from private move is either extremely naive or extremely cynical investigations are routinely conducted behind closed doors only when a decision to prosecute has been based on persuasive is an inquiry made public or suspects a ostensibly independent figure like the director to tip his hand at this extraordinarily sensitive moment amounts to an overtly partisan act since it must be assumed that is no it must also be assumed that he knew what he was less damning explanation is that he was clumsily attempting to save the further criticism from the republican which denounced his earlier investigatory efforts as a but if that is the why did not have a confidential word with the relevant congressional oversight nobody could then subsequently accuse him of a and he would not have triggered the firestorm in which the impartiality is again being and this time from the the damage is done must now try to weather the storm until having previously believed that she was in the clear it will be a rough ride the ugliest and most personally vindictive presidential campaign in modern history is now set for a furious and trump and his supporters have been quick to wade in speaking on the campaign the republican nominee revived jibes that is a corrupt and habitual liar in typically hyperbolic he said that her conduct was biggest scandal since risible exaggeration undermines his case but the genuine anger and alarm expressed by surrogates reflect their fear his attacks may be hitting home and their knowledge of how damaging renewed questions about her honesty and competence could potentially in trump she faces the least qualified for a host of most objectionable republican candidate in living is still only about ahead in the as a national bald figure may be considered misleading in battleground or where the electoral college will be is ahead in all but and but polls across the nation are tightening this latest flurry of negative headlines in national media desperate for a sensational story to keep the race alive in some to dish will not her advantages in name political achievement and spending has evidently failed to knock trump out of the a deeply damaging few weeks for when he was beset by allegations of sexual he still to be in with a more skilled and savvy politician than could and would have buried trump months ago a more popular or democratic could now be awaiting electoral coronation this latest blow may cause some underwhelmed democrats to abstain and best pitch to independent and undecided voters that she is the least worst candidate leaves her vulnerable to a elections

press has turned into the daily trump over the past six coverage of the us has dominated national trump was remarkable across five titles mail on express i counted pages with content about led their front pages with all carried leading articles about and he featured in most of the columns by senior political face stared out from most of the front whether smiling alongside brothers in the daily looking stern during his cannot imagine that a victory would have generated such intense newspaper interest as happened throughout the election campaign in the trump has proved to be a media positive or negative and the majority of the coverage has certainly been the latter the undeniable fact is that he is the a if somewhat lesser also managed still to attract undue attention from newspapers does that suggest some kind of inbuilt at least one i suppose it does because a demagogue would surely not have garnered as many headlines as trump and is no denying that both men have been lampooned in although the criticism has not amounted to they have been portrayed as figures of fun rather than as evil incarnate fate of many politicians think tony ed and now papers have shown an underlying sympathy for the views of trump and notably over their opposition to immigration and their consistent antagonism towards whether in or the same papers with an eye to their readership appeal have appreciated their naked populism with even greater their disdain for liberalism and the liberal elite so trump and even while being dismissed as mavericks and ridiculed for their lack of civility and benefit from the underlying often sympathy towards their central political articulating the prejudices of their readers the common people exercising commonsense the daily the sun and daily express could do no other than find common cause with trump and there is the simple matter of the volume of coverage name recognition is immensely important in and both men have enjoyed that because of widespread media coverage quite they have prospered by having a should we fall into the trap of seeing this as a peculiarly conspiracy the and the supposedly impartial and radio news have devoted a great deal of space and airtime to trump and is true to say they have disparaged both men but they have also been at pains most obviously in news bulletins and current affairs to treat them as serious representatives of people they like to refer to as disenfranchised and so ever careful to maintain as part of the required public service broadcast outlets have unconsciously given them credence in politics is precious we may be encouraged to laugh at trump and even loathe him for being unstable sexual predator and compulsive winning but he has just enough credibility to survive the onslaught it is not so much that the people love him the but that they love him for being willing to take it and ignore named as of the by the times in he has long risen above newspaper sarcasm he revels in aware that is viewed by many of his and as some sort of homogeneous liberal institution it therefore forms part of the trump and have not needed to manipulate the press and in a conscious sense having been within the modern media it has become second nature to them to use it to their advantage
it appears that in the aftermath of a monumental but nonetheless failed presidential sanders remains most comfortable in the spot that made him a trying to separate class and has never been wrong about the damaging roles establishment politics and economics play in the lives of millions of even long struggled with acknowledging that focusing on class alone make this country better for many who are struggling that the revolution cannot be colorblind if it were to truly make this country better for all of the disenfranchised at a speech in on the senator advocated beyond identity working class of this country is being decimated why trump won and what we need now are candidates who stand with those working who understand that real median family income has gone it has but like the others parading this pedestrian punditry in the aftermath of the news that most white people voted for is missing the point while continuing to promote the very ideas that sunk him during the primary he lost many potential voters of color because we know economic policies alone will not change certain realities of racism in they might great but only for people who have always had it pretty when asked in a new republic profile how uncomfortable he appeared talking about he this is an issue not really what i want to do is get into when told that it about him per sanders a complicated answer a good but i prefer not to get into it right sanders did make some efforts toward minority outreach it was too late and not good enough after all this that reality has still failed to reach him in his he demonstrated this blind spot yet when a woman in the audience asked asked sanders how she could become the is not good enough for somebody to a vote for sanders explained not good enough what we need is a woman who has the guts to stand up to wall to the insurance to the drug to the fossil fuel industry in other one of the struggles that going to be seeing in the democratic party is whether we go beyond identity should we pretend always been way that discounting them invalidates the lived experience of the very people that opted against sending him to the general sanders talks about the democratic failure to reach white he manages to somehow forget he lost to a woman who bested him partly because she spoke of the need of criminal justice reform and the overall role racism plays in before he went on to lose to a demagogue who promised to restore the nation to an image that excluded like me and like the woman who dreams of becoming a us sanders owed that woman a better answer he should have mentioned the need to combat voter suppression he should have mentioned how identity politics matter because identity in this country can very much play into economic status sanders went to what makes him comfortable rather than address voters proved they were more willing to let a con man break the country than share it with the rest of us the failure of democrats that they coddle white people it was that they failed to explain how unless you are white and connected like you will fall like every other person screwed over throughout his career that a multicultural coalition rooted in economic plurality for all benefits everyone insistence on moving past is the next step in his may it suffer even more defeat than it did in the income
in came under fire for suggesting that half of supporters belonged in basket of consisting of you name labeling people in such a disparaging manner is not a constructive approach research has shown true that trump brings out the worst characteristics in only about half of trump supporters think global warming is and twice as many republicans are unsure about the evidence as they were a year ago hostility towards women and racial resentment correlate with trump support almost as strongly as party affiliation and denial of science and facts are the defining characteristics of did we get journalists have struggled to treat trump as something other than a standard presidential candidate because he constantly spawns new scandals and is lacking in the policy to normalize trump and network evening news programs have devoted three times more coverage to emails than all policies as accurately satirized by night twitter night live opening nightly news programs have devoted zero time to discussing the climate plans media false balance has struck important to realize that trump does have a few policy positions for he wants to burn coal indefinitely because he denies the climate change consequences trump also wants to eliminate government spending on clean energy and climate cut taxes predominantly for the most build a costly and pointless border engage in expensive mass and deregulate the financial industry extensive policy plans are effectively the opposite of are puzzled that a candidate with such generally unpopular policy plans and who has been endorsed by the could be supported by over of and have a chance at winning the presidency of the united states unfortunately we seem to have entered a era in which facts simply matter the two political parties have become so different that swing voters have virtually gone extinct and most conservatives would vote for mister were he the republican party nominee political ideology trumps and reality and support comes heavily from a single white mostly older and without a college wants to regress to the white trump campaign slogan great suggests that he wants to return the country to some bygone era based on the words and his feelings about and that era resembles the the only about of women participated in the work and were still fighting for equality in the civil rights movement the tobacco industry created the followed by the fossil fuel industry spread misinformation and sow doubt to keep the public consuming its deadly products nearly half of smoked cigarettes in the compared to under the tobacco industry already knew that smoking caused but used the denial to keep characteristics fit the era that trump and his supporters appear to yearn for an era in which white men dominated society white male who comprise the core of base are also the predominant climate group in the country social scientists theorize this is due to the historical societal advantages they have benefited from the societal status and hence are least concerned with especially when addressing those risks would mean changing the status quo from which they it or the status quo is male are in the process of losing those historical societal advantages as minority populations losing their grip on the majority the first racial minority president was elected and women are approaching even footing with men in the labor force even social norms are for example with gay marriage becoming of course the climate itself is changing rapidly due to global which is causing all sorts of negative consequences climate scientists are pleading with voters not to make a choice our children will trump would be the only world leader to deny global warming and the tremendous risks it poses his threats to undo the progress made to tackle climate change have elicited widespread condemnation from the international most recently from the government when asked how his country would work with a trump administration on climate climate negotiator vote to reverse half a century of goal is to make again by reversing the progress made over the past half century and returning the country to a society dominated by white progress toward racial and gender equality could hypothetically be reversed in a trump climate change be only by continuing the progress made toward cutting carbon pollution can we slow global warming problems are not solved by denying their has many great many argue the country is great but like every there are also dark periods in its for in the treatment of minorities and women as citizens trump aims to return to those deplorable and to put the world on a path toward a catastrophic future by undoing the progress made in tackling climate world is counting on not to make a catastrophically wrong choice in change consensus the

something is deeply wrong when the reputation and influence can be borrowed by a source that describes itself as fantasy news to claim that he has endorsed a presidential and then be through a million individual shares the attention paid to fake news since the election has focused largely on fabrications and outright because they are easy to identify and extraordinarily viral fake news is created by the kinds of people when might call their work or admit that in it for the money or for the thrill of deception theirs is a behavior that can and should be and that is and maybe to deal with for many and especially opponents of j the attention paid to fake news and its role in the election has provided a small the discovery of the error that explains everything but as the attention has spread widely even president talked passionately about it on it may lead to an unwanted outcome for those who see it not just as an but also as a way to correct the course it misunderstands a new media world in which every and is at risk of being not by argument but by sheer force false news stories posted on websites were prevalent in this election were widely shared political videos some styled as newscasts containing outright image posted by individuals and shared by and endlessly shared quotes and video clips of the candidates themselves repeating falsehoods during the months i spent talking to partisan page operators for a magazine article this it became clear that while the ecosystem contained easily identifiable and intentional it contained much more of something else i recall a conversation with a fact checker about how to describe a posted on a website and promoted on a page copied from another site by overseas contractors it tried to cast suspicion on the father of a slain who had spoken out against j trump the overarching claims of the story were disingenuous and the facts it included had been removed from all useful context and placed in a sinister its insinuating mention of in proximity to mentions of and its misleading and strategic mention of amounted to a repulsive smear it was a story that appealed to bigoted ideas and that would clearly appeal to those who held them this was a story the likes of which was an enormous force in this clearly designed to function well within economy of sharing and it probably would not run afoul of the narrow definition of stories like that one get to the heart of the rhetorical and strategic risk of holding up as a broad media offensive especially after an election cycle characterized by the euphoric inversion of rhetoric by some of and by the candidate himself as the campaign criticism of trump was instantly projected back at his or at the critics themselves puppet no puppet the this tactic was used on the language of social which was appropriated by opponents and redeployed in an open effort to sap its power while simultaneously taking advantage of what power it retained were cast as the real racists progressives were cast as secretly regressive on their own terms this was not a new but it was newly effective it matter that its targets knew that it was a a clear bid for power rather than an attempt to engage or reason the referees called but nobody could hear them over the roar of the crowds or maybe they but realized that nobody could make them listen as shorthand will almost surely be returned upon the media tenfold the fake news as widely understood and has already begun to encompass not just fabricated but a wider swath of traditional media on and elsewhere fox fake news misleading claims about ford keeping jobs in fake news the entirety of fake news this wide formulation of will be applied back to the traditional news which does not yet understand how threatened its ability is to declare things even when they are may try to address the narrow version of the the clearly fabricated posts has plenty of tools at its disposal and has already promised to use to bar sites that have been flagged as promoting falsified content from using its advertising platform but the worst identified defenders make their money outside anyway another narrow response from could be to assert editorial control over external forces tried to a very limited with trending topics members of the editorial staff wrote descriptions of trending news accompanied by links they deemed credible this initiative collapsed in a frenzy of bias accusations and political fear but it is easy to imagine a system in which a upon reaching some high threshold of or a upon reaching some cumulative could be audited and declared unreliable this could resemble experiment to tag satire articles as such a number of narrow measures could stop a fake story about the for example but where would that leave the rest of the answered and and barely better positioned against everything else that remained it would be a news environment in which almost everything there before remained the main difference being that it would have all been not fake is a place where people construct and project identities to family and peers it is a marketplace in which news is valuable mainly to the extent that it serves those identities it is a system built on ranking and vetting and and yet one where negative inputs are scarcely and where conflict is resolved with isolation that provisions for open conflict on a platform present any easy for it has been a source of constant fake news operations are closely aligned with the experienced incentives of the economy more than most of the organizations that are identifying them their removal will be an improvement the outrage at their mere and at their promotion on a platform with the stated goal of connecting the will have been justified
remember when the glazer brothers took control of united back in they borrowed to acquire the then saddled it with the debt they used to finance the acquisition in other the club paid for its own purchase at the it sounded to many like some dubious newfangled financial mechanism dubious it was but not new the church was at it long before football was of borrowed tens of thousands of ducats from the banker to buy various ecclesiastical titles and bishoprics from the and then raised the money to repay the loan by selling bits of paper that promised the buyer time off purgatory like others before he turned the promise of salvation into a way of making much of which was being to to rebuild st basilica it was a ploy that would make green but established practice in the roman church of the early century batteries of nuns would be paid to pray for the soul of some wealthy dead aristocrat gifts to the church were encouraged as useful collateral in the hereafter the whole business model of the roman church was premised on selling salvation as if it were soap often in order to finance extravagant building was an unknown monk in an ecclesiastical backwater before he wrote a letter of protest people in the pews were being ripped off and worse the church was twisting authentic theology for financial gain salvation for the church to buy and sell it was free and it was entirely the gift of god the letter was sent on as legend has nailed to the door of all so this week we have entered the year since the the greatest and most social protest movement of them all with terse point protestantism was ignored theses probably nothing much would have happened but he pushed escalating the conflict to head office in and pressuring monastic order to silence his preaching they wanted him but protest feeds off opposition and had the astonishing courage of the true indifferent to the danger he was and far ahead of his time in appreciating the power of technology to encourage popular printing press was his social media and he used it to devastating continually taking the piss out of the unafraid to use vulgarity as a means of making serious points and within a few widespread revolution broke out against the totalitarian theology of the roman death star the church would never again to claim such temporal power and hallelujah for that protest was the mother of all protest movements and easily the most this pope met leaders of the church to error and seeking despite the reactionary instincts brought back by the the empire strikes back the catholic church has accepted much of teaching his theology was just an intensification of that of saint after all and the current pope has something of the reformer about him within months of his enthronement he was castigating another bishop for his lavish spending on church including a not just about the money more about the control and of access to god what protestants made clear was that there are no human gatekeepers to the divine you have to go via the church there are no turnstiles to the almighty just get down on your knees and hope for the best this simple insight changed the world some see it as responsible for and western individualism others as the call for a permanent and continual revolution against the forces of oppression and a reminder that no human being whatever their religion should claim an authority that is properly left to and god

the united states is a leader in technology but it may well be a laggard when it comes to using technology for political mischief the role that fake news stories on sites in particular played in last presidential election continues to be a issue did fake news tip the balance in the can do more to prevent fake should executives dispute the notion that fake news on the social network might have swayed voters but political analysts say the warning signs of this debate could be seen in other countries years ago take the where a spokesman for its shared on an image of a girl believed to have been raped and killed by a drug dealer checkers later revealed that the photo had come from and mark write the role of fake news posted to in the recent presidential election is likely to be debated for even years but there is little doubt that the social media network has had plenty of influence in a reminder to register to vote contributed to significant increases in voter registration across the according to officials in nine states in that did not dispute their conclusion
the emails currently roiling the us presidential campaign are part of some unknown digital collection amassed by the troublesome but if your purpose is to understand the clique of people who dominate the emails that really matter are the ones being slowly released by from the hacked account of campaign chair john they are last scandal in a year running over with but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere they are a window into the soul of the democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party class to which i refer is not rising in angry they are by and large pretty pretty contented nobody takes road trips to exotic west to see what the members of this class looks like or how they on the they are the ones for whom such stories are written this bunch have to make do with a mountebank for a for this the choices are always pretty and this year they happen to be are the comfortable and mainstay of our modern democratic party they are also the grandees of our national the architects of our the designers of our the high officials of our banking the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or the middle east with precision droning they they not a class at all but rather the enlightened the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselves twitter learned to fight dreamers campaign against us turn the magnifying glass on them for a by sorting through the hacked personal emails of john who has been a power broker for decades i admit that i feel uncomfortable digging through this stealing email is a after and it is outrageous that personal information has been since seem to have redacted the emails in any way there is also the issue of authenticity to contend we know absolutely and for sure that these emails were not tampered with by whoever stole them from john the supposed authors of the messages are refusing to confirm or deny their and though they seem to be there is a small possibility they all that taken into i think the releases furnish us with an opportunity to observe the upper reaches of the status hierarchy in all its righteousness and personae of the liberal class are all present in this amazing body of financial innovators colleagues attempting to get jobs for their children foundation executives doing fine and noble things of and high academic industries loom large and virtuous here ingratiating speeches to wall street are well known of but what is remarkable is in the party of and and smiling financiers now seem to stand on every constantly proffering advice about this and that in one email for the reader can watch current us trade representative writing from a email address in appear to name president cabinet even before the great election was decided an important clue to understanding why that greatest of zombie banks was never put out of its innovators of silicon valley are also here in interacting all the time with the leaders of the party of the people we watch as appears to email he makes plans to visit mark according to one wants to more about next steps for his philanthropy and social exchanges emails with an entrepreneur about an ugly

billionaires who give to democrats the miscreant in question was said to spinning donors who have supported democrats john and have both given to and others he is also attacking every billionaire that donates to many whom support other democrats as in the year it one of the correspondents appears to and political malpractice of the party to allow this to are wonderful things to be found in this treasure trove when you search the gilded words or but it is when you search on the dump that you realize these people truly inhabit a different world from the rest of us by of they mean the ritzy

last us election result and our own contortions must be one of the reasons why your paper and the media generally have had no space to cover the shocking descent into the genocide of the occurring in turkey and where president sees all as by his as his of thousands of political trade women university students and even schoolchildren are in overcrowded prisons where abuse and torture is and access to any impartial justice system week were shut becoming the latest victims to feel the wrath of president and his clampdown on of them are accused of being affiliated to the leaders have unleashed a ruthless suppression of every aspect of civil destroying all their efforts towards a peaceful solution to the long conflict in forces are targeting the whose protection units and are among the only really reliable local forces on the ground fighting and providing refuge for nearly million internally displaced people and refugees of all ethnicities and who have come from other parts of and now from in there has been some recognition of and air cover and some arms have been given to the and but this could all change with declared support for and for whose regime has for decades has been persecuting its as in has condemned slide into dictatorship and human rights and is considering ending its membership application but we in the have remained silent a week a young university student immolated herself in the prison where she was unlawfully detained we in the must no longer keep silent it will be to our lasting shame if we do not speak out and east and north
opposition has been killed or forced into parliament is servile and the media largely despite overwhelming apathy in parliamentary at the grassroots level from across the socioeconomic spectrum have been quietly challenging the authorities and these challenges have become increasingly hard to environmental campaigners holding companies accountable for oil spills to campaigns against local activists preserving parks and residents taking control of their local activism is gathering strength and momentum such movements may be normal for most but in they are development should be understood as a reaction to the policies of the which have consistently the interests of business elites over the needs of society and as those business elites are hit by the financial they are increasingly trying to squeeze more money from of most significant victories for action was a countrywide strike by truck drivers against a proposed increase in road tolls the truck tax known as is being operated by the son of oligarch a close friend of action was and because the people who took part came from support while the payments the tolls were reduced significantly and the truckers have gone on to lend their name to other civil including a protest convoy made up of from the region outraged that their land had been illegally confiscated under there has also been a gradual erosion of trust in the authorities to protect their but one positive consequence is that citizens have to plug the gaps in the government was for failing to put out forest fires that swept through the central and western regions of the country which left at least people dead as residents were chocking on smog it emerged that authorities were actively felling the trees in a protected area of the forest near and were placing their efforts on dispersing not putting out the flames across the country and in some cases residents do not just perceive the authorities they actively fear them according to a poll by newspaper of in and in the region believed the police were an active environmental activists campaigning to protect green spaces from development have faced violence from the police and private security contractors in private security guards were accused of attacking women and children who had joined a protest to protect trees in park when the police turned up they arrested of the most active but left the private contractors alone for the first time in history we are seeing angry muscovites not just collecting signatures but risking their lives and safety to take a stand the growing strength of these civil movements means we can no longer say that citizens are they just vote in elections because they think their vote will change anything but as the government continues to crack down on the independent that traditionally support grassroots movements the road ahead will not be smooth activists need to keep promoting the idea that citizens can no longer rely on the state to fix their they need to keep fighting attempts by the government to smear them in the press and they must continue to encourage their fellow campaigner to local government as three activists did successfully this it would then be possible for these grassroots groups to become the network that the society can rely not a state that only has the interests of the elites at heart east

how is everyone ready for i was asked to speak about a vision for the next hundred years of reproductive choice and justice such a wonderful frame to think about what a feminist future might look like but i bet like a lot of hard to imagine what the next hundred years will look like when so much of for women will depend on what happens in just is no overstating how important this election is not just about the next four or eight years this decision is about sending a message about who we are as a and setting a very particular course for the women who live here look back on this time as a watershed a moment that in shape the next hundred years of first i want to share a personal story a little over six years i was pregnant with my and when i was weeks i got incredibly ill i developed which some of you might know is dangerously high blood pressure during was admitted to the hospital and within just a few i developed another complication called the short version being my liver was in danger of and i was in danger of dying if my daughter was not had an emergency and was born weighing she stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first two months of her undergoing medical interventions to save and protect her that to this day i try to avoid thinking about but i was and she was and today a wonderful healthy and i feel grateful for that every share this story because this was something in my life that changed me that shaped who i am when i think about this what i think about most often is how fortunate i was that i got sick far enough along in my pregnancy that i faced with the reality of needing an abortion to save my when i think about those days in the hospital the the the the stress the idea that the government could ever become involved in my most pivotal it horrifies one thing i want for the next hundred i want for no to fear that their most personal life choices will be made by someone want for no to be afraid that her scariest life moment will be made even more difficult and traumatic by government the next hundred i want to see every woman be free from the fear that her body is not really her why i want to talk about this election tonight because at before in politics have bodies been so front and center in the national conversation and so at are choosing between a candidate who has spent her political career fighting for reproductive and a candidate who says that women who have abortions need to be punished a candidate who said this week in the final debate unequivocally that she will defend planned and a candidate who promised to choice between a person who has spent her life in public and a businessman who rips off his perhaps most making a decision between a woman who has said that rights are human and a man who says if you want you can just grab women the a feminist rallying cry right now that i like a and it pussy grabs i know that so much has been made of that and the ensuing allegations against trump by multiple women that he did just what he bragged about doing on that while some people may not see the link between sexual assault and reproductive those of us here in this room know know that there is a direct connection between those who think they can touch bodies without permission and those who think they can legislate our bodies reproductive rights and justice has always been about a fundamental respect or in this disrespect of bodily integrity and our bodies are our or make no the conversation that having right now about is not just salacious media fodder the way we come out of this moment the direction our culture shifts because of it will absolutely determine rights in the future we are witnessing a moment where our country could move backwards back to a place where will be and men will make decisions for women or towards a future where our culture and politics understand and respect women as autonomous full human are the two optimistic that on the right one the one that brings us to the feminist future all of us in this room have been waiting for when trump said he wanted to punish women for having there was outrage and he had to walk back those comments but more activists and organizations like planned parenthood were there to point out that while other politicians may not say they want women to be exactly what would happen if abortion were made in what has already happened to women like who was put in prison for inducing her own abortion in feminist future has no place for criminalizing women who decide if and when to trump claimed that what he said on that access tape was just and later when former new city mayor said that all men talk like men across the country came out to is not normal this is not acceptable men are better than this the feminist future that fighting for has men fighting alongside of men who refuse to be insulted by antiquated and sexist ideals about what it means to be a trump claimed that the women who have accused him of sexual assault were not attractive enough to warrant his unwanted when he called women when he called women the media who can so often get things wrong took him to our feminist future is not one where misogyny will go unchecked women have been disparaged and harassed for too many and not going to take one more minute of it course this feminist future the

as the great once put claims require extraordinary and as far as extraordinary claims suggesting that humans can possess psychic abilities is a pretty big one but in that was the claim that was made in a famous psychology paper by at university in new in a basic memory the setup might be something like this you give a group of participants a list of words to remember once had chance to try and commit the list to you might give them a bit of a or ask them to do some sort of task you then give them a larger list of words some of which they saw in the original some of which are new and get them to say whether they the words or your memory as accurate as you think it read study flipped this idea on its head across a number of different experiments in one such he got participants to read a list of and then immediately asked them to write down as many as they could remember he gave the participants a random subset of words from the original and asked them to type them out on a computer screen in other the recall session came the practice session at face findings were he reported that in the initial recall participants seemed better at remembering words that they would see in the later practice than words that they see later on in other people were better at recalling words that they would be told to remember in the future going thinking about this in the most basic there are two explanations that can account for either precognition or something went amiss during the course of the experiment that threw up an erroneous finding the way to figure out which of these explanations is right is to run a discussed before on the one of the cornerstones of science is reproducibility if the result of a study can be reliably then we can be surer that the result is a correct and in turn use it as a foundation for further research this is all the more important when a study suggests that something as extraordinary as precognition might actually this is where things get a little sticky in and attempted to replicate the memory test experiment explained above using exactly the same they find any evidence of precognitive abilities in the same a study by at university similarly showed over the course of seven experiments that there was no evidence for anything psychic going on other replication studies were but proved difficult to get does the effect exist or a failed replication necessarily mean that the original study was wrong it could simply be that something went awry in the replication study itself words are worth bearing in mind here for something so extraordinary as precognition to hold we should expect to see a wealth of supporting evidence original findings seem to hold up in a sea of negative and there is little further evidence to suggest that any form of psychic ability actually study is notable not so much because it showed evidence of psychic but more because of the controversy that followed that such a strikingly counterintuitive finding could be but replications countering the claim struggled to find the light of started to ring alarm bells for the psychological community this came at a time when psychologists were starting to grapple with the that there were other serious issues that the discipline was facing five years on since study was some of those issues are being but still a long way to
the latest furore over alleged misuse of private emails when she was secretary of state in has thrown a tumultuous and unedifying us presidential election into even greater with little more than a week to go before voting unexpected and very public revelation that it is recommencing its investigation into conduct may not be politically but its timing certainly makes it appear that way the row represents yet another hammer blow to a democratic process whose credibility has been repeatedly principally by the unscrupulous republican this new stoked by republicans and it remains likely that voters will deliver a possibly rejection of trump on although opinion polls show the race tightening nationally and nothing is certain as a febrile campaign is ahead almost everywhere that matters and

wounds and propensity for public meltdowns had pushed the needle toward according to recent polls that may have changed a little in the aftermath of the renewing of its email probe last week but even the fears of many voters that a trump presidency might become a reality have fears are not unfounded failings as a candidate and a person are and he would be in a position to wreak considerable havoc if elected especially true at the agency with the judiciary and in other arenas where the president can wield executive power the aspect of his personality poses risks that be nor can anyone know the degree to which congress would be inclined to obstruct or approve his most damaging has been lost in the salacious and obsessive media coverage of the republican outrageous bigoted remarks and appeal to the worst instincts of the is a critical examination of what a administration will mean for the nation the information on tangled interests within the evidence of influence peddling and revelations detailing manipulation of media and the democratic signal a plutocratic style of governance that is all too familiar and increasingly dominant at the federal content of what has been revealed in these as well as her lengthy track record in government and policy statements as a candidate yield an inescapable represents the entrenched interests of the status quo her election will expand the excesses of global interventionism and corporate welfare that have characterized us policies for several decades at almost incalculable cost both domestically and the has engaged in the type of one expects of presidential especially democrats who seek to counter the image as weak on defense she has agitated against president on and and reiterated her belief in responsibility to the rationale used to selectively promote the elitist economic agenda that she has so faithfully pursued over the years even as the exercise of that dubious mission has resulted in widespread devastation in the middle south and elsewhere a muddled and hypocritical foreign policy has created bitter enemies across the globe and angered us yet supports the rudderless and demonstrably ineffective efforts of president without a hint of and tragic wars in and continue to extract a heavy and though opposition to those wars helped propel into the focus on ending them and preventing new ones has been blurred by the ongoing the war on terror in reality little more than an extension of other armed conflicts the us has waged around the the deadly manifestations of the war on terror have largely been met with silence approval from much of what passes for the progressive movement self destruction has provided a smoke screen for those on the left and the more moderate elements on the right who might ordinarily question unabashed for a continuation of these modified strategies beyond the historical enthusiasm for but not fair trade even while waffling on the gives credence to the belief that she will sacrifice the welfare of workers here and abroad for the unfettered profits of the business elites whom she has always served in the face of documented inhumane labor practices and other related human rights abuses around the the administration and those preceding it have steadfastly refused to demand changes as conditions of honoring trade agreements as secretary of had an opportunity to honor and promote the rights of working people around the world but failed to do so why would anyone expect her to change the inflammatory rhetoric and actions of both and trump stand in sharp contrast to the platform and orientation of the green which offers the only alternative in this election that will move decisively to draw down us military interventions abroad and reduce the military budget to a sane level while redirecting increasingly scarce resources to rebuild the frayed social safety net and help those most in need here at home this election is about far more than our collective distaste for a and trading the noxious buffoonery and personal insults of trump for the clear and present danger of corporatist logic is no at all elections

are supposed to live in a felt so strongly about the proposal that i demonstrated outside county council in on two occasions when the council were voting on the applications since the decision my view changed i am willing to be involved in protest and demonstration i have already signed petitions and written to my mp and also who was the minister responsible at the time of the appeal we are supposed to live in a democracy but this is not operating when a government can ride roughshod over democratic decisions taken at local level are campaigning more than view changed and our free is campaigning more than ever we held an awareness raising meeting here in on and had about people there our page has had over likes since then and we are working closely with are approaching local parish our mp and the local landowners for support we are also in touch with the national group off and friends of the earth all this work began about three months ago so it is early but we hope to make people more aware of the implications of stand to save the environment we call view shifted in the slightest since the decision was made a month ago is going against everything we are working towards as a a false hope given to people who are deliberately deceived by some parts of the energy and the government themselves they claim is a replacement to the depleting gas fields in the north when the reality is they truly know how much shale gas is down nor do they know the devastation and livelihoods it will ruin along the change is inevitable but we have the chance to reduce the impact the is the windiest place in yet our government make it near impossible to build a wind turbine on due to its will turn the an area of beautiful country small villages and towns into a baron waste full of toxic chemicals that will destroy every living organism it campaign is a little currently in on holiday so using social media and support groups to demonstrate the severity of the situation we currently find ourselves in we stand against a giant who only care for not for against the government who have betrayed a democratic vote and effectively spat in our faces we stand for what is we stand for future generations and we stand to save the environment we call home together our voices be ignored communities should have a say in their own twitter group awareness group is part of the free alliance many community groups living in the area are opposed to here we also have a renewable energy group looking and actively green solutions we are still campaigning very and are actually holding a national march next in with groups from all over the coming along we still require significant funds to fight but our group lacks these resources one possibility is for us to raise money nationally via a if needed however we will continue to lobby local and national politicians about this firmly believe extracting fossil fuels is incompatible with our climate change targets and that they need to be left in the ground also the risks and impacts of on local communities is totally unacceptable we believe local communities should have a say in their own futures this is not just about us so many communities face this threat further down the line would have a devastating effect on the farming think important to inform people of the effect this polluting industry has had in places such as resulting in a wasteland would also have a devastating effect on the farming community of west the only people who seem to be supporting are those who will make money from it and that wont be ordinary
