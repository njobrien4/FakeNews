review when announced it planned to merge with another major communications many feared the new company would exercise monopoly power these concerns led some to call for government action to block the merger in order to protect both competitors and consumers i am not talking about recent announced plan to merge with but the reaction to merger with giant in far from creating an untouchable leviathan crushing all the merger fell apart in under a decade the failure of demonstrates that even the biggest companies are vulnerable to competition if there is open entry into the marketplace failed because consumers left them for competitors offering lower prices better quality corporate mergers and hostile takeovers can promote economic efficiency by removing inefficient management and boards of directors these managers and board members often work together to promote their own interests instead of generating maximum returns for investors by providing consumers with quality products laws making it difficult to launch a hostile takeover promote inefficient use of resources and harm and consumers monopolies and cartels are creations of not markets for the reason the media is dominated by a few large companies is that no one can operate a television or radio station unless they obtain federal approval and pay federal licensing fees anyone wishing to operate a cable company must not only comply with federal they must sign a franchise agreement with their local government the has given greater access to news and ideas shut out by the lapdogs of the mainstream media this may be why so many politicians are anxious to regulate the web government taxes and regulations are effective means of limiting competition in an industry large companies can afford the costs of complying with government costs which cripple their smaller competitors big business can also afford to hire lobbyists to ensure that new laws and regulations favor big business examples of regulations that benefit large corporations include the food and drug administrations regulations that raise costs of developing a new as well as limit consumers ability to learn about natural alternatives to pharmaceuticals another example is the which has strengthened large financial intuitions while harming their weaker competitors legislation forcing consumers to pay sales tax on their purchases is a classic case of business seeking to use government to harm less competitors this legislation is being pushed by large stores and retailers who are seeking a advantage over smaller competitors many failed mergers and acquisitions result from the distorted signals sent to business and investors by the federal reserves inflationary monetary policy perhaps the most famous example of this is the which was a direct result of the bubble in a free mergers between businesses enable consumers to benefit from new products and reduced prices any businesses that charge high prices or offer substandard products will soon face competition from businesses offering consumers lower prices higher quality monopolies only exist when government tilts the playing field in favor of crony capitalists therefore those concerned about excessive corporate power should join supporters of the free market in repudiating the and subsides that benefit businesses the most important step is to end the business cycle by ending the federal reserve this article was published by institute

presidential campaign by bar editor and senior columnist democrats used to value things like global peace and justice in the workplace for decades they have given their votes to warmongers and this they are mourning the defeat of a politician they once would have despised in lots of black democrats will cry over the exit of a president who won by making himself palatable to white people while also taking advantage of undeserved black pride freedom hollow legacy by bar editor and senior columnist the sight of and hosting a state dinner was enough to make black hearts swoon legacy is in and that is good news trumps victory was not just a win over but against democratic party policies that silenced the rank and file for years democrats became convinced that the only means of keeping republicans at bay was to go along with their party leadership without complaint if they wanted to expand trade deals that stole workers so be it the people who marched against the invasion of folded their tents when democrats became the party of endless war when promoted austerity and grand bargains with republicans not a word was uttered even black lives matter refused to point out that the justice department left killer cops unpunished is nothing if not consistent while democrats take to the streets in protest against president elect declares that the man he once called unfit is not an but a pragmatist no one should be surprised about the conciliatory tone never had a problem with republicans they may have obstructed but he was always happy to assist them because he really opposed to their policies the most obvious example of lack of substance was his relationship with black his disdain and contempt for the people who loved him the most was clear to anyone who paid attention jokes about cousin and parents serving fried chicken for breakfast should have been seen as the racist screeds they clearly were but the desire to see a black face in a prominent place endures to our detriment the people who marched against the invasion of folded their tents when democrats became the party of endless war won by making himself palatable to white people while also taking advantage of undeserved black pride would be the president elect if the new voters who emerged in had remained committed to the democratic party but their loyalty was to the imagery of as president their joy was confined to seeing him meet the queen of england alongside his first lady or disembarking from air force one with his signature swagger the sight of and hosting a state dinner was enough to make black hearts swoon policy initiatives need not intrude upon the love fest the end result of this unrequited and superficial love was six million fewer votes cast for in than for in the apocryphal cousin stayed home and no one should be surprised there is no secret to keeping voters engaged they are engaged if their needs are met deliver for voters and they deliver in the voting booth even the unpopular and shady could have won if the people of flint had received the federal help they needed so badly not only did the environmental protection agency allow the beleaguered city to be given contaminated but he showed up for a photo opportunity and did nothing else as residents suffered he drank a glass of posed for the cameras and returned to the people of flint are still living under conditions think of as being third world democratic voters must ask themselves why they said nothing when their party promoted trade deals that were against their interests the response to trumps victory should mean more than protesting policies the democrats now have little ability to fight this moment presents an opportunity for much needed introspection and culpas millions of people did more than just accept democratic party policy they supported actions they would have rejected if carried out by a republican or a white democrat they supported when republicans were president but averted their eyes to his murder when committed by a democrat they even voted for the person who bragged about the killing democratic voters must ask themselves why they said nothing when their party promoted trade deals that were against their interests ultimately that acquiescence led to defeat at trumps hands the teams propaganda skills were legendary but the day of reckoning revealed the emptiness of what they produced the corporate media acted like scribes under white house direction and declared that was an enemy state and its president a st century now it is the reality television who declares his willingness to talk to his counterpart it is the sort of behavior that democrats once valued democratic presidents jimmy carter and bill began the tradition of getting democrats to support what they like perfected the which ultimately led to the debacle he will certainly not be the last to tempt the party faithful but in democrats sold their souls and ended up with nothing

the is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda the nephew of the pioneer of it was who coined the term public relations as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions in he persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the new easter parade then considered outlandish one light another torch of fight another sex influence extended far beyond advertising his greatest success was his role in convincing the public to join the slaughter of the first world war the he was engineering the consent of people in order to control and regiment according to our will without their knowing about it he described this as the true ruling power in our society and called it an invisible government had a cousin called who has since earned the title father of public relations took idea and applied it to consumers if desire is our driving then appealing to emotions is the most powerful way to persuade consumers to act the idea was to short circuit their rational conscious and get them where they were most vulnerable the unconscious the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood in my career as a journalist and i have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged imagine two cities both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country both cities are occupied by who commit terrible such as beheading people but there is a vital difference in one the government soldiers are described as liberators by western reporters embedded with who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes there are front page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a for victory there is scant mention of civilian casualties in the second city in another country nearby almost exactly the same is happening government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics the difference is that these fanatics are supplied and armed by us by the united states and they even have a media that is funded by and another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad condemned for assaulting and bombing the city which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city not really such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda i am of to the current siege of the city of by the government forces of who are backed by the united states and and to the siege of by the government forces of backed by one is the other is bad war as portrayed on two popular news magazines terrorists and hero are typical propaganda images what is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if and the united states had not invaded in that criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as the monstrous and and and the rest of the gang might not and the people of might not be fighting for their lives today some may remember in a succession of reporters turning to the camera and telling us that was vindicated for what turned out to be the crime of the century the us television networks produced the same validation for w bush fox news brought on henry to effuse over same soon after the i filmed an interview in with the renowned investigative journalist i asked what would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude he replied that if journalists had done their there is a very good chance we would not have gone to war in it was a shocking and one supported by other famous journalists to whom i put the same question rather of rose of the observer and journalists and producers in the who wished to remain anonymous in other had journalists done their had they challenged and investigated the propaganda instead of amplifying hundreds of thousands of women and children would be alive and there would be no and no siege of or there would have been no atrocity on the underground on there would have been no flight of millions of there would be no miserable camps when the terrorist atrocity happened in last president immediately sent planes to bomb and more terrorism the product of bombast about being at war and showing no mercy that state violence and violence feed off each other is the truth that no national leader has the courage to speak when the truth is replaced by said the soviet dissident the silence is a lie the attack on the attack on the attack on happened because the leader in each of these countries was not a puppet of the west the human rights record of a or a was irrelevant they did not obey orders and surrender control of their country the same fate awaited once he had refused to sign an agreement that demanded the occupation of and its conversion to a market economy his people were and he was prosecuted in the independence of this kind is intolerable as has it was only when the leader in rejected an oil running through his country from to that he was attacked from that the planned to destroy the government of with fanatics the same fanatics currently holding the people of and eastern hostage why is this not the former foreign office official who was responsible for operating sanctions against told we would feed journalists factoids of or we would freeze them out that is how it worked propaganda is most effective when our consent is engineered by those with a fine education and with careers on the the the new the post these are known as the liberal media they present

the west is escalating its of media as weapons of information warfare that need but gilbert finds that accusation just another part of the wests own propaganda war one of the wests top points in condemning regime since has been his alleged suppression of democratic including an assault on media freedom and imposition of propaganda this the accusation was repeated in a resolution of the parliament calling for stronger in defense of values against information warfare from the charges that media are only an instrument of state propaganda directed at the domestic population to keep citizens in line and at foreign audiences to sow dissent among neighbors and within the union are taken as a matter of faith with almost no proofs adduced anyone who questions this group think is immediately labeled a tool of or worse president answering questions from citizens at his annual event on government i experienced this firsthand in march as one of three debaters on the a public affairs i objected to remarks by a fellow chairman of the parliaments foreign relations committee who maintained that crushed all liberties and his country has no free press based on my familiarity with the many different political lines of the print media and of the patently behind the national radio station and television station i countered for coverage of events in the was more and free than coverage in the lashed out with the slanderous and how much did the pay you to say the broadcaster then allowed this exchange to air freely i have ruminated on this exchange ever since and sought incontrovertible proof of the relative freedom of expression on broadcast media my close examination of the wildly popular political talk shows on television first as a spectator and then as a participant has provided just that i have written previously about my initial experience going back six months to when i first took part in a program on the state special correspondent i mentioned at the time the nearly permanent presence on these programs of domestic opposition figures as well as of foreigners from the and in who could be counted on to present views on the political topic of the days discussion at sharp variance with the line assessing the talk shows in early autumn i appeared on the same presenters new show sixty as well on what is probably the most respected show of this evening with another production has done television interviews with and may be considered to be as close to power as people in this medium get his personal views are probably more nationalist than the ruling united but on his shows gives time on air to very diverse and foreign views some of the estimated million who took part in immortal regiment parades across the country over three days in may in the past i broadened my experience with the talk show format by participating in shows on the other major state will and on the largest commercial television meeting this accelerated learning was facilitated by the presidential which made talking heads from like myself a rather hot commodity on television at least briefly in speaking to fellow panelists during break in interviews with i gathered some inside information about the production side of the talk including their target their technical aspects and their substantive positioning anyone looking over television programming in general quickly finds that talk shows as a format take up a very large part of broadcast time of the focus of talk shows may be highly and political talk shows were traditionally an evening as is the case with the shows cited while daytime programming more typically focuses on housewives daydreams of romance or tips for and the like in this it was a bold move when two years ago decided to launch a daily political talk show will in as the target audience proved to be women and viewers aged and although it appears there are also a fair number of viewers watching the program in the work place going daytime the ratings captured by this show typically are in the meaning that or so percent of all television viewers in at the given time are tuned to the given yielding an audience numbering in the millions on when i appeared on the show dedicated to analysis of the election the numbers spiked to as one might well understand given the very great interest among ordinary in the outcome of the race for the presidency and the outlook for war or peace a orchestra performing at roman theater on may after backed by air reclaimed the ancient city from the state from of the as time will tell presenter explained to the decision to appear on daytime television called for certain production decisions differentiating the programs from the evening talk shows the expectation of a less sophisticated audience meant that the language of panelists should be free of political science jargon and allusion to little known names or philosophies said panelists are asked to pitch their arguments as they would talking to their their mom or their lover on the other overly calm discussion is not seen as a benefit the presenter explains that his audience sitting at home at is in need of an adrenaline and the normal penchant of panelists to shout down one another in a is not discouraged in the way it is on evening programming the evening viewer is assumed to have come home from work and is seated in his armchair before the wants his nerves soothed more than excited all political talk shows on the main channels are produced in the and all feature on screen the caption live on air where and when these shows are broadcast live versus rebroadcast from video tapes is another matter for the programs are broadcast live to the far where they appear at the end of evening broadcasts then they are at local evening prime time in each of the

propaganda is now such a pervasive part of western governance that any foreign leader who resists the prevailing power structure can be turned into a demon and made a target of a regime change explains john by john journalist is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda the nephew of the pioneer of it was who coined the term public relations as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions in as a publicist for the cigarette persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the new easter parade behavior then considered outlandish one light another torch of fight another sex a pioneer in the modern use of propaganda influence extended far beyond advertising his greatest success was his role in convincing the public to join the slaughter of the first world war the he was engineering the consent of people in order to control and regiment according to our will without their knowing about it he described this as the true ruling power in our society and called it an invisible government the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood in my career as a journalist and i have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged tale of two cities imagine two cities both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country both cities are occupied by who commit terrible such as beheading people but there is a vital difference in one the government soldiers are described as liberators by western reporters embedded with who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes there are pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a for victory there is scant mention of civilian casualties permanent representative of the united states to the addresses the security council meeting on sept the difference is that these fanatics are supplied and armed by us by the united states and they even have a media center that is funded by and another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad condemned for assaulting and bombing the city which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city not really such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda i am of to the current siege of the city of by the government forces of who are backed by the united states and and to the siege of by the government forces of backed by one is the other is bad behind the fanatics what is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if and the united states had not invaded in that criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in moderate rebels smile as they prepare to behead a boy whose severed head is held aloft triumphantly in a later part of the video from the without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as the monstrous and and the front and the rest of the gang might not and the people of might not be fighting for their lives may remember in a succession of reporters turning to the camera and telling us that prime minister tony was vindicated for what turned out to be the crime of the the invasion of the television networks produced the same validation for w bush fox news brought on former secretary of state henry to effuse over of state fabrications the same soon after the i filmed an interview in with the renowned investigative journalist i asked what would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude he replied that if journalists had done their there is a very good chance we would not have gone to war in it was a shocking and one supported by other famous journalists to whom i put the same question rather of rose of the and journalists and producers in the who wished to remain anonymous there would have been no atrocity on the underground on there would have been no flight of millions of there would be no miserable camps when the terrorist atrocity happened in last president immediately sent planes to bomb and more terrorism the product of bombast about being at war and showing no mercy that state violence and violence feed off each other is the truth that no national leader has the courage to speak punishing independence the attack on the attack on the attack on happened because the leader in each of these countries was not a puppet of the west the human rights record of a or a was irrelevant they did not obey orders and surrender control of their country ousted leader shortly before he was murdered on as has it was only when the leader in rejected an oil running through his country from to that he was attacked from that the planned to destroy the government of with fanatics the same fanatics currently holding the people of and eastern hostage why is this not the former foreign office official who was responsible for operating sanctions against told we would feed journalists factoids of sanitized or we would freeze them out that is how it worked the wests medieval to which the and sell billions of dollars worth of arms is at present destroying a country so poor that in the best of half the children are malnourished look on and you will see the kind of massive bombs our bombs that the use against and against and funerals the explosions look like small atomic bombs the bomb aimers in work with officers this fact is not on the evening news refined messengers propaganda is most effective when our consent is engineered by those with a fine education and with careers on the the the new times the post new times building
the mainstream news media often holds itself out as the worlds gold home for careful reporting and diverse opinions compared to monolithic but the reality is quite says w in a wide ranging and necessary survey of political programming gilbert himself a frequent guest on those observes the charges that media are only an instrument of state propaganda directed at the domestic population to keep citizens in line and at foreign audiences to sow dissent among neighbors and within the union are taken as a matter of faith with almost no proofs adduced anyone who questions this group think is immediately labeled a tool of or worse host has launched an important conversation in light of the release of yet another alarmist media report this time by a group named after a long deceased democratic senator from state scoop which seeks to stifle debate on policy in the west by smearing dissenters from the conventional wisdom as useful idiots experience with the media therefore serves a double to combat willful western misconceptions of the media landscape as well as to serve as a useful point of comparison with media outlets and their coverage of if we take the example of the purportedly liberal cable news outlet we that the stance toward goes virtually unopposed regarding in comparison with their principal cable news rival to its credit occasionally makes room for the minority point of leaves about as much room for dissent as the perhaps less new as it there was a similar disparity when it came to the way the two networks covered the presidential election while went about bringing much needed balance to its albeit in the most inept way possible by hiring paid flacks from each of the campaigns to appear alongside actual republican rival fox wholly dispensed with any pretense of objectivity and served as little more than as a mouth piece for the disastrous campaign sen who led the red scare hearings of the as the liberal network found itself in the vanguard of the new which swept the but which in been a feature of the debate over policy since at least the beginning of the crisis in late if not earlier examples but perhaps the most striking case of the hysteria which attempted to dress up as its legitimate concern over national security was a rant that unleashed on her audience in when opened her show with a monologue dedicated to the proposition that trump was in league with in her signature informed readers that the admiration between and trump really is mutual i look at this praises trump brilliant and talented person praises bright and talented trump praises outstanding and talented trump there was some controversy over how to exactly translate but took care to flatter trump exactly the way trump likes to be and apparently enough for all he needs to all he needs to to tell how great is likes he must be must be great that is the very unusual context that you have a republican presidential nominee who is very susceptible to flattery the most powerful thing in the world to him if you compliment he will never forget it and kind of all he needs to know about you went on in this vein for quite a while longer little actual content but lots of and but her central such as it was little more than a regurgitation of democratic national committee talking points to no ones accusations were repeated almost verbatim in the press releases issued by the campaign which accused trump of being little more than a fifth columnist innuendo laden rant took on an added importance because she was the messenger after the sports journalist left the network in took over as the networks house intellectual so her words carry weight with its viewers in a do not nevertheless at no point at which i am aware did ever host a guest who pushed back against the still unproven charges that the government had interfered in the election or that trump in the words of former functionary mike an unwitting agent of the

voice as it is unquestionable that she has emerged as the networks most enthusiastic practitioner of the new days before the election hosted increasingly unhinged and former naval officer who has

the government had its hand on the scale of the election in was apoplectic president government that featured pierce made a good deal of sense throughout the pierce has been determined to draw a direct link between the trump campaign and a sample of his output helps tell the tale on pierce published trumps and shared agenda should alarm anyone concerned about democracy in which pierce speculated that trump seems increasingly dependent on money from and from the former soviet republics within its increasingly active sphere of influence in his offering of sept pierce protested that

comments what the government the government taketh away like that money in your wallet do you really think its if the people of would like to have a word with you you in case you missed the story during the din and clatter of the us selection all hell has broken loose in it all started on when prime minister made a surprise television address to the nation as you might have this was no stale policy speech sent through the country the by announcing that as of midnight that existing and rupee notes would no longer be accepted as legal tender the tax cattle would have until to trade in their and rupee notes at post offices and banks and just like that the bits of colored paper in everyones wallets were revealed as useless bits of colored paper already a
email at the branch office of the pentagons military alliance in there is a whirl of activity and apart from provoking by announcing an aggressive military surge around its its latest achievement was to have issue a commemorative stamp depicting the new headquarters and its distinctive architecture on a ceremony was held to mark the new but no details were given about the price of the vast palace which will enable all allies to have the space they require and there is also space for expansion should the need arise there is never any mention by of the staggering cost overrun that took but two years ago revealed that it was more than double the original construction at over a billion ten days before the stamp secretary general left the palace to visit a more modest one in where he met pope after his some observers were unkind enough to express surprise that could spare the time for such an but all was made clear when it was announced that the meeting took place in the sidelines of his visit to to celebrate the establishment anniversary of the defense an institution that has contributed generously to the economy his holiness the pope did not of course make a public statement about the but the publicity machine large and remarkably expensive organization that also arranges stamp issue made up for the omission by announcing that he and his illustrious visitor discussed global issues of common including the conflicts in and the wider middle the importance of protecting civilian populations from and the importance of in international affairs to reduce tensions the secretary general also stressed that climate change could pose a significant security risk it is remarkable that his holiness engaged in such deliberations with the titular head of an enormous military and it would be interesting to know if the pope mentioned that he did not always agree with the policies espoused by and his directors in as he averred earlier this year it will be recollected that in patriarch of the orthodox church met with pope in and that western media headlines included pope handed a diplomatic victory which was as absurd as it was trivial but even the economist headline was similarly slanted and amusingly asked did the pope just kiss this set the tone for other but one thrust of its reporting was especially as it pointed out in shocked shocked tones that the pope had made clear in his interview before the meeting that on certain issues he agrees with and disagrees with and its allies how truly dreadful that the pope dares to be impartial and ventures to disagree with and its allies about international affairs the economist further noted that on where western powers helped to bring down former dictator the pope was the west ought to be and he continued that in there has been a convergence of analysis between the holy see and the economist did not mention the unpalatable fact that the western powers the military alliance bombed and rocketed to a catastrophic resulting in anarchy and a base for terrorists perhaps the pope had taken note of that merciless and of the fact that under the dictator the catholic community in had lived peacefully while now it is suffering gravely as recorded by freedom international the upsurge in attacks on in since the supported ouster of is of grave concern condemns these killings and attacks on property in what is becoming an increasingly inhospitable region for perhaps pope raised this with the devout a graduate of cathedral school who was prime minister of when its air force carried out about percent of the in from march to the news that the pope has had the temerity and moral realism to disagree with and its allies is not altogether but the report that on certain issues he agrees with must have shaken whose fundamental stance is that is trying to kind of spheres of influence along its borders and for me this just underlines the importance of strong of strong partnership with other countries in that are not members of believes that because wants to establish more maintain spheres of influence along its borders then it must be discouraged or even stopped from doing so this is and it is unsurprising that his holiness has made it clear that the is not an unconditional supporter of pentagon and its palatial in may not have read the address to the us congress by his holiness in when he said we need to avoid a common temptation to discard whatever proves troublesome let us remember the golden do unto others as you would have them do unto you as reported the line drew thunderous applause from followed with some hesitation by a pattern repeated throughout the address in his talk to congress pope eschewed the line that desire to maintain peaceful spheres of influence around its borders must by definition be wrong and pointed out that there is another temptation which we must especially guard against the simplistic reductionism which sees only good or if you the righteous and sinners as president observed in an interview with we are not expanding it is including military that is moving towards our borders is this a manifestation of our it is not except in the eyes of such as the pentagon and makes many visits round the including attendance at the general assembly in new where he had discussions among president dear its great to see you again and secretary general ban and another recent stopover was in the united emirates on while committing to an individual partnership and cooperation program he praised the for its role as a valuable partner in projecting international security and from to to perhaps meeting with the pope affected his memory he ignores the unpalatable facts that in as freedom house reports there has been little progress in

evening news there was plenty of time to speculate what lay behind the actual story in other there experts on every news channel telling the viewer what to think a few months i watched the murder of six of the kidnappers on live television many media historians consider that event to be the beginning of the news cycle we live with now as brad points out in his newly published investigation of the group responsible for the kidnapping titled revolutions the patty mind and the secret history of and the it was a new technology that first made this live coverage possible this is not the focus of text revolutions end is about much more than the kidnapping or its coverage it is an investigation into the creation of the liberation army its roots in various law enforcement agencies and its intention to destroy the underground armed left of the early in the united states while not a new theory by any narrative is the first such attempt to examine this possibility for the general public from the moment the the aware of the doubts about their origins were expressed in large at least on the this was due to the groups confused and nebulous politics claiming to be an the first public attack they made was on the superintendent of schools in foster popular among progressives for some of his pedagogical approaches and his relatively forward thinking on issues of race and the gunned him down in their rationale was that he was instituting a pass system for students similar to the pass system in use by the south apartheid authorities in foster was opposed to the plan and was working to limits its reach in terms of accessibility by the police department describes the writing that the two men convicted of the murder were not actually the gunmen in the crime in according to and his it was the leader of the aka who along with a female actually committed the murder the persona of is the linchpin to the claims about the connection to law enforcement investigated in the book and previous investigations the primary investigation was conducted by the citizens research and investigation committee in the the black panther party newspaper published some of this showing the connections between well known and law enforcement agencies in in it is alleged that also worked for the and was a participant in various drug and mind control experiments during his imprisonment in prisons medical facility like millions of others in the i was fascinated by the story of the as it played out in the media from the kidnapping of patty to the distribution of the food ransom to poor people in various cities to conversion to an urban the unfolding drama was certainly better than most shows on in as a new left activist who was looking with many for an effective means to make a difference in a political milieu whose numbers were i participated in numerous discussions about the and its meaning for the rest of the left while much of the left dismissed the group as crazy or police the fact of their existence left others wondering if maybe they albeit somewhat misreading the political climate both on the left and in the greater public even more fascinating than the publicly known story of the text takes an extended and serious look at a possible deep narrative regarding the genesis of the as noted it is a narrative often suspected by many leftists and others regarding the groups beginnings by accepting it makes it easier to understand why its members did some of what they did in revolutions end describes a covert operation undertaken by various law enforcement agencies that went off the rail succinctly revolutions end postulates does a fairly good job of that the group that became the liberation army was begun in part as an attempt to ferret out potential violent radicals in while simultaneously attempting to discredit the revolutionary left played a role as both patsy and organizer while in prison his role as provocateur raised but somehow he was able to belay them in the he took advantage of the leeway given him in the prison to sleep with various women on the outside according to one of these women was patty who was involved in the prisoner rights movement in the period during which the was originally formed describes the as a group with three distinct phases the first was set up by informants for the above the second went from this entity to a albeit confused political and the third came after the deaths of members in a police attack on their hideout it was the last of the formations that included patty in a more fundamental role than as she hid out in communes and hideouts around the united states until she was finally captured with in in text covers all the manifestations of the except the last in doing he provides the reader with a look at the nature of an element of the radical underground left in united states even more is the detailed and convincing examination he provides the reader of how police agencies can and do work to destroy the political enemies of the corporate state it is this latter aspect that seems most important when the intelligence capabilities and legally granted powers to law enforcement agencies are so much greater than they were forty years ago one need only look at the various entrapment schemes arranged by the and other agencies that have cornered various folks into terror plots that would probably never have existed without the logistical and motivational assistance of those government agencies

email it was years or so when a classmate at bard college insisted that i read a short story by babel titled the reserve cavalry commander that he described to me as a cossack soldier miraculously bringing a moribund horse to its feet the red cavalry title of babels collection of short stories written when the and former was with had been confiscating peasant horses during the civil war and trading in nags ridden to exhaustion on the battlefield for fresh ones for the backward this was the sort of intrusion that would become the straw that broke the camels back in about a being forced into collective farms like recalcitrant horses drove them into open revolt for the time they were inclined to tolerate the communists who at least had come to power on the promise of bread and land it was the assault on the land that for the time being assuaged the peasants responding to an aggrieved the eponymous reserve cavalry commander who was a former circus rider described by babel as with a gray a black and wide red trousers with silver promised that he could make this lively little mare spring to her feet again the idea that the horse splayed out on the ground could be described as lively was almost an insult the cried lord in heaven and mother of god how is this poor thing supposed to get its on its last ability to bring the horse back on its feet was like raising from the dead but all the more miraculous since it likely occurred most of babels short stories were based on his experience as a war correspondent he you are insulting this my dear answered with fierce conviction pure my dear and he deftly swung his athletes body out of his saddle splendid and deft as if in the circus he stretched his magnificent his trousers girded by cords around the and walked up to the dying animal she peered at him dolefully with a penetrating licked some invisible command from his crimson and immediately the feeble mare felt bracing power flow from this blossoming romeo her muzzle her legs skidding under feeling the whip tickling her stomach with imperious the mare slowly and rose onto her legs and then we all saw slender hand with its fluttering sleeve run through her dirty and his whining whip swatting her bleeding ranks her whole body the mare stood on four legs without moving her lovestruck eyes from so you is a said to the and added and you were my dearest of throwing his reins to his the commander of the reserve cavalry jumped the four stairs in a single leap swirling off his operatic disappeared into the headquarters reading this story once again for the first time in i am reminded of how important babel was to me at the time like and he was a portal into the world of modernist literature that still had an immense attraction for young bohemians in the early i never thought once about who babel was or anything about the social reality he was trying to depict all that mattered to me was babels prose that could evoke the mysterious power of a cossack resurrecting a dying horse my early connections to modernism and my later connections to that superseded it and just about all the other intellectual baggage i carried around with me from the early converged as i watched a press screening of finding babel that opens on th at the cinema village in new directed by who has a background as a sound it is a film that will be of great interest to those whose appreciation of babel is strictly literary as was mine long ago and to those trying to come to terms with the soviet legacy given the prominence of today as a possible trigger of according to babels multiple identity as communist and critic of soviet deficiencies is worth pondering the film is structured around the odyssey conducted by who is the grandson of babel and an acting professor in the theater department of the new college of to see where his grandfather lived and to speak with people who knew him or who have studied or been inspired by his work babel was executed for treason in having been charged with belonging to a group and spying for and babels wife who died at the age of in is interviewed in the film and provides much of the information about babels personality and his travails as a dissident after her husbands arrest in the soviet cops told her to forget about him and to regulate her life according to the new times obituary she was formidable in her own right with her engineering she helped to design the subway system the obit ms recalled babels dismay at her haphazard reading which he tried to correct by drawing up a list of the hundred books that every educated person needs to read it included a volume titled the instincts and morals of insects she recounted evenings spent with soviet cultural giants like the film director m and visits by foreign luminaries like and it was babels mistake apparently to adhere to the values of the original revolution rather than to fall in line as a toady as he travels around encounters intellectuals and ordinary people who revere babel as one of their own especially for another collection of short stories that is as highly regarded as red cavalry written in and the stories focus on gangsters living in an hardly the material expect to find written by a partisan of the revolution but certainly in keeping with the original inspiration of soviet culture that conformed to homo a me or i am and nothing of that which is human is alien to me although i have never read i plan to as soon as i find the time since it is about the same sort

not be held hostage to the autocratic whims of but rather a full partner to a free and robust electoral process that guarantees not just meaningful input from the governed but the ability to challenge

by why did they vote for this if we understand why that choice was we will all get and not only in north but also all over the since the results of the latest presidential elections were i am longing for while the overwhelming cacophony of deafening noises is assaulting my and in fact all my senses suddenly everyone around me wants to to and to declare people who are surrounding as well as those who are far away from me are frantically watching the reading newspapers and browsing through countless political websites my friends and comrades all over the world are poking jokes at the us political or trembling in anticipation of something even apocalyptic many are just having fun even some thoughtful and educated individuals are behaving like obsessive football passing and spending countless hours on the in front of their television screens of course there are also many gigantic protests in countless cities against the the leader of the mightiest nation on earth there are some massive desperate and hopeless protests there are also personal resigned shrugs of shoulders and downcast glances overall there is a lot of noise everyone is speaking from the top of his or her lungs people are shouting over each other they want to be desperately while very few are listening very few also appear to be reflecting on what is being said by the on what is truly on what has happened despite millions of words and images assaulting our brains from all i know that something is definitely something and even something essential it is not just my analytical mind that comprehends it is also my intuition as a i want to smash those television sets in my i want to throw newspapers into the garbage and i want to go far from all my politicizing friends and comrades but what is it that is being omitted in the official and even in the alternative what is it that i want to longing to hear so much longing with such even with such am i desperate for some precise for exact for revealing am i yearning for one brilliant for a do i want to hear from someone why on earth did the people elect someone like like or is it all actually much more simple and do i expect those wise words to come from my own typed into my computer with my own how did it all really come to and what will happen what will happen to them the what will happen to the which despite everything used to be my home for many what will happen to which took so but which also gave me i kept above what will happen to the to the entire which is now my true and which is also their true home of the although perhaps they do not fully comprehend it yet i did not want to hear the i care less about the numbers i was not longing for and i felt absolutely no desire to there was only one longing left in to to to absorb the millions of voices of those who just recently went to the polls and stuck those pieces of paper into most likely changing the destiny of the world and since i knew i be able to absorb millions of i wanted to listen to at least a few hundred or even thousands of them if possible i wanted to hear the stories of those men and women from the from the deep from isolated farms and exhausted mining towns i wanted to put my glass of beer next to in some and just nod and whisper what so many storytellers before have done for and what they will be saying for many centuries to please tell me your story i want to hear their stories so i can collect arrange and pass them onto the world i want the people who voted for trump to speak to to to let me into their thoughts and emotions i want to understand what occurred through their stories i want to judge i am usually very very and very ideological this time i have no desire to be this is too too damn i owe that much that is the least i can do to return to fly there all the way from to rent a and drive from coast to for long and to finally listen to trying to understand who they what they and i am what i am because i am a passionate i was once told by one of the greatest people always know what goes on all we have to do is to listen to them and we have to lead them only when they ask when they order us to do so there is no doubt in my mind that now is the time to attentively listen to the to fill newspapers and websites with their words but almost no one seems to be doing that all we hear is why they voted as they did how they particular classes or states we read about numbers but we hear people we hear them formulating the words and that is what i am longing to shut to be and to listen and i want other intellectuals to shut up and to humbly listen not because i agree with what the have done not because i want trump to lead the country and the empire not because i suddenly fell in love with the small people it is simply because the people of the most powerful country on earth have because they made their choice and if we understand why that choice was we will all get and not only in north but also all over the i want to listen and to understand so the course of action can be so that we know where all this will lead because this is not the just the beginning of something

is the loneliest country in the world is it because abandoned the traditional family of all the nations on the entire the united states is the most lonely place to be we have the highest percentage of one person households on the entire and the average size of our households has been steadily decreasing studies have shown that the number of close friends that have is and we have the highest divorce rate in the world by a wide margin so why is this does this have anything to do with the fact that is abandoning the traditional family back in the the sexual revolution fundamentally changed the way that millions of viewed sex and love by throwing out all of the old many believed that they would ultimately be able to have more sex and more love this manifests itself in a hookup culture that is constantly being promoted as healthy in our popular in our television shows and in our movies but instead of this hookup culture resulting in more sex and more most are discovering that it leads to just the opposite we have become a nation of desperately lonely people that have very few real ties to others never in the history of our nation have been so isolated from one another most people get up in the drive to work or perhaps do a little shopping and then drive home again the rest of the evening is typically spent in front of the television or on some sort of electronic device in most spend precious little time attending social gatherings of any sort these days church attendance is at historic lows and most people take the time or the effort to get involved in other types of social groups and even when do go out and try to meet the relationships that are formed are very much on the surface at best the truth is that most have very few close friends just take a moment and consider how many people outside your immediate family actually love you and would be there for you no matter what for most that number is depressingly low in a desperate attempt for human love and an increasing number of have turned to social networking websites such as to fill that void for the desperately some human contact is better than none in a growing number of people are so desperate for people to talk with them that they will pretend to be someone else many will even use an attractive picture of someone else in an attempt to try to lure others this has become so common that this phenomenon has even been given a name it is known as and it has grown to epidemic levels other deal with their loneliness by recklessly indulging in shopping or other addictions we are a fundamentally unhappy and this is reflected in the fact that we lead the world in antidepressant use in the total number of taking antidepressants doubled between and could a lot of this have been avoided if we would have just fully embraced the traditional family structure as a most of us be doing a lot better if we lived in homes that were filled with healthy just consider what the consequences of free love and the hookup culture have been for has the highest percentage of one person households on the entire planet years were living in the average but now the average household only consists of people in percent of all households in the united states contained a married couple that number has declined to percent marriage rate in the united states has fallen to an low right now it is sitting at a yearly rate of marriages per people an low percent of in the to year old age bracket are married to the pew research only percent of all that are at least years old are currently married back in percent of all adults were married the united states more than half of all couples move in together before they get married divorce rate for couples that live together first is significantly higher than for those that do not has the highest divorce rate on the globe by a wide margin the average woman had her first child when she was years old now the average woman has her first child when she is years old birth rate for women in the to year old age bracket has fallen to births per women that is a new record low one out of every three children in the united states lives in a home without a father women under the age of living in the united states more than half of all babies are being born out of wedlock for most marriage has come to be viewed as a temporary agreement that can be abandoned the moment that it no longer makes them happy any longer this approach to love and marriage has had a whole host of negative consequences for us as a nation as the national marriage project puts a marriage in now depends for its survival on the happiness of both spouses over the last four many have moved away from identifying with an institutional model of which seeks to integrate economic and emotional intimacy in a permanent union this model has been overwritten by the soul mate which sees marriage as primarily a vehicle for personal emotional and shared consumption that depends for its survival on the happiness of both spouses thus where marriage used to serve as the gateway to responsible it has come to be increasingly seen as a capstone of sorts that signals couples have both financially and are on the cusp of arriving and our young people are no longer taught to value marriage they are told to put off marriage and to go out and have some fun this message is constantly being reinforced by popular culture for posted below is an actual ad
in the new you get any by on one of the unique things about the constitution of the united states was that it guaranteed certain rights for its citizens those rights provided the foundation for an era of freedom and prosperity that was pretty much unprecedented in human history and dozens of other nations eventually copied many of the ideas contained in our constitution and bill of rights because they worked so well of course our system never functioned but when you compare it to what has gone on for most of human it truly was a bright light in a sea of oppression and totalitarianism our rights are now being systematically taken away from us in the politicians have convinced most of us that in order to keep us all safe we must give up many of our rights and move toward becoming a totalitarian police state in the new you get any rights they tell us that giving people rights is too dangerous you get some limited privileges which can be revoked at any time by the authorities most have become so that they even realize what is happening how many do you think have actually read the i went through high college and even law school without ever being required to read the constitution of the united states that most even understand that they have rights because they have never even read the documents that grant them those rights you can find the text of the constitution right here if you have never taken the time to read the whole you really should according to the the following are some of the rights that we are supposed to have of religion from unreasonable searches and seizures right to due process of law right to a speedy and public trial from cruel and unusual punishments all of those rights are under attack in today in most a right is not taken away all at once opponents of these rights take what is known as an incremental approach for we are told that there are certain limits on the freedom of speech we are told that we cannot yell fire in a crowded theater and we accept that because it sounds reasonable but then once everyone agrees that there are limits on that the control freaks that run things just keep trying to tighten those limits in thousands of different ways until our freedom of speech is whittled away to almost nothing it is imperative that we stand up for our liberties and freedoms if we defend them eventually they will be gone for good the following are some examples of how our rights are under attack in today the federal government has become absolutely obsessed with monitoring everything that say this chills free speech because it gives people the feeling that there is always somebody watching it has recently been revealed that the department of homeland security plans to monitor social media outlets on the if you use the wrong keywords or if you are a key influencer on the there is no doubt that someone from the federal government will be keeping tabs on you the following comes from a recent rt article under the national operations center media monitoring initiative that came out of headquarters in has the written permission to retain data on users of social media and networking platforms the announced the and its office of operations coordination and planning can collect personal information from news reporters or anyone who may use traditional social media in real time to keep their audience situationally aware and informed in the powers that be seem to have become absolutely fascinated with twitter and as i have written about previously the federal reserve has decided to start monitoring social media sites and in order to keep track of what is being said about them and as a recent fox news article the department of homeland security is also developing such a system though still in is looking to establish a system for monitoring public websites and message boards the idea is to gather and analyze publicly available and then use that information to help officials respond to disasters and other situations so why do they have to spend so much energy and money keeping track of what we are all saying on the why they just let us one would think that the federal government has bigger problems to deal with at this point this trend toward endlessly snooping on citizens is not likely to reverse any time soon so could what you say on the get you labeled as a or as a potential signed a new law which allows the military to arrest potential terrorists on hold them indefinitely without trial and even ship them off to bay for endless interrogation sessions the insanity of this new law was detailed in a recent article by henry the reason this law is horrifying is not that terrorists deserve to be handled with kid gloves they the reason its horrifying is without due it is too easy for the government to just declare someone a terrorist who actually a terrorist its too in other for government employees to do what everyone else make mistakes if you think its possible for the government to mistakenly assume that someone is a terrorist who read this story by who was just held as a terrorist by the government in for and a half years at says he was tortured for not telling his captors what they wanted to he was a terrorist he was only eventually freed after his case went to the supreme court and the supreme court ruled that it might be a good idea to ask the government to present the evidence that led it to believe that was a terrorist government present according to this new law just reaffirms what he already had the power to do in his signing stated that he already had the authority
voting machine problems are being reported all over by on after what happened in the last election people seem to be more alert to signs of potential election fraud this time around and right now the is buzzing with reports of voting machine problems in some of the most important swing states in some areas officials were forced to make emergency switches to paper ballots due to voting machine and in other cases voters that intended to vote for trump were having their votes registered for instead the mainstream media is insisting that these are isolated and hopefully that turns out to be true because the integrity of our elections is of the utmost importance voting machines are supposed to make voting easier and more but instead they are once again causing major headaches all over the country the following summary of technical issues that we have seen so far comes from the new daily voting machine problems in the southern part of the state forced poll workers to use paper with some residents sent to alternate voting locations voters in received provisional ballots after officials reported computer problems though at least one county said that the state electoral system was back up afternoon machine issues were reported in and at one point all of the machines went according to local reports voting later resumed manually in a computer used by election clerks malfunctioned at a polling so officials briefly diverted voters to another polling place more than two miles away in some early voters were forced to wait as correct machines were installed in paper poll books were being used due to tech problems at a few sites but much more troubling is what has been happening in numerous voters have been reporting that their votes were switched by the voting machines from trump to the following is an excerpt from one local news time i would push a candidate for the republican it would come up for the democratic said voter election judges in butler county confirmed there were issues with two of their eight automated voting machines most of the issues came when people tried to vote straight party ticket others said they specifically wanted to vote for republican trump only to see their vote switched before their eyes to democrat i went pressed trump again three times i did so then i called one of the women that were working the polls over and she said you must be doing it wrong she did it three times and it defaulted to every lee said and today is reporting that vote switching is also being reported in and in one of the few glitches with political a problem with the calibration of electronic voting machines in caused about a half dozen machines to display what voters thought were straight republican tickets as straight democratic tickets poll workers alerted the county elections and voters were able to change their said director of the county bureau of elections if you this exact same kind of thing happened in the swing state of in so if ends up being the difference in a this will need to be looked at very closely reports of vote switching in are already getting so much attention that they are even making television other parts of the a different type of problem has emerged one voter that tried to vote for trump was extremely frustrated when the voting machine that he was using remained completely stuck on a selection for this particular voter captured this on video and uploaded the video footage to twitter this is what i was talking they fixed it but it was on some nut shit at first voter turnout is very heavy all over the and it looks like we may shatter voter participation records all over the nation so that is a good thing and we can get an idea of what voters are thinking by what they are searching for on the looking at searches of who is voting these names are the most swift

unavailable pages on this site are constantly being and occasionally removed you may have followed an outdated link or have outdated pages in your browser cache heres a i so how did come up with its predetermined final vote counts for and trump answer a method called fractional vote to a fractional vote feature is embedded in the gems election management system of electronic voting machines which counts approximately of all votes in the united states as explained by the fractional vote feature can be used to yet alter election outcomes by desired vote percentages for the candidates the tampering can be applied across large jurisdictions in less than is not visible to election even if they are standing in the room and watching the and is unlikely to be detected by auditing or canvass procedures gems systems operate under five trade global election election premier election dominion voting and election systems in addition to a number of private regional subcontractors gems is used statewide in new and and for counties in and it is also used in by electronic voting machines is real a hacking democracy investigates the flawed integrity of electronic voting particularly those made by election systems global election and exposes previously unknown in the trade secret computer software hacking democracy documents citizens investigating anomalies and irregularities with electronic voting systems during the and especially in the film culminates in the hacking of the election system in the same computer voting system which has been used in elections across and which still counts tens of millions of votes today so what is fractional or fractional vote is a method to distort the results of an election by weighting the votes instead of the principle of one some votes are counted not as but as a fraction of or less than or or as more than or the distortion of one vote is in order to achieve a percentage of votes for each candidate for candidate a is of the candidate b and candidate c gets the rest an algorithm is used to arrive at the percentages by changing the numbers automatically as the voting progresses although candidate a in actuality received fewer number of votes than candidate by weighting candidate as those votes are distorted in with one vote being so that candidate a is the winner and although candidate b actually received more votes than candidate candidate votes are weighted such that their values are with some votes converted to zero the end result is that candidate b loses according to below are the numerical votes and percentages that are the presidential election results for the various states which are already on the election results of a local station in tn if you go onto that all the values are line us president line trump line line us president line trump line line us

donate those of you that care about about the about the beauty of queer sexual about indigenous lands and their right to and about policing practices that have led to the deaths of many black men and how do we respond to this confusing what do we do how do we by let us acknowledge these difficult feelings of these terrifying thoughts that are suddenly very alive in the air today it is as if box has not only been emptied out into the but that it has been and spread out to the corners of all lands hope now seems in short supply we are undone i write you because things have indeed fallen apart while this unspeakable insurgency of despair might goad us into rushing into the next organizational moment the itch to hit them back or do something i want to invite us to slow down and pay attention to the stark grief that haunts us now she stares us in the this repulsive visitor if we must we must return her gaze and let her do her important work with us i am a living in but like most people on the planet that tuned in to the surrealism of the presidential i woke up to the shocking news that trump was not only beating on election but that there was a frightening possibility he could win and then that distant once laughably out of the became a blue wall fell to the man who promised to build the media people stuttered as their once pristine cast of glossy pundits groped for the peso fell and in one fell it felt like the home of the brave was exactly that a place dyed in where braveness would now be required to keep on living ever since trump became the th president of the united the has been flooded with articles attempting to make sense of this moment politico published a piece with a title that must have resonated with many people around the how did everyone get it so the independent insisted that trump would have lost us election if sanders had been the while frank opined on the pages of the guardian that trump is moving to the white and liberals put him there across the fractured landscape of also surprised by their fortune laughed at mocking the that thought an admittedly troubled candidate who seem to have a message beyond insisting on her entitlement would simply waltz into the white house i will not attempt to pry open the cadaver of this moment it is probably the case that no analysis is good enough to assuage our feelings of shock what happened is not reducible to a single causative factor or a decidable active ingredient the world that simple i will however in the spirit of full disclosure the kind of radical honesty we probably need at this time that i secretly wanted this to i was so invested in the idea of a sanders presidency so mortified by what was obvious to me as an attempt to stifle his that i became possessed by a i easily exorcise i understood the dangers of a potential trump but decided even that was better off to the inertia of the status quo as embodied by a regime that argument is not easily maintained in the face of the orange predicament we now find ourselves in in an case of be careful what you wish i find not relief but a painful sympathy with many who had hoped that the morning of th would somehow usher in a more tolerant a more beautiful country a country that cares about its many and contours now because of trump and the energies he has minorities are probably less safe at a time of unprecedented racial tensions and phallic exhibitions of some folks are already dreading their next brief visit to the shopping knowing that the streets are now being painted red with white with racial acrimony and blind and blue with the authoritarian aloofness of a candidate who promised law and order the new it is to these vulnerable ones i write those of you that care about about the about the beauty of queer sexual about indigenous lands and their right to and about policing practices that have led to the deaths of many black men and women without trump or falling into the trap of disillusioned punditry and yet with a keen awareness of the likely consequences of his presidency i how do we respond to what do we how do we what opportunities are presenting themselves to us to work for a caring at the time of writing this there is news of revolt on the streets of new and other cities people are protesting the rise of trump people are angry around this same famed has suggested concerned should fire the punditry and take over the democratic party it is impossible to answer the question of what a right response or to speak as if one is situated outside the swirl and flow of things i do however want to invite you to try doing something less spectacular something for it is my opinion that with the seeds of a new politics may yet be planted when i was growing up in i was taught to think of my life only in terms of its greatness quotient i was conditioned early to yearn for prominence fame fortune legacy success awakening the giant within getting to the top lasting forever those were resonant in my developmental years the figures of bill jack and were placed before me as aspirational objects if i did not do all i can to increase my greatness my life did not really matter i suspect this story is not uniquely mine to tell we live in a world that places priority in the top and discountenances the bottom the condition for living a life of meaning and purpose was moral
donate speaks in on march la n by on trump managed to pull the biggest upset in us politics by tapping successfully into the anger of white voters and appealing to the lowest inclinations of people in a manner that would have probably impressed propagandist himself but what exactly does trump victory and what can one expect from this megalomaniac when he takes over the reins of power on what is trump political if and is a will us foreign policy be any different under a trump some years public intellectual warned that the political climate in the us was ripe for the rise of an authoritarian figure he shares his thoughts on the aftermath of this the moribund state of the us political system and why trump is a real threat to the world and the planet in general for the unthinkable has in contrast to all trump scored a decisive victory over and the man that described as a dangerous clown and will be the next president of the united states in your what were the deciding factors that led voters to produce the biggest upset in the history of us before turning to this i think it is important to spend a few moments pondering just what happened on a date that might turn out to be one of the most important in human depending on how we react no exaggeration the most important news of was barely a fact of some significance in itself on the world meteorological organization delivered a report at the international conference on climate change in morocco which was called in order to carry forward the agreement of the reported that the past five years were the hottest on record it reported rising sea soon to increase as a result of the unexpectedly rapid melting of polar most ominously the huge antarctic glaciers arctic sea ice over the past five years is percent below the average of the previous not only raising sea but also reducing the cooling effect of polar ice reflection of solar thereby accelerating the grim effects of global warming the reported further that temperatures are approaching dangerously close to the goal established by along with other dire reports and forecasts another event took place on which also may turn out to be of unusual historical significance for reasons once were barely noted on the most powerful country in world which will set its stamp on what comes had an election the outcome placed total control of the government the supreme court in the hands of the republican which has become the most dangerous organization in world history apart from the last all of this is uncontroversial the last phrase may seem even outrageous but is the facts suggest otherwise the party is dedicated to racing as rapidly as possible to destruction of organized human life there is no historical precedent for such a stand is this an consider what we have just been witnessing during the republican every candidate denied that what is happening is happening with the exception of the sensible like who said it all but we do have to do anything because we producing more natural thanks to or john who agreed that global warming is taking but added that are going to burn in and we are not going to apologize for the winning now the calls for rapid increase in use of fossil including dismantling of rejection of help to developing countries that are seeking to move to sustainable and in racing to the cliff as fast as possible trump has already taken steps to dismantle the environmental protection agency by placing in charge of the transition a notorious climate change trump top adviser on billionaire oil executive announced his which were dismantling tax cuts for the industry the wealthy and corporate sector more fossil fuel lifting temporary block on the access pipeline the market reacted quickly shares in energy corporations including the world largest coal which had filed for but after trump registered a percent gain the effects of republican had already been felt there had been hopes that the agreement would lead to a verifiable but any such thoughts were abandoned because the republican congress would not accept any binding so what emerged was a voluntary evidently much weaker effects may soon become even more vividly apparent than they already are in tens of millions are expected to have to flee from plains in coming years because of sea level rise and more severe creating a migrant crisis that will make today pale in significance with considerable leading climate scientist says that migrants should have the right to move to the countries from which all these greenhouse gases are coming millions should be able to go to the united and to the other rich countries that have grown wealthy while bringing about a new geological the marked by radical human transformation of the environment these catastrophic consequences can only not just in but in all of south as already intolerable for the inexorably rise and the glaciers threatening the entire water supply already in some million people are reported to lack adequate drinking water and the effects will reach far beyond it is hard to find words to capture the fact that humans are facing the most important question in their history whether organized human life will survive in anything like the form we know and are answering it by accelerating the race to disaster similar observations hold for the other huge issue concerning human the threat of nuclear which has been looming over our heads for years and is now increasing it is no less difficult to find words to capture the utterly astonishing fact that in all of the massive coverage of the electoral none of this receives more than passing mention at least i am at a loss to find appropriate words turning finally to the question to be it appears that

is common domestic abuse and sexual assault destroy families despair and rage among the population have fueled an inchoate homophobia and and feed the latent and ever present poison of white supremacy they also nourish the magical thinking peddled by the con artists in the the state lotteries that fleece the and an entertainment industry that night after night shows visions of an and a lifestyle on television apprentice typified foster unattainable dreams of wealth and celebrity those who are cast aside as human refuse often have a psychological need for illusions and scapegoats they desperately seek the promise of divine intervention they unplug from a reality that is too hard to bear they see in especially those who are the obstacles to their advancement and success we must recognize and understand the profound despair that leads to these reactions to understand these reactions is not to condone them the suffering of the white underclass is real its members struggle with humiliation and a crippling loss of and dignity the last thing they or is politically correct thought police telling them what to say and think and condemning them as mutations of human beings those cast aside by the order have an economic identity that both the liberal class and the right wing are unwilling to acknowledge this economic identity is one the white underclass shares with other discarded including the undocumented workers and the people of color by the carnival barkers on cable news shows this is an economic reality the power elites invest great energy in masking the of the liberal which revels in imagined tolerance and enlightenment while condemning the white underclass as widens the divide between white workers and urban elites liberals have no right to pass judgment on these without acknowledging their pain they must listen to their which the corporate media shut out they must offer solutions that provide the possibility of economic stability and liberal class has no hope of defeating the rise of fascism until it unites with the dispossessed white working class it has no hope of being an effective force in politics until it articulates a viable martin king understood the downward spiral of hating those who hate you in a real sense all life is he wrote in letter from a men are caught in an inescapable network of tied in a single garment of destiny whatever affects one affects all indirectly i can never be what i ought to be until you are what you ought to and you can never be what you ought to be until i am what i ought to cannot battle the bigotry and hate crimes that will be stoked by the trump presidency without first battling for economic justice this is not a gap between the tolerant and the intolerant it is a gap between most of the population and our oligarchic and corporate which trump epitomizes it is a gap that is understood only in the light of the demand for economic justice and when we start to speak in the language of justice and the language of inclusiveness we will begin to blunt the being embraced by many trump supporters i spent two years writing a book on the right called fascists the right and the war on i spent many months with dispossessed white workers in states such as and i carried into the book project all the prejudices that come with being raised in the liberal disdain for a magic who answers your prayers and

those who retreat into a binary world of good and evil those enthralled by such thinking are did not come to make us rich and powerful and bless potential fascists they have fused the iconography and

power of the lords prayer that a sleazy developer and con artist was chosen as their percent of evangelicals voted for achieving this goal is to say the least but this is not a movement most of those

fort translated by j what scares politicians more than what is their number one not tanks coming down street they afraid of tanks for two reasons first of politicians have made so much money selling media disinformation to the west about tanks invading that they themselves are no longer afraid of this happening they have a whole a whole image of this and all relations with the west are built on their promises to provoke into open military intervention these promises have brought them money and so the very thought of a military invasion warms their soul now for the second reason is now ruled by very opinionated people who are convinced if something manage to make it to and fly away they hope that after fleeing from tanks they will be provided with and respect for the rest of their life form a government in exile and follow with endless lawsuits in international courts and travel the world giving lectures about how much suffered from and how much they miss unfortunate the regime is not afraid of a invasion they have an entirely different and it is precisely this other nightmare that is creeping into their daily reality i periodically try to explain to the experts that i encounter in television studios that has worn out even its strongest supporters in the west tired them out so much and so thoroughly that these supporters are already starting to discuss things that were unthinkable a year ago remember pace that bunch of bureaucrats who condemned for aggression against and deprived the delegation of its voting well now deputies are saying that pace is preparing a devastating report on human rights failures in the chairman of pace has even stated that it is necessary to bring back the delegation to work in and he even wrote a letter to with the proposal to personally meet to discuss this issue members of the delegation to pace are writing articles about the powerful lobby which could steal pace and force it to betray heres another example after authorities fulfilled all conditions for obtaining a vise free politicians turned to outright mocking them during it was recently revealed that martin the chairman of the now binds the regime to the fulfillment of the agreements an unpleasant situation has unfolded for official if they blame for not fulfilling the then have to admit that the has made dependent on the goodwill if this is not then have to admit that martin has facto blamed for disrupting the agreements and has punished the side by depriving it of its coveted visa free regime amidst all of the propaganda that the whole world supports looks very unconvincing yesterday i asked whether trump would put up for sale as a whole or in parts today i can present the version of the answer to this burning question former army commander general told local media that dividing into two parts will put an end to the conflict in the country and said that trump will reach an agreement with on concluding the conflict a year imagining that a representative of a army would express such a position in the media was but now it is normal in i am not convinced that trump will opt for this but it cannot be excluded the most important point is that no one is going to ask politicians about their opinions on the future of their country this is greatest fear on one fine they will wake up in a country that has been simply gifted to follow us on
email trump has all the momentum now will it be enough to propel him to victory on election trumps poll numbers were improving even before we learned that the had renewed its investigation into emails and the new survey results that came out over the weekend and on make it clear that certain victory is not so certain after all unless something are going to go to the polls on with an criminal investigation hanging over the campaign like an ominous and that is very good news for trump the campaign was hoping that this renewed investigation would not move the but unfortunately for them that appears not to be the case unfavorable rating just hit an high a whopping percent of all believe that this scandal is worse than and a survey has found that percent of all undecided voters that are leaning toward voting for are still open to changing their minds before election day and even before this story broke on was having a difficult time getting her voters to the polls according to the new times early voting among young adults and voters is significantly down compared to and those are demographic groups that desperately needs to turn out in large numbers but of course the key to winning the election is getting to electoral and poll numbers appear to be shifting in the key swing states that trump and both desperately need for a i would like to examine what the numbers currently look like in some of the most important states without trump has absolutely no chance of winning this is something that even the trump campaign has admitted that is why it was so alarming that most of the polls in had leading in the state fortunately for a new survey that was conducted on shows him leading in by four points supposed to be a problem has traditionally been a deep red but polling throughout this election season had shown a very tight race this had republicans deeply concerned and the camp very happy but now the momentum has seemingly shifted and the latest poll has trump up by seven points north mitt won north in and trump very much needs to win it if he hopes to be triumphant on was shown to be leading in the eight most recent polls before the email story but in the first major survey conducted afterwards she is now down by two points no republican has ever won the presidency without and trump knows how important it is to his chances the three most recent polls conducted before the renewed the investigation into emails all showed a but now the very first survey conducted afterwards shows trump up by five points has consistently been in the lead in throughout this and most experts give trump much of a chance in the but the latest survey shows that lead has been whittled down to just one point a survey that was conducted in showed having a five point lead in john home but now the latest major poll has trump up by two points one of the most important swing states out west is and most surveys showed with a strong lead throughout the month of unfortunately for a poll that was conducted on shows trump with a four point lead clearly trump has the momentum at this and it will be very interesting to see how the numbers change over the next few days and as we learn more about what is in these newly discovered will her fellow democrats stick with some are publicly wavering the following example comes from confidante and former democratic pollster told fox news the newly renewed investigation into private email server is forcing him to reassess his support for the democratic nominee for president a fox news made the comments to host during a live television appearance night on fox report weekend public opinion is shifting but the bad news for trump is that more than million have already voted so millions upon millions of cast their votes before they even learned of this new investigation if the race is very that could end up making the difference and of course the race could dramatically change once again if the comes to some sort of resolution about these new emails prior to on reported that a resolution before election day did not appear to be likely officials are unlikely to finish their review of new emails potentially related to its investigation into private server before the election the initial work of cataloging top aide s emails found on her estranged husband laptop could be done in the next few us law enforcement officials told but the investigators are expected to spend more time doing other including likely working with other federal agencies to determine what if any classified materials are in the emails this makes it unlikely there will be a resolution prior to the election late on evening the drudge report reported that the times has learned that investigators may have a preliminary assessment completed in coming days la times investigators had planned to conduct new email review over several weeks it now hopes to complete preliminary assessment in coming but agency officials have not decided or they will disclose results publicly developing whether good or i do believe that the people deserve to hear something conclusive about these emails before if nothing is found to implicate the people should be told that and if evidence of very serious crimes is there is no way in the world that should be held back until after the election even if it throws the election into complete and utter chaos the people deserve to know the truth but will we get stay because i think that this is going to be a crazy week take a look at the future of the beginning of the end and then

email when announced it planned to merge with another major communications many feared the new company would exercise monopoly power these concerns led some to call for government action to block the merger in order to protect both competitors and consumers corporate mergers and hostile takeovers can promote economic efficiency by removing inefficient management and boards of directors these managers and board members often work together to promote their own interests instead of generating maximum returns for investors by providing consumers with quality products laws making it difficult to launch a takeover promote inefficient use of resources and harm and consumers monopolies and cartels are creations of not markets for the reason the media is dominated by a few large companies is that no one can operate a television or radio station unless they obtain federal approval and pay federal licensing fees anyone wishing to operate a cable company must not only comply with federal they must sign a franchise agreement with their local government the has given greater access to news and ideas shut out by the lapdogs of the media this may be why so many politicians are anxious to regulate the web in a free market mergers between businesses enable consumers to benefit from new products and reduced prices any businesses that charge high prices or offer substandard products will soon face competition from businesses offering consumers lower prices higher quality monopolies only exist when government tilts the playing field in favor of crony capitalists therefore those concerned about excessive corporate power should join supporters of the free market in repudiating the and subsides that benefit businesses the most important step is to end the business cycle by ending the federal reserve article reposted with permission from the institute do forget to like freedom outpost on plus twitter you can also get freedom outpost delivered to your amazon kindle device here

if government can truly alleviate why have leftist policies only made it the political left keeps as if it is a new breakthrough discovery of that life is unfair have they never read written in a country more than two and a half centuries what about economic historian s world has never been a level playing in the joint autobiography of and his wife they in the world there are gross inequities of income and wealth they offend most of us few can fail to be moved by the contrast between the luxury enjoyed by some and the grinding poverty suffered by professor left behind a foundation dedicated to promoting school so that disadvantaged children could get a better education for a better chance in life what is it that the political left is saying that they think is so such a breakthrough and such a necessity for more what test of evidence if any have they ever subjected their notions no one has presented the social vision of the left more often than of the new times and no one has been more certain that those who do not happen to share his vision do get as he has repeatedly declared essay up poor in in the new times is a classic example of the mindset of the left it begins with the story of a poor black teenager in being raised by a single mom sometimes he goes hungry and his home does not have even one book but it does have television sets with huge and apparently there is money enough to buy marijuana surely we can all agree that this young fellow has very unpromising future prospects ahead of and that this is a human tragedy the circumstances of his life are unfair to him and none of us would want to be born into such circumstances he is just one of many who are brought up in a setting that is full of dangers and with a low probability of improvement but that is not enough for or for the political left in general of such youngsters he a we fail them long before they fail just when did make the decisions and engage in the actions that have led to this teenager being in the bad situation he is and just when did acquire either the omniscience or the omnipotence to prevent when the left says they usually mean government that is apparently what means in this for laments that this teenager is kind of person whom presidential candidates just do talk if the left chooses to believe that government intervention is the answer to such that is their right if they expect the rest of us to share that surely they could subject that belief to some empirical test but we however the were the triumphant decade of those who wanted government intervention to what they called how did that work what were things like before this social vision and what were things like homicide victimization rates among black males were going down substantially in the and the but homicide victimization rates reversed and skyrocketed in the wiping out all the progress of the two previous decades when the most black children were born into families with both a mother and a father after the great welfare state expansion during the most black children were born to a single like the youngster in today essay also mentions a teenage girl who is a single and suggests that could have prevented her from getting pregnant teenage pregnancy was going down down during the it reversed and shot up after the began bringing the vision into schools across the country very similar trends occurred in after very similar visions and policies also triumphed there in the perhaps it is the left that just does get it or cannot face the hard fact that its own vision and policies worsened the very things they claimed would be made better
why does everyone love it hard to say her unfavorable ratings have hit that makes her more popular than the bubonic plague bin corpse it not much to go on but the decided to run a piece by is so widely your response to seeing the name was probably huh unless you a gender studies student at an ivy in which case you know exactly who she is and love her is a novelist whose should all be is big in those circles the campaign is unbearably awkward and this panegyric by was an obvious attempt to channel some of that canned poetry and like most it fails badly there are howlers are millions who admire the tapestry of and are people when becomes the first woman to be president of the united will weep from it not quite a hymn to comrade nor is it getting there by any means except a tow truck and then there the phrasing oh the phrasing was guilty immediately when she stepped into the view of the public as the first lady of this is an awkward attempt to channel that but instead it reads like a manual badly translated from the the piece is full of lines that straddle the border between propagandistic and just bad writing was a lawyer full of was guilty of not being a traditional first lady she offended the old patriarchal then there the theme of the which is to just deny reality conservative writer labeled her a congenital liar when she was first and the label stuck because it was repeated over and it was a convenient label to harness misogyny if she was a then the hostility she engendered could not possibly be because she was a first lady who refused to be still and silent liar has during this election even though a respected source of information about has certified that she is more honest than most the perfect timing for that defense would have been not right after shouted at a rally that she had been in new on but do worry is more honest than most politicians a site supporting her said so other words have been repeated over and with no until they have begun to breathe and thrum with life especially emails the press coverage of emails has become an unclear morass where emails must mean something if only because of how often it is how about or or of regulations dealing with the handling of classified that got lots of context or people who love know that the it system at the state department is old and nothing like a smooth whirl was used to her and wanted to keep using it when she became secretary of people who love know that she love high tech blackberry love blackberry she is a lawyer full of dreams who fights for the children of migrant workers and loves their smooth whirl thrums with life says her blackberry is more honest than the has many dreams of thrumming blackberries whirling smoothly that offend the traditional stodgy patriarchal order it system conservative media saw an opportunity to blow the emails story out of soon almost by the rest of the is that how it works in because that not how it works in is no objective basis on which to equate to her they both they need oxygen to they better writers than people who love see the failings of the general where news entertains rather than informs they bristle when benign stories about her are covered with an ominous they bristle and they hug their blackberry and weep for they fear that the patriarchal stodgy it systems will prevent from being the thrumming first lady of north know that she is a bit too but they understand that she has to that she cannot afford you would think with all those six figure she could afford a little actions so falsely that she leaned into wrapped herself in a kind of caution that sometimes makes her appear stilted and wrapped in her her whirling blackberry in one she bristled at the retracting her quills and occasionally hissing in an informed fashion for the children of migrant workers who admired the tapestry of her past are millions of who do not have the expectation that a politician be perfect they are frustrated that is allowed no complexity get on the phone i think has got another hit

mysterious universe do other realities brush up against our are there parallel dimensions lying just beyond through some untraceable veil separating the idea of parallel realities beyond our own is not yet what if this phenomenon were to come bursting forth from the realm of theory and speculation and come crashing down into the are there perhaps some people who have stepped over that barrier into domains we have not yet to see and which we may indeed not even be meant to i have covered such alleged excursions into the horizon beyond our known reality here at mysterious universe before and here i will revisit this topic with a selection of other cases that seem to imply the possibility that not only are parallel dimensions but that they are destinations to which we can be whisked whether intentional or not in the issue of fate magazine there was the curious story of a woman who apparently shifted into another parallel universe in according to the in the fall of that year a woman by the name of golding had a profoundly unusual experience while riding an elevator with her in the elevator was and when made a mistake and got off at the wrong floor she found that she could not push her way back in past the throng of people and resigned herself to waiting for the next one that was when she looked around and was startled to realize that she was no longer in the store at but rather an expansive train station the enormous railway station she found herself in was allegedly bustling with fevered with throngs of travelers rushing to their trains and booming announcements of arrivals and departures echoing through the air there seemed to be no way this busy place could have any connection whatsoever to the music store she had been in moments before the confused made her way to an information booth to ask where she but found that the woman working there completely ignored as if she there at all followed a series of signs pointing the way to the street and she emerged out into a sunny afternoon that seemed to be in the midst of summer rather than in a place that was most certainly not she wandered about in confusion and noticed that everyone around her seemed to completely ignore her and walk on by as if they did not even see her at some point she claims that she saw a confused looking boy standing in the sidewalk similarly being passed on by people who seemed to have no idea he was even and approached him wondering what was going on the boy was able to actually see and respond to and looked in her the first time anyone had acknowledged her presence in this surreal place as she the boy seemed equally relieved that he was visible to smiled slightly and purportedly i guess they let you off at the wrong too the two lost people walked together down the street in the whole time completely ignored by those around and the boy told of what had happened to him he claimed that he had been playing tennis in in the united and had gone to the locker room to change his shoes when he had gone back to the courts to play some more he had found that the tennis courts that had been there moments before were now gone and in their place was a huge train which had turned out to be the exact same station into which had enigmatically entered from the elevator the two allegedly kept on walking until they reached an open area that led to and over the waves they could apparently make out a sand bar with several women upon it chatting and seeming to act as if nothing was beyond the ordinary to one of the women was oddly her sister the women out on the sandbar seemed to notice them and began waving and shouting to and her companion this encouraged the boy to try and make a swim out to the which did not seem so far and which he was confident he could reach yet even though he was a good swimmer it seemed that no matter how much he tried and pushed against the he was unable to draw any closer to the mysterious sandbar and he returned to shore in frustration it was then that the sandbar supposedly suddenly vanished into thin air closed her eyes in and and then was overcome by the sensation of floating through space after some time of this odd feeling of hovering in darkness she claimed that she suddenly opened her eyes to find herself sitting atop a stool in the music store in which seemed to be in the process of closing for the suggesting that she had been there for at least several hours looked around for her but could not find him and decided to head back to his home when she her was noticeably relieved and explained that he had lost her in the store and had waited for her to come to the right floor for a few hours before deciding to go back home the whom had seen on the mysterious sandbar claimed that she had seen in town and had even called out to but that she had been too absorbed in talking to a young boy to notice her where did go during that why should she see her sister on a sandbar while the sister had seen her in all while they could not reach across to were they separated by strange barriers we do not and may not ever it is a mystery another strange article in the issue of fate magazine

from the gray project they act like people and they act like actors its hard to explain the catcher in the rye lives in a at the wearing a she keeps in a jar by the is it the editor note the analogy of the mask and the role it plays in our lives provides fertile ground for discussion of this political season that each of us plays some role in this farce the classic sense of that is an important recognition more than any election in my lifetime i have heard you cant make this shit up a classic statement of life imitating art imitating fantastical life for many of myself this feels more like a nightmare from which i cannot wake myself there is a world in the balance one could say that there always in when dealing with a deck stacked with the arsenal of the united states now we are dealing with an unfolding environmental catastrophe which will leave more dead than we can count the new estimate from the world wildlife fund is that of the worlds wildlife will be extinct by that is less than years those species deaths will certainly be accompanied by the decimation of countless human lives as well so pick your stage and which play is real t he idiocy of the presidential election race will soon be as will the endless and the droning of the who have been prattling on for more than a as if there were something to consider about this sick as if the deep state had not been directing this from the got a laugh when years ago he referred to as our acting president but had four acting presidents since and their acts have left millions dead and wounded around the including thousands of troops now we have the sordid spectacle of an election campaign that is so patently phony that is the only word that can describe the thinking of those who take it seriously many have acquiesced in this ongoing playing their parts in this deadly charade the ghosts of all victims walk among and they will haunt us until we come to life by admitting our own complicity in their deaths the show must not go but it as long as we keep acting our parts o brown so well describes our stage ancestral voices prophesying ancestral spirits in the macabre or war ghostly warriors who kill each other and are reborn to fight again all warfare is every army an of every soldier a living corpse the administration repeatedly sets the stage by talking about and waging an endless a thirty year a long an war soon war loving will take center stage as he exits after promoting her this is not me going through the motions he recently said i really want to elect the black face of empire will be replaced by the female face of empire as the audience hiding from their masked selves their part in a phony performance without a complicit the performance cant go on but it as put so it goes but the act is wearing thin the autumnal season and especially the weekend of the and masks has me thinking of my own experience with and how understanding the nature of our complicity in a mass act of bad faith is so important having grown up as the only brother among seven i was always my parents favorite son with such dumb i never felt the need to be someone i and so accepted my favored fate but from an early age i learned from my sisters what it meant to put on your face like most girls in a cosmetic they would stand or sit in front of a mirror dutifully applying and mascara in preparation for their entrances onto the social stage where they would face so many other faces facing and them mirrors meeting selves it seemed to the boy i such an exhausting act at the time i had only a dim awareness of life the movie when i was a young i had the great opportunity to learn how to be a public phony and put on a face i got to lie to a national television audience and got paid for my deception the show was a very popular one to tell the truth one of many game shows my and i appeared on we were a theatrical not trained but a brood of faces unconsciously hoping to discover who they were through their acts my parents had started this by accepting an invitation to appear on a show hosted by johnny do you trust your show was later renamed who do you an albeit grammatically appellation for the paranoid cold war but i then care about i just wanted to put on a good face and lie well while ostensibly telling the truth i succeeded by convincing two of the celebrity panelists that i was who i and getting paid for my act lying seemed so all you needed was a good mask and a convincing demeanor this was my public lesson in putting on your face ever since been fascinated by and the role of acting on the social stage ghosts of the past by as the weekend this enchantment increases i think of how all persons by the word person being derived from the meaning mask another occurs to it too meaning or evil spirit the living masks light up for me as i think of the all the souls and spirits circulating through our days while etymology might seem i rather think it offers us a portal into our not just but politically and culturally as well was of all the worlds a though i would disagree with the bard that we are merely players it does often seem that but seeming is the essence of the actors show and tell but who are we behind the who is it uttering
up installation by basil in henry a cultural critic and public intellectual editor note the institutions that drive and reinforce capitalism at its most direct and base level are not even considered by politicians included as needing dismantling in order to save children those institutions are the so called criminal justice and juvenile justice and the and paid international forces that are hired to carry out us international policy where children are often collateral and sometimes direct targets the also uses poor children of all but disproportionately children of as front line expendable military troops a s the distinction between the truth and lies fades in public politics appears to be increasingly emptied of any substance as has observed facts and truth are becoming difficult to uphold in politics in business and even in the age of trump there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that the appeal to informed judgment and facts is at odds with the current political culture that truth and evidence have gone the way of the electric or so it seem to have a growing fondness for an attitude that reinforces the downsizing of the civic function of language falsehoods and deceptions no longer appear marginal to political debate but now seem to shape much of what is said by the presidential candidates this is shockingly true for who has organized much of his campaign around endless sending fact checkers into a frenzy of activity when trump is caught in a he simply ignores the facts and just keeps on lying his followers could care less about whether he deceives them or not on the other has earned a reputation as a willing to say almost anything to promote her political regardless of whether she sacrifices the truth in order to do so her email scandal is largely read as symptomatic of a more pronounced and deeper level of dishonesty she is viewed mostly by the general public as untrustworthy in she has managed her truth deficit by invoking her lifelong defense of families and children for during the second debate she claimed she wanted to be for our children and attempted to bolster her concern for the welfare of children by pointing to her early work with the defense fund in the third presidential she argued against trumps call for exporting million immigrants by stating that she was against his deportation policies because she want to rip families apart was sending parents away from children in her political television she points to supporting policies that will invest in schools and colleges will work develop an economy where every young can find a job and start a family of their own only focuses on managing some of the problems that young people rather than doing anything to change the conditions that produce them for she says nothing about what education should accomplish in a democracy when educational policies are driven by a economy that she supports and while she talks about providing jobs for young she has little to say about transforming rather than adjusting an economy marked by wide gaps in wealth and power matters of state extreme institutional a broken criminal justice the school to prison pipeline and the existence of the mass incarceration among other important rarely if ever enter her discourse and yet these are major issues negatively affecting the lives of millions of children in the united states and her alleged regard for children falls apart in light of her hawkish policies on global regime drone attacks and and her unqualified support for the warfare state her alleged support for children abroad does not capture the larger reality they face from when their countries are attacked by drones and subject to contemporary forms of indiscriminate violence rather than critique the us as a powerful engine of expands its imperialist role around the globe this is a key point in light of her defense of the rights of because her warmongering ideology puts children in the path of lethal violence at the same promise to address the problems many children face in the united states reeks of a made visible by her history of siding with and supporting policies that were injurious to children not only did she once disparagingly call young people but as the first lady she strongly backed her husbands campaign to end welfare as we know it president welfare policies did great harm to poor children they eliminated the aid to families with dependent children federal assistance program and infuriated wright the president of the defense to the degree that she ended her working relationship with according to the bill represented a frontal assault on the of poor children and families yet as late as was still touting this pernicious welfare bill as a success she also supported bill tough on crime according to resulted in the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in history which has a devastating effect on the families and children of color supported invasion of which led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children occupying the right wing of the democratic has aligned herself with a war culture that supports drone warfare and continues to support military policies that result in the needless deaths of millions of children in the middle and other places that bear the brunt of foreign policy it is difficult to given coziness with the financial big the complex and the reigning war that she will do anything that will lessen the violence to which both at home and around the will face under her potential reign as president of the united states has nothing to say about the need for a collective struggle for economic and political justice given her past becomes even starker next to the images of war and violence that mark the bodies of youth both in the united states and abroad her commitments to war and security have been built on the mutilation and
before and after mountain top removal for coal extraction devastation brought to you by the brothers earth the real news network editor note we are at the point in earth the breaking point be fair shall western civilization has virtually killed the only home we have there is no place for homeless humanity to go when this home becomes habitable only for cockroaches and similarly hardy beasts those in the worst offender the united have allowed themselves to be pacified into disbelief that we or even destroy the only home we have much of that willing disbelief is founded on a orchestrated propaganda carried out by the fossil fuel industry and the owners of it such as the brothers the video below examines this decades long campaign that has been waged to lead a willing populace to the graveyard of humanity we are literally at a point where days matter in reversing course we does not have centuries to address this problem we even have decades some argue that if something significant is not done by to radically reduce the production of global warming that it will be too late to avoid the worst that is coming at us we are talking months not years recognizing the many organizations and publications are devoting major effort to addressing the destruction of our world the real news network is starting a global climate change bureau the post and uncommon thought journal are dedicated to bringing you consistent and engagement opportunities focused on anthropogenic climate disruption as clear puts the blame for the problem on humans please join us in this effort and send pertinent materials to at from the real news network scientists say temperatures will rise to critical by the real news network is building a global climate change bureau and each set the record for hottest calendar year since scientists began measuring surface temperatures over years and is shaping up to be even warmer this will be the first time that seen three consecutive years with temperatures a temperature increase of two degrees degrees above levels will now be reached much sooner than earlier predicted according to a report by seven leading climate scientists the target could be reached by the early and the target by says the report that included sir former chair of the intergovernmental panel on climate change the scientists say that even if all the pledges made by the signatory countries to the agreement are fully climate will pass this dangerous mark in years this is a threshold that most scientists have warned cannot be crossed without dire including a rise in sea levels of several feet that would flood many coastal cities in the longer more intense heat waves that cause a major disruption in the worlds food and large migrations of people from countries of the global south it is also a point where it becomes far more difficult to reverse the warming trend some scientists suggest temperatures by the end of the century could rise as much as above levels equals so this is a temperature rise of the report titled the truth about climate change much of the public believes that climate change is only going to happen by the end of the and that this is a misunderstanding of the urgency unless there is a dramatic change in current public most people alive today will live to see the threshold crossed the report climate change is happening and much faster than anticipated climate change related more intense heat and wildfires have already had devastating effects on and lives if the threshold is to be the report calls for far more aggressive targets than those set by the agreement and for that action to begin immediately the report to meet the global emissions should be net zero by the threat is the science overwhelming so why solutions to the climate change crisis at the top of the political why we see millions of people in the streets demanding decisive why this a major issue in the election why are politicians who deny the existence of climate change even elected to the lack of public engagement in the climate crisis is a global concern if policy human life as we know it and thousands of other species will not survive according to a of now believe global warming is real if why there more political pressure to face up to the dig further into the numbers and the state of public opinion is more fully revealed of those who believe climate change is only half think that global warming is mostly human caused one in three believe it is due mostly to natural changes in the environment only about one in ten understand that nearly all climate scientists than are convinced that global warming is happening over half of say they are at least somewhat worried about global but only say they are very worried why are only of people surveyed very worried about what of scientists think is a catastrophic the brothers war on science certainly plays a major role in promoting doubt about the overwhelming scientific evidence of climate change they spend millions financing witch hunts against climate scientists and funding research designed to confuse public opinion the and other billionaires with a vested interest pour hundreds of millions into the coffers of politicians willing to obstruct legislation that would regulate fossil fuel and promote a green sustainable economy perhaps as responsible for the gap between public opinion and scientific evidence is corporate television the gatekeeper of public consciousness they ignore the crisis the report cited above was not the lead story on television newscasts we cant find evidence it was carried by any television news outlet at all according to a media matters the four major corporate networks aired a total minutes of climate change coverage in only aired minutes of coverage and coverage consisted mostly of criticism of efforts to address climate change the report aired almost five times

affiliation with his helped him establish his credentials as a manipulator t he is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda the nephew of the pioneer of it was who coined the term public relations as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions in he persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the new easter parade then considered outlandish one light another torch of fight another sex influence extended far beyond advertising his greatest success was his role in convincing the public to join the slaughter of the first world war the he was engineering the consent of people in order to control and regiment according to our will without their knowing about it he described this as the true ruling power in our society and called it an invisible government the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood in my career as a journalist and i have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged imagine two cities both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country both cities are occupied by who commit terrible such as beheading people but there is a vital difference in one the government soldiers are described as liberators by western reporters embedded with who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes there are front page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a for victory there is scant mention of civilian casualties in the second city in another country nearby almost exactly the same is happening government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics the difference is that these fanatics are supplied and armed by us by the united states and they even have a media that is funded by and another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad condemned for assaulting and bombing the city which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city not really such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda i am of to the current siege of the city of by the government forces of who are backed by the united states and and to the siege of by the government forces of backed by one is the other is bad w hat is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if and the united states had not invaded in that criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as the monstrous and and and the rest of the gang might not and the people of might not be fighting for their lives today some may remember in a succession of reporters turning to the camera and telling us that was vindicated for what turned out to be the crime of the century the us television networks produced the same validation for w bush fox news brought on henry to effuse over fabrications the same soon after the i filmed an interview in with the renowned investigative journalist i asked what would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude he replied that if journalists had done their there is a very good chance we would not have gone to war in it was a shocking and one supported by other famous journalists to whom i put the same question rather of rose of the observer and journalists and producers in the who wished to remain anonymous in other had journalists done their had they challenged and investigated the propaganda instead of amplifying hundreds of thousands of women and children would be alive and there would be no and no siege of or there would have been no atrocity on the underground on th there would have been no flight of millions of there would be no miserable camps when the terrorist atrocity happened in last president immediately sent planes to bomb and more terrorism the product of bombast about being at war and showing no mercy that state violence and violence feed off each other is the truth that no national leader has the courage to speak when the truth is replaced by said the soviet dissident the silence is a lie the attack on the attack on the attack on happened because the leader in each of these countries was not a puppet of the west the human rights record of a or a was irrelevant they did not obey orders and surrender control of their country the same fate awaited once he had refused to sign an agreement that demanded the occupation of and its conversion to a market economy his people were and he was prosecuted in the independence of this kind is intolerable as has it was only when the leader in rejected an oil running through his country from to that he was attacked from that the planned to destroy the government of with fanatics the same fanatics currently holding the people of and eastern hostage why is this not the former foreign office official who was responsible for operating sanctions against told we would feed journalists factoids of or we would freeze them out that is how it worked the wests medieval to which the us and sell billions of

by film t he second season of the network television drama created by concluded recently though drawing a somewhat smaller audience than the first the show remains popular among critics and has developed a following among young viewers in particular the series has won a golden globe for best drama and star won an award for his portrayal of a security hacker who leads a on e described as the worlds biggest conglomerate in the first is recruited into the hacker group by the mysterious robot plots to wipe out the debt records of e corp in robots take down the evil corporation and incite the biggest revolution the world will ever see the hack ultimately throws the global financial system into chaos in a narrative robot is revealed to be a mental construct inside based on memories of his dead father at the start of the second has retreated to his mothers seemingly having abandoned his revolution to focus on ridding his mind of robot the far from taking down e has instead caused it to consolidate its power e corp price is using the chaos created by the hack to secure a government bailout and to advance the proprietary digital currency the effects of the financial crisis are largely being borne by the population itself a credit crisis has frozen the accounts of masses of and most are forced to subsist on a a day allowance the economy is in major cities have ceased trash leaving mountains of garbage to pile up on city streets e corp banks have taken advantage of the loss of data to gouge customers for interest and loan payments that they have already paid large protests are a regular and social unrest is boiling over taken at face the show depicts revolution as a cure worse than the one at is the product of misguided and at inevitably leads one down the road of violence and treachery assumes leadership of she is determined to finish off e corp by destroying public confidence in the largely through the use of stunts and symbolic protests the killing of a key member of causes the hackers to fear that they are being targeted by the dark a shadowy group of hackers who participated in the e corp at the same an investigation led by agent is closing in on the and the resultant panic and paranoia forms something of a for the season the first season of robot suffered from a number of not least of which was a kind of narrative hyperactivity that resulted in a maddening array of distractions and twists the series seemed unable to hold its attention on important and the meagerness of the political steeped in a kind of shallow limited its ability to say much when it did but the first season also possessed what seemed a sincere outrage at the the top one percent of the top one percent who secretly run the world as says in the pilot the second season is sharply different in tone in place of the editing and the insistent the second season is much quieter and more slowly paced one gets a sense that the show creators had a desire to settle down and tell a more perhaps more realistic story they are partially successful in some places the various scenes that take place among the e corp elite are generally with recurring images of financial oligarchs gazing on crowds of protesters from offices an atmosphere of foreboding and tension pervades it take for the shows attempts at realism to descend into the kind of affected darkness so prevalent in contemporary film characters wax on the human generally expressing hopelessness and angst lines such were all just tightrope walking above that pit of ungodly pain thats daring us to trip are par for the course the scenes themselves are and with shots scrubbed of color and framed to make the world seem inescapably isolating and cold matters are not helped by the scenes involving struggle with which end up becoming a tedious series of exchanges on the nature of etc tenuous grasp on reality gives the show creators free reign to pull the rug out from under the audience whenever they see fit when states in an internal monologue that we trust that accurately portray the real world around us but what if the haunting truth is they that what we perceive the real world at but just our minds best that all we really have is a garbled a fuzzy picture we will never truly make one is hardly surprised t he change in tone is apparently a deliberate attempt on the part of the show creators to depict the consequences of the first seasons revolution the hackers often express if not outright for their actions in the first which everyone agrees have only made things the world socialist web site s initial assessment of the we wrote the idea of revolution and revolutionaries put forward by robot is ludicrous in the series appears to have little despite the references to in the conditions of wide layers of the much less any conception that masses of people will take part in the process of changing things this is a revolution carried out by presumably a layer of disgruntled computer engineers and other professionals the creators conceptions have led them from outrage to pessimism it is no doubt true that a like the one depicted in the first season would likely bring about little more than increased state repression but insofar as the show creators continue to identify these actions with revolution while refusing to see an they end up condemning the entire notion of revolution itself taken at face the show depicts revolution as a cure worse than the one at is the product of misguided and at inevitably leads one down the road of violence and treachery more than a few

trump is like a meteor shower of this age he sprays antipathy upon all manner of people of varied and any other target of choice he avoids the politically correct avenue and simply does things his own way trumps age of distractions has thrown the country into a frenzy leaving people careening and disoriented the real issue is the lack of focus is not limited to the realm of it has shifted into other areas that have affected many on a personal level this is not really about the distraction of it is more centered on the politics of of the things that continues to rise over the past years or so is the increase in diagnosis involving focus whether it is deficit hyperactivity or the list of diagnosis that indicates a challenge in our ability to focus has in the lead above any other country the blame has shifted from the school system to the to the programmers of major television stations and trumps age of distractions famed novelist golden a mind troubled by doubts cannot focus on the course of victory with this in it is evident that no matter who is to blame for the lack of victims need to discover a remedy by is the adjustment for distinct a center of and attention it is the last part of the definition that really stands the center of a persons and attention here is the real people do not possess focus if it has not arrested those three areas of life that is the difference between hobbies and passions the latter captivates all you are and all you do many have failed simply because they have refused to bring their lives into a definite allows us to harness our and resources and put them to work on our life goals at one time or have fallen into the trap of being a jack of all trades the part that is often missed is that we become masters of none we spread ourselves thin in an effort to appear but successes come from a laser beam approach toward tasks this may be the reason ranks nearly last amidst other countries with regards to productivity we have more stuff than but we seem to be doing less the issue lies in our inability to do we in a society that is screaming at us from sun up to sun how will we find the time to even on our we get assigned to one project only to be told the other five are really the priority everything was due two days ago people consume fast food at alarming rates because it is supposed to be fast and no one has time to cook a balanced meal leads to fears of illnesses like cancer and diabetes people of all nationalities seem to be in a losing battle with the clock and now experts are telling saying the biggest problem is really the lack of focus listed below are solutions that can ease the pressure and help people to find focus in trumps age of other things are important one of the first mistakes we make is trying to go cold turkey when it comes to our distractions you have had them long enough for them to become a new normal cutting them out will not be easy devise a plan to lower a number of distractions by setting guidelines by checking emails less frequently and turning the ringer off on your you increase your ability to focus instantly solicit the help of people tend to interrupt you because that is what you have trained them to do setting boundaries around yourself sends an instant message to people indicating you are in work mode let them know your times of on purpose focus and that you are not to be disturbed people will honor it utilize sticky and lists to your in your lap right now is the power to retake your focus you probably have a kindle or some other device capable of helping you organize your time i find if we do not have a we are planning to fail set reminders to study in your read your morning paper on your while or set a list the night before all these small tasks add up to big time savers in the future in trumps age of it has become easy to blame the lack of focus on external events in the only thing we really do control is our behavior in any given situation take back your life and readjust your focal point you will be amazed at how closely life imitates a camera until it is turned on and no memories are ever clearly captured this is really not about the distraction of but the responsibility of managing the politics of the politics of image courtesy of image courtesy of image courtesy of steiner license trump election focus self help

pm by leave a comment before election the liberal media were speculating about the demise of the republican party the media misjudged the electorate before and they are misjudging it again its the democratic party that faces an uncertain future in an broadcast before election cox said the results might just mean that the would cease to be a national party because the demographic trends were in favor of and the democrats had reclaimed the mantle of patriotism and reclaimed the mantle of faith host are you looking for in tomorrow nights results the beginning of the discussion within the republican party about how to rebuild itself into something resembling a coherent former bush communications director and political strategist miller i have a lot of pessimism about where the party goes after the results came journalist john became writing in his most recent column that the democratic party had not lost a presidential race in since but it did in the democratic party had not lost a senate race in a presidential election year since but it did in but it gets worse the democratic party has been decimated in the state he writes from with a senate caucus that looks likely to have seats smallest total since was and an assembly caucus with members smallest total since was in as noted by public republican governor walker will have his biggest majorities yet when lawmakers return to next year who writes for the capital says the democratic party of is going to need to rethink and remake but that this is not just a problem this is a national crisis his solution is to elect a radical rep as chairman of the democratic national committee frank of the center for security policy rightly notes one would think that the last thing democrats want to publicize after their wholesale repudiation by voters is their ties to radical leftists and supremacists he goes that will be the predictable effect of leading the democratic national committee is not alone in recommending as chair is backed by senators sanders and warren going further in this case embracing a fiery critic of is starting to attract some media scrutiny the embrace of could be interpreted as a death wish by the democratic party the political situation has changed dramatically five years ago was telling the democratic socialists of that the progressive movement was on the and that this process of revolutionary change would continue so what simply the democratic party abandoned the working once considered the cornerstone of the revolution president of the alliance for manufacturing calls it the blue collar election he a week has passed since election and if it clear it is economic pain in the industrial states is real and has shocked our politics in order for the republican party to take advantage of this dramatic trump has to get tough with foreign countries l president of the business industry says that trump will face a lot of opposition as he pursues a balanced trade agenda his antagonists include wall street multinational major business academic editorial business opinion and the generally mainstream writes his remark about a mainstream media is right on target but as we have seen in coverage of the campaign and their predictions about the a lack of knowledge stopped the media from claiming to be knowledgeable the media may sound but they must realize that if the republicans are able to accommodate the interests of their new blue collar constituency and bring forth a balanced trade and the democrats will be left with a constituency consisting of a few some gays and student young and the radical feminist lobby its difficult to see how the democrats can assemble a majority out of that is the director of the aim center for investigative journalism and can be contacted at view the complete archives from
you are home of the am by leave a comment at this time in organizations like accuracy in media are needed more than ever the bias in the media has been exposed as a poison that undermines the publics right to know and threatens the future of democratic our duty is to tell the people what has happened to their country in his letter to j new england patriots coach bill congratulations on a tremendous campaign you have dealt with an unbelievable slanted and negative media and have come out beautifully is not alone poll after poll has confirmed that the people understand and recognize the problem of liberal media bias in the bias is just one aspect of the corruption that surrounds us and infects the government a university poll found that percent of voters told pollsters that trump was right when he charged the media were biased against him an associated poll found that percent of likely voters say the media is biased against trump one cannot say with certainty that the media bias in the campaign was worse the elections of or both and enjoyed extraordinary media bias in their favor one difference this time around is that the media bias has been extremely by the emails released from the account of campaign chairman john we have seen the evidence of how the collusion and collaboration occur the evidence shows that journalists work secretly with one major political the against conservatives and republicans needless to all of this is a blatant violation of the ethical standards that journalists profess to uphold the preamble of the code of ethics of the society of professional journalists says they believe that public enlightenment is the forerunner of justice and the foundation of democracy ethical journalism strives to ensure the free exchange of information that is fair and thorough an ethical journalist acts with integrity they have compromised their integrity in order to elect a woman whose record as a security risk should make her ineligible to seek the presidency but its worse than being unethical we see in one of the emails that post journalist was in touch with the democrats about crafting one of his columns this email proves that has been functioning as an operative of the democratic party of those of us who have watched his appearances at conservative events over the years had suspected what was going on now we have the proof of the actual collaboration the email portrays help for as a research request from the columnist in other he even write his own columns he was lazy and liberal what this suggests is that function was to write put his name certain articles in order to divert attention away from scandals involving democrats in the latest case in order to justify a post of charges that he was bill black would cover his news conference and make fun of the event such an attack serves two purposes it justifies the posts decision not to cover the event as a legitimate news story it scares others away from covering it how many conservatives in the media shied away from the in his landmark the corrupt society there are many weapons that can be used to prevent the corruption of societies the most powerful of these weapons are vigilance and knowledge hence the importance of the and television to break through all imposed restrictions to discover how the government how it arrives at its how it manages its how it deals with especially the traitors in its midst dedicated his book to that was a of because found and his administration to be utterly corrupt was forced from office for covering up a burglary into the offices of the opposition political the democrats stories in the post sparked his resignation in the scandal victor it start with proved that democrats had done similar things in the democrats

by former secretary of state is one of those traitors had warned about her illegal private full of classified was open to hacking by foreign governments her top arranged for some of emails to be stored on a computer shared with her pervert husband the foundation laundered money to her husband on behalf of foreign governments seeking favors from the state department and the at this late refuses to hold any of them responsible for undermining the security of our nation the post facilitates this corruption in government by failing to expose it and one post journalist has been exposed as a lazy liberal pawn of those who were in charge of getting into the white house the existentialist wrote about the corruption in the church and how church and state had become one in his critique of the danish state he said everyone knew privately that the system was rotten and corrupt but they would not say so publicly just as one says that death has marked a so we recognize the symptoms which demand to be attacked it is a battle against he said the problem we face today is not just media but corruption in government and the media that runs so deep that it is uncomfortable for some to

print email for those of you that is a well known television producer and director she has won several awards which include golden globe peoples choice awards and more she has been in the industry for over twenty years and has gained much respect from many of her colleagues who she is now speaking on behalf of i just want to make it clear how long she has been inside the and the connections she has to others within it industry insiders are feeling the need to share inspirational words and food for thought to the millions of people that pay attention to them as of saw this recently with celebrities have a voice that can reach a large sum of they can be a threat to corporate interests and the controlling elite and as many celebrities bite their tongue and live in a culture of fear not long made some shocking alluding that and the entertainment industry is dominated by ultra ultra was the name for a previously classified research program through the scientific intelligence division it was the program of research in behavioral modification and perception manipulation of human beings it was previously known as operation is suggesting that is a tool used in the manipulation of human used as a tool for behavior modification and perception control in human beings is the one that keeps all of this power structure they perpetuate the culture of and keep it all in place continue to feed and they make a lot of money doing it they do it at the behest of their who run everything speak on behalf of i go to parties and things like that and big stars pull me take my arm and i just want to thank you for the things you say and it blows my but thats the its a culture of fear a big culture of mind ultra rules in the and its funny that ancient druid wizards and magicians used to make their wands specific for casting spells from the holly wood tree maybe is used to cast spells on the masses because at the very least it can sure seem that way everything we do is so so robotic in nature we go to get a have a family and chase materialistic gains only to find out that it is not what our soul truly desires we are told what to whats what to what truth is and how life is through television it keeps us ignorant and blind to what is really happening on our planet everything is top pieces of in our world public remark that the ultra program rules in is an educated and not just an opinion it comes from her own experiences within the industry as well as an awareness of known facts about the and their involvement in of which also happen to be available to the public its not hard to see how television and mass advertising can be used as mind basically shaping the perception of the as well as displaying what each individual should be what type of life to chase and what it means to be successful given as well as the information we already have in the public its safe to say that something fishy is going on in ask are your wants really or have they been programmed into you since not many people know but the has an entire department dedicated to the entertainment industry its run through the entertainment industry liaison office which collaborates in a strictly advisory capacity with filmmakers the just offer guidance to it even offers money in the agency bought the rights to animal farm and then funded the animated version of the film its involvement had long been but only in the past decade have those rumors been substantiated the link between and the something and just blurting out information that has no backing behind it the also had a project called mockingbird in which the infiltrated mass media outlets in order to sway public opinion after leaving the post in spent six months looking at the relationship of the and the press during the cold war years his word cover story that was published in rolling stone in the late can be read here with this article i wanted to present a small amount of information to give the some background on these programs within the department of defense making the connection between these programs and hard using as a mind control hub can easily be as a conspiracy to but i believe that labeling can only come about when one fails to actually look into it hopefully this tidbit of information provides some backing for along with her experience within the industry if you want to look more into the influence in ultra and project mockingbird are a good place to start brave souls like speaking out is simply helping the masses shed light on these programs individuals within the entertainment industry are simply used as tools for mind control we are programmed to worship praise them and be like them these stars are used as puppets to serve a greater agenda lets not forget that is owned by the same corporations and financial institutions that own the health and food industry institutions like fidelity the vanguard group and the state street corporation they own and the major corporations that govern they also own big oil big food and big the connections are and if you do the its not hard to see nothing is really its not a conspiracy its good to see the world waking up everyday we are recognizing that peace between all is what really makes the most sense peace and love is the necessary core to our awakening to the truth about our planet and who we give our power away to on a daily basis is a step for some people to arrive at a greater conclusion the truth we are required

from monster to democrats grovel before trump by information clearing house within a day of the election of leading democrats have moved with extraordinary speed to declare their support for the invited trump to the white house for a friendly meeting on he declared afterwards that his priority in the coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our is successful he speaking to i want to emphasize to that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you if you then the country declaration stands in stark contrast to his own statements just a few days ago then he asserted that trump appears to only care about himself and know basic facts that need to know to be president he added that trump spent years on this earth showing no regard for working was before the democratic debacle on election day now he declares his highest priority to be ensuring that trump is comments followed the statement by on that she hoped will be a successful president for all senator the supposed issued his own groveling to the degree that trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this i and other progressives are prepared to work with such the democrats are in effect abandoning any pretense of acting as an opposition party to a president trump and a proclamations of support from top democrats are made in relation to an individual whose election clearly marks a watershed in politics what is coming to power is a government of the extreme with fascistic characteristics there are reports that trump wants to appoint as his chief of staff the head of an and fascistic media outlet his top advisors and likely cabinet appointees include reactionary figures such as former new mayor and new jersey governor their rush to lend the transition of power an aura of the democrats and the media have maintained a studious silence about certain quite striking elements of the one is noting that a principal factor in the election of trump was a significant decline in voter turnout for all of the media talk of a surge of white working class voters behind the republican candidate actually received one million fewer votes than mitt received in losing the election to won million fewer votes than won in his when the outgoing president obtained significantly fewer votes than he had received in also virtually ignored is the extraordinary fact that trump failed even to win the popular vote had a higher percentage of the national but she lost in the electoral which involves a complex and antidemocratic apportionment based on victories in individual states trump will take office having failed to secure a let alone a of the overall the entire history of the united there have been only five elections in which the incoming president did not win the popular vote when this happened in the b became though he had fewer votes than the j the political conflict over the outcome was so intense that the republicans were able to hold the white house only after agreeing to the effective end of war through the withdrawal of federal troops from the a split vote in when grover lost to the winner of the electoral vote was also the winner of the popular vote for the next years in the this anomaly has now happened and again in in the former the selection of w bush as president required the intervention of the supreme court to halt the recount of ballots in trump found himself in the position of he would have taken his time before conceding his concession when and if it would have stressed that he had won the popular vote and that crooked could not claim a media message would have stressed the need for to be conciliatory and acknowledge that the majority of the voters had chosen trump one can easily imagine announcing the breaking news that had withdrawn the nomination of choice for the supreme court and invited the republicans to name the replacement for the deceased the democrats have done just the is behind this universal president said perhaps more than he intended when he declared that we have to remember that were actually all on one team this is an intramural a test competition involving players from the same united states does not really have an oppositional political system the divisions between the democrats and and between and are of an entirely tactical character they all defend the same basic of the corporate and financial aristocracy that controls the political this the democrats are always the more accommodating and conciliatory since their rhetorical references to defending the interests of working by the likes of thoroughly vacuous and insincere in relation to trump and the dangers he there is an element of complete which arises from the fact that the danger is not to the democrats or the privileged social forces for which they but to the working chief concern of the democrats is to contain popular anger their moves to circle the wagons around trump are above all a response to the danger they see of the emergence of popular opposition that threatens not only the incoming but the capitalist system as sanders and company prostrate themselves and pledge their loyalty to thousands of youth and workers are demonstrating around the country against the these protests are only a pale and politically disparate foretaste of mass struggles of the working class that are to is critical is that the lessons of the election be drawn and all attempts to keep opposition to war and austerity chained to the political corpse of the democratic party be rejected the task is not to take back the democratic party or push it to the inevitable result of that false perspective has already been demonstrated in the reactionary outcome of

inside the invisible john the is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda the nephew of the pioneer of it was who coined the term public relations as a euphemism for spin and its he persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the new easter parade then considered outlandish one light another torch of fight another sex influence extended far beyond advertising his greatest success was his role in convincing the public to join the slaughter of the first world he was engineering the consent of people in order to control and regiment according to our will without their knowing about described this as the true ruling power in our society and called it an invisible the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood in my career as a journalist and i have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go two cities both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country both cities are occupied by who commit terrible such as beheading people but there is a vital difference in one the government soldiers are described as liberators by western reporters embedded with who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes there are front page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a for victory there is scant mention of civilian the second city in another country nearby almost exactly the same is happening government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics the difference is that these fanatics are supplied and armed by us by the united states and they even have a media that is funded by and another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad condemned for assaulting and bombing the city which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first not really such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda i am of to the current siege of the city of by the government forces of who are backed by the united states and and to the siege of by the government forces of backed by one is the other is is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if and the united states had not invaded in that criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as the monstrous and and and the rest of the gang might not and the people of might not be fighting for their lives may remember in a succession of reporters turning to the camera and telling us that was vindicated for what turned out to be the crime of the century the us television networks produced the same validation for w bush fox news brought on henry to effuse over fabrications the same soon after the i filmed an interview in with the renowned investigative journalist i asked what would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude replied that if journalists had done their there is a very good chance we would not have gone to war in was a shocking and one supported by other famous journalists to whom i put the same question rather of rose of the observer and journalists and producers in the who wished to remain anonymous in other had journalists done their had they challenged and investigated the propaganda instead of amplifying hundreds of thousands of women and children would be alive and there would be no and no siege of or there would have been no atrocity on the underground on th there would have been no flight of millions of there would be no miserable the terrorist atrocity happened in last president immediately sent planes to bomb and more terrorism the product of bombast about being at war and showing no mercy that state violence and violence feed off each other is the truth that no national leader has the courage to the truth is replaced by said the soviet dissident the silence is a attack on the attack on the attack on happened because the leader in each of these countries was not a puppet of the west the human rights record of a or a was irrelevant they did not obey orders and surrender control of their same fate awaited once he had refused to sign an agreement that demanded the occupation of and its conversion to a market economy his people were and he was prosecuted in the independence of this kind is intolerable as has it was only when the leader in rejected an oil running through his country from to that he was that the planned to destroy the government of with fanatics the same fanatics currently holding the people of and eastern hostage why is this not the former foreign office official who was responsible for operating sanctions against told we would feed journalists factoids of or we would freeze them out that is how it wests medieval to which the us and sell billions of dollars worth of arms is at present destroying a country so poor that in the best of half the children are malnourished look on and you will see the kind of massive bombs our bombs that the use against and against and funerals the explosions look like small atomic bombs the bomb aimers in work with officers this fact is not on the evening is most effective when our consent is engineered by those with a fine education and with careers on the the the new times the post these are known as the liberal media they present themselves as progressive tribunes of the moral zeitgeist they are and they love they

riots in on third night of protests trump returns to twitter to complain about protests by media by reason there were more protests around the country against the election of trump last with police in declaring the protest there a riot due to deteriorating conditions rioters there threw objects at attacked newspaper and smashed windows police said protesters were trying to stop from destroying and tweeted that it encouraged others to leave the before declaring the situation a riot and issuing orders to disperse the police say they made arrests and dispersed the crowd using pepper ball distraction and rubber baton returned to twitter for the first time since being elected on night after spending the day in tweeting that incited by the are calling it news described the tweet as an end to a brief stretch of conciliatory behavior since although one salty tweet in a hour period does seem like enough data to come to that conclusion trump had to as news put also pointing out trump himself had tweeted in favor of a march on after mitt and suggested if he lost riots could least two other prominent trump sheriff and former rep had also tweeted supportively of protests and civil disobedience before the election but called for a tough response after they did not expect trump to so the calculus changed things are different now that he not for trump tendency to make loose statements and the media tendency to botch interpretations of those tweet was characterized as not sure what was expected at this particularly since such protests until worked in trump favor the trump campaign a rally in after massive protests there trump said the protests would his clinched the nomination in may by i noted how attacks on trump supporters by protesters were an apparent effort to help get trump elected in late when protests and riots erupted in after a fatal police shooting i suggested the city was working hard to get north in the trump when there were protests and around the i suggested this trend to could end up helping trump by earning him political capital and helping drive conservatives back into the fold protesters say they are demonstrating because trump has created a climate of fear for minorities riots also have that tendency if the mostly white rioters in last night provide police in the city to ramp up that endangers marginalized people the most protests last month over a police contract the outgoing mayor pushed through before leaving office failed to stop the and it not unreasonable to fear tonight riots will increase tensions in altogether different for all the talk of what else could violent protests over the result of an election be other than voter won but that still leaves a minority of trump voters watching their fellow citizens destroy property over the way they voted and it leaves a slew of residents who did but will probably eventually be blamed for trump win as well blame anyone but and the democratic protesters like to compare trump to yet it does seem they understand their own comparison used civil the greatly expand his powers after he had already been elected at the republican trump called a crime and said he could solve the country problems protesters are setting the stage for him it hard to imagine what continued violent protests group has organized as a can accomplish other than creating a climate of fear trump could exploit to make it easier to get what he whatever that turns out to of a mostly white riot in would perhaps be incomplete with a note about the occupation of a remote outpost in the national wildlife refuge in in protest of federal prosecutors reneging on a plea deal with two ranchers who had set a fire on their property that spread onto federal appealing the sentences handed down in favor for longer ones those protesters were called by many commentators because they were armed the went viral no one has suggested or have been under attack nor has anyone called the protesters or rioters terrorists but as one side has created a precedent when it was convenient rhetorically in the short term that can be used by the other side with as if not protesters are concerned about the powers trump will president and the congress have two and a half months to try to get something accomplished in terms of limiting executive power the prospect is unlikely already protests make the prospect less and also place efforts at reducing government power after trump is in office at a disadvantage although protesters may be more interesting in expressing their including by than reducing government power and constraining the office of the smashed protest in proclaimed riot some people started their protest at pioneer courthouse square and moved to northeast according to the daily about time for an trump death threats swamp twitter numerous disgruntled have taken to twitter to encourage the murder of echoing the reaction to election albeit from a different side of the political

rotten to the core who will be in trump a few possibilities by information clearing house today after a stunning win that upended the political trump and his top advisers now must put together a white house staff and cabinet a group that may well include some of those same are a few possibilities for some of the most powerful roles in a new trump administration the city mayor became one of trump surrogates the former prosecutor could now be in line for attorney the speaker became a top adviser and television spokesperson for trump during the campaign and was even among the real estate mogul finalists for running mate he is said to be interested in becoming secretary of corker the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee could also be a possibility to lead the state a onetime trump emerged as one of trump most steadfast surrogates the renowned physician would be an obvious candidate to be surgeon the retired general emerged as trump most visible military adviser he could be in line for defense secretary or some other national security sessions during the primary sessions became the first sitting member of the senate to endorse trump campaign the senator could be another possibility to lead the the chairman of the republican national committee which ran the trump campaign operation could wind up as trump white house chief of trump finance formerly of is in line to possibly become treasury though shadowed by the recent the new jersey governor has been a fixture at trump side since endorsing him in and will likely have his eye on a spot in the new administration at the justice department or in the white the news executive became trump campaign in august he could be in line for a spot as a white house his job is already known vice president the governor and former congressman is expected to play a large role in the trump administration as a partner to the new who lacks any experience serving in government

the foul stench of fascism in the may be shocked by the election of trump but black and brown smelt it throughout this summer and i have interviewed fellow asking them about their feelings and experiences regarding this presidential election in all of these one thing was we knew this was some of it hung like a foul smell in the air the acrid stench that generations before somehow learned to live though it choked them many of us coughed and spluttered when that suffocating air filled our lungs some of us cried out in when those of us who spoke up were heard at we were greeted with or with laughter like some i wrote about that were given the assurance that there were some for whom that acrid stench was a breath of fresh but those foolish people were few and unimportant we were told the smell would go away on its own it went nowhere it lingered and it got for some of it was more than a smell for some unlucky ones such as it became a physical parked his car in my beloved town of hood to take his dog for a walk as told the town started to get out of the and heard someone the car door smacked my head and then my head hit the door frame i lost part of my memory for about news of the assault hit our small it shocked us all we had a hard time believing especially when reported that the only other words he heard were you is not a he is a monk in typical monk his response was filled with am happy it happened to me and not to a he ca feel safe in a third of my own in my we spoke at length about the assault and what it meant by we had already seen that racism and white nationalism were on the rise the fact that an innocent monk was attacked at all was but that he was attacked for being something he for being nothing more than not was what really my town assumed it was isolated we assumed there was a small minority of people filled with assumed that the smell would go away on its news stories abounded about white people verbally or physically attacking and people with disabilities many people mostly white allies thought that it was rare not something to worry did believe that for a is a black designer who was living in in but was returning to his native white girlfriend and i are moving back to this he told me had originally planned to drive across the country and stop in new and phoenix needless to we not doing that any and his girlfriend took an plane instead too many stories of white backlash attacks in too many disparate places made them cancel their was jokingly worried about being opinionated in the south before this he said it untenable it incredibly sad that in i ca feel safe in a third of my own is not alone by many minority people in had already changed their and outlook marina an artist from began to avoid eye contact with people on the metro when someone looked at her and people are so experiences with actions and violence have existed before but have gotten the attention they getting now social media makes sharing these experiences easier than ever so things encountered kept to but with and twitter talking about with people throughout the i saw this pattern repeated minority people of various and racial groups were all doing the same were talking about the foul smell in the pointing out the real danger to anyone who would and they were all being more cautious around white people many of them changed their in subtle ways wear headphones more at work said a white lesbian woman who wants to remain anonymous for fear of a backlash at the legal practice where she works outside i just want to avoid the chance of getting into was being verbally assaulted and called because she spoke about wanting to marry her partner even in national symbol of a lesbian woman felt afraid to argue for her right to a marriage that the state had already given a black writer and actor in who did not want his real name had a somewhat similar take on avoiding arguments when he talked about the police goal is not to win the he told me goal is to get home happens to be tall and his car is fitted with special gearing to allow him to drive only with his hands it is a car that only someone his size can a white cop pulls me over one he told is looking me up and looking at my insurance and my and he asks me this your i what is that question supposed to we all know what it supposed to mean you looking at my and i have a car only i can drive i know why you asking that but not going to say because the goal is to get home so i just say sir it is white men are taking back to the i heard similar responses throughout the summer and minority people universally spoke of this election as a they spoke of being scared white people universally saw it as an accidental event that would just that could really happen warned us of exactly that sentiment a political writer who studied has written of the seriousness of this election in numerous telling us that ca happen is exactly how fascism happens her essays are like a plan for how to avoid a yet it seems that no one wanted to bring her map on this i warned us writing that are on the cusp of a historic decision in the us we can make history and transition from the first black to the first female
turkey and the next war by the republic of turkey has become a loose cannon on a asset in enabling the united states bombing of northern but a major liability when it comes to any eventual settlement intended to quell the fighting in the is seeking to destroy both genuine enemies and far less blameworthy critics alike in his reaction to attempted military coup his emergency powers were recently extended he has used an enemies prepared to detain without any prospect of to arrest or fire more than government to shut down newspapers and television to close schools and universities and to wage an increasingly bloody war against the southwestern there have been wholesale dismissals and even arrests of bureaucrats and elected including mayors they are being replaced by appointees from loyal to the government but frequently lacking in the training required to do their paranoia and desire for revenge run deep alleged coup has been described as the head of a terrorist organization intent on subduing the entire far beyond turkey embassies and consulates overseas have been ordered to compile lists of disloyal and even sued a comedian who turkey police and intelligence agents have been arresting people who possess multiple bills whose serial numbers all start with the same letter is believed that the banknotes were used to establish bona among coup reading the wrong newspaper or book has led to firing or while parliamentary critics are being silenced and threatened with arrest after being as terrorists there have been frequent reports of beatings and even rape of those and has supported calls for the death penalty for military officers involved in the then there is the ongoing corruption of his family and his close associates turkey illegally bought oil while was under and son used his tankers to move it to markets in east to sell it fearing a police raid at one telephoned his son and advised him to go to his remove all the money inside and hide the government has been arresting businessmen accused of being sympathetic to the coup without presenting any while also confiscating billions of dollars in assets belonging to their companies the assets are being temporarily managed by the political associates of is unfortunately supported by a solid bloc of voters who see the world the same way he does and generally share his intense and religiosity he is inspired by his own personal sense of and he has exhibited what one might reasonably describe as seeing grandiose building projects and a redefinition of turkeys domestic and international interests as part and parcel of his own authority and that of his ruling party and development have previously described how increasingly aggressive foreign policy has long been driven by a somewhat legitimate fear of the development of an independent which presumably would incorporate parts of turkey with northern and as well as western recent participation in the fighting against the state is actually a deliberate being instead mostly aimed at striking the militias that the us regards as its most effective fighting force against the terrorist disturbing recent developments suggest that is now entertaining irredentist claims over former parts of the ottoman empire that are adjacent to turkeys current including in areas just north of in and parts of has argued that he has a responsibility to protect turks in a that he has been employing to bomb areas and to demand a role in the impending assault on which has a small minority knowing that once has its foot in the it will be difficult to make soldiers go has flatly rejected the offer responded by observing that turkey has a right to invade if it feels aim to assert some form of regional dominance is a reversal of turkeys former foreign which stressed friendly relations with all its one might further suggest that the coup let the genie out of the fully liberating from whatever restraints he believed himself to be under and giving him an opportunity to rewrite the constitution to enhance and perpetuate his own a process that is now well reasonably question whether the north treaty organization should exist at all after the demise of the soviet but including turkey as a member raises some very serious concerns due to article of the treaty created the this provision requires all members to respond to a military threat against any member state as a collective defense as the alliance purports to be defensive in turkeys irredentist claims are problematic particularly as it would not be difficult to contrive an incident that would make an offensive operation appear to be such an incident took place in with the clearly premeditated downing of a warplane that had strayed over the border into turkey for seconds turkey regarded the incursion as an act of war was restrained in its and the situation did not escalate in military terms the issue of though it briefly surfaced in was essentially as a basically has long taken as a given that member states will conform to reasonably democratic norms that is something that turkey is rapidly moving away from with its mass show trials and collective punishments while seeks to his position by enhancing his own presidential powers as of the institute puts it turkeys brief democratic moment is the united the calculus is somewhat complicated will likely up the ante in which will require the use of the airbase at but after presuming that a third world war can somehow be averted while the escalation and intervention are taking the role of turkey should be based on strategic considerations distinct from the current fighting in and status as a strategic asset should certainly be particularly in light of the governments authoritarian observers in now believe that will soon be defeated as a territorial though it likely will retain a base of operations in troubled that means any continued operations against the group will be conducted by special ops and intelligence and thus
us bombing of is no worse than what happened in and by the bombing campaign in eastern which has ended at least for the time has been described in press reports and as though it were unique in modern military history in its indiscriminateness in an usual move for a senior us secretary of state john called for an investigation of war crimes in discussion has been lacking in historical however certainly the civilian death toll from the bombing and shelling in has been but many of the strikes may not be all that dissimilar from the major us bombing campaign in in nor as indiscriminate as recent campaigns in densely populated impression that the bombing in was uniquely indiscriminate was a result of news reporting and commentary by that there are no real military targets in east in front turned into the central hub of a massive system of conventional warfare in province in late when it sent an enormous convoy of at least vehicles with troops and weaponry into eastern a dramatic video shows what appears to be hundreds of vehicles full of troops and trucks with weapons mounted on command in has drones observing the routes in and out of so it certainly knew where many of those military sites were located opposition sources also revealed that began immediately to put the military assets at its disposal digging deep bunkers to protect military equipment and tunnels through which troops and weapons could be moved move underground explains the use of bombs for the first time in the war as the guardian reported of the think tank royal united service institute concluded that the have intelligence of the whereabouts of opposition mainly because bunker buster bombs are too expensive to use simply to destroy buildings at like fighters in in the command in has moved its weapons and command around in the tunnels that they have built so many of the and air strikes are almost certainly hitting targets that have already been abandoned and in other the wrong target has undoubtedly been health a local monitoring estimated that civilians had been killed in the first three weeks of bombing in east the united nations put the death toll at the superiority act as terrible as that toll of civilian lives the united states should drop the stance of moral superiority when the us military invaded in it made no effort to keep track of how many civilians were killed in its bombing and artillery claiming it had no way to tell who was civilian and who was the best estimates of civilians killed in us and urban wars provide any basis for moral superiority a survey of hospitals by the times in may produced an estimate of at least civilians killed in the first five weeks of war the estimate included those who had died in ground fighting and from unexploded but even with those contributing factors subtracted from the it would still be far greater than those killed in the assault on east on a weekly war on city in and the war on in were also far deadlier than the former killed according to an investigation by the human rights the latter killed according to the office of coordination of humanitarian affairs on hospitals the one feature of the air offensive on east that seems most clearly to violate the laws of war is the targeting of hospitals media accounts have referred to air strikes with barrel bombs that have hit two major hospitals in the part of the government has been acting as though it regards the hospitals in eastern as serving the front and the which are under intense pressure from the militants who run that part of have fed the governments a detailed report by doctors without borders on the air strikes that hit the hospital on the local that created a new system of hospitals in decided not to declare the hospitals openly but to keep them underground meaning secret from the of the government knows perfectly well where all hospitals in east are located the air strike that damaged the hospital shows how the government has responded it began with an air strike that destroyed a building across the street from the hospital the building was a but former residents of east who have gotten out have confirmed that associated with the command have located their offices in schools to try to hide their a few minutes of the initial according to the hospital staff were pulling survivors out of the rubble and taking them across the street to the emergency whereupon the air force dropped a barrel bomb at the entrance to the emergency killing several of the hospital including one doctor then it dropped one close enough to the side of the hospital to hit the emergency room minutes hit a building down the block where hospital staff were attacks on those who try to save the lives of survivors of bombing attacks sometimes called double tap attacks are rightly condemned as violations of humanitarian law and the belief that the staff at the hospital are operating in effect as medics for the military does not justify attacking it and the wounded sheltered such violations of the laws of war are hardly unique to or unique us drone strikes in have hit rescuers or mourners after hitting their initial targets in numerous documented cases in the the military argued that fighters were using hospitals to hide from but offered no valid evidence to support as the report showed the completely destroyed the hospital in an air strike recorded for public release after claiming falsely that it had been fired on by its wars in and in the has gone well beyond the and campaign in refusing to any distinction between civilian targets it not only targeted civilian offices in both but treated entire areas of the city as a legitimate on the premise that all civilians had been

posted on by with less than a week until the just about every voter in the swing states has received dozens of and exposure to and social media ads most are attack with similar messages the ads focus upon homeland and bringing jobs back to the conservatives have thrown in the phrase liberal extremists in many of their ads in an effort to shock all to believe that liberals are somehow tied to extremists the liberals are pushing an agenda that defines the conservatives as greedy plutocrats who have little thought for the middle class this from local offices to the presidency may be the dirtiest since when challenged john who has outsourced much of his clothing line and construction now says if president he will bring jobs back to stop illegal defeat repeal lower taxes for families while miraculously raising the budget for and perform myriad miracle acts that are not part of a presidents constitutional responsibility on his march to the trump has focused upon a scandal that one congressional hearings and the have cleared innumerable trump has continued to attack her has already apologized for using a personal server during her four years as secretary of state what turned up among more than is about that received a confidential the lowest of three with another receiving secret or top secret classification as a cabinet and fourth in line of she had the right to classify any message a few of the messages came from other agencies about messages were classified retroactively still ahead in numerous has attacked trump for his crude behavior one of her which penetrates almost every is a collage of his many among trump mocks a disabled uses obscene and treats women as chattel both candidates call each other unfit to be with asking voters if they really want trump to be the person in charge of unleashing the nuclear and trump asking voters if they want a corrupt liar in the white house trump has also played upon years of public linking her as an insider and him as an outsider to politics the outsider label has been resonating with voters at all levels of the election campaigns as voters believe they are alienated to and are willing to be led by insiders who claim to be outsiders the cost of airing ads by both candidates for the presidency and members of congress is more than and that include the cost of producing them more than spread among all major democratic and republican candidates for the has been spent on broadcast according to associates during the past has spent about million on broadcast trump has spent about according to data compiled by trump has used both twitter and free due to outrageous to equal campaign during the final week prior to the trump will spend million in broadcast ads the trump totals include a million ad buy from the which stokes the fire of fear that if elected will violate the second amendment and take guns away from something a president cannot do by it will be doubtful that either or trump will know how many ads were placed by their campaigns or by on their behalf that aired on broadcast television there is one reality in all the ads generally and exist only to reinforce a candidates base of support who has covered politics and government for four is author of sacrificing health and the environment for economic benefit

in the world only citizens can vote in the us presidential yet the impact is global the world is suddenly in in panic a man notorious for his bigoted a man who believes in who wants to build the walls and to restore has been elected the th president of the mightiest nation on earth his nation is doubtlessly in it is indebted and some would even hopelessly but it is still the the sole one to this day below the trump may not be any viler than the democratic candidate and her clan has been for years the establishment with which she has been inseparably intertwined for years and decades has been murdering millions all over the looting entire and brutally guaranteeing that the western world would always stay firmly in control of the entire planet throughout the has been using politically correct mainly often in a twisted in order to silence those who dared to criticize her deeds no matter what her words were millions of people have been as a result of the policies introduced by her and by her former president trump is narcissistic and most brutally honest what he says is often pure but whatever it he is not embarrassed to parade it in public he has been giving many advanced warnings to both his supporters his and to his adversaries objectively he is not any more or any less dangerous than both candidates come from the milieu yet trump evokes much greater fear all over the world than his from and to it is at least partially because the mainstream western propaganda rallied determinedly behind the and reliable has proven to be subservient to the western imperialist regime and to market fundamentalist and the western mainstream media is exactly what is giving marching orders to the local particularly in client states in all parts of the world trump is definitely frightening on his own and just because he ran against the establishment does not make him less so managing editor at the post and publisher of uncommon thought recently summarized what i felt about the recent when she wrote to me was right after the results were i am frightened over the election of trump things were going to be bad here even without that because his position as the candidate for president legitimated the ugliest bigotry and violence his legitimates and institutionalizes it at the highest levels possible it is not as if this ugliness was not present in the us as it certainly but it was not celebrated his racism extends outside the us and he has already stated numerous times that he would use nukes in the middle east and just take the oil he also hates the earth he plans to reverse or remove all environmental protections and and he believe in global warming his presidency could not happen at a worse time for our planet i had the extremely bad fortune of spending the day after in the den of the western mainstream media based in pacific the foreign correspondents club of or perhaps it was not only bad fortune but also some type of perverse desire to witness the great and genuine desperation of those who for years and been serving the empire and its liberal twisting the truth and manufacturing even before my arrival at the the results of elections were finalized i expected a great and mess it was i witnessed depressed nervous small and an excessive consumption of booze speeches soon made by the members of western human rights of several and press corps some exile began trashing somehow loosely connecting it to the us elections someone else had a go at the president and of china was hit on several and so was particularly that evil one after speakers mimicked ms derogatory pronunciation of presidents name no one mentioned or even once it was all grotesque and endlessly sad then the chest beating and insulting the voters slowly began a slow masochistic public orgy in the several members of the public began queuing in front of the asking polite questions not sending the panelists to not insulting them directly to their faces nothing like people were just asking and patiently and politely waiting for replies the client states of the west were still very far from the rebellion then my phone became extremely as i began receiving messages from all corners of the globe from i never thought would the are making fun of trump saying that he looks like our president from better than but still disgusting from our government is acting as if it back before the elections from now in the us they will have to eat their own crap as they made others eat it for decades from trump said that he would increase tariffs on imported products in that case hell have to pay more for his as he apparently wears some that are made in where were you on the or where were you on some people compare these two events on both occasions no one bothered to to face and as a some terrible events took place on i was in bangkok on in sipping and looking out of my window the apartment was on a higher floor of the tower the building was literally growing out from the old where patriots used to be raped and executed by the colonialists if i were to walk all the way towards the very glass i would be able to far two shiny preserved for people to remember the great enlightened rule of the west over suddenly on the the sky lit up in a tremendous explosion of colors the villages surrounding were shooting firecrackers and makeshift rockets up to the sky it was a great fireworks something i had never seen before i turned my television set on on the two airplanes were in slow towards the towers of the world trade center a few

by in yesterdays episode of this series came up with an attractive synthesis about the trajectory of modern progressivism he was then thrown into confusion by the arrival of a and cryptic references to intellectual and cultural border guard i felt like a compelled to painfully tear away one skin after another the outline of my conclusions was the but in the cold light of reeds things somehow appeared differently is it true that we have surpassed we still look negatively at right wingers and others who believe in absolutes we still pay lip service to the idea that other cultures are just as praiseworthy as upper middle class liberal culture but looking beneath the it does seem like has been consigned to the graveyard of history but rather than who have learned from the mistakes of we are who have successfully forgotten that ever existed already in the parts of the world were uncomfortable with and brown argued that they had set up their own reactionary by that she meant that they had selected one aspect of their and then declared all attempts to interpret it critically to be subversive our newfound unity is based on two prongs on the one we have consolidated our alliance with key sectors of modern and thereby cemented our branding as intelligent people it is working out wonderfully but have we paid a price for bell argued in the cultural contradictions of capitalism that conservatives supporting capitalism were thereby supporting a cultural engine that undermined the social values central to their conservatism have by letting the cultural arm of the economy fight our battles for clouded our ability to radically critique that in the complex relationship between modern progressivism and the cultural sector of who is using on the other we have fixed certain instances of suffering as foundational and can now blast anyone who seems to doubt their centrality in understanding the world earlier attempts to create a liberal culture based on a consensus about oppression tended to produce a hodgepodge of groups that centrifugal forces could easily pull apart what was different as i had suggested to the had played a role but seemed relevant as well as bin laden had the image of the planes striking the towers appeared on television as a dramatic flash of absolute reality in the new rhetorical world thus squishy came off as inane and republicans happily twitted liberals over their lack of moral clarity the right surged from one apparent victory to while liberals seethed with humiliation maybe there was no epistemological breakthrough that enabled us to answer the gnawing doubts about objectivity maybe we changed the nature of absorbed the stubborn moral clarity of rush and went on to forge a consensus between unruly interest simply because we believed we had to morality as stylized images of suffering inject us with potent shots of we become addicted to empathy with as an antidote for existential disorientation this leads to a natural desire to expand our attention to and hurtful ways of thinking but if we commit to being on the side of people who experience almost everyone might be able to find something in their life that could qualify and in many groups for whom we feel little sympathy are not unwilling to talk about their pain and humiliation we have dodged this trap by finding a principle that will disqualify unintended groups from empathy that way we can classify their pain as the simple rule that does the trick if a group has suffered something historical that we agree is unmistakably horrible then it is also allowed to claim as real we dress it up in academic language about what counts as structural but in simple the rule if a group and we have canonized their suffering as a source of moral clarity for us then they should be allowed to freely discover further incitements to suffering so in mocking older or rural or government or overweight is all entirely acceptable while carrying around fox thinking a fur is calling a bunny or not supporting a baby fox who wants to be an elephant are all entirely unacceptable t he principle that prejudice is wrong the principle is that the latter examples are code for liberal flash points i thought about something brown in its emergence as a protest against marginalization or politicized identity instills its pain over its unredeemed history in the very foundation of its political claim politicized identity enunciates makes claims for only by and inscribing its pain in it can hold out no future for itself or others that triumphs over this pain by instilling pain at the center of our epistemological we condemn ourselves to endless efforts to shuttle and amplify that pain brown emphasized revenge as a key technique in dealing with a will that makes not only a psychological but a political practice of an identity whose present past is one of insistently unredeemable injury offers plenty of examples of hurting people the way they hurt so they can see what it feels and learn the response to nick tricking and telling her its a sweetheart is for her to trick him and then its a sweetheart the same line is then used on the evil female sheep at the end of the movie the movie sees cultural insensitivity as not only the primary evil in the but also the most appropriate punishment the final prison episode also came to when i had laughed at the evil anger at her wool getting touched the culmination of apology is announcing that she really is just a dumb bunny her guilt is so great that she knows she deserves the pain of stereotyping brown worried about the insatiable dead end of insistently irredeemable injury modern liberal culture way out of the cycle of suffering and revenge models it for us in her apology to nick if the oppressor voluntarily decides to submit to the worst tortures the
shrimp imports chemical injections food fraud it seems that the more advanced human civilization the less we learn about what is and is good for our bodies that the only way to explain why many commercial food operations are so toxic and hazardous to our daily mail is reporting on a commercial shrimp operation in where workers have been videotaped injecting them with disgusting substances in order to make them appear bigger and fresher before they are sold and video shows factory workers injecting tiger prawns in the tail and midsection with a gel substance to make them heavier before they are is the largest source of imported shrimp for many video footage was shot by a television station earlier this year since it has gone viral on social media sites like with many people expressing disgust and substance is often used in food as a thickening in particular for icing but many people who have watched the video are labeling the factory and its workers as and dishonest in their attempt to make the shrimp appear bigger and more meaty in the practice makes one wonder what else is being done to shrimp or other food not just in but throughout the region local shrimp suppliers do environmental protection organization recently released a report as an aid for importers of shrimp to find sources that are harvested without using slave methods that are destructive or harmful to ocean or that utilize toxic guide recommended shrimp harvested in and around but also black tiger prawns from the organization also warned against all imported which very often is sourced from because of concern about mangrove pollution and the use of invasive species natural blaze in reporting on the story noted that workers at the shrimp preparation factory in question said they injected the shrimp there because local shrimp suppliers do site noted further that the largest suppliers of shrimp products in import more than half of their raw materials for processing from other including which has a reputation for unsanitary food the about million pounds of shrimp or about percent of the amount of shrimp consume annually comes from which in turn gets most of its shrimp from where food regulation is a cruel joke added weight means additional profits natural blaze reported that after about million worth of shrimp was imported into the from china between and the food and drug administration issued an import alert in of that year the alert warned importers of the of new drugs unsafe food in seafood originating in and that included daily mail said that workers were injecting the shrimp with a substance known as or many say it is not considered harmful because it dissolves in water and becomes a smooth liquid before it is then pumped into the obviously is not a element which means shrimp that it is injected into are no longer organic and natural and the substance has been linked to abdominal eye pain and and lingering changes in natural blaze yet its use in food continues that because wholesalers and retailers see a bigger profit margin in artificially inflating the size of shrimp that is then sold by weight and even if retailers are doing the they are knowingly selling a product that has been injected at the source

license cold war has reached unprecedented hysterical levels and yet a hot war is not about to break out before or after the us presidential election from the machine supported by a think complex to the establishment and its corporate media the of the free are racking up of and to pure incandescence and yet a hot war is not about to break out before or after the us presidential election so many layers of fear and loathing in fact veil no more than a bluff let start with the naval task force in led by the officially designated admiral which will be stationed in the eastern at least until supporting operations against all strands of the admiral is fully equipped with air artillery and warfare systems and can defend itself against a vast array of unlike vessels advertisement is spinning with alarm that of the northern along with the is on the way to the it only part of the northern and the fleet ships are not going anywhere the heart of the matter is that when the capabilities of this naval task force are matched with the missile systems already deployed in is now facto rivaling the firepower of the us sixth fleet to top it as this comprehensive military analysis makes has made their own zone over and a us viscerally promoted by now impossible to that should be more than enough to put into perspective the impotence transmuted into outright anger exhibited by the pentagon and its vassals add to it the outright war between the pentagon and the in the war where the pentagon backs the who are not necessarily in favor of regime change in while the backs further of as in compounding the trademark administration three stooges school of foreign threats have flown more liberally than bloody baton in the new season of the walking dead pentagon head ash a certified has threatened as in strikes against army forces to the after the pentagon itself broke the ceasefire advertisement president took some time off weighing his options and in the he backed off so it will be up for the virtually elected by the whole us establishment to make the fateful decision she wo be able to go for a zone because is already doing it and if she decides to the already via defense ministry spokesman there will definitely be for imposing a hot war sun does do of reserves for itself a nuclear fully supports trump does and for that he also if we allow the current hysteria to literally go then we must consider the matter of the system which effectively seals air wo admit it on the record because that would unleash a relentless arms race a us source with close connections to the masters of the universe but at the same time opposed to cold war as adds the necessary united states has lost the arms indulging in trillions of dollars of worthless and endless wars in and now is no longer a global power as it cannot defend itself with its obsolete patriot and aegis land based ballistic defense against even as the have sealed their airspace the may be as much as four generations ahead of the in the deep recesses of shadow war the pentagon and the defense ministry also that in the event some launched a nuclear preemptive strike against the population would be protected by their defensive missile systems as well as nuclear bomb shelters in major cities warnings on television have not been the population would know where to go in the terrifying event of nuclear war breaking out
license the is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda the nephew of the pioneer of it was who coined the term as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions in he persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the new easter parade behavior then considered outlandish one light another torch of fight another sex influence extended far beyond advertising his greatest success was his role in convincing the public to join the slaughter of the first world war the he was the of people in order to and regiment according to our will without their knowing about he described this as true ruling power in our and called it an the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood in my career as a journalist and i have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged imagine two cities both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country both cities are occupied by who commit terrible such as beheading people advertisement but there is a vital difference in one the government soldiers are described as liberators by western reporters embedded with who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes there are front page pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a for victory there is scant mention of civilian casualties in the second city in another country nearby almost exactly the same is happening government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics the difference is that these fanatics are supplied and armed by by the united states and they even have a media center that is funded by and another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad condemned for assaulting and bombing the city which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city not really such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda i am of to the current siege of the city of by the government forces of who are backed by the united states and and to the siege of by the government forces of backed by one is the other is bad advertisement what is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if and the united states had not invaded in that criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as the monstrous and and and the rest of the gang might not and the people of might not be fighting for their lives today some may remember in a succession of reporters turning to the camera and telling us that was for what turned out to be the crime of the century the us television networks produced the same validation for w bush fox news brought on henry to effuse over fabrications the same soon after the i filmed an interview in with the renowned investigative journalist i asked would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude

please read part and i b before this chapter the horn of has the second most globally location on the continent behind north straddling the commercially vital red sea and providing international access to the worlds economy of in this the coastal states acquire a dual maritime and mainland importance through which their territories can be simultaneously used to exert influence along the waterway and the regional interior as it relates to the red this body of water occupies a crucial role in chinas grand strategy because it serves as the most geographically convenient route for facilitating the transit of goods between the east state and the which is particularly expected to climb with the completion of the silk road in a few years time due to the importance that china places on the one belt one road grand strategy and the need that it has for maintaining and strengthening its overseas markets the large and in order to sustain domestic stability and it logically has an inherent interest in preserving stability in the horn of so as to safeguard its sea line of communication to for similar it also wants to tap into the allied economy and assist in the maximization of its potential so as to acquire a strategic presence there that allows it to deepen its presence further inland into the continents interior it should be no surprise then that the horn of is the focal point of international military as evidenced by the previous part of the research which described the vast array of foreign military bases in the recent presence in and the and plans for building a base in quite naturally and in accordance with its obvious china is opening its first overseas military base in in order take advantage of the dual role in exercising maritime and mainland influence its clear how and why the tiny coastal state can be used by for flexing its maritime but its less obvious how it plans to do this in the opposite mainland direction its therefore relevant to recall the railway that china is building between the coastal city and the inland since this infrastructure project will serve as the umbilical cord between the and economies and also allow the later to finally and reliably access the global market in general the connective vision that china is pursuing is complemented by the project that its also helping to finance which eventually plans to connect with the ocean port of by rail suffice to the completion of both transnational railways and the military facility will catapult china into being the most influential country in the horn of although this seemingly inevitable reality will expectedly be opposed by the us using the methods of hybrid war this part of the research therefore endeavors to explain all of the ways in which the us could apply hybrid war strategy in order to conceivably offset chinas grand designs in the horn of region it begins by offering a general overview of regional relations that sets the appropriate context for deeper analysis after having established the state of affairs and provided a solid understanding of each examined countries interactions with the the second portion of the work then delves into a summary of these states strategic focusing primarily on their most influential determinants the last part of the regional study looks at the most realistic hybrid war scenarios that the us could possibly provoke against chinas horn of interests thorny relations in the horn the four states that occupy the horn of region and all have pristine relations with one with the most obvious problems being between on one side and on the other to explain the reason behind the abysmal relations between these two its necessary to begin by talking about bloody secessionist war against which only ended in the roots of the conflict are but they can be summarized as starting during the imperial period when the kingdom of annexed from the larger of in thenceforth giving it a sense of identity separateness from and planting the seeds for future conflict after the two entities were reunified following the end of world war ii unilateral abolishment of the federation of and sparked the separatist war that raged throughout the proceeding and even after the two countries remained at tense odds with one another over the expectation that there would eventually be a continuation war sometime in the future this came to pass from and despite ending in what has been described as a lingering stalemate it killed over one hundred thousand people and undermined the economic development potential of these two dramatically impoverished states in the years and have still remained each others primary with the two sides regularly accusing the other of attempting to subvert its stability and supporting various forces just like in the immediate years after there still exists the very real possibility today that the two countries will go to war with one another at a moments and this atmosphere of heightened militant tension is the most destabilizing interstate factor in the horn of in it will later be argued that this situation is being exploited by the powers inside the as a means of acquiring leverage over and potentially pushing into instigating a renewed round of debilitating violence although not as bad as its ties with relations with are objectively pretty poor on the surface of things there is positive and pragmatic interaction between both states at the but the primary issue between them has always been the enticing idea of greater that has captivated some on both sides of the border and even led to the war between this conflict is notable as being the last conventional attempt to create greater and also as being the only time when the soviets and switched sides during a proxy war the issue was over the status of in sparsely populated eastern region which has now been revealed to be rich i n oil and natural

the letter from about the email scandal has motivated as the campaign says they raised million in the last hours of the campaign says they raised in last hrs the most since became nominee at the convention the letter was supposed to boost trump and depress democratic but the opposite appears to be happening interference in the presidential election has motivated supporters to work give more and get to the which in not what republicans wanted at all democrats have seen through letter and the republican spin the surprise has failed it has made even stronger while giving her campaign more resources to use to close out the presidential election as a political the letter is harming republicans republicans have thrown everything that they can think of at and nothing has stopped her and her supporters continue to grow while trump is marching back into reality television star celebrity obscurity
the post reported trump raised just million for his presidential campaign committee in the first days of about half as much as his democratic putting him at a severe financial disadvantage in the crucial final days of the white house new campaign finance reports filed night showed the presidential nominee had just million left in his campaign coffers on compared to million when the cash reserves of their joint committees are war chest grew to while trumps totaled million trumps total dropped in the first days of million is close to nothing for a national presidential campaign in the closing weeks of the race at a time when trump needs boots on the ground to get out the republican his presidential campaign is and in debt to the tune of million there going to be a ad blitz for or a reservation of television time so that the republican nominee can speak directly to voters before election day the plan for trump is for the campaign to continue to limp along with lots of which are good for trumps but not effective in getting voters to the polls trump promised to donate million to his campaign but has only given million the billionaire who promised to has run his presidential campaign into the ground trump took ten times more money out of his campaign in reimbursements to his own businesses than he gave in is an indicator of expected election outcomes the money tends to go towards the winner at the end of an election is having no trouble raising which suggests that enthusiasm is high among her supporters trumps cash crush points to a depressed base that expect him to win trump has done what he does best he talked a big game while bankrupting the republican party for his own personal gain convincing republicans to give him their nomination may go down in history as trumps biggest con of all

print version font size when i was younger my very dear godmother wanted a small television set for her the color scheme of the walls and furniture was sky blue with accents she desired one to compliment the this was and most television sets came in one color black as the years progressed i cannot tell you the times i heard how she sought a blue television of course every year new models and brighter hues became available until eventually my godmother quite nearly discovered the precise set best suited to her she passed away prior to ever purchasing one while the implication of my anecdote is obvious you likely to die before ever finding perfection it seems some people in need a gentle reminder what the dueling implications of their current search for a perfect political candidate holds for a fate not the least less serious than death the foremost women issue of our time is immigration and these are the two futures awaiting us if wins has stated she favors a world without limit and as a result the already porous southern border shall remain largely unguarded to there are over million illegal in the united states they pay no income taxes and no payroll taxes of any kind yet they avail themselves of hospitals and welfare which are paid for by citizen tax dollars if trump wins he has emphatically repeated a physical wall will be constructed on the southern offering job opportunities to tens of thousands of citizens and billions of dollars for both the national and local economies other employment will be created by maintaining and guarding this structure tax dollars will support veterans and elderly if wins illegal present in the country with coupled with illegal driving illegal subsidies from taxpayers and dozens of other illegal will not pause there if illegal can break every other law in why should sexual sexual deviancy and sexual assault be any women should expect hundreds of thousands of additional sexual and physical assaults every year by people who have no legitimate excuse to be in the united states in it is legal to have sex with children years of although often misconstrued or hidden by this is the fact in most of today is not as long as the something for the female child and do think illegal leave this at their border in recent years have been instances in the united states when illegal have swapped a case of beer or other items as compensation for taking someone then used this in courts for being acquitted of a if trump wins the million illegal will dramatically be reduced their departure will lessen your daughter classroom size while increasing resources for her school you cannot have dramatics and sport programs when you double the with illegal in very real unless you are independently wealthy and can afford private the presence of illegal children literally curtails your daughter opportunities and minimizes her life choices at the same time the million illegal begin to depart another million illegal will never arrive due to strict border security on average to million illegal are invading every year this will immediately cease with a trump presidency to the benefit of your child education and future employment not to mention your own quality of life if wins one of the most important things to know and to remember when you is many allegedly illegals and refugees have genuinely empathetic stories from their are entirely unable to function in the united states with no not a or a it is a fact the vast majority are illiterate in the languages of the new homelands as well as most being illiterate in their own the myth these people want a better or they are to is revealed by the truth they simply cannot work in an industrialized society which already has extremely high unemployment for manual labor illegals and refugees lack the lack the skills and most importantly lack the basic ability to learn them in it is now admitted only in of the refugees are employable thus of will be on receiving free and collecting taxpayer benefits into which they never paid at least one refugee in with and offspring claims per year we all hope for the best for our but if your daughter is less than a or other highly educated professional illegals and refugees will directly compete with her in the workplace and if she cannot find a job there may be no welfare benefits for her due to it all being taken by illegals if trump wins in the past years are approximately million refugees of the even the government admits only will find permanent employment this means uninvited people will be draining social security systems from hardworking taxpayers with trump a similar situation need never occur in the united where citizens can care for fellow citizens if wins she has announced in addition to totally will increase their number over to nearly combined all men of fighting with few if any women or though these people have no documents and even the admits it impossible to know who is a terrorist and who a refugee as whether organized terrorists or not in the first six months of this year even the refugees have committed over serious crimes in many of these being assaults of grotesque sexual nature if trump wins there will be new immigrants to since none can be ascertained to the citizenry however financial and material aid will be sent to care for

trump ran for office on a promise of securing the nations southern partially through the construction of a border with the added caveat that would somehow pay for it the government has consistently stated that it had no intention of paying for any such and it waste any time after trumps victory to reiterate that according to foreign minister made clear that paying for a border wall was not on her agenda paying for a wall is not part of our said foreign minister to a local television station added that her government had remained in contact with trumps campaign team ever since his visit to in august there has been a daily communication with different members of the she stated obviously trump and the government see eye to eye on this issue at the but with the admission that the two sides are talking on a regular it stands to reason that something could be worked out considering how adamant trump has been about building the wall and having pay for it in some he may just need to be a bit more persuasive with leaders to help them adjust their vision to include a border wall

written by the bombing campaign in eastern which has ended at least for the time has been described in press reports and as though it were unique in modern military history in its indiscriminateness in an usual move for a senior us secretary of state john called for an investigation of war crimes in the discussion has been lacking in historical however certainly the civilian death toll from the bombing and shelling in has been but many of the strikes may not be all that dissimilar from the major us bombing campaign in in nor as indiscriminate as recent campaigns in densely populated cities the impression that the bombing in was uniquely indiscriminate was a result of news reporting and commentary by that there are no real military targets in east but in front turned into the central hub of a massive system of conventional warfare in province in late when it sent an enormous convoy of at least vehicles with troops and weaponry into eastern a dramatic video shows what appears to be hundreds of vehicles full of troops and trucks with weapons mounted on them the command in has drones observing the routes in and out of so it certainly knew where many of those military sites were located opposition sources also revealed that began immediately to put the military assets at its disposal digging deep bunkers to protect military equipment and tunnels through which troops and weapons could be moved unseen the move underground explains the use of bombs for the first time in the war as the guardian reported of the think tank royal united service institute concluded that the have intelligence of the whereabouts of opposition mainly because bunker buster bombs are too expensive to use simply to destroy buildings at random but like fighters in in the command in has moved its weapons and command around in the tunnels that they have built so many of the and air strikes are almost certainly hitting targets that have already been abandoned and in other the wrong target has undoubtedly been hit the health a local monitoring estimated that civilians had been killed in the first three weeks of bombing in east the united nations put the death toll at drop the superiority act as terrible as that toll of civilian lives the united states should drop the stance of moral superiority when the us military invaded in it made no effort to keep track of how many civilians were killed in its bombing and artillery claiming it had no way to tell who was civilian and who was not and the best estimates of civilians killed in us and urban wars provide any basis for moral superiority a survey of hospitals by the times in may produced an estimate of at least civilians killed in the first five weeks of war the estimate included those who had died in ground fighting and from unexploded but even with those contributing factors subtracted from the it would still be far greater than those killed in the assault on east on a weekly basis the war on city in and the war on in were also far deadlier than the former killed according to an investigation by the human rights the latter killed according to the office of coordination of humanitarian affairs attacks on hospitals the one feature of the air offensive on east that seems most clearly to violate the laws of war is the targeting of hospitals media accounts have referred to air strikes with barrel bombs that have hit two major hospitals in the part of the city the government has been acting as though it regards the hospitals in eastern as serving the front and the which are under intense pressure from the militants who run that part of have fed the governments suspicions as a detailed report by doctors without borders on the air strikes that hit the hospital on the local that created a new system of hospitals in decided not to declare the hospitals openly but to keep them underground meaning secret from the government in of the government knows perfectly well where all hospitals in east are located the air strike that damaged the hospital shows how the government has responded it began with an air strike that destroyed a building across the street from the hospital the building was a but former residents of east who have gotten out have confirmed that associated with the command have located their offices in schools to try to hide their staff within a few minutes of the initial according to the hospital staff were pulling survivors out of the rubble and taking them across the street to the emergency whereupon the air force dropped a barrel bomb at the entrance to the emergency killing several of the hospital including one doctor then it dropped one close enough to the side of the hospital to hit the emergency room minutes hit a building down the block where hospital staff were staying such attacks on those who try to save the lives of survivors of bombing attacks sometimes called double tap attacks are rightly condemned as violations of humanitarian law and the belief that the staff at the hospital are operating in effect as medics for the military does not justify attacking it and the wounded sheltered there but such violations of the laws of war are hardly unique to or hardly unique us drone strikes in have hit rescuers or mourners after hitting their initial targets in numerous documented cases in the the military argued that fighters were using hospitals to hide from but offered no valid evidence to support as the report showed in the completely destroyed the hospital in an air strike recorded for public release after claiming falsely that it had been fired on by gunmen in its wars in and in the has gone well beyond the and campaign in refusing to any distinction between civilian targets it not
written by journalist is often described as the man who invented modern propaganda the nephew of the pioneer of it was who coined the term public relations as a euphemism for spin and its deceptions in as a publicist for the cigarette persuaded feminists to promote cigarettes for women by smoking in the new easter parade behavior then considered outlandish one light another torch of fight another sex influence extended far beyond advertising his greatest success was his role in convincing the public to join the slaughter of the first world war the he was engineering the consent of people in order to control and regiment according to our will without their knowing about it he described this as the true ruling power in our society and called it an invisible government the invisible government has never been more powerful and less understood in my career as a journalist and i have never known propaganda to insinuate our lives and as it does now and to go unchallenged tale of two cities imagine two cities both are under siege by the forces of the government of that country both cities are occupied by who commit terrible such as beheading people but there is a vital difference in one the government soldiers are described as liberators by western reporters embedded with who enthusiastically report their battles and air strikes there are pictures of these heroic soldiers giving a for victory there is scant mention of civilian casualties in the second city in another country nearby almost exactly the same is happening government forces are laying siege to a city controlled by the same breed of fanatics the difference is that these fanatics are supplied and armed by us by the united states and they even have a media center that is funded by and another difference is that the government soldiers laying siege to this city are the bad condemned for assaulting and bombing the city which is exactly what the good soldiers do in the first city not really such is the basic double standard that is the essence of propaganda i am of to the current siege of the city of by the government forces of who are backed by the united states and and to the siege of by the government forces of backed by one is the other is bad behind the fanatics what is seldom reported is that both cities would not be occupied by fanatics and ravaged by war if and the united states had not invaded in that criminal enterprise was launched on lies strikingly similar to the propaganda that now distorts our understanding of the civil war in without this drumbeat of propaganda dressed up as the monstrous and and the front and the rest of the gang might not and the people of might not be fighting for their lives today some may remember in a succession of reporters turning to the camera and telling us that prime minister tony was vindicated for what turned out to be the crime of the the invasion of the us television networks produced the same validation for w bush fox news brought on former secretary of state henry to effuse over of state fabrications the same soon after the i filmed an interview in with the renowned investigative journalist i asked what would have happened if the freest media in the world had seriously challenged what turned out to be crude he replied that if journalists had done their there is a very good chance we would not have gone to war in it was a shocking and one supported by other famous journalists to whom i put the same question rather of rose of the and journalists and producers in the who wished to remain anonymous in other had journalists done their had they challenged and investigated the propaganda instead of amplifying hundreds of thousands of women and children would be alive and there would be no and no siege of or there would have been no atrocity on the underground on there would have been no flight of millions of there would be no miserable camps when the terrorist atrocity happened in last president immediately sent planes to bomb and more terrorism the product of bombast about being at war and showing no mercy that state violence and violence feed off each other is the truth that no national leader has the courage to speak when the truth is replaced by said the soviet dissident the silence is a lie punishing independence the attack on the attack on the attack on happened because the leader in each of these countries was not a puppet of the west the human rights record of a or a was irrelevant they did not obey orders and surrender control of their country the same fate awaited once he had refused to sign an agreement that demanded the occupation of and its conversion to a market economy his people were and he was prosecuted in the independence of this kind is intolerable as has it was only when the leader in rejected an oil running through his country from to that he was attacked from that the planned to destroy the government of with fanatics the same fanatics currently holding the people of and eastern hostage why is this not the former foreign office official who was responsible for operating sanctions against told we would feed journalists factoids of sanitized or

except law enforcement agencies and the president are dropping and united is not the because people perceive it not as a but as a kind of a governmental body its rating will keep going but step by step if you vote for united it means a symbolic a sort of political ritual if you are and go to the polling you are likely to vote for united because it is necessary this is the very logic and motivation that drive average voters to elect united though some people preferred not to vote for the ruling they voted for the current because there were no real they voted either for one of the three systemic parliamentary parties or the spoiler which aimed at distracting the attention of voters and preventing the opposition from gaining parliamentary seats why did the opposition fail and what is its key the reason why they failed can be traced back to the personal ambitions of the opposition leaders they team up and compete with each other in they have different in fact i mean liberals and liberals always agree this does after all these leaders have enough political heft most of them cannot be considered powerful and influential political figures problem is that the authoritarian regime in will prevent the emergence of new powerful liberal forces in if such a party emerges and poses a serious challenge to the authorities like opposition leader it will be either destroyed or discredited and marginalized in such a it is very difficult to come up with a pragmatic solution this years parliamentary elections proved that the only political democratic force on a scale of a whole country is the party and its leader no matter how you view them it is losing popularity year after but this party remains firmly within the political landscape and if the opposition is able to persuade voters that brings together different representatives of

turnout remained well below the necessary percent of all valid although percent of voters more than three million people said they wanted the parliament to have a decisive say about any future redistribution of inside the referendum and its campaign had two separate goals the ruling party had to test the loyalty of their political thus they tried to redefine classical political fault lines and checked on the unity of the opposition prime minister used this occasion to bring forward his arguments about reshaping the competences of the especially the commission referendum question has been thoroughly debated ever since it was as it reflects both of the above goals the question you want the union to be able to order the mandatory settlement of citizens in without parliaments political and civil groups were enabled by the ambiguous wording of the question to focus on significantly different interpretations neither the constitutional court nor the national election committee declared the question despite the fact that it raised concerns among experts the constitutional rules within most member states declare that no national referendum should be held on issues already regulated by international a way of getting around this the government later claimed that the referendum did not concern the decisions of mandatory quotas already decided at the level of the council it would only concern future possible the competency of the the council is required to give the final word in any such case of distribution of resettlement or relocation among member in any case where has a way to raise its own voice or to build a blocking coalition the government decided to go against the quota system after the councils decisions of last autumn and went to the court in to dispute the legality of the measure was the final point where the government turned the migration crisis into a sovereignty question it had started in the official government rhetoric already after the attacks on but the referendum question undoubtedly raised the stakes of the debate it is not anymore about whether migrants or refugees should be welcomed or the opinion of the government focuses on the competence of the institutions whether they in enforce decisions on member position is openly on the side that the quota system violates the sovereignty of member states and unnecessarily forces a instead of paying attention to securing the external borders of the area this has been the argument already since last when hundreds of thousands of refugees crossed the country and the route towards the borders must be because if member states start the redistribution the political pressure for a sustainable solution at the border protection level would dissipate and would be left with an influx of uncontrolled deal seriously decreased the number of arriving in the though the route remains open and is under growing pressure again have not seen masses of migrants since last when the

welcome back to a bipolar courtesy of a axis is but the is quite yet here either originally appeared at strategic culture foundation the transition in the international from a world to a bipolar cost humanity a world war involving millions of deaths the next distinct from the conflicts between the and the ended with the fall of the wall in but without the tragedy of direct confrontation this fundamental historical difference has its own intrinsic logic governing the relationship of forces between powers the was a country in unable to continue its role on the international stage as the premier power the transition from a bipolar to a unipolar reality could have had nuclear but an agreement between the powers avoided this danger the upshot was an unconditional surrender of the with catastrophic consequences in economic and cultural terms for the superpower to come to terms but at least without the explosion of a conflict with the end of the bipolar began what some historians declared to be the end of history the transition from a to a bipolar to end in a unipolar world from the point of view of the story ended with only one global power thereby granting the united states the power to decide matters for the whole world the scenario in which we live in terms of international law and the balance of is almost unprecedented in history if looked at in the present context it is true that the current transition from a unipolar to a reality is something similar to what has been seen in previous with the transition from hegemony in the century to a situation in the period preceding the two world wars resorting to this historical analogy is given the relative absence of international rules compared to a century ago therefore it is difficult to use the earlier transition period to make assumptions about future trends the causes of change the attitude of the us over the last years has been focused completely on the achievement of global hegemony the dream of having control over every in every corner of the has ironically led to accelerating the end of unipolar moment of course the deep meaning of the word can be expanded examining the merits of the economic and military impositions that result from a constant quest for global domination the us has chosen an impassable road that is full of contradictions to justify their rise as a global power in two decades we have witnessed the dismantling of all the key principles of the balance of power between and the united necessitating the change in international relations from unipolar to the ratio of economic and military power between china and the united states has significantly culminating in the dangerous dispute over the south china sea the abandonment of the doctrine governing relations with and the failure of the reset with have pushed two global and to forge an alliance that allows for a world where there are more powers on the international stage and not just as the central focus of global relations the failure of the foreign doctrine of the united states was a direct consequence of the arrogance and the utopia of being able to dominate the seeking to extend indefinitely the unipolar moment and forging a worldwide system culturally and economically based on the will of reinforced by a power and military posture without precedent had thought more carefully about the consequences of their and thereby employed a more considered strategic it would certainly have opted for different choices as a demonstration of we note attitude in the middle the deciding ground for prospects of continued us global hegemony much of remaining capacity to influence global decisions is attributable to the dollar and the trading of goods such as oil in that currency with the appearance of a world with more regional or global it is easy to guess that the rise of the republic has consequences for the whole of the middle east region the odds are evident that economically and will be the first regional power has realized this and has decided to reach an agreement with the republic in order to remain relevant in the region and not to be cut off from future agreements also in doing to counterbalance the situation with her most influential regional and it is a strategy that in the middle east has had a negative impact in the immediate present for and in some ways even who have all opted for an autonomous and interventionist approach in the region without much consultation with the choice to include as a partner for the middle east balance has allowed to conserve the illusion that in the future it will maintain an important role in regional decisions this is a decision that has created many problems with historic but with a view to the to have made an appropriate choice this also explains why so many of the and liberals promoters of a prolonged unipolar the cause of so many failures are clearly opposed to this agreement and its establishment have opted for a cultural and economic confrontation with possibly militarily with in the south china in the process impelling the emergence of a world in which more powers have the by joining to resist the will of the greater global power in it is easier to frame the international balance in a model that is slowly becoming bipolar we consider that and china to a lesser extent do not possess the military capability to successfully oppose power in a conventional conflict on a grand scale for this it is easy to understand that shaping a international order perhaps remains quite optimistic at this time it is similarly optimistic to maintain a unipolar world order that remains anchored in the illusions of the elite reality rather shows us a bipolar where the alternative pole to the us is represented by the union and alliances economic and of and and
leave a reply trump has all the momentum now will it be enough to propel him to victory on election trumps poll numbers were improving even before we learned that the had renewed its investigation into and the new survey results that came out over the weekend and on make it clear that certain victory is not so certain after all unless something are going to go to the polls on with an criminal investigation hanging over the campaign like an ominous and that is very good news for trump and as we learn more about what is in these newly discovered will her fellow democrats stick with some are publicly wavering the following example comes from longtime confidante and former democratic pollster told fox news the newly renewed investigation into private email server is forcing him to reassess his support for the democratic nominee for president a fox news made the comments to host during a live television appearance night on fox report weekend and of course the race could dramatically change once again if the comes to some sort of resolution about these new emails prior to on reported that a resolution before election day did not appear to be likely officials are unlikely to finish their review of new emails potentially related to its investigation into private server before the election the initial work of cataloging top aide emails found on her estranged husband laptop could be done in the next few us law enforcement officials told but the investigators are expected to spend more time doing other including likely working with other federal agencies to determine what if any classified materials are in the emails this makes it unlikely there will be a resolution prior to the election stay because i think that this is going to be a crazy week sf source economic collapse share
the price of hubris has set years of assuming an easy victory in team is taking the heavy toll as reality is setting under her own set of scandals after the brutal was seen breaking down in tears as she carried dry cleaning through in new the campaign is not taking their failure to secure total power very well at all right now they are in the grieving image captured by daily mail photographer tells it all there are many angles and snaps of this priceless moment at the daily mail to the daily mail closest aide wept openly in the street on as she returned to the place where the democratic candidates campaign was fought and lost looked like she had the weight of the world on her shoulders as she visited the campaign headquarters of the failed presidential candidate after her own stumbles and her husbands habits helped contribute to historic the pain and emotion of the situation were clearly visible on the face of the despite the dark sunglasses that covered her eyes her breakdown was triggered by a text as the daily mail appeared to start weeping after she read a message on her mobile phone as she made her way to the headquarters it is thought that feels guilty for the campaigns as the last minute investigation into just before election week was largely due to the emails found on her husbands himself under fresh investigation for allegedly misdeeds involving underage girls regardless of the merits of either of the it may have taken down a final just enough for trump to win the is taking it quite she is hardly the only one herself has been reportedly crying and cycling through systematic blame against her surrogates and while lamenting her own loss of what no rightfully it was the primary reason why she did not make an appearance on election to ed who spoke with a close friend and confidante of that she in have a serious breakdown and was in no condition to speak to on live shock of losing after having been a lock for the presidency was simply too much to bear and as you might expect from a it was everybody she was crying inconsolably she stop crying and her her female friend from way back said it was even hard to understand what she was saying she was crying so hard her friend said she could make out that she was blaming the director of the for her i understand the president of the united states for not doing enough via gateway the question did really cast the bulk of blame on the loyal aide who is typically more closely at her side than even her daughter or has a notoriously dark reputation for throwing objects at the former president castigating her staff and surrogates and demeaning the general public and even her own supporters can only imagine how bad she took her rage and despair about the big loss on we finally know why disappeared on election she was crying inconsolably it was hard to understand what she was saying she was crying so hard she was in full unleashed on for unapproved debate question evidence surfaces that chair fed questions to campaign in advance make no everyone who is warning about is a target and they are marked media faces from they bet the farm on and lost
posted on home headlines world news are we about to see the largest election day miracle of all because as i will show in this that is precisely what it is going to take in order for trump to win before i go any i want to make it exceedingly clear that i am not saying what the outcome will be on as i recently told a national television i do not know who is going to win in this article i am simply going to examine the poll numbers and the electoral map as they currently stand but in this bizarre election things can literally change and it is entirely possible that we could still have another surprise or two before it is all said and done and without a doubt trump desperately needs something to move the because if the election was held today would almost certainly win what we have witnessed so far during the election season has been absolutely unprecedented just consider some of the things that we have seen up to this point in time we have never had a bigger surprise than the release of the lewd audio tape from years ago in which trump claimed to grope women without their consent we have never seen the mainstream media openly attack a presidential candidate as much as they have attacked trump in the the big mainstream news outlets at least pretended to be fair and but this year they have completely discarded all notions of objectivity they should be completely and utterly ashamed of and no matter who wins the election they will never be able to get their integrity back we have also never seen a major party at war with itself this close to a presidential election it has been said that a house divided against itself will surely and a whole host of prominent republican leaders have been openly attempting to sabotage the trump campaign if trump is able to overcome all of these it truly will be a miracle of biblical proportions as it stands at the the numbers are looking quite ominous for trump right the real clear politics average of national polls has ahead by percent most political experts consider that to be an insurmountable lead at this stage in the game but even if trump can close that gap and pull that does not mean that he will win the election in trump could beat by millions of votes nationally and still lose in order to win the one candidate has got to get to electoral votes and on the latest real clear politics electoral electoral votes are being projected to go to electoral votes are being projected to go to and electoral votes are in the toss up category so unless something dramatically trump is essentially going to have to run the table in all of the closely contested states in order to and the mathematical odds of that happening are extremely slim lets take a closer look at this the first thing that trump is going to have to do in order to get to electoral votes is to win all of the states that mitt won in that would get him up to electoral votes it looks like that may be very difficult to do won north but the six most recent polls all have ahead in that state also won but the most recent poll to be taken there has ahead by five points but for a lets assume that trump can win all of the states that won on top of there are four other states that trump must win trump must win electoral votes without trump has no realistic path to electoral votes so on election night if it is announced that trump has lost you might as well turn off your television and go to bed because trump is going to lose the election unfortunately for four recent major surveys all show trump down by four points in the sunshine state trump must win electoral votes no republican has ever won the presidency without winning and the two most recent major surveys show that trump and are tied in the state trump must win electoral votes fortunately for most recent surveys show him actually leading in trump must win electoral votes at this point that is looking like it will be very tough to because all of the recent polls have leading in including the most recent one that has her up by points if trump can win those four that still does not get him to electoral votes it gets him to electoral and so he would still need one more state to win the most likely candidates for that last state are or unfortunately for appears to have big leads in all four of those states right at this moment but even if trump can somehow pull off a miracle and squeak past the electoral vote the truth is that could still mess everything up do you remember he was the third party conservative alternative candidate that was hyped for a couple of days but that seemingly fell off the map afterwards he is only on the ballot in but one of those states is and it turns out that is a many believe that a will be elected president someday when the constitution hangs like a thread according to this this president will turn the country around and all sorts of wonderful things will start to happen many thought that mitt was going to be this but now has become the target of these expectations so how in the world could become their plan is to have win and that could potentially keep both trump and from both getting to electoral votes if the election is super close if that the election would be thrown into the house of representatives it is being projected that the house will still be controlled by the republicans after this

think is the state of perception that stops people making a difference you can only make a difference in a world of uniformity if you operate outside of that uniformity we either take that on or we in

the reptilian deity the ruling the the royal the presidents and prime ministers have created the illusion of being separate ruling bodies when in fact they have always been on the same team of sorts there is a bloodline that has been strategically kept intact for ages the peerage and a comprehensive aristocratic genealogy reveals that all presidents have carried royal bloodlines into office over the course of history this includes bill the bush family john and so on and so forth portion of the global elites family tree if we truly live in a democratic how is it that every single person brought into office has been of and royal what are the chances of this considering the fought for their independence of in the the peerage makes a strong suggestion that elections are not really based on a public voting but rather they are based upon the highest percentage of royal make things even more peculiar is the fact that brad and tom hanks of biggest also descend from this lineage what could all of this goes on to illuminate the theory of quantum which states that our physical reality is a projection within our and that at the most basic quantum the solidity of matter is existing as vibrations instead of the light from matter reflects into our the cells pick up the light travels as a wavelength measured from the visible light and transmutes the vibrations or into an image within the brain this is the same for it is a vibration until it is decoded by the brain the matrix plot seem so the human brain can only see an extremely limited spectrum of as we know there are a plethora of different forms of energy in our universe and thousands of different frequencies around us at any given moment that we cannot such as radio and radiation waves suggests that and other beings exist in our but they operate at a frequency just above what the human mind is said to be able to this could explain the strange sightings of that seem to appear and disappear in an it be that the or are advanced enough that they can raise or lower their frequency to come in and out of the visible light frequency this is something that says the ruling elite are aware knowledge that is used to manipulate mankind into thinking that our experience is limited to a says the reptilians control the globalists through the manipulation of human it is no secret today that the world is ruled

archives on television reasons why starting world war in the middle east is a really bad idea by on august while most of the country is obsessing over the administration is preparing a military attack against which has the potential of starting world war in it is being reported that cruise missile strikes could begin as early as the administration is pledging that the strikes will be but what happens when the fight what happens if they sink a naval vessel or they have agents start hitting targets inside the united then we would have a war on our hands and what happens if the decide to retaliate by hitting if missiles start raining down on tel will be extremely tempted to absolutely flatten and they are more than capable of doing precisely that and of course and are not likely to just sit idly by as their close ally is battered into oblivion we are looking at a scenario where the entire middle east could be set and that might only be just the beginning and china are sternly warning the government not to get involved in and by starting a war with we will do an extraordinary amount of damage to our relationships with those two global superpowers could this be the beginning of a chain of events that could eventually lead to a massive global conflict with and china on one side and the united states on the of course it will not happen but i fear that what is happening now is setting the stage for some really bad things the following are reasons why starting world war in the middle east is a really bad idea the people are overwhelmingly against going to war with strongly oppose intervention in civil war and believe should stay out of the conflict even if reports that government used deadly chemicals to attack civilians are a poll says about percent of surveyed said the united states should not intervene in civil while just percent thought president should act at this a war in is even more unpopular with the people than congress is the administration has not gotten approval to go to war with from congress as the constitution requires the united states does not have the approval of the united nations to attack and it is not going to be getting it has said that it will use all means available to defend itself if the united states attacks would that include terror attacks in the united states foreign minister made the following statement on have two either to or to defend ourselves with the means at our disposal the second choice is the we will defend ourselves has just sent their most advanced missiles to what do you think would happen if images of sinking naval vessels were to come flashing across our television when the united states attacks there is a very good chance that will attack just check out what one official said member of the national council until recently the propaganda ministers said on that views as behind the aggression and therefore it will come under fire should be attacked by the united states in an interview for the radio station in president fellow party member we have strategic weapons and we can retaliate the strategic weapons are aimed at stressed that the threats will not influence the regime and added that if the us or err through aggression and exploit the chemical the region will go up in endless affecting not only the areas but the worlds if attacks the consequences could be absolutely catastrophic prime minister is promising that any attack will be responded to are not a party to this civil war in but if we identify any attempt to attack us we will respond and we will respond forcefully will likely do whatever it can to fight for the survival of the regime that could include striking targets inside both the united states and closest ally is will sit idly by as their closest ally is removed from the starting a war with will cause significant damage to our relationship with on deputy prime minister said that the west is acting like a monkey with a hand grenade starting a war with will cause significant damage to our relationship with china and what will happen if the decide to start dumping the massive amount of debt that it is interest rates would absolutely skyrocket and we would rapidly be facing a nightmare scenario and have compiled some startling evidence that it was actually the rebels that the is supporting that were responsible for the chemical weapons attack that is being used as justification to go to war with with the assistance of former member and native has assembled evidence from various middle eastern sources that cast doubt on administration claims the government is responsible for last weeks attack you can examine the evidence for yourself right here as pat recently it would have made absolutely no sense for the regime to use chemical weapons on defenseless women and children the only people who would benefit from such an attack would be the rebels the basic question that needs to be asked about this horrific attack on which appears to be gas to whose benefit would the use of nerve gas on women and children certainly not as we can see from the furor and threats against him that the use of gas has produced the sole beneficiary of this apparent use of poison gas against civilians in territory appears to be the who have long sought to have us come in and fight their war if the really want to topple the regime they should do it themselves they should not expect the united states to do their dirty work for them a former commander of central command has said that a attack on would result in a very serious war a war in the middle east will be bad
archives on television if trump he will be months and days old on his first full day in office by on a couple of weeks it looked like was all set to cruise to victory but now the has delivered an election miracle in the nick of time a few of my readers had criticized me for suggesting that trump might but i know who is going to win the and so all i had to go on was the hard numbers and a couple of weeks ago the hard numbers were telling me that was going to win of course it is entirely possible that the national polls might have been seriously but even the state polls in the most important battleground states consistently had bad news for trump so things look good for trump at the but now that the has renewed their investigation into emails the poll numbers have shifted dramatically in trumps favor it was not entirely clear what meant by that but it could potentially be smoking gun evidence of obstruction of justice if that choice turns out to be after everything that we have seen during this election i truly believe that we will have reached the point of no return as a nation
archives on television will delay or suspend the election if is forced out by the new email at this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen
on television election not money is being raised to challenge the election results in and just when you thought it was safe to celebrate trumps the left is hatching a plan to try to steal the election right from under his nose a group composed of prominent computer scientists and election lawyers is urgently asking the campaign to challenge the election results in and they claim that there is persuasive evidence that the election results in those states were manipulated or and they are pushing to file formal challenges to those results while there is still time to do so as i write this the final result in could still go either and if does end up winning all she would have to do would be to flip the results in and to become the next president of the united states many on the left are absolutely incensed that trump is going to be the next president even though it looks like is going to win the popular vote by a very wide margin in as i write this article lead in the popular vote has expanded to more than million votes after all of the votes have been it is entirely possible that may finish more than million votes ahead of trump in a desperate bid to try to salvage the an attempt is being made to push for recounts in the key swing states that lost this is being talked about all over the mainstream media but it was first reported by new is being urged by a group of prominent computer scientists and election lawyers to call for a recount in three swing states won by trump new has learned the which includes attorney john and j the director of the university of center for computer security and believes found persuasive evidence that results in and may have been manipulated or hacked the group is so far not speaking on the record about their findings and is focused on lobbying the team in private last the activists held a conference call with campaign chairman john and campaign general counsel to make their according to a source briefed on the call the academics presented findings showing that in received percent fewer votes in counties that relied on machines compared with counties that used optical scanners and paper ballots based on this statistical may have been denied as many as she lost by the race in is even and the truth is that may be able to close the gap of about votes there without a recount in the gap is currently about and so that would present much more of a challenge for the campaign at this point it is questionable whether is willing to formally request recounts in those states before the deadlines but she have to be the one to do it in according to another presidential candidate is already raising the money needed to submit her own requests for recounts in those key battleground states the green presidential is prepared to request recounts of the election result in several key battleground her campaign said on stein launched an page seeking donations toward a fund she said was needed to request reviews of the results in and stein said she was acting due to compelling evidence of voting anomalies and that data analysis had indicated significant discrepancies in vote totals but if stein wants to do she needs to act very quickly the deadline to officially file for a recount in is in it is and in it is next six former sanders supporters are engaged in a last ditch effort to use the electoral college to deny trump the presidency on just like the attempt to recount the votes in key battleground this plan is not likely to work but right now it is receiving a lot of attention from the mainstream media the following comes from a daily caller article entitled sanders electors vow to vote against in wild attempt to keep trump from white group asserts that in order to succeed in their they would have to convince republican electors to vote against a number the groups understands is unlikely the ultimate the group is to reduce the overall faith the average voter has in the electoral college system until the actual votes are it will be very difficult for either democrats or republicans to ascertain just how effective the movement because there is no organized whip effort to how many electors intend to vote they way they are instructed there is no remedy for a faithless elector it is extremely unlikely that republican electors would betray trump at this point what is far more likely is that these former sanders supporters will bring enough attention to faithless electors that it will cause an even bigger push to abolish the electoral college but because it would require changing the constitution in order to abolish the electoral it is something that is not likely to happen any time soon all of these last minute moves by the left seem destined to and there seem to be anything that they can do at this point to keep trump out of the white house and the truth is that so many of the things that i warn are coming to in my new book are far more likely to happen if trump is in the white house rather than if a democrat is residing there we have reached a critical moment in and right now optimism about the future of this country among conservatives is off the charts but is that optimism we shall but without a doubt this optimism is not shared by and many on the left are preparing to fight against trump every step of the way debt debts trump extreme pain intense pain lawyers pain painful trump commentary half of the population of the world is dirt poor and the global elite want to keep it that way man fear mongering its
when shall say peace and safety by on millions of are expecting a new golden age for under but is that what they are going to there is always optimism when a new president is but i know if i have ever seen anything like the euphoria that many trump supporters are expressing right now i voted for trump and i want him to be as successful as possible but when trump becomes our next president on that does not mean that all of the great problems that our nation is facing will somehow magically disappear if you listen to some they make it sound like is going to experience nothing but prosperity and blessing for decades to come i would love it if that was indeed going to be the but unfortunately that is simply not the truth we are currently on a path that leads to national and unless we change our ways it going to matter who is in the white house i keep hearing about how our new president is going to unify the but that is going to be extremely difficult to do considering the fact that we are now more divided than ever in a brand new survey found that an record high percent of all believe that we are greatly divided when it comes to the most important values i keep hearing about how we are now entering a golden age of peace and but how is that supposed to happen while we are still butchering millions of innocent children in our abortion i keep hearing about how the economy is about to take off like a but how is that possible when we have already been on the greatest debt binge in world history the only way we have been able to maintain our massively inflated standard of living is by piling up debt at a faster pace than any generation in history today we have accumulated trillion dollars in consumer corporate debt has doubled since the last financial and the national debt is rapidly approaching trillion dollars how can trump possibly pump up our standard of living with debt more than has already i keep hearing about how we are going to make great but how can we be great when we are producing more pornography than the rest of the world i keep hearing about how law and order is going to but meanwhile chaos has already been erupting in cities all over the nation and the far left is planning to turn inauguration day into a major riot i keep hearing about how things are going to go back to the way they used to but as i discussed in a previous article diseases are spreading at the fastest pace in the percentage of births out of wedlock is more than times higher than in and approximately two out of every three men watch pornography on a regular basis i keep hearing about how we are going to drain the and yet there are no plans to even reform the federal reserve system which is at the very heart of our financial problems as a nation i keep hearing about how good judges are going to be put on the supreme but how can we trust that when our new president just said that he is fine with the supreme court decision that forced all states to redefine the institution of i keep hearing about how we are going to be an example for the rest of the but how can we be an example when just about every form of evil imaginable is exploding in popularity inside our own i keep hearing about how our government is going to be but how can a government that gives hundreds of millions of dollars a year to planned parenthood be now that the republicans have control of the white the senate and the house of this is their golden opportunity to planned parenthood if it happen it probably will never and it will show what a complete and utter failure the republican party has become planned parenthood is an organization that has been caught on camera admitting that they harvest organs from the babies that they kill and that they sell those organs off to the highest bidder some would argue that is already great at a lot of things after the united states is number one in the world in television legal drug use and illegal drug use we lead the world in plastic eating disorder teen pregnancy and lawyers per capita we have the highest std infection rate in the industrialized the highest divorce rate in the industrialized and the largest prison population on the entire planet we also have the most complicated tax system in the entire the largest trade deficit in the entire and the largest national debt in the entire world so if we want to make great we sure have a lot of work to do the complacency that i am seeing out there right now really alarms me so many people seem to think that the battle is won because trump was victorious on election night but that is not even close to reality if we do not fundamentally change course as a nation we will not survive tinkering with tax regulations and trade agreements is not going to get the job done so many people are acting as if we just have a few cuts and when the reality is what our country really needs is major heart surgery trump is not some sort of a and even if he is able to accomplish every single thing that he is promising right now it will not nearly be enough but for the moment millions of are proclaiming peace and safety now that trump has won the and we shall see how it all turns out anxiety blessing trump national suicide peace safety successful suicide trump commentary we are being set up for
why is threatening with world war right before the on television we are being set up for higher interest a major recession and a giant stock market crash since trumps victory on election night we have seen the worst bond crash in years global bond investors have seen trillions of dollars of wealth wiped out since and analysts are warning of another tough week ahead the general consensus in the investing community is that a trump administration will mean much higher and as a result investors are already starting to demand higher interest rates unfortunately for all of history has shown that higher interest rates always cause an economic slowdown and this makes perfect because economic activity naturally slows down when it becomes more expensive to borrow money the administration had already set up the next president for a major recession but now this bond crash threatens to bring it on sooner rather than later for those that are not familiar with the bond when yields go up bond prices go down and when bond prices go that is bad news for economic growth so we generally want yields to go up yields have been absolutely soaring over the past couple of and the yield on year treasury notes has now jumped one full percentage point since treasury yield jumped to in late trading on the highest since up basis point since the and up one full percentage point since the yield is at a critical juncture in terms of the first thing that might happen is a rate increase by the fed in after a year of a slew of pronouncements by fed heads including relatively soon have pushed the odds of a rate hike to as i noted the other day so many things in our financial system are tied to yields on treasury notes just look at what is happening to mortgages as wolf has noted the average rate on year mortgages is shooting into the stratosphere if mortgage rates continue to shoot there will be another housing crash rates on auto credit cards and student loans will also be affected throughout our economic system it will become much more costly to borrow and that will inevitably slow the overall economy down why bond investors are so on edge these days is because of statements such as this one from a nascent administration that at random in its can seem to be not just a focused but almost a messianic like were going to build an entirely new political he says its everything related to jobs the conservatives are going to go crazy the guy pushing a infrastructure plan with negative interest rates throughout the its the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything ship iron get them all jacked up were just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks it will be as exciting as the greater than the revolution plus in an economic nationalist movement is going to be one of the most influential voices in the new trump and he is absolutely determined to get this trillion dollar infrastructure plan through congress and that is going to mean a lot more borrowing and a lot more spending for a government that is already on pace to add trillion dollars to the national debt this fiscal year all of this comes at a time when the economy is already starting to show significant signs of slowing down it is being projected that we will see a sixth straight decline in earnings for the and industrial production has now contracted for months in a row the truth is that the economy has been barely treading water for quite some time and it going to take much to push us over the edge the following comes from lance an economy running at below consumers already heavily wage growth weak for the bulk of there is not a lot of wiggle room for policy mistakes the stock market soared immediately following trumps but it because economic conditions actually improved if you look at a stock market crash almost always follows a major bond crash so if bond prices keep declining rapidly that is going to be a very ominous sign for stock traders and history has also shown us that no bull market can survive a major recession if the economy suffers a major downturn early in the trump it is inevitable that stock prices will follow the waning days of the administration have set us up perfectly for higher interest a major recession and a giant stock market crash of course any problems that occur after will be blamed on but the truth is that will be far more responsible for what happens than trump will be right now so many people have been lulled into a sense of complacency because trump won the election that is an enormous mistake a shaking has already begun in the financial and this shaking could easily become an avalanche now is not a time to party it is time to batten down the hatches and to prepare for very rough seas ahead all of the things that so many experts warned were coming may have been delayed but without a doubt they are still on the way so get prepared while you still because time is running out
derrick writes that with each passing more compromising of national and scams and general malfeasance on the part of come to light via new data dumps but the news medias obsession with things trump has said consistently overshadows things has actually done revelations have now surfaced that backed the debt relief bill a plan to help the financially struggling commonwealth deal with a billion debt it managed to rack after a top who just happens to be a lobbyist for the treasury emailed his brother to discuss the situation who is this none other than john chairman of the campaign the tony has been by the treasury department has paid campaign chairmans brothers firm nearly two million the email in question is from march at that point treasury had already paid the the million since enlisting the firms whatever those in how does a government billion in debt cough up million to pay a consultancy and what consulting or services was that firm specifically tony serving as president of the emailed his brother with a subject line of the body of the email can you call me today re pr need advice not action at the time tony and other lobbyists in the firm were pushing for passage of congressional legislation to allow to restructure its debt through a chapter bankruptcy filing a few months after the email between the officially backed congressional legislation authorizing chapter proceedings amazing timing so formally backed legislation to relieve of billions of dollars in debt after her campaign managers brother emailed him seeking advice and after his client had paid him million for services what could those services could they be using ones connections in to help see to it the passage of a debt relief bill is if this sound like influence read on in addition to being her campaign managers tony is a donor and according to federal election commission filings he has provided reportable bundled contributions of about for the campaign he has also donated between and to surprise the foundation is there anyone too shady for this foundation to accept cash how many instances of cash contributions to the foundation in exchange for allegedly have there been one can barely keep track we also just learned through that the government of gave the foundation a million check for bills birthday why would a foreign any foreign let alone one in the middle give a million dollars as a birthday the payoffs and general level of suspicious activity that surrounds this couple is astounding exactly what the talked about but other hacked emails show that specifically asked her staff to craft public statements in support of debt relief after the brothers apparently discussed the but before publicly backed chapter proceedings could it be that some of that million made it into foundation bank congress eventually passed and the president signed a debt relief package as of this neither the campaign nor the group had responded to requests for additional information this exchange typifies exactly what trump has tapped into believe there is so much so much so many snakes in the grasses around that everyone is on the everyone is into someones pockets and the entire brood is wallowing around in the muck of politics having hacked john email account and putting this information into the public domain only confirms the suspicions of course the other suspicion is that our mainstream media is equally corrupt and will not cover stories like this one the public is mostly right on both counts

as was predicted by opponents from the has begun to owing to high costs brought on by government planners questions and what on former president bill in a series of unexpected and perhaps unscripted comments while stumping on behalf of his wifes presidential campaign in took the political world by surprise when he singled out care for scathing criticism got this crazy system where all of a million more people have health and then the people who are out there busting sometimes hours a wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half and its the craziest thing in the told a crowd of supporters he added that the current system works fine if eligible for if a working if already on or if you get enough subsidies on a modest income that you can afford your health care but care is hurting the very people it was intended to pointing out that the people getting killed in this deal are the people and individuals who make just a little bit too much to get any of these subsidies during bill own presidency a generation was put in charge of creating a system of socialized medicine an effort that met with political failure the have long been ardent public supporters of socialized medicine socialism in what would prompt bill to attack during a heated presidential have the failings of disastrous experiment in socialized medicine become so obvious that even democrats now want to distance themselves from in a yes since its full earlier in the affordable care act has as its many detractors have been predicting for years inflicted critical damage on an already creaky system and ruined coverage for tens of millions of as noted the middle and owners and their employees have borne the brunt of the although no one but the few who can afford to pay out of pocket for have been unaffected by premiums have skyrocketed alongside deductibles and while president most quotable promise that who liked their care health coverage could keep it has been as millions promptly lost their coverage or endured deep cuts in benefits and soaring costs with their existing coverage in a has been a scourge on the already troubled a monumental political and economic mistake that has been a major contributor to our continuing economic more than eight years after the onset of the great recession sticker shock one of the concerns that was supposed to address was rising which had outpaced wage increases for years during the period from to for premiums rose an average of while wages increased by only percent figures such as these buoyed president and other supporters of socialized and were a crucial factor leading to the passage of in yet in the first year after premium costs soared by an additional and by the increase over five years was a whopping additional while wages only grew by percent during that same period while some of the depressed wages were certainly attributable to the great recession and its seemingly it has become embarrassingly clear that care has done nothing to halt the rise in premium costs with open enrollment in slated to begin in politically far more damaging consequence has dominated the news in recent the soaring cost of premiums in many states during the last week in the election season was roiled by news that the price of premiums will rise on average percent in with many areas experiencing significantly greater price hikes which will be among the will experience a whopping percent increase in its silver for which a hypothetical paying per month in will be paying in the administration has tried to downplay this latest round of sticker with glib assurances that eight out of beneficiaries will qualify for subsidies under the terms of the named affordable care act of the department of health and human services rushed to assure customers that the government will cover the difference for most of issuers were pricing for a completely new one where they could no longer exclude those with the most serious health many set prices that turned out to be too low not only do tax credits bring down the cost of they adjust dollar for dollar with the cost of the benchmark plan in your area so even if the cost of benchmark coverage goes most consumers will not have to pay more in other the market got pricing wrong at the but now the in its will fix everything has indicated that our hypothetical young in a silver plan will qualify for government subsidies of about per month if his annual income is or so if he makes more than the subsidy will be much less left unsaid in all the posturing and spin is how the government is going to pay for all the new subsidies that the disastrous rise in premium costs has made necessary the of will ultimately be higher and public coupled with further contractions of benefits another development unanticipated by the administration has been the veritable stampede of providers and insurers out of as early as insurance company announced that it was opting out of in a number of including the corporation is and other major such as blue cross and united health have also pulled out of exchanges in and elsewhere as the health insurance market continues to contract under centralized control many of the nations top hospitals and clinics are either opting out of or being very selective in the policies for which they will accept coverage with the beginning of open enrollment in many such as will be left with only one or two insurance providers participating in leaving consumers little or no choice on the number of options available to customers will decline by about a with competition declining in all but four states that participate in exchange is a fairly typical example of the dizzying decline of in the grand canyon the number of options available will

email as election day democratic nominee knows that she must be able to count on the votes of the black a bloc that has been a reliable democratic constituency for decades in light of some of the revelations in the the campaign is worried that they may actually have a fight on their hands on for the support of even president senses the danger in an article covering a campaign stop in north

data in north shows blacks have cast fewer ballots than at this point four years when lost the state by about votes aides note that officials there reduced early voting sites for the initial week of early and they say they can make up the difference by election day now that more sites are opening black voters share of early ballots request is also down a few percentage points in and though the campaign points to strong early turnout in key urban counties with large numbers of blacks and it not as if is just sitting trusting that blacks will show up for her on election day she attacking her republican calling him a threat to the black community from her campaign is broadcasting an ad on radio stations hailing the former secretary of state as fighting for in contrast to trump demeaning our community a female voice in the ad listen to how he talks about us one audio clip has trump singling out a black supporter at a rally in look at my over he said in trump lambasted as the most ignorant president in our history there is that some black voters are focused less on what trump said about president in a stump speech and more on what said about when she thought no one was listening black conservatives fund a organization dedicated to representing the views of just launched a targeted paid media campaign intended to reach minority millennial voters in swing states who are still considering the qualities of the two major party candidates running for the white house their advertising features two spots highlighting democratic party nominee previous comments expressing contempt for black calling them and claiming make up her firewall against senator sanders in the primary the features the candidates comments where she was caught using racially divisive undertones to champion a bill that ultimately locked up a generation of black men the ad also uses footage of her with black lives matter protesters were not just the only conservative group going after black voters on television were the only black conservatives fund senior adviser said with a television buy in and north the ad is supplemented by a sizable digital buy that spans across and highly targeted web publications the cable time has been reserved across and networks in these states the digital ad buy stretches into at least three other states not being targeted on television in

black voters that would cause substantial media furor if such statements were made by a republican presidential hopeful make no our aim to suppress votes were telling black voters to make sure they participate in this but they need to remember what thinks of said we are confident that our message will have significant since democrats have neglected advertising to them this cycle message might be reaching the right as even the new times has reported that early voting among blacks is down in key states and that this electoral anomaly might turn out to be in a coal indicating that black voters are as monolithic or as easily duped as the campaign and the thinks they are from the times article published on are failing to vote at the robust levels they did four years ago in several states that

this post was originally published on this site institute of oriental studies under the academy of sciences presented a devastating report about the lies of the western mainstream media about but this damning report is not getting the attention it deserves by the mainstream media in the west that come as a surprise there are many facts in the institutes report that would make sensations in the and the had they unmasked the and not the media falsifications in a similar there was a whole media frenzy in the us and media in when a television channel released an interview with a woman refugee from the rebellious eastern who provided the unconfirmed report about a local boy being crucified by government troops in its proved much intentional falsifications on the side of the western media reports about for report proves the falsity of a news item published in the daily express on at the very start of air forces operation against terrorists in on an invitation from the government the report said that a air strike on destroyed a mosque in the town of which was taken from government forces by insurgents earlier this year having studied the photos of the made from the planes on the researchers from institute of oriental studies proved beyond any reasonable doubt that the mosque in remained intact in the end of the it had been intact during all of the specialists on studies from say they proved that the daily express simply provided unverified information from the local opposition activists the information on bombing was also cited by the daily as well as other and global media the institute for oriental studies made an important observation accusing of not bombing the so called state and thus not damaging the terrorists the western mainstream media has not been providing its readers adequate information on groups in the some of them no less dangerous than the for the daily telegraph reported on that same day that continued their aerial bombardment on targets included and areas under the control of the army of an alliance of groups which have won significant victories against the regime this year reporting from the same the telegraph actually names the groups which express called rather vaguely insurgents these were actually very dangerous terrorist groups of and the army of conquest they are often cited as terrorist groups by international human rights some of their members are accused of mistreating the people who work in human rights groups will you report our when the director of the institute for oriental was presenting the findings of his colleagues at the press center of information he was asked a question by a journalist from the official will the western media publish what you found or will they keep reporting the same stuff about who had just been asked a question on his institutes report by a female correspondent of the financial readdressed question to her there is so much news and i am not yet in my answered i am not sure we shall report on your findings i know you professor smiling bitterly according to policy in has become a target of a deliberate disinformation attack from the western especially after the presence of air force near was unveiled in why is the western media attacking us so asked rhetorically during his press conference because the process of national reconciliation is under way in and this process is main purpose in that on the par only with the imperative of damaging destroying the so called state the western media indeed want to achieve its misrepresenting our countries priorities as support for the regime or a proxy war against the western mainstream medias in their the experts of institute for oriental studies noted that some of the western myths about the civil war in are debunked by the western media itself in its rare moments of truth for at the beginning of the civil war in the western media kept saying there were no terrorists among the opposition fighters and that the opposition force was not including foreign mercenaries but on august the new times and reported from the zone of operations that the groups in now include more than foreigners the also reported then that the areas controlled by the opposition and previously described as liberated by the western mainstream may be developing into one of the biggest terrorist threats in the world today they were in the final stages of becoming a prominent us economist and mentor of the liberal reformer wrote already in on the western governments pursuit of a violent overthrow of president without their regime would most likely have remained with their has become a site of mass death and destruction the of the post back in penned an article headlined eerie parallel to in wrote certain truths which the post is now trying to make its readers in as in officers are operating helping insurgents improve their command and control and engaging in other activities weapons are coming from third parties they came mostly from china and in they are mainly brought from the black and the major financier for both insurgencies has been does one need to remind the reader how the insurgents in ultimately turned their weapons against the very people who procured writes about this development in his own article in the post this victory opened the way for decades of chaos and and extremism that are still menacing its neighbors and even the united states having read one listens with special attention to the warning of professor who concludes his presentation with the following we are in fact in the same trench with the facing the same global threat of terrorism the problem is that the western leaders are simply too slow to understand this one could not put it better was

views comments guest posts by my friend roger is a staunch democrat supporter he is in his seventies and has always voted democrat him and i have had countless discussions over the many years that we have known each other his paternal roots are and he sees himself to be on the left side of but of him and i have not been able to see on the race to the issue he is with the view that has inherited a financial and military disaster and did the best he and that he should not be blamed for his failure to perform as many did after his elaborate and successful yes we can slogan he supported and other domestic reform and this is perhaps where roger and i stop to agree and start to disagree including look at the appalling record of the republican party and try to paint a tainted image of it the party that is affectionately called the grand old party or the by its own staunch supporters certainly has enough such records to put it up there with charges of global mayhem and genocide the has given birth to people like the and of who can forget is another character that comes to one that no thinking man could trust with a a federal senator who commands authority that no one seems to be able to either understand the mandate or challenge at the end of the infamous line republican well at least thus enter trump and what a character he need one say god forbid if this article may be read like a defense of the the is run by the rich and the and as described by w bush by the haves and have more it is the party of dick who saw in an opportunity to generate contracts for if tens of hundreds of thousands of had to die for him to achieve his he would not and did not blink this is the party that condones and feeds it is the party that has huge control over the media it is the party that runs the world like it is a business enterprise and whether the rest of the world likes it or until the current global status quo no political party in the world affects the rest of the world like the ruling party in the united states whilst elections in other countries are domestic affairs that affect domestic politics of the country elections have implications that are not only domestically but have a much further global reach that encompasses every corner of the world as a i am much more concerned about the wider global implications of politics than the domestic ones this is not to say that i am indifferent about and the people as a matter of not only do i have close friends who live in but also close family members and i have grave concerns for all mankind in every corner of the by my interest in politics remains focused on foreign policy and to this i am only able to relate to the choice between the major two parties from the perspective of their foreign policies as insists to be the world police and the a stature many are refusing to accept that they have already it must accept what comes with it and concede that the rest of the world is hoping that the people will choose the better candidate as the new or should i say the one who is less harmful to the world in between and who fits the this is the question enough has been recently said about health to write a horror novel her and alleged recent case of pneumonia have made headlines as if not bigger than her infamous hidden allegations of involvement in the murder of an ambassador and even selling arms to very recently the issue of the emails is resurfacing and very late in the perhaps late enough to serve with a knock out her zeal to reach the seems to have been in her mind even before bills scandal back in was prepared to publicly support appear to forgive him and move because she had a bigger fish to the she somehow managed to hush down all other sex allegations against all the and trying to score mileage from similar allegations against trump her unabated lust for power will not stop at anything for as long as she ends up at the the first female even if she has to be commander in chief from behind the control button of a wheelchair there are even observations and allegations that many people who have campaigned against her have died under suspicious circumstances whether this mystery is going to be taken up by main stream media just on the eve of the elections to serve her with yet another knock out remains to be seen her uncontrollable laughs and hysterical facial expressions leave many questions unanswered in between the two front runners and it is hard to say that she presents herself as the sane and rational choice is there a distinction on foreign affairs perhaps but not historically for some the republican party is seen as the party of the hawks and the democrats are seen as the doves but are to answer this question in an unbiased we ought to look back at history notwithstanding the history of the the father and the and what is really the history of the democratic a few landmark historical decisions make it very clear so let us start with current events before we dwell into recent history that some might have chosen to forget the war on was the brainless child of the a spring that was heralded by the visit of an president to and a speech he made to clergy at university the presidents name is and he is a democrat speech was a subtle endorsement for the and to be specific to the street

multimedia science technology if you are a gun especially one who carries a firearm on a daily probably wondered how you would fare if you had to use your weapon in a situation could you hit a moving would you freeze under would you accidentally harm innocent bystanders in your attempt to take down a with virtual simulation you can find out the answers to these questions there are some awesome stories out there in about armed citizens stopping crimes and protecting lives in a life or death situation like a mass shooting each second counts and a firearm can level the playing field and give you a much better chance at surviving than the standard liberal wisdom of hiding and praying as a growing number of homes have guns now at most recent tally it seems like these life and death situations are happening more as acts of civil and mindless violence continue to plague our country the qualifications for a concealed carry permit vary from state to but generally you have to take a course that ranges anywhere from hours to hours some states require range qualification and others do not the course that you take is very informative it explains the laws in regard to using your firearm for protection in your particular state does that really mean that you will be ready to use your firearm in an emergency i am a permit holder in the state of i am a single mom and i fully intend to be able to protect my family without being powerless until the police arrive i practice shooting regularly and take classes with an instructor read many books on the topic of carrying my firearm i highly recommend this one i have had occasion to be very glad that i was armed but never had reason to actually use my gun against someone and that is something which is little understood by most gun owners have our guns if we need but we sincerely hope to never need them of this makes you do you really have what it takes to use your firearm to protect yourself or someone is the training been doing and how do you find out before the rubber meets the the pros have been using virtual simulation training for quite a while training simulations are one way to learn a skill that is too dangerous to perform for real both the police and the military use virtual reality simulations for training the us army website says this system gives the power of simulation to the squad in order to close the gap of individual soldier training and collective said john project assistant project manager for close combat tactical trainers this system enhances it does not replace it the ability to train with this system allows the reset time to be cut which allows the ability to get more repetitions in a shorter amount of time and the ability to review each mission on a television screen to enhance the after action review process upon completion of each mission with a wide variety of and the ability to insert specific entities into the the options for training opportunities are virtually rehearsals for missions or exercises are just a couple of examples the programmed training environments include and desert these are intended to simulate places like and but are not limited to only these specific scenarios virtual reality training allows soldiers and police officers to face situations in a multitude of environments with as many different scenarios as you could possibly imagine and it all training with either users can deploy virtual weapons like and making this a good way to test out alternatives to lethal force without putting lives at risk virtual simulation training is now available for civilians my firearms instructor is incredibly innovative you are anywhere near you can find her here when she discovered a virtual simulation facility within an hour of she invited me along to try it out we headed to virtual safe shot in fair the training for civilians is quite different a strong emphasis of this training is on shoot scenarios not all situations require that your firearm be discharged and because the instructors mix up the you know whether to expect a kid to pop around the corner of your basement stairs or a drug addict and that how it is in real some scenarios that were addressed in the training i took read like a persons worst a convenience store robbery a mass shooter at a school a carjacking surprising a burglar in your home a ex who is intent on killing your neighbor anyone can imagine being caught up in one of these scenes because taken directly from the headlines even though you know the situation real and that your life is not in you get a surge of adrenaline you know something is going but you know what to expect everything that happens fast the guns at the facility are real that have been modified to shoot only harmless lasers the recoil is driven so you get the feel of shooting a gun with real ammo this means that you must quickly reacquire your target if a second shot is needed beginners work with stationary targets and replica while advanced shooters practice simulations in which they must draw their verbally take and shoot from a covered position the accuracy of this technology is pixels that means if you show a

by on occidental observer the dismantling of the jungle refugee camp has been marked by huge scenes of disorder with at least one gang rape and much of the camp going up in flames but there has been uproar in too since the that most of the thousands of child refugees which the prime minister had agreed to were neither children nor refugees from the moment these strapping adult male migrants stepped off the bus in it was obvious that the people had been subjected to yet another massive immigration deception those who enabled and this child refugee scam are brazening it safe in the knowledge there will be no comebacks for them first they attempted to prevent any more embarrassing pictures by throwing blankets over the arrivals so they resembled state witnesses at a mafia trial then a screened walkway from the bus alighting point to the door of the reception was erected overnight for the same purpose dental tests to determine the real age of these youths were ruled out as an invasion of privacy and there is no question of having them so nothing can be done now here get over it but of it all works better if there is no from the public so the have resorted to the tried and tested method of stifling dissent anyone who sticks his head above the parapet to raise doubts is subjected to stern lectures about their moral shortcomings presenter chastised his fellow for their shameful while shadow home secretary abbot t attacked those who wanted to carry out dental tests to assess their age as racist pop singer lily became a media darling on behalf of the people of she made a tearful apology to the refugees for causing their plight let that sink in caused the plight of the refugees after voting for for ordinary who have seen their hospitals and welfare services strained to breaking a fresh influx of immigrants was not exactly what they had been looking forward to after has no legal or moral obligation to take these people they were supposed to be the responsibility of the first country they arrived at in the and why are they coming to racist its incredibly of them why not go to some or or this fresh burden will be placed squarely on the local authorities that receive the and they are going to have to dig deeply while the government is providing per annum for each young the total annual cost is around so tax increases or reduced services in other areas are predicted naturally little of this will fall on the prosperous boroughs filled with morally uplifted whites instead many migrants are being located in areas such as or poorer northern communities already thronging with such as the tipping point in the long battle to admit these bogus child refugees seems to have been a initiative in which more than religious leaders led by the former archbishop of lord and senior representatives from the and faiths signed a letter urging the prime minister to admit in a speech at a lord described the camp as a stain on the conscience but in this alleged support was not what it appeared to be it was largely by dozens of activists working through an called citizens that the casework and poured substantial resources into ensuring that the necessary amendments to the law would make it through parliament the jungle crisis has brought the community together in a unity of purpose rarely seen outside the occasion of various wars from the highest communal levels to the smallest youth it seems everyone has been in the cause of getting economic migrants into it is a campaign they have chosen to frame in entirely moral terms the loud insistence has been that not only is under a strict moral obligation to take these migrants but that there should be no upper limit to do otherwise would be to undermine our reputation as a humanitarian country that wishes to describe itself as their arguments have been formed around highly emotional anecdotes and images time and again we have been treated to stories of children struggling in the squalor at the jungle camp the iconic photographs of the lifeless body of boy washed up on a beach are frequently invoked you will notice that nowhere is there any consideration of the stress this is causing on existing especially those in the poorer areas where refugees are invariably housed nor is there any recognition of the profound unfairness this imposes on the native white community who will be required to support these strangers via the welfare health and housing services such a process is not only it makes a mockery of the basic idea that help from the welfare state is in return from previous tax contributions there is a largely unspoken reason for resentment over perceived inadequacy in admitting refugees before world war ii in admitted many tens of thousands of in the but it is an article of faith amongst many that could and should have admitted many more typical of this attitude was the speech of rabbi founder of the forum he says he lost over relatives in the holocaust and implied that wartime attitudes to refugees were to blame for this i feel obliged to ensure we make the same he said numerous references were made to the by which children from were smuggled into too has already debunked much of this greatly a veteran of that same is the figurehead for the refugee crusade year old lord dubs a veteran politician he has tirelessly campaigned for mass immigration all his life a former director of the refugee he somehow arrived in aged six in despite horrendous attitudes at the and was shown much charity since he has

talk to a couple of weeks ago rather than the regime but the will make no difference nor will the john oddly fears of smashed to smithereens originally an word have the slightest effect yet the government still hopes more civilians too will leave the besieged east and allow it to reabsorb the enclave without another war everything depends right now on three the commander of the the head of

first days two of them were wounded by snipers one of the video clips shows a apparently fired from eastern exploding in the background as two men run from the east to the army lines the general thought there were only civilians left in eastern an intriguing figure since the number of trapped families in the enclave have moved between and according to various experts the believes the higher a army officer on the front line suggested another far more senior intelligence officer thought the party guessed between to all of which proves that no one neither the the or journalists has the slightest idea of just how many souls are waiting to be saved or to die we promised to take care of the the general announced we did the people who came across were free to go and live with their

officers ran into his office with aerial photographs presumably the work of a drone and his attention suddenly turned to more pressing matters there are armed men crossing from turkey through the border point to the north of which showed just how far the generals remit ran in northern and they are driving a lot of vehicles with explosives and ammunition we search for a political solution and they are ready to attack and fight but would the and bomb east there are orders that the planes cannot bomb within of eastern the general replied an interesting since the general is the man who orders the air strikes along with his of course and he followed up with a slightly ambiguous remark when i asked for his feelings when he saw the wounded children of east on television i see them as like my he replied i have a very high sense of humanity with civilians but with i have to do my national duty to defend the civilians and protect them the terrorists and the general thought there were separate armed groups in eastern are the same wherever they exist in perhaps but the general also made a remark about medical facilities for terrorists which suggested that hospitals who treated militiamen in east were targets for the whomever else the hospitals treated which also tells its own grim tale so now to the headquarters in bathed in generator light and sudden power where the local party described how he talked to east civilians by claiming that through these interlocutors he has contact with civilians in the enclave and negotiations were he said the group had indirectly received a message from the government via text and they replied by recorded phone the governments message was that they could send over a group of their men if they wanted to cross to the west of the city as a test just two if they wanted and these two could telephone when they arrived through the government lines and reached a safe place they we trust but we trust the government or the security

posted on tweet via in august prime minister had formed a task force to plan for the next three this was followed by our mainstream media writing the usual things the task force should do to improve sports ways can ensure a better showing at how to win medals by or can get you medals in if you spend rs kind of stuff two months down the all is forgotten since we are not a satire site but a serious it was against our ethos to jump the gun and write such an article instead we have done painstaking research for the last months and come up with our suggestions here are our due to our colonial cricket dominates the sporting scene in cricket in its purest form was meant for the aristocratic families of england who had nothing better to do with their time and wanted a game which would keep them occupied for days it is not suitable for common working class who have to earn a living was once the superpower in hockey and there is no reason why we cannot be once again our create a social media campaign to boycott cricket force organizations who sponsor cricket to donate at least rupees for sponsoring other sports impose hefty fines on cricket commentators force to do commentary for hockey and matches it is common to find people in and the surrounding region flaunting their power and influence one has often heard the phrase flaunted by these folks this craving for recognition through power has prompted several impressionable kids in the region to take up aggressive sports to flaunt their power just look at the number of medalists from the region who have won medals in aggressive shooting and wrestling wrestling wrestling who won the bronze in shooting in was brought up in and but his parents hail from the region which explains it the ripple effect from is so strong that even from neighboring won silver medal for shooting in poor found it difficult to practice a sport like badminton in and had to shift to to become a champion and win a bronze medal in our channelize the aggressive and power flaunting energy of the kids early on and we can be assured of a few medals from here in every eastern and southern has produced many medalists like in in in tennis and p v and in badminton along with the likes of who show a promise in a sport where was never in the reckoning our just provide encouragement and things will improve our intellectuals and elites attribute the poor showing of to poverty but then what explains western poor show considering that it has two of the most prosperous and the last medal a person from won at the was in wrestling in but then is home to cricket legends like and of course the cricket commentary of this explains it but what about we are not mainstream media and we do not claim to have expertise on everything and we admit we do not have the answer but the mainstream media which questioned on everything else has kept quiet about this our we do not have an answer to this but we will not keep quiet like the mainstream media why did not produce a single medal will given that the elites blame the lack of facilities in our country for our poor show in what stops the kids of these elites from excelling at with cheap skilled manpower to they should have done well the elites believe in a sense of entitlement and are not willing to work hard sport is a meritocratic activity and only performance matters that is the reason sport is one stream in which is dynasty except for brave exceptions like who are willing to fight against all odds a friendly media and intellectuals ecosystem can make a failed politician look a failed actor a superstar or a news trader a journalist but this ecosystem cannot make a cricket duck look like a cricket century this explains why the son of one of greatest khan who captained cricket team despite having vision in only one chose his mothers profession rather than his fathers his biggest sporting achievement to date remains winning a meters sprint in an macho ad you also know why the daughter of chose acting or why the son of chose journalism of there are exceptions like who went on to become a tennis star despite his father being a member of hockey team and mother being member of basketball team he is also wise in that he choose tennis over hockey or basketball given his ability to get in trouble with his doubles may it be or one wonders how he would have fared in basketball or hockey which has a team of more than players our lack of facilities is not an at least for the elites every other boy wants to become a cricketer for those boys who look beyond analysis of winners show that men have only won in hockey and aggressive sports like boxing and except for in who was anyway born to parents and moved to soon after winning the medals of course is an exception but we already told you why he did not play hockey and also how aggressive he is even towards his partners our do not expect anything from men beyond hockey and aggressive sports compared to women have won medals in a variety of sports and have been very such as in and p v in in boxing and in wrestling the fact that women got opportunity to train and win in sports like boxing and wrestling that are considered the domain of men show how fake the propaganda of the feminist intellectuals is these feminists intellectuals will form stereotypes based on their opinions and peddle it as facts being into responsible we cannot do that so we decided to explore an angle we

here something interesting from the review recipient name recipient email as the army advanced further into east fighters responded by firing mortar shells into the district that had been freed earlier in the week we met the families fleeing the mortar barrage crammed into their battered cars and at an army checkpoint at a dozen miles down the road we had been told we could not go any further because it was too dangerous and fighters were firing at the road not far ahead between and we thought we had got rid of and then they started firing mortars at said one woman in black robes she added that a rocket had landed on her house in the morning and killed him and three women she expressed hatred for and said that when soldiers had knocked at her door and asked for information about her small son who looked about had gone to show them the nearest headquarters the people escaping from the eastern side of give a convincing picture of what is happening there as the army moves forward a former metal worker but jobless since captured in said that the shelling had started at and had gone on for an hour he had put his wife and seven children into their car and driven out of the city without much idea of where they were so long as it was safe confirmed reports that were withdrawing from the eastern side of which is separated from the western side by the river they are leaving some two or three fighting positions behind in every district and the fighters there are being he said all the local fighters were leaving and those who stayed behind were foreign members of

smoke from they send you off to be whipped there is no doubt that the great majority of people in will be glad to get rid of with its subjugation of women and religious bigotry but it is not at all clear what comes next is likely to lose but it will not go wholly out of business in or anywhere else it is already resorting to guerrilla raids such as one today when a group of fighters took over a mosque and part of the town of miles south of and were resisting they did the same in last month when fighters mysteriously invaded the of the oil city but the effect of the recapture of the second largest city in on the morale and capacity of should be great will no longer have the human and financial resources of the at its peak a powerful administrative to support its campaign of slaughter at home and abroad the very fact of defeat is likely to be damaging for a movement that claimed its victories were divinely inspired another point seldom noticed will make it difficult for to revert to guerrilla warfare of the type that it has waged in the past the secret network of supporters and helpers that once sustained in and in its early no longer exists when became the ruler of the area where it had previously had a hidden its local activists came out of hiding and became the new rulers but with on the retreat and losing its its old guerrilla networks are paying a price for becoming too visible during their day of triumph may be but this does not mean that it is no longer to be feared security may be greater for the minorities living in the the flat land east of city that was once home to half a million people who might be speak their own language and mostly or the security for these people has but only by comparison with what went before when they were persecuted and driven out by the television pictures since the offensive began on are deceptively similar to newsreel of villagers greeting allied armies in in the media is full of talk of the liberation of and the surrounding comments one expert on the area i will not speak about liberation until the displaced and especially the powerless are able to go back to their homes and live in peace and with a credible guarantee of security there were no signs of any such guarantee being given anywhere on the plain today people who wanted to go back to for the first time in two were being held back at army checkpoints and those who were hoping to welcome relatives trapped in for two years were left staring at an empty road there were only a few vehicles with frightened drivers and poles bearing ragged white flags sticking out of the windows not far from there is the empty catholic town of which once had a population of who fled in a local community explains that when they come back they will find that their homes have been destroyed he says that my brothers house was destroyed by an the and my house was damaged burned the other houses before they left and they have all been looted a long time ago even where houses are still there is no water or electricity or likelihood of it being restored any time soon many of the former residents have already migrated to and other parts of the world the chances of restoring any form of security to the plain depends on first of all capturing from which has the whole of northern it will take time to discover if is going to be destroyed as well as as has already happened to the city of in and the city of in it is also unclear if will be able to revert to guerrilla to which its tactics of using suicide bombers alongside and fanatical are it was

street and to grant use of their strategic military bases to the pentagon and the most powerful and richest countries in south and the most strategic military platform in southeast were the objects of intense us political operations in the to in each wall street and the pentagon secured smashing successes leading to premature ejaculations over the new golden era of financial pillage and unfettered

soon to have their turn facing prosecution the political who had decreed the sale of were replaced by nationalists who would turn the bordello back into a sovereign nation state this essay outlines the rapid rise and dramatic demise of these erstwhile progeny of wall street and the pentagon in and and then reviews shock and awe as the newly elected president embraced new ties with china while we

that there was no risk with their champion president at the helm wall street based its giddy predictions on a mere experience with but then some of the hedge fund managers began to raise questions about the viability of presidency instead of reducing the fiscal began to increase public spending to offset mass discontent over his triple digit increases in utility fees and the mass layoffs in the public sector and the slashing of pension funds the major banks had counted on the abrupt devaluation of the currency to invest in the export but instead they were confronted with a sudden appreciation of the peso and a skyrocketing inflation of leading to high interest rates as a the economy fell even deeper in recession exceeding minus for the year while most wall street bankers still retain some faith in the they are not willing to the kind of cash that might allow this increasingly unpopular regime to survive what keep wall street on board the sinking ship are the political and ideological commitments rather than any objective assessment of their dismal economic performance wall street counts on free market bankers appointed to the the massive purge of social services and

of when they took over much of northern and eastern the presence of in may complicate and prolong the battle for as his surviving adherents fight to the death to defend him said that it is obvious that they will but not how long this will take to happen he said that forces had been impressed by the extraordinary number of tunnels that had dug in order to provide hiding places in the villages

by on constitutional used prohibited domestic terror warrant in email search by with editors veterans today in a surprise the department of justice just admitted that there was no legal authorization in place to access email accounts of estranged wife of accused sex offender former congressman the government admitted that no warrant had been requested and that discussions to seek a warrant had not yet making the letter director wrote to congress on a potentially criminal if it can be proven that was aware of this fact and of the actions of his subordinates in planting emails on department and officials are working to secure approval that would allow the to conduct a full search of top aide newly discovered sources familiar with the discussions told government lawyers yet approached lawyers to seek an agreement to conduct the search sources earlier told that those discussions had but the law enforcement officials now say they have director is under assault for what is being perceived as more than simply partisan behavior former presidential writes for the as director an investigative not a prosecution agency have any authority to send a report to congress in the middle of an investigation about the past or present subject of an investigation he appears to be in violation of the limits on his authority as director by disclosing investigation information or possible investigation information directly to congress with obtaining permission from the attorney general or someone else delegated authority by her his decision to reveal the results of an ongoing before a published criminal violates due process principles and secrecy rules and guidelines of the justice through court challenges to search tactics under and other accessing cloud based emails and either representing them as found in a warranted search of a hard drive or in syncing a computer to place emails on a drive under a warranted clear prohibitions have been in this with no warrant in place at there are no possible interpretations of actions that could be consistent with admissibility in what has been seen by most a the long expected the highly controversial letter written by director something more far reaching has a constitutional crisis that may well exceed that of or even like the federal the itself lacks a clear constitutional authority there is no mention of nor authorization in the for a national police force in the in the amendment ratified in the powers not delegated to the united states by the nor prohibited by it to the are reserved to the states or to the more often than this has been a stepchild of the bill of rights the created initially as the sex created to enforce the has assumed not only powers not granted under the but has exponentially expanded its well beyond constitutional limitations on rights of privacy and against unreasonable search and assailed by laws like the patriot acts behind the current that of an director being accused of interfering in an election and acting against procedure and advice of the attorney is something more the has crossed into the area of possible violating clear cut federal court not only through an illegal search but by actually planting evidence and then channeling misleading information into the press with a clear intent to subvert constitutional authority another issue is the kind of language has been using to mollify critics who have kept a flurry of investigations going and who have subjected him to hostile interrogation for endless hours in front of highly partisan committees colonel former us to and ranking military intelligence planner commented on the nature of assertions of classified take the text of any of the emails we have seen anything here could have been said in a press conference or on a television interview in those would not have been considered classified there would have been for not from disclosing policy or in endangering real issues that get high level classification were they made and there was reason to expect this might well are revealing and reflect on her personal at demonstrate a lack of particularly when it comes to or these are issues of public not criminality nor are they areas of real security classification what we have seen do may well rise to the level of something certainly he undermines the and attacks the system of government as to what his intent was or to what laws this is not my area of expertise but i would like to think that criminal code could deal with this kind of threat one additional consideration to put into the mix is during recent weeks while has released two dozen batches of the campaign has mirrored earlier charges made against by former national security advisor that sexes up and even fabricates documents that according to when speaking to woodruff of national public seeded into a virtual deluge of material the used intelligence surveillance powers when it downloaded and synced emails into former congressman according to legal the knowingly violated the law in applying terror statutes when they illegally expanded their search into computers and downloaded emails from a party account with only days before an the term surprise has never been more applicable the question people are asking why did director choose to ignore legal advice more was he aware that he was upsetting an presidential election based on a pattern of misconduct by his own the lied when it claimed the it found emails when it searched computer sources now tell that the in fact synced the email account of estranged downloading the emails from the cloud and falsely claiming they were discovered as part of a legal search warrant there is no case law supporting the expansion of such warrants to spouses or others whose email accounts may be accessible through devices but were not stored on hard drives and not by any stretch of the legally accessed under any possible search warrant tied to sexual indiscretions what did in fact happen here
by on future now rests in the hands of a man older than the supreme leader of celebrate in the streets of the coastal city of after election of former general as president the news come as much of a surprise in the end presidential posters with face were already being hung around east before the results had even been released but now its has finally elected a new a and former military was elected on making him the ending a political vacuum in the top post that had left now takes the reigns of a country heavily plagued by a massive refugee overload with refugees from various practically public constant threat of war from their southern and bomb attacks from terrorists interestingly this is the second time that has been announced the president to when he and the military government of east appointed itself in and anyone who dared disputed this was met with which did eventually occur even went on to fight a war of liberation against the army forces stationed in during which ended in failure and forced to flee his native land into exile in the man behind the poster is by his to be a strong leader with a military background who knows how to play the political field to achieve his goals on the other most i have spoken to about have offered plenty of negative feedback even from people who i assumed would throw their full support behind the old boy an overall slippery character who has been lucky enough to pick the right partners since his return to after his exile i have to the side of my personality that appreciates dark comedy chuckled at the picture of president sitting in the big chair of the presidential palace with just the slightest whisper of a cheeky smile on his face the last time held the the army under the authority of pictured at the presidential palace in being elected president of president of bombed him out in a attempt to illuminate a stubborn nationalist troublemaker yet years son of offered his personal congratulations to on his election victory just president also shares my dark which would explain his sly smirk while he sat in his prize seat despite all the he has returned to and claimed what he had always the presidency carries with him a considerable amount of political baggage from a long career full of civil war and side switching which has left many in questioning if this lord of war is the man worth appointing to end the political stalemate which some have suggested would be better off remaining politically frozen instead of appointing a man who has fought against the administration in during the late but now fully backs and in this is a totally understandable stance given the lack of honest candidates available in the fact remains that has been left completely disabled by the political deadlock which is pushing the country to the brink i personally agree with the progressive socialist party and leader who said on twitter prior to the vote that its time to elect any president to escape the presidential vacuum why elect i have a growing concern that behind closed doors some very egotistical and conniving millionaires are beginning to see the massive potential gas wealth just sitting off the coast but political class has been far too busy infighting among themselves to invest in steps towards harvesting and selling gas also have their eyes on this untapped wealth lying below the perhaps this could be why so many old adversaries of have decided to suddenly put an end to their refusal to back ally for who is smart enough to see this type of opportunity on the horizon and just about desperate enough to surrender his staunch opposition to candidacy in return for inclusion in any future plans given recent bad luck with his struggling business in i put it past him who is still eagerly perusing the trial and conviction of what he believes where who at news beside former prime minister after announced that he will back to become president assassinated his is now willing to throw his vote to candidate in order to secure the position for the second as prime minister certainly there are many more aspects to consider in what has been a leading up to yesterdays grand finale but i suspect that political godfathers are smart enough to realize they are sitting on a potential trillion dollar money maker is at risk of being high jacked if they continue pussyfooting around over never sectarian feuds what could during my last trip to i was shocked to see how even the average struggle with the lack of basic services the country is a mess and the only institution that is worth any praise is the army that has coped remarkably well under the strains of constant terror attacks from radical terrorists the rise of regional sectarianism and a huge lack of money equipment the proxy of dictator who fought a long bloody war against is now considered the candidate who confirms an political victory over its competitor for political influence in what has largely held the country back is the fact that has been stuck in a vicious game of between refusal to pick a side has left the country empty handed with no vision of a safe future has a desperately needed arms deal with a pathetic blaming the deal cancellation on a statement made by foreign minister happens to be who refused to accept a statement referring to as a terrorist group the produced statement patriarch president of also demanded all league members to condemn which both refused to do in previous attempts to remain has also refused to accept any or offers to provide free arms deliveries to the army in order not to upset the countries ties to the us or the gulf now that holds may have the guts to finally

for more information and media requests please contact or write to for media inquiries related to other independent human rights media unit the trade deal set to be signed by the union and is a fundamentally flawed treaty which should not be signed or ratified without a referendum in each country a united nations human rights expert says the independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international deplored the pressures brought on the regional parliament of which initially said it would not approve the treaty but later said its concerns had been met a culture of bullying and intimidation becomes apparent when it comes to trade agreements that currently get priority over human the expert said in his reports to the human rights council and general assembly has previously warned that is incompatible with the rule of democracy and human and substantiated how and why before the parliamentary assembly of the council of he believes that both and the trade and investment partnership currently being negotiated by the and the us give undue power to corporations at the expense of national governments and human and deplores that the mere existence of dispute settlement generates a regulatory chill the danger of and being signed and one day entering into force is so serious that every especially parliamentarians from member should now be given the opportunity to articulate the pros and cons the agenda gravely endangers health and other social and there is no justification to it said civil society should demand referendums on the approval of or any other such that has been negotiated behind closed he noted the expert said the should have heeded expert warnings and strong civil society opposition to his specific concerns include provisions which he says could hamper states regulatory powers and could allow investment companies to sue over legislation affecting even in cases where the laws were designed to protect workers public health or the environment states should not sign the agreement unless their powers to regulate and legislate in the public interest are fully safeguarded and the investment protection chapter is removed this chapter creates privileges for investors at the expense of the said noting that the new text may slightly amend this chapter but adding that the investment court system is similarly incompatible with the international covenant on civil and political which requires legal cases to be heard by independent public tribunals the associations of and judges have already decried this kind of dispute which is a and also discriminates against domestic is not necessary when all participating states are parties to the and already have public courts that are transparent and he said along with most trade and investment agreements is fundamentally flawed unless specific provision stipulates that the regulatory power of states is paramount and must not be impacted by a regulatory chill it must also be clear that in case of conflict between commercial treaties and human rights it is the latter that must prevail the expert said there was now a strengthened case for a legally binding instrument on corporate social obliging transnational corporations not to interfere in the internal affairs of and imposing sanctions when they pollute the environment or shift their profits into tax havens the human rights council has established an working group on transnational which is holding its second session this week who has participated in this working urges the prompt adoption of a treaty that makes the guiding principles on business and human rights legally binding and enforceable he also said it was time to discuss the secrecy surrounding the drawing up of the and the anomaly that much of the information about it became available only through in violation of state obligations to ensure open access to information the constitutionality of the and agreements should be tested before the court of justice in and the human rights aspects before the court of human which could be called upon to issue interim measures of said national courts should also test the compatibility of the agreements with national the independent expert stated there is a legitimate fear that will dilute environmental food and health and he said a treaty that strengthens the position of transnational corporations and monopolies at the expense of the public interest conflicts with the duty of states to protect all people under their jurisdiction from internal and external threats said the should have paid greater attention to a warning from a committee of members of parliament from the parliamentary assembly of the council of the committee on social health and sustainable development said earlier this month that imposed unacceptable restrictions on the legislative powers of national and called for the signing to be postponed note to the independent expert devoted his report to the human rights

heres how against the republican establishment trump it is very clear to me that sanders was replaced with trump by the corporate media i know what no one else can see this we know who rigged this from primary to the predictable and then the turn on the in the general election i just and tried to share on social media the truth about what had but everyone was lining up with the quo account of what was happening trump was an out of control well but be angry at trump but be truly angry about those who made him the only choice against it is about the corruption and propaganda in the corporate the unwillingness to the public and the entertainment media to discuss the elephant in the room and i sure mean the republican elephant i am talking about the unmentionable oligarchy that is the root of everything that the find deplorable in our government if you use only television to try and understand our world you will be lost in a matrix of and for the direction they want us to think i even know why they bother information like that which came from is the last unless you are a fly on the that will even get you close to being able to form an opinion from unbiased material other than that information it takes a talent to read between the collect from what is a see just how far the public news media is willing to push the envelope beyond that you have to look at what is being censured by all forms of the truth and from beyond the the works of professor john i am beginning to see among those who have the intellect to see this massive the obvious rigging of our the impending end out our species due to the dominate economic an unwillingness to do the work to the truth the best of us are giving up and would rather remain in denial of what is happening when i have gone to the effort to try and explain on social media how all this created misdirection of anger towards who is an should actually be against the corporate media and the powers who control them the destroyed our chance to elect a qualified actual anti status quo candidate by blacking out the coverage of sanders while at the same time giving and unqualified airtime this in effect replaced sanders with trump to me it was so obvious i knew and posted that the corporate after the would eviscerate using information they already had in the hole to counter what ever surprise would be coming out against needed to be pitted against an idiot like the predictable to ensure a win of another insider in the executive branch i have watch as the bill and the have become part of the subset of the who have crossed that line into the area of comfortability and which they are unwilling to this becoming part of those who are unwilling to truly push the envelope into any are resembling the truth of what is truly happening and have become part of the establishment propaganda machine the same is happening of non profit news like while not so much helping the establishment push their agenda they have either been corrupted by the corporate as with and the or they do not have the financial stability to risk telling us the full truth only as individuals in such rags as the and what pitifully little someone like me can do we see what a few of us are still willing to say what we think there are many more i am afraid who are in or have just given up the hopefulness of the to keep the avenues of truth through the works of and the social philosophers beyond the like prof john are we catching the last glimpse of the light of truth the is quickly surpassing this last exposure to the light from the the perception of light becomes brighter as the door dividing them begins to close if the search for truth is the telling of a and the speaking of truth an then we are correct in our assertion that a new truth is needed or an old truth rediscovered to find and reopen this to let back in the will be far more difficult once the darkness prevails walker as we knew is certainly but politics has always been the realm of so any that what we knew was good is a fantasy of fools politics has always been the realm of the cheaters and the cheated and if not a politician or his biggest cheated donate

process safety not human safety physical security was constantly breached by the local staff and was out of direct expatriate the physical barriers and systems were wholly inadequate i know exactly what systems we did and did not and management on site were aware of all the failings too after the fall of there should have been a massive review of but instead we handed over more control to poorly trained security guards we were all aware of bandits and arms trafficking in the desert regions but were just relying on the military to manage maybe by force or maybe by according to the most

traveling the world giving long lectures on the nature of testing peoples truths in regards to who is really running our world today leads a similar having just completed his hour arena world tour which was sold out in multiple countries during the extended lecture he touches upon topics such as the holographic the pseudo moon and his most infamous theory regarding a reptilian hybrid race that is controlling our world to begin to explain the complex discusses the current fear state of our world the fear of what other people think is the state of perception that stops people making a difference you can only make a difference in a world of uniformity if you operate outside of that uniformity we either take that on or we in which case nothing changes we are now at this place where we can go down one track and experience freedom like never even understood what freedom is we go down the other the one that the control structure then were headed for an global state the lion sleeps

and prime have created the illusion of being separate ruling bodies when in fact they have always been on the same team of sorts there is a bloodline that has been strategically kept intact for ages the peerage and a comprehensive aristocratic genealogy reveals that all presidents have carried royal bloodlines into office over the course of history this includes bill the bush john and so on and so forth portion of the global elites family tree if we truly live in a democratic how is it that every single person brought into office has been of and royal what are the chances of this considering the fought for their independence of in the the peerage makes a strong suggestion that elections are not really based on a public voting but rather they are based upon the highest percentage of royal genes to make things even more peculiar is the fact that brad and tom hanks of biggest also descend from this lineage what could all of this goes on to illuminate the theory of quantum which states that our physical reality is a projection within our and that at the most basic quantum the solidity of matter is existing as vibrations instead of atoms when the light from matter reflects into our the cells pick up the light travels as a wavelength measured from the visible light and transmutes the vibrations or into an image within the brain this is the same for it is a vibration until it is decoded by the brain the matrix plot seem so the human brain can only see an extremely limited spectrum of as we know there are a plethora of different forms of energy in our universe and thousands of different frequencies around us at any given moment that we cannot such as radio and radiation waves suggests that and other beings exist in our but they operate at a frequency just above what the

in technology comments an artificially intelligent machine that predicted the outcomes of the last three presidential elections says republican candidate trump is imminent to win an artificial intelligence system created in by founder of startup correctly predicted the results of the republican and democratic primaries if trump it will defy the data trend for the first time in the last raj told the machine uses million data sources from places like twitter and to make its decisions from engagement on social media platforms and search the machine believes that trump has overtaken engagement numbers in when the democrat first came into power and his popularity was at its peak says that the system has shown which candidate will win an election just by looking at engagement data he told if trump it will defy the data trend for the first time in the last years since engagement began in full earnest despite democratic nominee being ahead in most says this data should remind her not to get complacent the businessman does say that there are limitations in what can be achieved by explains that just because someone engages with a for it necessarily mean that they support him there are now more people on social media than in the last three elections for which was meaning that there could be more negative engagements which the machine would struggle to distinguish if you look at the in the there were immense amount of negative conversations that happen with regards to trump when these conversations started picking up in the final it meant a huge game opening for trump and he won the primaries with a good margin billionaire trump is now facing an uphill battle in his bid to become president of the us after a string of controversies dented his bid to beat in the race to the white house
are the polls rigged against all of these wildly divergent surveys cannot possibly be correct on television what is the best place to live in the united states to prepare for the coming economic may what is the best place to live in the united i get asked that question all the time my answer can be summed up in two it depends the truth is that the answer is going to be different for each person all of us have different goals and different needs if you have a very strong network of family and friends where you live right you might want to think twice before moving hundreds or thousands of miles away if you have a great job where you live right you might want to hold on to it you should not just assume that you are going to be able to pick up and move to another part of the country and be able to get a similar job right away the united states is in the midst of a very serious economic decline right and wherever you live you are going to have to provide for your family just because you move somewhere new does not mean that you are going to leave your problems behind in you might find that they moved right along with you with all that being the reality is that there are some places in the that are going to be much more desirable than others when the economy totally falls apart for during a total economic collapse it will not be good to be living in a large city or in a densely populated area just think about what happened in the aftermath of hurricane if the entire nation is going through something like you want to have hundreds of thousands of close neighbors at that point so when thinking about where you want to be when everything falls population density should be a major factor but there are other factors as well and no area of the united states is perfect if you live in or near a major city right that is okay most do even if you have limited financial resources at the you can start developing a plan that will get you where you eventually want to go if you want to move to another part of the country you can start applying for jobs out there you can also be working hard to develop a business that would enable you to move perhaps you have friends or family in more isolated areas that would allow you to stay with them during an economic collapse those that possess more financial resources could start thinking about getting a second home in a location that is more rural the key is to come up with a plan and to be working towards accomplishing that plan if you have a plan hopefully the following information will give you something to think about not all areas of the united states are and all of them do have problems the following are some thoughts about the best place to live in the united the northeast a major problem with the northeast is that it is just so darn crowded there are some rural but the overall population density of the region is so high that it would be really hard to go unnoticed for long in the event of a major economic collapse another thing that is not great about the northeast is that so much of the population lives near the coast as we saw in japan living near a coastline is not necessarily a good thing while it is likely safer to live along the east coast then the west the truth is that there is an inherent level of insecurity when it comes to living in coastal areas you never know when the next oil spill or tsunami is going to strike the northeast is really quite cold so staying warm and growing your own food would be more difficult than in some other areas of the country the the is one of the most beautiful areas of the nation it suffers from many of the same problems that the northeast does the has a very high population density for the area around is pretty much all suburbs for miles in all directions the weather is nicer than in the northeast and there are some less dense areas once you get south of if you think that the might be for you might want to check out north or south the people tend to get friendlier the further south you go and there are definitely some areas that could potentially work is generally not going to be a place that you want to be during an economic collapse the housing market has absolutely collapsed down there and the crime rate is already very high it is also very densely populated the weather is very nice down in but one big thing that you need to consider when it comes to is the fact that it is very flat and most of is just barely above sea level in quite a bit of is actually below sea level in hurricanes are always a major threat in it is a beautiful but there is a lot of risk to living down there the southeast the southeast has really taken a pounding over the last few years first it was hurricane and then it was the oil spill and then it was the tornadoes of there is a lot of poverty in that area of the country there is also a lot of crime there are a lot of great people who live down in the but if you do not know your way around it can be a very difficult place to move to the one of my favorite places east of the river are the mountains along the border if you must be in the eastern half
in the temple of the dog i by jack heart on by jack friends every story has a beginning and an everything in between is just a the oldest stories known come from the aborigine people of their stories go back at least thirty thousand years they are passed on orally by the tribes elders under a rigid tradition called the law which ensures the preservation of the aborigines ancient tribal narratives linguistic scholars who have studied them have noted the aborigines ability to sustain the scaffolding needed to transmit stories over vast periods aborigine tribal lore has been academically documented to chronicle the thawing of the ice age and the flooding of the coastline years according the wisdom keepers an episode of ancient the television show purporting to document alien intervention in human aborigine lore also recounts meteorite volcanic earthquakes and solar what is certain is that aborigine culture ignores the brutal realities of its own existence and focuses on what is now called the the word itself is a mistranslation of the aborigine word which means the uncreated a source which was always which perpetually yields fresh materials from which everything that is perceived is derived to the aborigine the is an altered state of consciousness that lies across the uncharted chasms of the a place where everything that ever was has been imprinted forever in the aether nothing that nothing that can be lost and it can always be accessed by going back to the beginning through ceremonies and dreams according to ancient in many ways the concept of mirrors the ancient idea of the records this may not be the idea of records go back no further than madam and a system of mysticism which she founded simply means aether in the expansion of the microcosm into the macrocosm and contraction back of the macrocosm into the microcosm is a doctrine of just about every reputable school of mysticism as it is above is so it is below to the and the living creatures rush forth and return as it is written in verse of the concerning the eyes of if and her followers got the idea from anywhere other than a library that there was an astral hall of cosmic records it was

with each other by some mechanism that travels faster than light anyone ever had a premonition should have known in the holographic quantum entanglement the enigma of interaction between particles what a baffled called spooky action at a petulantly denying its existence in the face of all the evidence is easily explained what are being observed in particle physics are not particles at but different aspects of interference patterns generated by the collision of spherical frequency waves emanating from an event horizon the holographic paradigm in fact takes it as a that at the threshold

that any assault on forces would be considered an attack on themselves the rapidly deteriorating crisis in has already caused tensions with to rise to the highest level since the end of the cold but now is adding fuel to the fire by publicly considering an unprecedented covert action against apparently believes that hackers are interfering in the election and so he wants payback the following comes from an news article entitled prepping for possible strike against the administration is contemplating an unprecedented covert action against in retaliation for alleged interference in the presidential election intelligence officials told news current and former officials with direct knowledge of the situation say the has been asked to deliver options to the white house for a clandestine operation designed to harass and embarrass the leadership the sources did not elaborate on the exact measures the was but said the agency had already begun opening selecting targets and making other preparations for an operation somebody should tell that he is not playing a video game a attack is considered to be an act of and the would inevitably retaliate and considering how exceedingly vulnerable our infrastructure i know if that is something that we want to invite at the end of last vice president also publicly threatened the on vice president met meet the press host chuck for an interview that has raised serious concern in without bothering to question the authenticity of the took the allegations of hacking at face opening his interview with a loaded why we sent a message yet to after a moment of stunned were sending a message we have the capacity to do it and it will be at the time of our and under the circumstances that will have the greatest impact when asked if the public will know a message was hope not the firmly deny that they had any involvement in the and so far the administration has not publicly produced any firm evidence that the were behind it perhaps the administration privately has some but at this point they have not shown that evidence to the public so for to be making these sorts of threats is a very dangerous thing the are taking these threats very and they are preparing to protect their interests the threats directed against and our states leadership are unprecedented because they are voiced at the level of the us vice president to the backdrop of this unpredictable we must take measures to protect to hedge a spokesman according to news agency here in the united most people even realize that we could be on the verge of a major conflict with but over in things are completely different talk of war is and the potential for war is the number one topic in the media right now just check out some of the recent media headlines about the conflict between our two in contrast to trump has no appetite for war with and one television network recently instructed their viewers to locate the nearest bomb shelter in case a
