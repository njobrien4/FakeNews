holidays often come wrapped in memories and expectations mindfulness offers the gift of being present in the moment just show up and be interested at holidays , this means simply being present in the moment with compassion for yourself , and others nina smiley , director of mindfulness programming at mohonk mountain house
the zika virus caught the worlds attention last year after experts noticed that a small percentage of women carrying the virus in latin america were giving birth to children with microcephaly , a defect that causes malformed heads and severely stunts brain development the virus is now endemic there , and scientists fear that caseloads may spike again during the hot , wet months of the southern hemispheres summer , which begins in december but although the zika strain circulating in latin america is originally from asia , health experts know little about its history on that side of the pacific we know the virus has been circulating in the region for the better part of 70 years , but we dont know how extensively , said duane j gubler , an emeritus professor at the duke nus medical school in singapore zika may have been understudied for decades because there were no routine tests for it until recently , scientists say , and perhaps also because the symptoms resemble those of mild dengue fever another possibility , they say , is that women carrying the zika virus gave birth to microcephalic children at home microcephaly was first noticed in brazil only because doctors in neonatal intensive care units of several hospitals realized that they had far more children with the problem than they normally did , and many of the mothers reported having zika symptoms months earlier but the zika scare in latin america has prompted a recent surge in awareness and monitoring of the virus in asia health ministries across the region have reported hundreds of new infections in recent months and in october , the world health organization said that the western pacific region was highly likely to report more cases and possibly new outbreaks humans are primarily infected with zika through the bites of mosquitoes from the aedes genus the same ones that carry dengue , yellow fever and other mosquito borne illnesses zika can also be transmitted sexually , although scientists have not yet determined how long the virus lingers in semen or vaginal fluids the majority of people who contract zika never experience symptoms , and the symptoms that do appear including fever , rash , joint pain and conjunctivitis are often mild but zika can cause microcephaly and other birth defects in infants born to women who are infected during pregnancy scientists also believe that zika infections are linked to the prevalence of guillain barr syndrome , a rare disease of the nervous system that can cause muscle weakness and even paralysis a zika vaccine is being developed , but the process may take years in february , as microcephaly and guillain barr cases that scientists believed were linked to zika appeared in latin america and the caribbean , the world health organization declared the zika epidemic a public health emergency the agency announced an end to that emergency this month but cautioned that the disease should now be viewed , like malaria and yellow fever , as a continuing threat by mid november , 75 countries had reported mosquito borne zika transmissions for the first time since 2007 , with nearly half of the new transmissions occurring this year alone in southeast asia , singapore and thailand have reported many of the cases this year , with hundreds each thailand also reported southeast asias first two cases of zika related microcephaly in infants in late september , and vietnam reported what it said was probably its first zika related microcephaly case in late october the united states centers for disease control said in a september memo that pregnant women should consider postponing nonessential travel to 11 southeast asian countries because the virus is linked to birth defects but the number of reported zika infections and infant malformation cases with likely links to zika in the region is still significantly lower than the number in latin america and the caribbean \( more than 2 , 000 babies have been born with microcephaly in brazil , far more than in any other country \) the c d c has also said that recent reports of new zika cases in southeast asia may simply reflect increased awareness or monitoring , rather than increasing transmission scientists say that tropical asian countries long experience with mosquito borne diseases may help their response girls who contract zika are believed to be immune when they reach their childbearing years , meaning they cannot give birth to microcephalic babies people who live in countries that are hyperendemic to dengue including thailand , vietnam and the philippines also carry natural antibodies that some scientists say may help them to suppress or protect against zika infections dr sutee yoksan , a dengue expert at mahidol university in thailand , said that theory is now being tested through research projects in multiple countries \( other scientists , by contrast , worry that dengue antibodies may make zika infections worse \) southeast asian officials so far appear relatively sanguine about the risks that zika poses to their citizens , and dengue remains a greater threat , said tikki pang , a former director of policy research at the world health organization but those officials probably would feel political pressure to respond to zika more aggressively , he added , if it became clearer to them that the virus posed a risk to unborn children asias experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome , or sars , and other infectious diseases has prompted increased coordination among its countries health ministries since the early 2000s , health experts said in interviews , and that coordination may come in handy if zika transmission surges in the region but officials may be underestimating zikas spread in southeast asia , in part because some countries lack the resources to test for zika infections on a large scale , the experts said the fight could also be hindered by a chronic lack of political will in the region to address mosquito borne diseases with long term investments in vaccine development , public education and new mosquito control technologies , they said
milwaukee i love telling people im from wisconsin maybe its my defense mechanism for when people accuse me of being a coastal elite , out of touch with real america i like fulfilling all the wisconsin stereotypes i love cheese and cheese curds , of course i love our sports teams out of a vague sense of homerism and my accent \( all hard as \) comes out in full force after ah couplah beers mostly i love my grandma , who has called wisconsin home for 88 years her parents immigrated to wisconsin from germany , and she started public school without knowing a word of english she forgot most of the german her parents taught her years ago , but taught me the words to the liechtensteiner polka that we would sometimes hear when my family would go to a friday night fish fry up until nov 8 , i still believed my states moral baseline bent toward empathy the wisconsin i thought i knew , where i lived for 21 years , was filled with complex but fundamentally decent people who recognized that everyone is deserving of respect and could disagree without being disagreeable the state did elect scott walker as governor in 2010 , and the republican led legislature gutted public sector unions , setting off huge protests in the capitol but i didnt think that state would vote for donald j trump , turning its 10 electoral votes to a republican for the first time since 1984 \( i mean , come on , we even voted for dukakis \) as much as mr trump won the election in wisconsin , hillary clinton lost it her campaign , which prided itself on employing all the data wizards and ground game gurus money can buy , did not do nearly enough to lock down the upper midwest , particularly wisconsin and michigan , and instead treated those states as a given paul soglin is the mayor of madison , wisconsins capital city , in cerulean dane county he supported senator bernie sanders in the democratic primary , and said he talked at least once a week with a field organizer from the sanders campaign during the primary but once mrs clinton locked up the nomination , it was radio silence from the clinton campaign since i first held elected office in the early 70s , virtually every presidential election , ive been contacted , either by the candidate or by a staffer , he told me im not saying this to say im important but the point is , not only wasnt she in the state , but i never got a call , a contact , anything after the primary president obama , by contrast , made two campaign stops in madison during the 2012 election , including a huge rally with bruce springsteen on the monday before election day mr soglins frustration with the clinton campaign was apparent i dont understand the strategy ive never seen an explanation for it , other than assuming that they wanted not just a victory , but a smashing victory actually , the kind that donald trump had , he said wisconsins voter turnout in 2016 was the lowest its been in 20 years roughly 40 , 000 fewer democrats voted in milwaukee county this year than did in 2012 the drop in turnout in milwaukee county might be partially attributed to a voter identification law in the state in 2014 , a federal judge found that roughly 300 , 000 registered voters in wisconsin lacked the necessary photo id card to vote under the new law , and a substantial number of those voters were low income however , election watchers have said the voter id law alone could not have flipped the state in mr trumps favor mrs clinton did not visit wisconsin once after the democratic national convention in july neither did president obama or michelle obama mr sanders made multiple trips to the state on behalf of mrs clinton , but that was not enough to gin up voters enthusiasm like most of the country , my friends and family in wisconsin were shocked that mr trump won the state , and the election my mom says shes still in denial my dad has progressed comfortably to anger my grandma , though , has been coping with the election result with characteristic wit after listening to donald trump speeches about hate , i was convinced its o k to hate , she emailed me therefore , i hate donald trump throughout the general election , the clinton campaigns surrogates appeared reassured to the point of hubris that they would be able to convert moderate republican voters in midwestern suburbs for every blue collar democrat we lose in western pennsylvania , we will pick up two moderate republicans in the suburbs in philadelphia , and you can repeat that in ohio and illinois and wisconsin , new york senator chuck schumer said in july this line of thinking was not just wrong , but disastrously so in 2008 , barack obama won 59 of wisconsins 72 counties this year , 59 counties voted for donald trump republicans successfully built on the map that helped to elect mr walker to the governors mansion while the clinton campaign was looking to run up the score in states like arizona and georgia a triumvirate of wisconsin republicans also helped elect mr trump , both actively and passively first , there is reince priebus , who worked his way up from republican politics in wisconsin to head the republican national committee , and now , to serve as mr trumps chief of staff then there is house speaker paul d ryan , who now has a historic opportunity to pass his agenda through congress finally , mr walker , recovered from his own failed presidential campaign , will now oversee the republican governors association charlie sykes is a longtime radio host in milwaukee , who became a voice on the right for the nevertrump movement after 23 years on the air , he will retire from his radio show this year along with being a vocal opponent of the trump campaign , he has taken on a new role as chief apologizer for right wing media he expressed frustration with his listenership , who , he said , had gradually grown immune to any inconvenient fact presented to them while he read news from the washington post , politico and national review throughout the election , his audience seemed to glean most of its news from fox news , talk radio and their facebook feeds on his radio program last week , mr sykes played a sound bite of adm michael s rogers , current head of the national security agency , suggesting the russian government had made a conscious effort to sway the election in mr trumps favor mr sykes asked his listeners , can we all agree that this is a big deal and we ought to do something about it \? he opened the phone lines , and the first call was steve from waukesha , who said i dont believe it i dont believe any of it mr sykes sighed you cant break through that , he said it is way harder to knock that stuff down than you would think he says he is disappointed , but not surprised , to see conservative media falling in line and supporting mr trumps cabinet picks this is the monster weve created , he said all of the worst elements of the conservative media have now been empowered every one of them has got a strut alex jones now has a pipeline to the white house i mean , think about this ! mr sykes spent half of 2016 arguing that wisconsin conservatism was fundamentally incompatible with what mr trump was offering his party wisconsin conservatism has been distinctive , i think , in being aggressive but substantive , and very , very policy oriented , and also proving that you can do things and be rewarded by the electorate , he said mr trump has certainly been aggressive if not very policy oriented , and he has proved that you can run an atavistic , substance free campaign and still win even in the mild mannered midwest the wisconsinites i know dont like to argue about politics in general , and certainly not at the thanksgiving table we are creatures of habit we dont like to make ourselves or others uncomfortable we loathe confrontation but this year seems to bring with it a moral imperative to have uncomfortable conversations about the very real stakes of this election this year we may need to break the habit , worry less about being nice and talk more about what it means to be decent
the election of donald j trump gives the republicans in congress a chance to act on their often stated desire to get rid of obamacare , a wish that mr trump mostly says he shares aaron e carroll and austin frakt , the health policy analysts for the upshot , discuss then what \? aaron i think its safe to say few in congress thought they would have this opportunity but like the proverbial dog who has finally caught the car , after untold futile attempts , republicans have finally come within reach of repealing the affordable care act now comes the essential question will they actually do it \? theyve been promising it forever , but i am still skeptical that it will happen i believe you disagree im going to let you go first why do you think theyll do it \? austin i think theyll do it because they so thoroughly own the idea of repeal , having passed bills to repeal , partly repeal , delay or defund the a c a in the house something like 60 times just the other day senator mitch mcconnell endorsed repeal \( again \) the house and senate also agreed to do so , in large part , in a budget reconciliation bill earlier this year the only thing that prevented it was that president obama vetoed it i doubt mr trump would do the same if given a similar opportunity now , i know that a budget reconciliation dismantling of the law is not a full repeal , because according to the rules it can only touch budget related provisions this excludes things like requiring insurers to take all comers for premiums that vary only by age and smoking status or preventing them from imposing coverage caps and lifetime limits , among other measures i also must add that im much less confident of a repeal \( or partial repeal \) without agreement on a replacement but ill turn it back to you , aaron do you think the g o p has to offer a full replacement to get its members to sign on to repeal \? or can it offer something that would cover fewer people and with fewer benefits \? aaron i think they can get away with slightly fewer people and somewhat skimpier benefits , but not too much theres a part of me that thinks many in congress were always so willing to vote for a repeal because they knew it had no chance of being signed into law they got credit for the vote without ever having to face the downside actually repealing without replacing would mean effectively stripping more than 20 million people of their health insurance , without anything in return this would be an unmitigated political disaster the stories of people with cancer , diabetes and more who were suddenly stripped of their insurance and left out in the cold would very likely dominate our discussion for months that leaves more than enough time to lead to significant repercussions in the 2018 midterm elections with no democratic leaders in any branch of government to blame , i think this would be akin to what happened in the 2010 elections , but in reverse now , if they can coalesce around a replace plan that doesnt leave too many people out , then i think they could move forward but in all the years since the a c a was passed , republicans havent been able to do that do you think they can \? what do you think that plan would look like \? austin one way to get from repeal to replace that minimizes immediate political risk is to pass a plan that doesnt call for repeal for several years , at least after the 2018 midterms , though possibly after the 2020 election between now and then , there would need to be some kind of transition to whatever replaces obamacare that didnt just dump people off coverage with no alternative but the alternatives could just be not as comprehensive or costly absolutely there will be bad stories but keep in mind , there will be bad stories under obamacare , too rocketing premiums , huge cost sharing and markets with few choices is not a recipe for political success republicans now own the task of fixing those things and doing so in a way that does not look as if theyre making obamacare better theyre actually in a tough policy spot theyll get the blame if they dont fix or repeal the a c a , and theyll get the blame if they dont replace it with something people like better health policy is a very difficult and thankless task i think theyll opt for something they can call repeal and replace , but they could also just let obamacare struggle and die neither looks good one other way to get out from under the issue is to kick it to the states do you think a trump administration , working with a g o p congress , will offer greater flexibility to states to design their own coverage plans that could diverge from obamacare \? if so , what are some ideas states might try \? aaron i think its very likely those in congress could punt medicaid to the states for years , theyve been trying to change medicaid funding to a block grant that they can then constrain over time this will be enticing for them because it will allow them to reduce medicaid spending in the future , while forcing states to make the tough decisions and take the blame for cuts in either beneficiaries or services fixing the markets for those who are getting health insurance through the obamacare exchanges , though , is a different story without some sort of market regulation , which theyve generally been opposed to , the same problems that existed pre a c a with respect to pre existing conditions and individual ratings will exist many people will become uninsured annual and lifetime limits could reappear lots of people will have problems getting insured moreover , i have yet to be convinced that a significant number of republicans in the house might coalesce around such a plan maybe for medicaid , but im not sure about the exchanges even if they could , its likely the democrats in the senate would try to filibuster either of these plans dont you think \? austin yes , i think democrats would filibuster anything they could the filibuster is not set in stone a senate majority can change it , and some are already calling for the g o p to do so but that doesnt appear to be what the senate will do theyll retain the filibuster this could play to their favor , since they can propose things they like , let the democrats filibuster them and take the blame when repeal kicks in with no replacement perhaps thats another way for republicans to get out of their political bind aaron im sure well have more to discuss as president trumps administration comes into power
britains vote to withdraw from the european union followed by donald trumps election in america constitute a single giant political event one that makes 2016 a vintage year in history that will long be studied big political events have big causes for the last three years ive been working on a book about whats been happening beneath the surface in the plumbing and wiring of the world thats roiling politics in so many places my answer begins with a question what the hell happened in and around 2007 \? 2007 \? thats such an innocuous year but look again steve jobs and apple released the first iphone in 2007 , starting the smartphone revolution that is now putting an internet connected computer in the palm of everyone on the planet in late 2006 , facebook , which had been confined to universities and high schools , opened itself to anyone with an email address and exploded globally twitter was created in 2006 , but took off in 2007 in 2007 , hadoop , the most important software youve never heard of , began expanding the ability of any company to store and analyze enormous amounts of unstructured data this helped enable both big data and cloud computing indeed , the cloud really took off in 2007 in 2007 , the kindle kicked off the e book revolution and google introduced android in 2007 , ibm started watson the worlds first cognitive computer that today can understand virtually every paper ever written on cancer and suggest to doctors highly accurate diagnoses and treatment options and have you ever looked at a graph of the cost of sequencing a human genome \? it goes from 100 million in the early 2000s and begins to fall dramatically starting around 2007 the cost of making solar panels began to decline sharply in 2007 airbnb was conceived in 2007 and change org started in 2007 github , now the worlds largest open source software sharing library , was opened in 2007 and in 2007 intel for the first time introduced non silicon materials into its microchip transistors , thus extending the duration of moores law the expectation that the power of microchips would double roughly every two years as a result , the exponential growth in computing power continues to this day finally , in 2006 , the internet crossed well over a billion users worldwide in time , 2007 may be seen as one of the greatest technological inflection points in history and we completely missed it why \? 2008 yes , right when our physical technologies leapt ahead , many of what the oxford economist eric beinhocker calls our social technologies all of the rules , regulations , institutions and social tools people needed to get the most out of this technological acceleration and cushion the worst froze or lagged in the best of times social technologies have a hard time keeping up with physical technologies , but with the great recession of 2008 and the political paralysis it engendered , this gap turned into a chasm a lot of people got dislocated in the process how could they not \? what happened around 2007 was that connectivity and computing got so fast , cheap , ubiquitous and leveraged that they changed three forms of power in really differentiated ways all at once the power of one , the power of machines and the power of ideas what one individual or small group can now do the power of one to make or break things is phenomenal when president elect trump wants to be heard he now gets his message out directly from his new york penthouse through twitter to 15 million plus followers at any hour of the day he pleases and the islamic state does the same from a remote province in syria machines can now not only beat humans at jeopardy ! or chess , they are starting to become truly creative , offering architectural and other designs and writing news stories , songs and poetry that are indistinguishable from the work of humans at the same time , ideas now flow digitally through social networks all over the world faster and farther than ever as a result , new ideas \( including fake news \) can suddenly take root , and long held ideas think opposition to gay marriage or transgender rights can suddenly melt away so if you look down from 30 , 000 feet you see that technology , globalization and , i would add , mother nature \( in particular , climate change , biodiversity loss and the impact of population growth \) are all accelerating at the same time , and feeding off one another more moores law drives more globalization and more globalization drives more climate change and together , climate change and digital connectivity drive more human migration i recently met with economic and climate refugees in west africa who made it clear to me they didnt want aid from a rock concert in europe they want to come to the europe they see on their cellphones and they are using whatsapp to organize vast illicit migration networks to get there so no wonder many in the west feel unmoored the two things that anchored them in the world their community and their job are feeling destabilized they go to the grocery store and someone there speaks to them in a different language or is wearing a head covering they go into the mens room and there is someone next to them who looks to be of a different gender they go to work and theres now a robot sitting next to them who seems to be studying their job i celebrate this diversity of people and ideas but for many others theyve come faster than they can adapt thats why my favorite song these days is brandi carliles wonderful ballad called the eye , the main verse of which is i wrapped your love around me like a chain but i never was afraid that it would die you can dance in a hurricane but only if youre standing in the eye these accelerations in technology , globalization and mother nature are like a hurricane in which were all being asked to dance trump and the brexiters sensed the anxiety of many and promised to build a wall against these howling winds of change i disagree i think the challenge is to find the eye for me , that translates into building healthy communities that are flexible enough to move with these accelerations , draw energy from them but also provide a platform of dynamic stability for citizens within them more on that another day
milan victor massiah has grown weary of talk that the italian banking system is so threadbare and stuffed with terrible loans that it threatens europe with another financial crisis the mansion that serves as local headquarters for the bank he runs , ubi banca , one of italys largest lenders , does not feel like a place on the verge of running out of money an inlaid marble fireplace sits in a conference room beneath wooden beams worthy of a castle a statue of the greek goddess athena stands triumphantly over a staircase as you can see , he says , sweeping a hand across the scene , were not necessarily bankrupt among policy makers alert for signs of the next financial disaster , italys mountain of uncollectable bank debt is a subject discussed in tones ordinarily reserved for piles of plutonium its banks seem at once too big to fail and eminently capable of doing so , menacing the global economy for years , italian lenders have muddled through , hoping time would cure their afflictions but italys economy has been terminally weak , not growing at all over a recent 13 year stretch bad loans have festered good loans have deteriorated italys problems are europes problems nearly one fifth of all loans in the italian banking system are classified as troubled , a toll worth 360 billion euros , or nearly 400 billion , at the end of last year , according to the international monetary fund that represents roughly 40 percent of all the bad loans within the countries sharing the euro in recent weeks , the worlds focus has shifted to germanys largest lender , deutsche bank , on fears that it could be forced to seek a rescue but if deutsche has become the crisis of the moment , italy is the perpetual threat that could , at any moment , present the world with an unpleasant surprise potent enough to send legions of officials descending on rome to try to contain the damage the italian government has sought to spend more money to spur the economy but european leaders , led by germany , have enforced rules limiting budget deficits and italian banks have held tight to cash and are reluctant to lend , starving an already anemic economy of capital all of which leaves italy and europe , and to some extent the global economy , with a formidable conundrum europe may never regain economic vigor so long as italys banks are a slow motion emergency but italys banks cannot get healthy without growth and italys economy cant grow without healthy banks mr massiah has no patience for stories that cast banking as the source of danger a few irresponsible cases aside , italys lenders are not the cause of trouble , he insisted rather , they are the victims of their times a recession that lasted seven years wiped out nearly a quarter of italian industry the unemployment rate sits above 11 percent the population is aging , and too few women are working , limiting spending power too many italian businesses are small operations that are especially vulnerable to globalization family run craft and apparel makers have been destroyed by low cost competition from china negative interest rates maintained by the european central bank to encourage lending have cut into bank profit margins this is a bank centric country , and there was a huge crisis , mr massiah said when the tide goes out , you dont see everything nice in the sea italys banking pain is a symptom of an italian business style that has traditionally favored relationships and community ties over a dispassionate analysis of the bottom line a perception the nation is eager to alter to visit senior italian officials in their offices decked out like personal versions of the sistine chapel is to hear a recitation of complaints that reforms have gone underappreciated they betray resentment that italy continues to be caricatured as the reckless debacle at the center of european economic decline the comically ineffectual former prime minister silvio berlusconi a fiercely tanned media magnate has been dispatched to history at the controls today is the young technocrat matteo renzi , who has delivered a spate of politically perilous reforms long sought by solemn faced officials in brussels under mr renzis direction , italy has made it easier to fire workers this has somewhat diminished a major disincentive to giving people jobs the not irrational fear that problem hires will stick around forever , like grown children tethered to the refrigerator italy has also sped up civil processes in its notoriously inefficient courts the prime minister is now seeking a constitutional change that would refashion the entire legislative process in an effort to break a logjam in the upper chamber of parliament he argues it would eliminate obstructions to further pro growth measures italians vote on the amendments next month if they reject the proposal , mr renzi has suggested he may step down yet in the telling of some economists , the reforms are a sideshow the trouble lies with the banks they prop up so called zombie companies that will never repay their loans , extending just enough credit to keep them current on their debts suggest this to the man in charge of the system , ignazio visco , governor of the bank of italy , and he recoils as if someone has thrown an offensive object on his elegant silk carpet the bulk of italys bad debt is backed by collateral , he said most of the remainder has a solid chance of turning into collectible debt , provided that economic growth returns it is the result of bad economic conditions , seven years of almost continuous recession , mr visco said banking is a symptom , not the cause banking is also an activity that in such conditions seems equal parts math and hope mr massiah , the man heading ubi banca , confronts a contradictory set of imperatives his bank is strong in northern italy , home to some of the most productive industrial areas in europe if he frets too much about limiting risk , he may deprive the companies that could build a more vibrant future but if he lends too aggressively , he risks creating more bad loans he is putting stock in darwin the weaker companies are dying , he said the survivors will be of higher quality if natural selection is playing out , workers in the industrial enclave of nave fear that they are threatened with extinction a speck of a town carved into the foothills of the alps some 60 miles east of milan , nave has long drawn sustenance from its steel mills now many of those plants are abandoned , their concrete walls disintegrating , their windows broken locals call the old factories the cemeteries outside the stefana steel mill , beyond the shuttered gates , idled workers hold vigil , waving placards at the occasional passing vehicle in the hopes that their presence will somehow translate into a resumption of their jobs stefanas business has disintegrated in the face of a global glut of steel and the disappearance of construction projects in italy and spain in late 2014 , workers began hearing that management was having difficulty paying for gas and electricity for two weeks , the plant shut down , then work resumed then , ubi and other italian lenders stopped delivering bank loans the end came in june most of the workers used to earn about 1 , 800 euros a month \( about 1 , 964 \) , plus pension and other benefits now they get half that via state aid and a local emergency fund the company sits in legal limbo as a judge sifts through claims from creditors twenty years have passed since fabio stefana \( no relation to the plant owners \) moved out on his own , courtesy of the wages he earned making steel when his wages stopped in june , he found himself asking his parents for help with groceries his father worked at the mill and retired from there now the fathers pension payments are supporting his 39 year old son i have to have lunch with my mother , said mr stefana , who frequently goes home for meals as a way to save money its not the right reason to eat with your parents mr massiah acknowledges the pain when his bank stops lending , but he does not dwell on it the son of libyan jews who fled to italy in the early 1960s , he favors pinstriped suits and round tortoiseshell glasses he looks at once like the university of rome graduate student in economics he used to be , and the head of a bank large enough to be regulated by the european central bank you have winners and losers , he said some of the steel companies are doing very well , because they are more sophisticated they do specialized stuff and others that were not managed in a proper way went bankrupt ubi may be the quintessential large italian lender it is not a grandiose disaster like banca monte dei paschi di siena , which mr renzi tried to resuscitate by injecting public money but new european rules prohibit taxpayer funded bailouts the bank is now laying off staff members and shutting branches in a desperate bid to win private investment nor is ubi like unicredit , the one italian financial institution large enough to be deemed systemically important on a global scale though unicredit also feels pressure to raise capital , it has a portfolio stocked with choice assets it would most likely be able to sell ubi was created by combining local cooperative lenders institutions meant to aid local merchants , not churn out profits for investors it reflects a spirit of collective undertaking that has made italy a beloved vacation destination and trusted source for food and fashion people paying a premium for a bottle of italian wine may savor the idea that the vintner feels a kinship with the people harvesting the grapes but such emotional dealings do not generally produce positive results when it comes to managing money since becoming chief executive of ubi in 2008 , mr massiah has sought to inculcate a modern banking culture he has been in the socially awkward position of having to honor the sense of community while saying no to people who feel entitled to hear yes we say , lets sit , he said lets see the business plan because if its not feasible , we are just making your agony longer the bad loans on ubis books dropped to 8 3 billion from 9 3 billion at the end of last year yet ubi , too , faces allegations of wrongdoing on thursday , italian prosecutors announced they had concluded an investigation finding evidence that mr massiah and 38 other bank officials obstructed italian regulators who had been looking into claims that the company had improperly elected a supervisory board in 2013 those accused have three weeks to prove that they do not deserve to be charged mr massiah dismissed the prosecution as the outgrowth of a highly politicized battle for control of the bank following a merger under the rules that had governed the entity , then a cooperative , the new board was formed through an election in which all individual shareholders had equal votes , regardless of how much of the bank they owned when a group of investors holding less than 1 percent lost the election seeking board seats , they accused bank executives of rigging the outcome , mr massiah said the people who lost were saying the bank was influencing the people who went to vote , mr massiah said its absolutely not true they are doing this because the ones who lost were trying to take control of the bank theres no accusation that we mismanaged one single euro its not a money story mr massiah added that he and the board ultimately changed the structure of ubi to ensure transparency votes are now apportioned to the size of the investment mr massiah spends hours with his branch managers , counseling them on how to more intently scrutinize balance sheets while delivering bad news even when they face a clash between cold numbers and what he calls the important values of life a young couple wanting a mortgage , for example , so they can buy a home and start a family its difficult for the people to manage the emotional part of the story , mr massiah said the guys that we do have at the branch are human beings and feel bad its terrible to say no , in particular in our culture in a way , in the anglo saxon culture , there is a more direct way to interact our culture is less straight our culture is less confrontational but italy is awash in the expensive consequences of social graces governing banking sometimes a no is protecting somebody , mr massiah said its a polite way of saying to a young couple , im killing you , accepting that mortgage please rent a house for the moment , and then when you earn more you can buy a house , he said we have to understand that we have to live at the level that we can allow sometimes no is just another word for not knowing how to assess the deal this is marco rossis takeaway , as he looks back at his futile effort to pry loose a loan mr rossi had been working as a business consultant when , six years ago , he stumbled on an opportunity of his own a german pharmaceutical company was in the process of merging with an israeli firm the two companies needed to sell some overlapping operations one unit sold over the counter drugs like aspirin another owned a respiratory drug mr rossi purchased the two units for the grand total of nothing he merely agreed to take responsibility for paying 80 workers along with their pension obligations he negotiated a deal with the union , agreeing to eschew layoffs and he bought licenses from other italian pharmaceutical companies enabling him to sell additional drugs , seeking to squeeze more revenue out of his sales force in his first two years of existence , he doubled his revenue to 12 million from about 6 million but achieving profitability required that he increase his sales further mr rossi purchased a license to sell a new cholesterol drug , but he needed funds to buy it wholesale all he needed was 300 , 000 , he said that was the last piece of the puzzle ubi had always seemed keen for his business , mr rossi said when he started the company , he had promptly deposited 2 million in his account they were very happy about that , he said mr rossi went to his local branch in central milan and sought a loan they asked for collateral , and he presented invoices worth 2 million but the bankers were unimpressed it was not a building , mr rossi said it was not something solid it was paper the local branch sent him to a central office , which told him there was no guarantee his business would continue to grow they said , give us your balance sheets for the last three years , and i told them that i only had two , mr rossi said they said , oh , youre a new company this was not a good thing to be i had to face ignorant people , mr rossi said , fuming they refused me the loan desperate , mr rossi tried another bank , veneto banca its bankers were prepared to extend a loan with one major catch they said , you need 300 , 000 we are prepared to give you 600 , 000 , mr rossi recalled but you have to take the extra 300 , 000 and buy the banks stock that would have doubled his payments while placing a sizable bet on a dicey bank if it failed , he would still be responsible for the loan this seemed dangerous and unsavory the next step is the mafia , mr rossi said his reluctance was ultimately validated this summer , as veneto banca teetered toward collapse and was eventually bailed out by a private investment fund , depositors yanked money out of branches and shareholders savings were wiped out in august , the italian authorities arrested a former chief executive of the bank on allegations that the bank had lent customers cash so they could buy company shares for mr rossi , his inability to borrow stopped his expansion plan in january 2013 , he sold the company for 3 million , he said 10 times what he had been seeking to borrow he rented a ballroom at a local hotel and gathered his entire staff there , he delivered the grim news sixty people three fourths of the work force were losing their jobs , though the sale enabled him to pay severance and maintain pensions i wanted to grow in italy , and the support that i received was zero , mr rossi said this is a country where we have a huge unemployment rate we have a lot of skilled people we have smart people with ideas why dont we create something \? mr massiah of ubi listened to this account with a pained grin no one ever tells the story of the bad idea that we didnt give money to , he said and yet , he offered , maybe his bank is overdoing it maybe , in their understandable eagerness to avoid a future with more bad loans , his bankers are being so conservative that they are perpetuating a long and lean present i could be wrong and overshoot it , mr massiah said we are asking ourselves always if we are doing something wrong

the nobel prize in literature may be the worlds most important literary award , but not everyone who wins can make it to the ceremony among the reasons given by past laureates for failing to travel to stockholm to accept the award being gravely ill and in a wheelchair \( harold pinter , 2005 \) being so anxious and agoraphobic that you are not suited as a person to be dragged into public \( elfriede jelinek , 2004 \) and being a soviet dissident terrified to leave the country because you might not be allowed back in \( aleksandr solzhenitsyn , 1970 \) bob dylans excuse \? pre existing commitments last month , the swedish academy , which awards the literature nobel , proudly announced that the songwriter bob dylan would be the 2016 laureate for having created new poetic expressions within the great american song tradition though the announcement proved exciting to people who agree that mr dylans lyrics are indeed literature of the first order , it dismayed traditionalists who believe that the prize should go only to people who practice literature as literature , in the form of books or poems or plays in any case , mr dylan , who has always liked to follow his own path , has proved to be an elusive and frustrating laureate , starting with his apparent failure to immediately appreciate the honor being bestowed upon him , not to mention the 8 million swedish krona , or 871 , 412 , check that comes with it for nearly two weeks , he declined to take calls from academy members or to call them back \( per wastberg , a member of the academy and chairman of the nobel literature committee , called his failure to respond quickly impolite and arrogant \) mr dylan briefly identified himself as the nobel winner on his website , then deleted the reference \( although news of the award was kept on his official twitter account \) performing in las vegas , he avoided mentioning the prize it wasnt until oct 28 , in an interview with a british newspaper , that mr dylan made his first public comments about the news and said that yes , he was accepting the nobel , and yes , it was an amazing turn of events the same day , the academy issued an announcement saying mr dylan had called them earlier that week to graciously acknowledge the award but even after that , mr dylan still held out on the academy like a teenager being coy about whether to accept an invitation to the prom , he refused to commit to attending the traditional white tie award ceremony on dec 10 that question was cleared up on wednesday no trip to stockholm for mr dylan the news came in the form of an unobtrusive announcement on the academy website yesterday evening the swedish academy received a personal letter from bob dylan , in which he explained that due to pre existing commitments , he is unable to travel to stockholm in december and therefore will not attend the nobel prize ceremony , the group said on its website it is unclear what commitments mr dylan might be referring to his official website lists no tour dates after nov 23 as if to mitigate what looks like extreme rudeness from mr dylan , the academy said there were no hard feelings and that the only requirement for a literature winner is to deliver a lecture within six months of the ceremony he underscored , once again , that he feels very honored indeed , wishing that he could receive the prize in person , the academy said , pointing out that no one forfeits the award by failing to be there to receive it the prize still belongs to them , the academy said , mentioning ms jelinek and mr pinter , just as it belongs to bob dylan the academy is known for its independent mindedness and for its at times almost willful perversity in picking winners the award to ms jelinek , a relatively obscure figure on the international scene but known in austria for her provocative discussions of sex and power , caused one member of the academy , knut ahnlund , to resign in protest her writing , mr ahnlund declared , was whining , unenjoyable public pornography and a mass of text shoveled together without artistic structure for good measure , he said that choosing her for the prize had done irreparable damage to all progressive forces as well as confused the general view of literature as art over the years , some literature prize winners seem to have delighted in making things difficult for the academy by , for instance , reacting to news of their win with less than complete enthusiasm oh , christ , doris lessing said in 2007 , when , as she exited a taxi in front of her house in london , a waiting reporter informed her that she was the newest laureate she added , grumbling , that shed been hearing rumors about it for 30 years in 1964 , jean paul sartre turned the award down as for v s naipaul , when the academy telephoned him at home to let him know that hed won the 2001 prize , he refused to come to the phone there was a bit of playacting , mr wastberg said in an interview his wife said that sir vidia is working intensely and may not be disturbed but when we said , its from the swedish academy , one heard that someone was breathing heavily just near the phone mr wastberg said that mr dylans failure to answer the academys calls for such a long time had been baffling and unprecedented , especially when he appeared to be hiding in plain sight we had so much difficulty in finding out his telephone number , mr wastberg said ive been in this business for 20 years , and it was never this difficult to get a telephone number and talk to a person straight
moscow president vladimir v putin of russia instructed his government on wednesday to withdraw from the treaty that created the international criminal court , while his government assailed the tribunal as ineffective and one sided the action was largely symbolic , because russia like the united states has not ratified the treaty and is not under the courts jurisdiction but it was another setback for the fairly young court , which handles cases of war crimes and crimes against humanity and is an emblem of the international order that is being shaken by populist revolts across the west essentially , this is just a gratuitous slap in the face , not a body blow , said kate cronin furman , a human rights lawyer and political scientist at the harvard kennedy school , who predicted that the election of donald j trump as president of the united states would lead to more harm for the court burundi , gambia and south africa moved recently to withdraw from the court , calling it biased because all the people it had convicted so far had been africans or because , in the case of south africa , it disagreed with the courts mandate to prosecute any individual , including a head of state zeid raad al hussein , the united nations high commissioner for human rights , tried on wednesday to rally support for the court a new trend of isolationist and unprincipled leadership is building up across the world , he said in an address to the general assembly of the courts member countries in the hague renewed attacks on the court may well be in the offing mr al hussein has sharply criticized the divisive and racist rhetoric of several european right wing politicians last month , he said that mr trump would without any doubt be a threat to global stability if the president elect stood by his campaign pledges to bar muslims from entering the united states , to deport millions of undocumented immigrants and to endorse the use of torture in a world that seems increasingly adrift , the turmoil yet to face humanity may be far greater than any challenge we have yet experienced , mr al hussein said on wednesday we face a choice we can safeguard our societies by standing firm on the principles of justice which anchor this institution or we can cast away the moorings of law laid down to save the world from horror in announcing russias withdrawal from the treaty , the russian foreign ministry said the court had failed to live up to expectations that it would serve as an impartial and authoritative arbiter of international law this week , the courts top prosecutor called russias annexation of crimea an ongoing state of occupation , a judgment affirmed by a united nations human rights committee , which reiterated the world bodys commitment to ukraines sovereignty over the black sea peninsula the ministry cited the courts approach toward russias brief war with georgia in 2008 the court has said it would investigate possible war crimes in georgia which is a member of the court by all parties , including russian armed forces an even sharper rebuke to the russian government came on monday , when the courts chief prosecutor , fatou bensouda , said in a report that the situation within the territory of crimea and sevastopol factually amounts to an ongoing state of occupation russia has insisted that its capture of crimea was warranted by the legitimate popular vote of the crimean people in a referendum the prosecutors report also said that the information available points to russias direct military involvement in the armed conflict in eastern ukraine , something that the russian authorities have denied repeatedly the russian federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of the ukrainian territory without the consent of the ukrainian government , the report said russia might also be concerned about calls by western officials , including secretary of state john kerry , to have the court look into the bombing campaign in syria the court is the worlds first international tribunal with permanent jurisdiction to prosecute war crimes , genocide , crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression it was founded in 1998 , when 120 countries adopted the rome statute , and began operations in 2002 the court has headquarters in the hague mr putin directed russia to sign the rome statute in 2000 , but parliament did not ratify it the united states never ratified the rome statute , though the obama administration has cooperated with the courts proceedings ms bensouda , the chief prosecutor , said this week that she was considering an investigation into allegations of war crimes , torture and related treatment by american military forces and intelligence agencies in afghanistan , raising the prospect of a confrontation with the trump administration given that the i c c is a relatively young institution , and the norms surrounding it are not firmly entrenched , the loss of american leadership on accountability for mass atrocities could be profoundly damaging , said ms cronin furman , the human rights lawyer vladimir frolov , a scholar of international relations , called russias move a symbolic gesture prompted by ms bensoudas report on crimea at the time when russia signed the rome statute in 2000 , it wanted to be a part of the modern world , he said now it doesnt he added that he believed that many of russias actions in syria could potentially be subject to an investigation by this court
