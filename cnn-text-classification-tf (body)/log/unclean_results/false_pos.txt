by on fri oct at pm as megyn kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her share on twitter print this post earlier this week friday fox follies under the assumption the explosive and bizarre battle between megyn kelly and newt gingrich would be this weeks lede i had already tricked up an opening paragraph in case you missed it thats when he got personal accused her of being obsessed by sex and she told him that he should work on his anger issues this weeks column would have been about how the fox audience continues to splinter as they take sides in the presidential election the nyt calls em megyn moments i call them fissures in what had been assumed to be the bedrock foundation of the fox news channel its unthinking audience then came word that rupert murdoch was playing hardball as kellys contract negotiations break out into the open that paragraph lovingly crafted went out the window but lets see what this fight was about because heat is always better than light for ratings as trump congratulates newt gingrich for getting his butt kicked by megyn kelly watch as kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her her contract expires next year and rupie opened up to the wall street journal of which he is owner to partially cajole kelly and partially to threaten her into extending her contract million in contract talks with fox news if they are going to make a network that is going to be a post ailes post trump it will be around megyn kelly chris wallace and shep smith and they are going to have to throw hannity and oreilly overboard said andrew tyndall a television news consultant of other hosts at the network that isnt going to happen promised mr murdoch were not changing direction that would be business suicide he said mr oreillys contract is also up at the end of next year and mr murdoch said were going to want bill to stay with us mr hannitys contract isnt up until ms kelly has forged close ties to mr murdochs sons particularly lachlan murdoch who is co executive chairman of fox and has taken an active role in contract talks people close to the situation said fox would like to settle this before the election and before kellys book is released both of which could only strengthen her position in the negotiations if all goes well from the the power of megyn kellys feminismeven if she doesnt call it that by the daily beasts tim teeman imagine then her mix of satisfaction and maybe ennui as she scrolled across some of the praise ridden screeds out today how megyn kelly became an improbable feminist icon megyn kelly has become the biggest example of white feminism at work and aw crapheres proof that megyn kelly is kind of a feminist role model now note the grudging headlines because of kellys employer and because she has not fought the good feminist fight in a conventional left wing context throughout her career to date the f word mantle is being conferred upon her with something of a scowl this in itself reveals a kind of blinkeredness on the part of kellys critics it is perfectly possible to work for a right facing institution and not be percent right wing yourself or spout the prevailing dogma of the tv station you work for aside from the fact that when she tilts right she tends to tilt alt right the biggest knock on kelly is that shes too hard edged marshall mcluhan spoke of the medium cool of tee vee but kelly comes across as the opposite of warm and fuzzy this makes her less attractive to other networks shes hoping to change that impression when she co hosts live with kelly ripa the morning after the election think of her as a designated hitter trying to knock murdochs hardball right out of the park still watters still a few weeks back fff reported on a racist watters world in which the white privileged pencil necked geek made fun of asians this week asian american groups meet with fox news personnel over awful jesse watters segment paul cheung president of aaja told the erik wemple blog that the meeting was productive i think they heard what the communitys reactions are he said of the session at new yorks museum of chinese in america approximately asian american groups and allies have signed an open letter to fox news regarding the unfortunate episode said cheung ron kim a new york state assemblyman in attendance told this blog that a representative from the oreilly factor and a senior representative from the news side of the channel attended the meeting together they played a good cop bad cop routine said kim the gentleman from oreillys show was defending what they were doing and trying to explain that this is a part of the opinion section of fox news and sometimes edgy humor can go too far said kim once again the specter of fox newss vaunted news opinion divide presents itself as weve noted before this is a convention borrowed from the newspaper industry to justify fox news hosts such as sean hannity openly campaigning for donald trump steve doocy of the morning show fox friends spreading harmful innuendo into the public square and oreilly allowing his protege to spread racist stereotypes all about chinatown

posted on nov by ann jones tomdispatch donald trump grabbed a new lifeline speaking at a rally in charlotte north carolina on october he raised a hand as if to take an oath and declared i am a victim the great business tycoon the one and only man who could fix america and make the place great again was laying claim to martyrdomand spinning another news cycle i am a victim he declared of one of the great political smear campaigns in the history of our country they are coming after me to try and destroy what is considered by even them the greatest movement in the history of our country i am a victim that pathetic line echoed in my head which is why im writing this in my long life i had seen a large white man stand up in a public arena and proclaim those wordsthe shrill self pitying complaint of the remorseless perpetratoronly once before that was in a courtroom in lower manhattan in the man was joel steinberg a new york lawyer who over a year period had brainwashed and beaten into oblivion a woman named hedda nussbaum once a successful young editor of childrens books in the early years of their relationship she had run away several times seeking help and every time a doctor or friend had called steinberg to come and get her at that pointtime and againsteinberg would administer punishment breaking her bones and her spirit she took on what police would later describe as a zombie like quality some years earlier a teenage girl had hired steinberg to arrange an adoptive home for her baby instead he kept the child lisa until one evening when she was six years old and stared at him in a way he didnt like he responded by striking her repeatedly in the head after which he went out to dinner with his cocaine dealer leaving the child unconscious on the floor nussbaum by then so traumatized so absent from anything like life thought vaguely of calling a doctor but she was not allowed to use the phone in steinbergs absence instead she sat on the floor and watched over the girl as she lay dying on trial for the childs murder steinberg blamed everyone but himself im the victim here he whined in court he swore that he had never hit anyone not anyone even though he was known to have assaulted a business associate and three other women before he settled into the single minded single handed demolition of hedda nussbaum judge harold rothwax observed that steinberg was a man of extraordinary narcissism and self involvement who had an extreme need to control everyone in his ambit while he lived a life of self gratification yet steinberg could not see in himself the man judge rothwax described he thought people should feel sorry for him he had been disbarred and had lost a child he railed at those who had conspired to bring him down the police the neighbors the judge the prosecutor the expert medical witnesses his defense attorney the jurors the press and hedda nussbaum im the victim here he claimed at the time nearly years ago the public blamed hedda nussbaum the district attorney the police the doctors and psychiatrists who treated her intensively for more than a year before the trial all agreed that on the evening in question she was too physically and mentally incapacitated either to cause the girls injuries or take action to save her nonetheless she was tried and condemned by the press and public opinion including women who called themselves feminists in court the jurors were merciless when they began to deliberate only four thought steinberg guilty of murder as charged five were in the middle and three held out for lesser charges feeling certain that hedda nussbaum had somehow been responsible for killing the child they finally agreed upon a verdict of manslaughter even then a woman juror assured the press that nussbaum was a very sick woman who should have been charged and convicted of some crime another juror also female expressed popular opinion this way i just feel that she was to blame and a third woman juror who claimed that certain others agreed with her said poor joel joels a victim we have to send a message to the system you dont make victims out of nice men like joel judge rothwax sentenced steinberg to eight and a half to years released after years steinberg now in his seventies still claims to have done nothing hurtful to anyone he has not paid a civil court ordered settlement of million to the birth mother of the dead child nor has he ever been charged with any crime for what he did to hedda nussbaum two lessons lurk in this story one old and one very up to date first its a reminder of how much women at that time even after a great wave of feminism still blamed women for whatever happened to them at the hands of men second a man with a character like steinbergs is not the kind of guy you want to choose for high officeor any office at all joel steinberg stalked a far tinier stage than donald trump and he did more deadly damage but the two men seem to be brothers under the skin sharing common character defects well described in psychiatric texts extreme narcissism a taste for sexual predation and very similar views of the women on whom they prey like steinberg who was incapable of seeing himself as the judge accurately described him trump seems blind to the real nature of his own behavior neither man seems capable of taking responsibility for the harm hes done and when posted on oct by sonali kolhatkar protesters organized by the national organization for women gather near the trump international hotel and tower in new york city on oct as sexual

behavior neither man seems capable of taking responsibility for the harm hes done and when their own actions finally call down retribution branding them as losers ah then come the conspiracy theories and the vindictive wail of the victim last june i published a piece at tomdispatch venturing to explain why candidate donald j trump was getting rock bottom ratings in the polls from women voters nearly of them reportedly couldnt stand the guy i pointed out what seemed to me to be the obvious trumps behavior perfectly fits the profile of an ordinary wife abuser in a sworn deposition introduced in divorce proceedings his first wife ivana swore under oath that he had torn out her hair and forcibly raped her raging at her because he didnt like the results of a scalp reducing procedure performed on him by a plastic surgeon she had recommended about one in three american women are survivors of some version of such treatment euphemistically called domestic abuse thats roughly million women voters who as i wrote last june know a tyrant when they see one i raise this subject again because the now infamous tape of trumps open mic hollywood access bus ride in added a new page to the rap sheet of this particular abuser in that piece of mine i traced the history of the principal tactics of coercion used by controlling men like trump some of those tactics including steinbergs favorites involve physical force but most when used by a skilled abuser require no force at all trump applies the handiest tools to his targeted victims regularly leaving no physical marks behind threats intimidation degradation put downs humiliation insults trivial demands occasional indulgences the lesson is simple and clear the mind can be bent and the spirit shattered without battering the body i neglected however to mention one of the most insidious tactics of such abusers perhaps because its so obvious that it regularly hides in plain sight in the military its called pulling rank high status is itself a powerful coercive force that can stifle resistance in a lower status victim and so silence him or her status is trumps brandished weapon his open carry on this he couldnt have been clearer in boasting of his pussy grabbing skills on that hollywood access tape when youre a star they let you do it you can do anything the most chilling moments on that tape however occur after trump emerges from the bus in all his orange splendor followed by his escort billy bush now a former nbc personality who could be heard on that tape laughing as trump recounted his compulsive assaults bush then greeted his television colleague arianne zucker who like so many women on american tv was less fully clothed than the men around her and whom trump had been ogling from the bus while sucking tic tacs to freshen his potty mouth for a possible kissing attack billy bush asked ms zucker how about a little hug for the donald in that short bus trip across the parking lot bush had learned just what to do to get in good stead with his high status guest and so recipient email for journalists to discourage an inquisitive stance even distrust toward government and the elections process is astounding but not surprising im thinking of cnn journo brian stelter who assertedthey never argue do they they only ever assertthat skepticism about voting irregularities in america is dangerous well a
