wells fargo has asked a federal district court to order dozens of customers who are suing the bank over the opening of unauthorized accounts to resolve their disputes in private arbitrations instead of court according to legal documents the motion filed in the united states district court in utah on wednesday is in response to the first class action lawsuit filed against wells since it agreed to pay million in penalties and million to customers for opening up to million deposit and credit card accounts in their names without their permission the scandal has shaken wells the third largest american bank by assets it has been put under tougher regulatory scrutiny its chief executive john stumpf has stepped down and its reputation has been damaged as it faces multiple inquiries wells fargo has begun an advertising campaign to win back customer loyalty in the wake of the scandal a spokesman for wells fargo declined to comment on the filing in a written response to questions from lawmakers published last week the bank said it would stand by its arbitration policy but is offering free mediation services to affected customers mandatory arbitration rules inserted into account opening agreements prohibit customers from joining class actions or suing wells fargo instead the agreements require individual closed door arbitration mandating arbitration when signing up for financial products has become standard practice after a supreme court decision in validated the practice but customer advocates say it improperly denies customers the legal protections of court proceedings such as the right to appeal and helps to conceal corporate misconduct from the public and regulators because the related documents and hearings are not made public customers trying to recover small sums of money are also unlikely to find lawyers to represent them in arbitration critics say and the cases do not set a legal precedent to help other affected individuals last year a court dismissed an earlier lawsuit against wells fargo saying that customers had signed arbitration clauses when opening their accounts the bank has been criticized for its mandatory arbitration clauses from democratic lawmakers in congress including senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts the consumer financial protection bureau is considering rules to prohibit banks credit card issuers and other companies from forcing customers to submit to arbitration and waive their right to join class action lawsuits but the bureau could find its powers scaled back by president elect donald j trump and a republican led congress according to members of both political parties lobbyists and lawyers
washington donald j trump once declared that campaigning for substantial changes to medicare would be a political death wish but with election day behind them emboldened house republicans say they will move forward on a years old effort to shift medicare away from its open ended commitment to pay for medical services and toward a fixed government contribution for each beneficiary the idea rarely came up during mr trumps march toward the white house but a battle over the future of medicare could roil washington during his first year in office whether he wants it or not let me say unequivocally to you now i have fought to protect medicare for this generation and for future generations senator joe donnelly of indiana a democrat running for re election in said this week in a video message to constituents i have opposed efforts to privatize medicare in the past and i will oppose any effort to privatize medicare or turn it into a voucher program in the future for nearly six years speaker paul d ryan has championed the new approach denounced by democrats as voucherizing medicare representative tom price of georgia the house budget committee chairman and a leading candidate to be mr trumps secretary of health and human services has also embraced the idea known as premium support and democrats are relishing the fight and preparing to defend the program which was created in as part of lyndon b johnsons great society they believe that if mr trump chooses to do battle over medicare he would squander political capital as president george w bush did with an effort to add private investment accounts to social security after his re election in democrats will stand firmly and unified against mr ryan if he tries to shatter the sacred guarantee that has protected generations of seniors said representative nancy pelosi of california the democratic leader republicans have pressed for premium support since mr ryan first included it in a budget blueprint in as he envisions it medicare beneficiaries would buy health insurance from one of a number of competing plans the traditional fee for service medicare program would compete directly with plans offered by private insurers like humana unitedhealth group and blue cross blue shield the federal government would contribute the same basic amount toward coverage of each beneficiary in a region those who choose more costly options would generally have to pay higher premiums those who choose plans that cost less than the federal contribution could receive rebates or extra benefits supporters say this approach could save money by stimulating greater price competition among insurers who would offer plans with lower premiums to attract customers democrats say that premium support would privatize medicare replacing the current government guarantee with skimpy vouchers coupon care for seniors the fear is that the healthiest seniors would choose private insurance lured by offers of free health club memberships and other wellness programs leaving traditional medicare with sicker more expensive patients and higher premiums beneficiaries would have to pay much more to stay in traditional fee for service medicare said john k gorman a former medicare official who is now a consultant to many insurers regular medicare would become the province of affluent beneficiaries who can buy their way out of private plans republicans say their proposal would apply to future beneficiaries not to those in or near retirement but the mere possibility of big changes is causing trepidation among some older americans i am terrified of vouchers said kim ebb who lives in a retirement community in bethesda md and has diabetes atrial fibrillation and irritable bowel syndrome you get a fixed amount of money to draw on for your expenses then you are on your own charles r drapeau of east waterboro me said he was rattled by the republican plans im scared to death said mr drapeau who has multiple myeloma a type of blood cancer and takes a drug that costs more than a month we dont know exactly how it will work but just the fact that they are talking about messing with medicare its frightening to me senator richard m burr republican of north carolina has proposed a version of premium support and other republican senators have expressed interest but the idea has not gained as much traction in the senate as in the house the impact of premium support on medicare beneficiaries depends on details of the plan to be specified by congress a crucial question is how the federal payment would be set the effects would almost surely vary from one market to another depending on whether private plans cost more or less than the traditional fee for service medicare program mr gorman said that premium support would be a seismic change in medicare and could increase costs for many people in the traditional fee for service program fueling a big increase in enrollment in private medicare advantage plans enrollment in private plans is already on the rise having increased more than percent since adoption of the affordable care act in it is not just republicans who have expressed interest in the idea alice m rivlin who was the director of the white house office of management and budget under president bill clinton told congress in that she favored a bipartisan proposal for premium support because health plans and providers would then seek every possible way to provide higher quality care at a lower cost the nonpartisan medicare payment advisory commission which advises congress has explored the idea of premium support and endorsed the principle that medicare payments should be financially neutral that is equal for fee for service and medicare advantage in each market the congressional budget office analyzed two of the leading options and found that most beneficiaries who wished to remain in the fee for service program would pay much higher premiums on average under either alternative at the same time the budget office said the proposal could slow the growth of medicare spending
following up on a campaign promise that appealed directly to his rust belt base president elect donald j trump said thursday that he had reached out to the carrier air conditioner company in indiana to ask it not to move more than factory jobs from indiana to mexico in a post on twitter thursday morning mr trump said i am working hard even on thanksgiving trying to get carrier a c company to stay in the u s making progress will know soon during both the primary and general election campaigns mr trump frequently cited the february decision by carrier and its corporate parent united technologies to close two indiana factories and move production to mexico as an example of how nafta and other free trade agreements had failed american workers in a recent new york times article workers at one plant in indianapolis warned that they would withdraw their support for mr trump if he did not keep his promise to bring back overseas jobs the two plants a carrier factory employing more than workers in indianapolis and a united technologies plant with employees in huntington are profitable but pay workers to an hour about what the companys workers in monterrey mexico earn in a day in a time of slow economic growth and intense pressure from wall street to improve profits moving production south of the border seemed like too good of an opportunity for united technologies executives to pass up however a shaky video of the announcement on the carrier factory floor and the furious reaction of workers went viral in february it caught mr trumps attention prompting a furor throughout the campaign in a tweet thursday after mr trumps tweet carrier confirmed that the president elect had reached out but refused to say what steps if any management was now considering carrier has had discussions with the incoming administration and we look forward to working together the company said nothing to announce at this time for workers in indianapolis the twitter exchange provided a ray of hope on an otherwise anxious thanksgiving holiday everyone is posting about it on facebook and theres a lot of excitement said paul roell who has worked at carrier for years and was an enthusiastic supporter of mr trump in the election im a little more optimistic now he said others are saying lets see if hes really going to do this i was very surprised to see it on thanksgiving today mr roell added i figured hed be like everyone else today with his family not thinking of carrier earlier in the week indiana state officials had come to the factory to describe what benefits workers could expect as layoffs approach mr roell said the first production lines are expected to shut down in august if he can get them to stay here im all for it said robin maynard a trump supporter im hoping he can get stuff done and also save me from having to look for a new job other workers especially those who did not support mr trump in the election were more skeptical its baloney said jennifer shanklin hawkins who has worked at carrier for a decade and a half and earns over an hour well above what similar blue collar jobs pay in the area i could see him reaching out to carrier but i dont think anything will happen said ms shanklin hawkins who added that she reluctantly voted for hillary clinton this month he can try and talk to them and its good that he mentioned it but i think carrier will still leave
in the run up to the presidential election new york city was hardly trump territory and every time michael ricatto put another display of trump campaign signs up on the lawn of his sizable white house on abingdon road in kew gardens queens last summer they were stolen or knocked down actions that would later set off a series of events as unpredictable as the election itself infuriated by the thefts as well as an obscenity about donald j trump that had been spray painted on the public mailbox in front of his house mr ricatto installed a security camera it captured a grainy image of a sign stealer mr ricatto and a real estate investor then printed fliers bearing the image and a reward offer for information leading to the arrest of the sign thief he hired some local teenagers to post the signs around the neighborhood with tape when the tape ran out he said the teenagers used a stapler to post the fliers to trees on the streets the hubbub made the news and the stapling method was mentioned in the weeks that followed a team of enforcement officers from the parks department arrived at mr ricattos house he said and issued him summonses with fines totaling and citing unauthorized posting and minor tree damage to trees to mr ricatto his real transgression was supporting mr trump a republican which he claims annoyed democratic city officials lets call it staple gate said mr ricatto who calls himself a conservative a proud gun owner and a fan of ronald reagan and john wayne a supporter of mr trumps democratic opponent hillary clinton would never have been cited in this situation he fumed and said that official parks department signs are often affixed to trees with similar staples people in new york city dont like conservatives he said they wanted to teach me a lesson about being outspoken and about who i believe in so they found something to hang their hat on mr ricatto said he paid the summonses because i didnt want the headache of fighting them nor the expense of hiring a lawyer instead of backing down he splurged on a larger trump banner to hang in front of his house and he called the prominent civil rights lawyer ron kuby to see if he had any grounds to sue the city for damages claiming political bias in an interview mr kuby said that he thought the summons was a wild overreaction by the city but that a suit by mr ricatto claiming selective enforcement based on his trump leanings would be difficult case to make a parks department spokesman dismissed the claim that the summonses were political and called them a routine penalty for damage to the trees the fine had nothing to do with the content of the signs mr ricatto posted and everything to do with the fact that staples can damage and even kill trees the spokesman sam biederman said in a statement he added that the fine was determined by the citys administrative court and not based on the amount of damage or the cost associated but rather on the rule broken the order to cite mr ricatto set off something of a parallel episode within the parks department an enforcement supervisor ordered a sergeant to write the tickets but the sergeant joe oro refused arguing that it was improper to write summonses weeks after the signs had been removed with no witnesses to the violations they were bogus summonses said sergeant oro a veteran with years on the job i might as well hit every dog owner who puts up a lost puppy sign he said he also consulted a superior officer and he told me stay out of it its too political a rookie officer wound up writing the summons said sergeant oro who has had previous run ins with the agency as an outspoken member of his union local of dc the locals president joe puleo characterized department officials as using the officers as pawns for their political favoritism in this case sergeant oro said he was included in an email conversation about possibly forcing mr ricatto to pay in damage for the staple holes a proposition that an agency lawyer replied to incredulously in the email chain as for mr ricatto president elect trumps victory is a bit of revenge last week he bought and hung a new larger banner i told you so the banner reads trump trump trump trump

for his second book john pomfret a journalist with extensive experience in china has taken a microscope to an enormous subject the relationship between the united states and china from to the present with growing stress points in that relationship and the emergence of strongman leaders in both nations the book the beautiful country and the middle kingdom arrives during a precarious inflection point it is peppered with characters that mr pomfret uses to trace a long historical arc from howqua a cantonese tycoon to herbert yardley a prominent american cryptographer and henry m paulson jr the former united states treasury secretary mr pomfret is scheduled to speak about his book on tuesday at the politics and prose bookstore in washington in an interview he discussed the history of interactions between the united states and china president xi jinpings worldview and what china policy might emerge from the trump administration what has been the overarching paradigm of united states china relations from the century to now americans and chinese have been enchanting each other and disappointing each other since they first met in when the first u s ship landed in guangzhou with a cargo of american grown ginseng and silver to trade for tea if theres a pattern to the relationship it has been rapturous enchantment followed by despair right now americans are in the disenchantment phase of the cycle as are the chinese you tell many colorful anecdotes of americans and chinese in contact with each other which one do you think best reflects the wider story one of the main goals of the book was to bring to light stories of unchronicled influence on both sides the first american minister to the qing court in beijing was a young republican named anson burlingame burlingame was a radical abolitionist who was dispatched to beijing by the lincoln administration burlingame believed that the west needed to give china time to develop and modernize and stop pressuring china to change he believed that the west had no right to criticize for example the way china treated chinese christians and he argued that western officials should tolerate the chinese habit of maintaining that their emperor actually ruled the entire world to me burlingame encapsulates one side of the american view of china one that reappeared in the and lasted up through the beginning of the obama administration the idea or rather the bet that china would liberalize and become more like us as long as we facilitated its rise in opposition to burlingame other americans believed his views on china were as one of his successors in beijing put it a hallucination that also has formed a key part of the american perspective on china your book discusses the way governments in the two nations have interacted with each other but you also go into detail on the roles that notable nonpolitical figures have played to what extent does the united states china relationship depend on the attitudes of each countries leaders versus those of other citizens whether they are from the elite classes or the grass roots in many ways we and the chinese and our governments elites and those from the grass roots are captives of our past in the beginning of the relationship individual americans and chinese created the relationship and imbued it with much of its meaning american merchants and missionaries saw china as a vast market for stuff and for souls chinese saw america as a place that could save china from the depredations of other imperialist nations and with its world class educational system as a model for china to emulate at the same time other groups of americans feared the chinese and starting in the late oppressed chinese workers in america starting a long history of fearing the industriousness of the chinese chinese had their own prejudices against americans and american ideas as well viewing them as immoral sexually deviant and dangerous many of these dreams and nightmares fantasies and biases we have about each other have resurfaced in subsequent decades in donald trumps claim that china has been raping the united states when it comes to trade one can hear the populists of the california workingmens party in late century california railing on the streets of san francisco against the heathen chinese in your many years as a journalist in china what were the most notable changes you saw in the united states china relationship with chinas rise beijing is less willing to bend to washingtons will than before and more willing to aggressively pursue its interests whether they involve trade or the south china sea washington spent decades arguing that as china strengthened it would become more like a liberal western nation it hasnt turned out that way and as such the u s has stopped doing china any favors much more than before it is blocking the sales of western companies to chinese firms and strengthening its alliances with nations around chinas periphery the careful balance of containment and engagement that defined americas policy toward china is now heavily skewed toward containment what are your thoughts on president xi jinpings worldview and how the united states fits into that xi jinping has said he wants asians to rule asia which i think can be translated into a desire to see china rule asia in this view the u s is an interloper and would do best to retreat to hawaii and let china handle the western pacific china benefited greatly from the pax americana in the pacific but now xi feels that china does not need the u s to protect it anymore it wants the u s out of asia not next year not the year after but one day soon with the election of donald trump as the next united states president where do you see the relationship going trump is not an outlier when it comes to his views on china they are contradictory but so were obamas
washington president obama officially pardoned two turkeys on wednesday in an oddly mournful replaying of a white house thanksgiving ritual that not even his daughters attended standing in for the presidents two daughters were two nephews austin robinson and aaron robinson who unlike malia and sasha have not yet been turned cynical by washington mr obama joked they still believe in bad puns they still appreciate the grandeur of this occasion they still have hope at the mention of hope the crowd in the rose garden made up of family and friends getting perhaps one last visit to the white house grounds grew quiet and mr obamas staff gathered along the nearby colonnade looked grim mr obama has spent much of the last two weeks as a kind of crisis counselor trying to persuade his staff and hillary clintons supporters that donald j trumps victory will not spell disaster for mr obamas priorities or the nation and on wednesday the president was at his this will all be all right best the occasion was one of those somewhat odd white house traditions that become enshrined on the calendar in part because nobody quite knows how to kill them the notion that a pardon given to two turkeys out of million slaughtered for the thanksgiving holiday should be some kind of feel good event has always felt a bit off mr obama has long papered over the awkwardness with a speech peppered with puns but with his legacy on the chopping block this year even a few puns could not dispel the feeling of a new orleans funeral celebratory but with an underlying sadness i know there are some bad ones in here but this is the last time im doing this so were not leaving any room for leftovers mr obama said to some laughter putting aside the jokes mr obama spent part of his speech trumpeting his administrations accomplishments on jobs housing and health care it was a mini stump speech that most in the crowd had heard many times but they clapped with gusto nonetheless thats worth gobbling about mr obama said then he grew somber and gave one of what will be many goodbyes on this thanksgiving i want to express my sincere gratitude to the american people for the trust that youve placed in me over these last eight years and the incredible kindness that youve shown my family mr obama said on behalf of michelle and my mother in law and our girls we want to thank you so very very much he then dismissed the crowd with one last stab at good wordplay saying and so lets get on with the pardoning because its wednesday afternoon and everybody knows that thanksgiving traffic can put everybody in a foul mood
hillary clintons lead in the popular vote is growing she is roughly votes behind donald j trump in the key swing states of michigan and wisconsin a combined gap that is narrowing her impassioned supporters are now urging her to challenge the results in those two states and pennsylvania grasping at the last straws to reverse mr trumps decisive majority in the electoral college in recent days they have seized on a report by a respected computer scientist and other experts suggesting that michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin the keys to mr trumps electoral college victory need to manually review paper ballots to assure the election was not hacked were this years deviations from pre election polls the results of a cyberattack j alex halderman a computer science professor at the university of michigan who has studied the vulnerabilities of election systems at length wrote on medium on wednesday as the calls based on his conclusions mounted probably not more likely he wrote pre election polls were systematically wrong but the only way to resolve the lingering questions would be to examine paper ballots and voting equipment in critical states he wrote tellingly the pleas for recounts have gained no support from the clinton campaign which has concluded along with outside experts that it is highly unlikely the outcome would change even after an expensive and time consuming review of ballots but that has not quieted mrs clintons supporters who see the inequity of her growing lead in the national popular vote which is now more than two million votes or percent of all ballots cast according to the nonpartisan cook political report which regularly updates its count as states continue to tally and to certify votes since there is currently no effort to review the paper ballots which exist in michigan and wisconsin but only in parts of pennsylvania conspiracy theories about the election may live on for years after united states intelligence agencies accused russia of trying to influence the election by stealing and publishing emails from the democratic national committee and a range of other institutions and prominent individuals the united states went on high alert to determine if there was any attempt to sabotage the vote count so far no one in the obama administration has indicated that there is any such evidence in the three battleground states mrs clinton is behind by percent or less and the final results have not yet been certified uniting around the social media hashtag auditthevote the campaign after the campaign has picked up momentum among grass roots activists still mourning mr trumps victory and who echo paradoxically his pre election complaint that the vote was rigged based on the information of the intelligence community that russia was actively trying to screw around with our election i thought why not take the time and question this said michelle zuckerman parker an engineer in pittsburgh who on wednesday planned to petition her county election board for a recount of the nov vote that view spread quickly on social media on tuesday evening when new york magazine published an article about professor halderman and others who had contacted the remnants of the clinton campaign it also generated pushback by experts who said that even though it was theoretically possible to hack voting machines it would be enormously difficult because it would have to be highly targeted in key precincts and conducted on a scale required to assure mr trumps victory left wing conspiracy theories of vote rigging are pathetic dave wasserman of the cook political report said on twitter time may have already run out pennsylvania allows individual voters to petition for a recount but the deadline was sunday said wanda murren a spokeswoman for the pennsylvania department of state a candidate can also contest an election in court and the deadline is monday michigan and wisconsin have not reached their deadlines for seeking a recount but they will in days so far mrs clinton has not requested any action said reid magney a spokesman for the wisconsin elections commission until the publication of professor haldermans work clinton supporters had few reasons to hope he did not offer them much he noted that while the voting machines used in those states are not connected to the internet during the election they are programmed before the election the data is usually transferred on a usb stick or other data card if attackers can modify that software by infecting the machines with malware they can cause the machines to give any answer whatsoever professor halderman wrote the problem as bruce schneier a security expert who has written often on the issue noted in an interview is that the usual triggers for a recount a very close margin between two candidates make little sense in a world of state sponsored computer hackings a truly sophisticated hacking would result in a wider margin of victory that would not set off an automatic recount mrs clinton would have to triumph in all three states to win the electoral college the electors will meet in december to formally choose the president and there mr trump is ahead by votes to mrs clintons with michigan still officially uncalled as of wednesday mr trumps lead in michigan had shrunk to votes or percent according to the national popular vote tracker maintained by the cook political report mr trumps lead in wisconsin has narrowed to votes or percent in pennsylvania his lead slightly grew on wednesday to or percent the clinton campaign did not respond to requests for comment other democrats said it was time to move on im not sure its possible to undo the results and all the people are focusing their energy on opposing the worst ideas of this administration at this point not the legitimacy of the results said daniel doubet an organizer for keystone progress a liberal group in pennsylvania those pushing for a recount say they are trying to pick up the fight for a tired
washington when federal reserve officials convened just before the presidential election they talked like people who were ready to raise interest rates although they decided to wait a little longer they fretted about the growing risks of keeping borrowing costs at a historically low level according to an account of the meeting that the fed published on wednesday they also expressed confidence albeit with some reservations that the economy was ready for higher rates the exuberant reaction of financial markets to donald j trumps victory has strengthened the case for higher rates and solidified expectations that the fed will act at its next meeting in december the early november meeting was something of a placeholder the fed was seen as unlikely to move on the eve of the election officials had decided they were not quite ready to raise rates at their previous meeting in september and the account noted that they did not have much new data to consider but the latest meetings account portrays a sense of growing urgency among the members of the federal open market committee the fed committee that sets the course of monetary policy many judged that risks to economic and financial stability could increase over time if the labor market overheated appreciably or expressed concern that an extended period of low interest rates risked intensifying incentives for investors to reach for yield potentially leading to a mispricing of risk and misallocation of capital it said the account was published after a standard three week delay the fed said that the case for a rate increase had strengthened after the november meeting janet l yellen the feds chairwoman went a little further last week telling a congressional committee that an increase in the feds benchmark interest rate could well become appropriate relatively soon the meeting account is in the same key two officials voted to raise rates in november and the minutes said others were already convinced that the fed should move in december given its stated objectives moreover the account said most participants expressed a view that it could well become appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate relatively soon so long as incoming data provided some further evidence of continued progress toward the committees objectives markets have received the message some analysts warned before the election that mr trumps victory could upset financial markets and lead the fed to push back a rate increase so far the opposite has happened markets have rallied and expectations of a december rate increase have solidified the probability derived from asset prices stood at percent on wednesday investors are responding in part to mr trumps economic plans he has promised to collaborate with congressional republicans on a large tax cut and other measures intended to stimulate economic growth fed officials have all but begged for fiscal authorities to take a stronger hand in part because they are eager to dial back their own efforts and push rates up toward more normal levels yet the markets reaction to mr trumps victory also creates some new problems the timing and scope of these actions is still highly uncertain said james marple senior economist at td bank in the meantime interest and exchange rate sensitive sectors of the economy like housing and trade will take a hit suggesting some downside risk to economic growth the fed has kept its benchmark rate between and percent since last december the policy is intended to bolster economic activity by encouraging borrowing and risk taking but it has raised concerns that the fed is encouraging too much borrowing and risk taking in addition fed officials have concluded that labor market conditions are unlikely to further improve although the share of adults with jobs is significantly below the prerecession level the account takes pains to emphasize that the fed is planning a slow retreat and it sounded a cautionary note about the strength of growth in the third quarter the economy expanded at an annual rate of percent but fed officials pointed to a number of unusual factors including a boom in soybean exports excluding these factors underlying economic growth had been relatively modest the account said growth of consumer spending had slowed from its brisk pace earlier in the year residential investment had fallen again and business fixed investment had remained soft inflation has increased a little faster than the fed expected in recent months although it remains below the percent annual pace that the fed regards as healthy some officials advocating a rate increase argue that inflation will begin to rise more quickly as labor markets tighten that in turn could force the fed to raise rates more quickly potentially disrupting economic activity but the feds concerns about inflation remain relatively subdued ms yellen told congress last week that she saw little chance of a sharp rise in inflation the weakness of the global economy continues to weigh on domestic inflation in part by pushing up the value of the dollar mr trumps election also has pushed the dollar sharply higher

trump and mr obama in the oval office mr trump is working to reset his mercurial relationship with the media as he looks toward assuming office starting with this meeting at what he branded the failing new york times during his presidential campaign but he still nurses intense grievances toward news outlets in general and the times in particular here is more about mr trumps relationships with the news media and the times mr trump is hinting that even though federal law does not require him to do anything specific to separate himself from his vast business empire he is inclined to submit to some sort of voluntary standard of ethics that would avoid conflicts of interest or their appearance but he leaves open the possibility that there may not be a way to accomplish it this story has more about mr trumps business ties mr trump is correct that federal law for the most part exempts the president from conflict of interest rules meaning he is allowed to take actions that could benefit his financial holdings but in modern times most presidents have voluntarily put their financial assets into blind trusts mr trump has said he does not intend to take such a step instead will turn his companies over to his children read this story for more on mr trumps potential conflicts of interest the wall street journal editorial board among others has suggested that the only solution to mr trumps potential conflicts of interest is to sell off all of his assets and then have a blind trust reinvest the proceeds mr trump suggests that this is not practical mr trumps crowds at rallies frequently targeted hillary clinton chanting lock her up and referring to her as a criminal in july mr trump himself encouraged a crowd in colorado telling them im starting to agree with you as they chanted lock her up in addition despite mr trumps remarks here the f b i and the justice department which have investigated mrs clintons email server and the clinton foundation conduct criminal inquiries largely independently of the white house a president attempting to intervene in those kinds of inquiries in any direction would be a major scandal here is our full story about mr trumps reversal on prosecuting mrs clinton mr trump has been criticized for not specifically denouncing bigotry and groups that spread bigoted views his statements about such conduct tend to be vague including here when he says i disavow the group that nonspecific language has been comforting to leaders of the alt right a rebranded white nationalist movement including richard b spencer who led a gathering at a federal building near the white house last weekend that included some audience members offering a nazi salute mr trump here acknowledges perhaps for the first time that being president will perhaps help enrich his family he also concedes that the arrangement might fairly be called a conflict of interest back in february when he was still a candidate mr trump said definitively that torture was effective dont tell me it doesnt work torture works he told an audience in south carolina o k folks torture you know half these guys torture doesnt work believe me it works o k so mr trumps answer on tuesday offered a revealing insight into his willingness to shift or rethink a position especially after talking with someone he respects gen james n mattis may well be mr trumps secretary of defense and his rejection of torture clearly had an effect on the president elect the reality is more complicated the number of factories and the number of americans who work in factories both have declined sharply in recent decades but the nations manufacturing output is at the highest level in history the labor intensive production of low value goods like socks has been replaced by the largely automated production of high value goods like circuits in president ronald reagan signed a landmark law that prohibited the hiring of illegal immigrants provided new resources for enforcement along the mexican border and offered legal status to several million illegal immigrants experts say the law did little to slow migration to the united states but made crossing the border more difficult and dangerous premiums for many health plans under the affordable care act are increasing percent to percent or more but increases of percent are extremely rare deductibles for many plans are high but not for a family plan in the maximum out of pocket cost including the deductible is mr trumps comments about his fellow republicans had a sharp edge and an implicit message they owe their congressional majority to him and he expects to be treated accordingly whether this is true and to what extent will be one of the pivotal stories of the new trump administration and crucial to figuring out how much or how little he can get done he needs congress to achieve many of the campaign promises he made including the deep tax cut and large infrastructure spending package not to mention and it is an open question how in love with his policies republicans will prove to be read these stories for background on mr trumps relationships with republican leaders in congress and the never trump stalwarts who are pondering the future of the conservative movement mr trump suggests here that he may name jared kushner his son
at thanksgiving many of us will be subject to or subjecting our hosts to a wide range of opinions about the election but some aspects of it are rooted in fact not open to interpretation below we present a compendium of sorts about the election to help guide you in your discussions some of these may seem basic but they are by no means obvious to everyone dont let them get in the way of a good holiday argument hillary clinton definitely won the popular vote and that lead is only going to grow the new york times called the election for donald j trump at about a m on nov at that time he had about million votes almost a million more than hillary clinton even before then the signs pointed to her edge in the national popular vote most of the votes that remain uncounted are in heavily democratic places like california even roughly two weeks later the state estimated that it had about two million ballots yet to be counted including about in los angeles county where voters have preferred mrs clinton by around percentage points as the votes have trickled in the popular vote has tilted toward mrs clinton as of wednesday morning that lead surpassed two million votes or percentage points better than mr trump this lead is still growing but its already a larger margin than in popular vote victories by al gore in richard nixon in and john f kennedy in turnout in the election was not low it is about the same as it was in and comparable to most century presidential elections turnout is simple to calculate take the total number of votes cast and divide it by the total number of adults who are eligible to vote and presto you have a turnout rate when the race was called this math problem yielded a rate that was indeed historically low it was also wrong for the same reason mrs clinton trailed in the popular vote at that time not all the ballots had been counted because the denominator in this math problem the number of voting eligible adults on election day does not change the turnout rate goes up every time ballots are counted as they have come in the turnout rate has risen to about percent michael mcdonald at the united states elections project estimates that it will ultimately be closer to percent a bit lower than it was in and roughly comparable to most presidential elections in the last years yes the polls were off but not in extraordinary ways mrs clinton held a modest but steady lead in nearly every national poll for months and led most state polls in florida north carolina pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin yet she lost in each of these states so how wrong were the polls on average by about percentage points in the closest states thats higher than in any election in decades but comparable to polling misses in and the polling miss much larger because the places where mrs clinton fared worse than polls suggested were concentrated in a few battleground states the places where she fared better than expected were in big liberal states where she had almost no chance of losing nationally these effects nearly canceled out which is why her national polling lead before the election three to four points ended up being close to the result third party candidates like gary johnson and jill stein may have cost mrs clinton michigan but they almost certainly did not cost her the presidency the total vote tally says about percent of all voters about million people voted for mr johnson or ms stein in four battleground states that mrs clinton lost florida pennsylvania wisconsin and michigan the votes for these third party candidates exceeded mr trumps margin of victory if those states had flipped mrs clinton would be president are third party voters responsible for the trump presidency almost certainly not with the exception of michigan third party voters would have had to overwhelmingly favor mrs clinton to flip the state that notion also rests on a significant number of third party voters coming to the polls but many of them told pollsters that they would have stayed home if they could not have voted for their third party candidate if we look at mr trumps margin of victory in these four states and the number of votes cast for mr johnson or ms stein were left with a simple math problem if those candidates did not exist what share of those votes would mrs clinton have needed to pick up to overtake mr trumps vote lead the answer a substantial share might these voters really have preferred mrs clinton to mr trump to this degree and showed up to the polls at higher rates than they told pollsters they would its possible but for that vote to be decisive pennsylvania or florida and at least one other state would have had to flip the evidence we have suggests such an outcome would have been highly unlikely if anything the johnson vote could have easily leaned toward mr trump exit polls are useful but dont give them too much credence as my colleague nate cohn has written exit polls are helpful but using them to come to conclusions about the precise composition of the electorate is risky and frequently wrong in they painted a picture of the electorate that was younger and more diverse than it really was many important questions remain about precisely who voted and why did poor democratic turnout doom mrs clinton or were swing voters the key to mr trumps win did mr trump really do better among hispanic voters than mitt romney further analysis of the voter files which show who voted and who didnt will provide more clarity in the months ahead exit polls alone are not a definitive way to answer these questions but a few things as weve tried to
donald j trump has said climate change is a hoax created by the chinese to get the united states to suppress its manufacturing sector that prompted a public rebuttal last week from a chinese official attending a climate summit meeting in marrakesh morocco on tuesday mr trump appeared to back away from the strict climate denier viewpoint embraced by many republicans in an interview with the new york times saying that there was some connectivity between human activity and climate change he also said he wanted to keep an open mind about whether to pull the united states out of the paris agreement the main global climate change accord mr trumps opacity means it is unclear whether he will actually support policies to limit the effects of climate change after being sworn in as president in january but officials from china which has surpassed the united states as the worlds largest emitter of greenhouse gas have said they will move forward on climate policies without the americans if it comes to that on tuesday michael r bloomberg the media tycoon and former mayor of new york city said that american cities would continue to enact climate policies no matter what mr trump and the federal government decided to do mr bloomberg made his remarks in washington at a talk hosted by the china general chamber of commerce they were adapted for an op ed article published tuesday by bloomberg view under the headline washington wont have last word on climate change mr bloomberg a longtime advocate for action on climate change praised xie zhenhua chinas climate envoy for saying china remained committed to tackling the issue thats a responsible thing to do for the chinese people and the world he said mr bloomberg added that if mr trump decided to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement then he would urge the mayors of cities in the united states who see the need to fight climate change to join the agreement following is a central passage from mr bloombergs op ed article i cant tell you what donald trumps administration will do and in all fairness they will need time to figure it out themselves whats said on the campaign trail is one thing actually carrying out a specific policy is another i hope theyll recognize the importance of the issue but i am confident that no matter what happens in washington no matter what regulations the next administration adopts or rescinds no matter what laws the next congress may pass we will meet the pledges that the u s made in paris the reason is simple cities businesses and citizens will continue reducing emissions because they have concluded just as china has that doing so is in their own self interest the u s s success in fighting climate change has never been primarily dependent on washington bear in mind over the past decade congress has not passed a single bill that takes direct aim at climate change yet at the same time the u s has led the world in reducing emissions that progress has been driven by cities businesses and citizens and none of them are letting up now just the opposite all are looking for ways to expand their efforts mayors and local leaders around the country are determined to keep pushing ahead on climate change mr bloombergs remarks dovetail with recent ones made by american mayors who say their cities will defy potential policies from mr trump on critical issues among others the mayors of new york chicago seattle philadelphia and washington have said their cities will be immigrant sanctuaries that do not cooperate with united states immigration and customs enforcement in his visit with reporters and editors at the new york times on tuesday mr trump said of the paris agreement im looking at it very closely i have an open mind to it in addressing the climate issue he also said clean air is vitally important mr trump appeared to be confusing the issues of climate change and air pollution carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change do not cause smog it is buildup of particulate matter that leads to toxic air a severe problem in chinese cities greenhouses gases and particulate matter can both come from the same source in many cases industrial coal burning so any policies to limit the use of coal helps with both issues the united states and china have made pledges to curb the use of coal mr bloomberg concluded the op ed article published tuesday with this thought washington will not have the last word on the fate of the paris agreement in the u s mayors will together with business leaders and citizens
luther helland stood on a platform in the middle of the river and surveyed his dam it was in bad shape several of the panels that kept the water back were missing while others were out of true weeks of work stretched before him compounded by the vagaries of the river mr helland is master of lock and dam no on the ohio river that makes him responsible for billions of dollars worth of cargo and the operation of countless factories power plants farms and refineries east of the mighty mississippi by extension then he is responsible for the livelihoods of millions of americans built in lock no sits in a quiet corner of southern illinois that happens to be the busiest spot on americas inland waterways where traffic from the eastern united states meets and passes traffic from the gulf coast and the mississippi river more than million tons of grain coal fuel and other goods worth over billion move through here each year it wouldnt seem like it but this is more stressful than when i was in the military said mr helland a farm boy from wisconsin who worked as an army welder and machinist in south korea before he took this job lock no is a serious bottleneck in innumerable supply chains nationwide it is emblematic of the nations crumbling transportation infrastructure coast to coast including locks ports highways and railroads president elect donald j trump has said he will spend trillion on infrastructure but how the money will be raised remains unclear to avoid raising taxes or increasing debt his plan calls for much of the money to come from the private sector with a proposed tax credit offered in return funding might also come from taxes on repatriated money as companies receive incentives to return cash that they have been accumulating overseas even with a tax credit though companies building roads or locks would want a return on their investment most likely in the form of toll collection said mike toohey president of the waterways council an advocacy group for the river shipping industry his industry is not in favor of a toll he said still he is optimistic that spending on inland waterways will increase under a new administration the average delay at no in october and november was to hours at the moment no sister dam downriver no is adding more hours to the wait dealing with both dams it can take five days to travel just miles on this stretch of the ohio river and if something goes wrong at either one which does happen the delay can build to a week or more on sept for instance all river traffic stopped for an additional hours while emergency repairs were made to no dam no and no have been waiting to be blown up since when a new mega dam near olmsted ill was supposed to be finished authorized in the project is now wildly over budget and decades behind schedule what was supposed to cost million and be finished in will now most likely cost billion and be operational in october at the earliest capt david stansbury was in the pilot house of the towboat william hank which was tied to a fleet of barges near metropolis ill waiting for its turn to pass through lock what would happen if both lanes of interstate were completely shut down for three or four days he asked youre talking total gridlock in a major metropolitan area this is the equivalent of that right now the inland waterways are out of most americans sights and minds if does fail or one of the other locks fails and you cut off half the united states from their barge traffic then youll see a public outcry mr stansbury said he explained if corn cannot get to the factories the price of any grain based product will go up and people will say what do you mean ive got to pay for a box of cornflakes are you out of your mind a towboat and its barges need at least nine feet of water to stay afloat to guarantee this depth from say pittsburgh to cairo ill a distance of miles the united states army corps of engineers built dams the dams make pools each pool is like a step climbing from sea level to the appalachians say or st paul to get from one step to another boats use water elevators called locks that raise anything that floats from one pool to another before the locks and dams many rivers in the united states were low enough to walk across during dry months on an overcast september morning the william hank was pushing barges two tankers of soybean oil one barge of dry cement one barge of aluminum ingots three barges of scrap steel four barges of iron ingots one barge of wheat and one of grain a total of tons of cargo worth around million most towboats push a barge tow which holds the equivalent of train cars or truckloads there is a lot at stake when this much stuff is late in a low orange trimmed building on the outskirts of paducah ky are the offices of tennessee valley towing which owns the william hank gordon southern the companys senior vice president calculated that the hour river closure on sept cost him around his company is just one of dozens we call that bleeding said harley hall tennessee valley towings vice president for operations if failed all that tonnage that passes through here each way it would have to move on rail and road and the rail cars arent there and theres no room on the highways theres no way to bypass this domestically trucks moved five times as many goods by weight as ships or barges did in trains moved twice as much as was moved via water and planes moved far less but percent of all international trade moved via water
elton john will not perform at donald j trumps inauguration in january contrary to a report from a member of mr trumps transition team a publicist for the singer said on wednesday anthony scaramucci the member of the presidential transition team made the claim during an interview on the bbc program hardtalk this week but fran curtis the publicist for the british singer issued a strong denial by email incorrect he will not be performing mr scaramucci who founded the investment firm skybridge capital and has referred to himself as a gay rights activist used his appearance on the bbc show to discuss his own stance on same sex marriage he said that mr trump shared his views a snippet of that interview was subsequently published by the new york post which also initially reported mr scaramuccis claim that mr john planned to perform on jan in washington this will be the first american president in u s history that enters the white house with a pro gay rights stance mr scaramucci said on the show elton john is going to be doing our concert on the mall for the inauguration the post later said that mr john had denied its initial report emails and telephone calls requesting comment from mr scaramucci were not immediately returned but on wednesday afternoon he admonished someone on twitter who suggested he had lied about mr johns appearance lets drop the rhetoric mr scaramucci wrote it was an honest impression that i got wrong it was a fast paced interview and you can see i thought it was true mr johns denial is the second false alarm in a week involving mr trumps inaugural entertainment prospects on saturday the musician vince neil said that his invitation to play at the inauguration had been rescinded after mr trump won the election on the campaign trail mr trump had few a list celebrity supporters its still unclear who will perform at the inauguration no major musician has stepped forward but ted nugent loretta lynn and kid rock were among those who voiced their enthusiasm for mr trumps candidacy securing a performance by mr john would have been a long shot he performed at a fund raiser for hillary clinton mr trumps opponent last month mr john a longtime activist and the founder of the elton john aids foundation has been an outspoken critic of mr trumps the singer told the news site mic in october that the possibility of a trump victory made him fear for the world when it came to helping raise awareness of and spurring activism for treating and curing h i v hell marginalize people hes already doing it mr john said the daily beast reported in february that two of mr johns hits rocket man and tiny dancer were among mr trumps preferred songs to play on the campaign trail mr john suggested to the guardian that asking mr nugent to use his music might be a better choice
if you think back to this years presidential campaign and recall a lot of articles mentioning hillary clintons email troubles and donald j trumps various controversies you wouldnt be wrong if it seems there were fewer articles about jobs the economy and taxes thats because there were the temptation to blame news organizations for this imbalance is strong but there is at least some reason to resist it critics have long assailed campaign coverage as focused too much on candidate personality campaign strategy and assessments of whos winning instead of on policies and ideas but this year the candidates share the blame i compared the content of campaign ads with the content of news articles about two specific topics candidate traits or characteristics and the economy or jobs both the candidates and news organizations spent more time discussing the candidates fitness for office than they did the nations economy and the imbalance grew more lopsided as the election approached using analytic tools provided by crimson hexagon i categorized the campaign news coverage of media outlets this consisted of four broadcast networks three cable news networks national public radio and hugh hewitt on the radio two online news sites and newspapers i specifically searched for news about mrs clintons campaign and her email server or her campaign and wikileaks and several controversies connected to mr trumps campaign i also looked for news about the candidates campaign appeals on the economy and jobs this list isnt exhaustive but it gives a sense of the trade off between coverage of these controversies and the economy the candidates controversies received more coverage on average than their views on the economy from june until election day percent of the stories mentioned mr trumps various missteps and percent mentioned mrs clintons email only percent mentioned mr trump and jobs or the economy and only percent cited mrs clintons campaign and the economy closer to the election from oct on the numbers got even more lopsided this was an important date just after the release of the access hollywood video and a few weeks before f b i director james b comeys letter to congress from this point percent of the campaign articles mentioning either controversies or the economy discuss mrs clintons email while only percent mention her alongside jobs or the economy as for mr trump percent mention his entanglements while percent mention him related to jobs and the economy the imbalance in coverage of the candidates character is striking as is the lack of coverage about the economy compared with the controversies moving one week past the video release between oct and election day roughly half of the stories about scandals and the economy mentioned mrs clintons emails and only a quarter discussed mr trump and his imbroglios a mere percent of the stories in these last three weeks mentioned mrs clinton and the economy these choices have consequences according to the gallup organization americans reports of what they heard or read about mrs clinton between june and september were mainly references to her handling of emails during her time as secretary of state in contrast mentions of mr trump changed week by week tracking what was happening on the campaign trail but before anyone blames the news media its important to examine what the candidates themselves were talking about over the course of the campaign if media reports reflect candidate discourse accurately then it is not merely the media choosing to report on scandals it might be at least as much the candidates choosing to campaign on them that results in unending coverage of traits and characteristics to figure out if this was the case i used data from kantar media cmag on all the candidates campaign ads aired between june and election day i coded all of the appeals in each ad and weighted the appeals by how many times the ads ran on television mrs clinton made more ads than mr trump and she vastly out advertised him running nearly three times as many ads as he did all told over half a million ads were run in during this period the content of the ads is revealing both candidates spent most of their television advertising time attacking the other persons character in fact the losing candidates ads did little else more than three quarters of the appeals in mrs clintons advertisements were about traits characteristics or dispositions only percent of mrs clintons appeals in her ads were about jobs or the economy by contrast percent of mr trumps appeals focused on the economy jobs taxes and trade since the start of presidential campaign television advertising in no campaign has made percent of its television ad appeals about any single topic on average traits typically garner about percent of the appeals the economy typically generates about percent of the appeals theres usually much more balance of course this was an unusual election year with two very unpopular candidates so the candidates flaws may have simply been too big a story for either them or the media to pass up whatever the reason the criterion of fitness for office dominated the clinton campaigns messaging and made up a good share of the trump messaging as well and the news media covered it
q what were your early years like were you in leadership roles early on a my dad was in the air force and we moved around a lot there was a stretch when i went to a different school every year we lived in san antonio before i went to college i learned a lot from being in a marching band i was playing trumpet and it was a piece marching band exactly like in friday night lights i became a section leader and we would get up at in the morning and do all our drills when it was still dark then i went to stanford where i had a lot of great leadership opportunities as a sophomore i ran the kitchen for our dormitory another guy and i had a budget of about a year and we were responsible for feeding people and hiring staff when you were younger did you mind moving so often i dont remember kicking or screaming i always just thought it was a pretty good adventure im pretty adaptable im good at packing and unpacking tell me more about your parents they both have a good sense of humor and like jokes and humors a big part of what i value and how i lead and theyre both analytical moms an accountant dad was a physics major but then became an engineer i remember when i was in second grade we needed a new tv all my friends would just go to the store and buy one but my dad bought a heathkit and we had to put together the parts i remember being mortified and saying dad why cant we go buy a tv like everybody else but in retrospect it taught me that everything is made by people we look at our technology now like iphones and i think a lot of people see them as magical obelisks from the mountains that steve jobs bestows on us early leadership lessons for you i didnt understand the role of simplicity and messaging early on one of the things that happened at one of my start ups was that i would get bored saying the same thing every day so i decided to change it up a little bit but then everybody had a different idea of what i thought because i was mixing it up so my big lesson was the importance of a simple message and saying it the same way over and over if youre going to change it change it in a big way and make sure everyone knows its a change otherwise keep it static you spend a lot of your time meeting with c e o s to decide whether to invest in their companies how do you assess them one is sort of a context free assessment which is who is this person and how do they behave the other is a contextual assessment which is am i any good for this person there are some amazing c e o s who i just dont know how to interact with because of stylistic differences you have to have both because you want to make good investments but you also want to make good investments where you can work with the person i ask a lot of questions but i almost dont care what the questions are when people start talking about their business plan ill say what about this what about this what about this you start to expand the scope of the questions to try to see two things one is the quality of their thought process and the other is how they interact with you do they become defensive do they become aggressive are they listening youre trying to get a sense of whether in a complicated situation with a lot of things going on can they be honest and candid and still get to a productive place sometimes you get honest and candid and sometimes you get antagonistic or defensive as a v c ill meet with probably companies a year and ill invest in two of them the context of those meetings is highly variable and the power dynamics are all bizarre because you come into this minute crucible moment you have to go out of your way to make sure that your questioning is understood when i was a v c at first i would just ask my questions and kind of poke poke poke poke and now ill say look im going to ask some things and this might be kind of awkward but im just going to say it and lets work our way through it and it doesnt mean i dont believe in you and your company i just want to understand where you are and what you think im going to ask some things and they might be wrong but lets figure some things out together the one thing thats profoundly different about being a v c compared to an operator is that v c s talk a lot about fomo fear of missing out you turn things down all the time and you worry what did i miss and what did i get wrong as an operator you focus percent on what youre doing as a v c you wonder what youre not doing its a difference in perspective what career and life advice do you give to new college grads one is to use the words of my colleague reid hoffman at greylock find your tribe you should look around and figure out whose team youre on and whose team youre not on and for the people whose team you want to be on you need to invest in those relationships and treat them well and spend time with them the choices you make on who you stand with and who you stand against will matter the other thing i would say is to stay close to professions that create and make things and stay

it would make the job i am doing much easier were working very hard we have great people coming in i think youll be very impressed with the names well be announcing some very shortly everybody wanted to do this people are giving up tremendous careers in order to be subject to you folks and subject to a lot of other folks but theyre giving up a lot i mean some are giving up tremendous businesses in order to sit for four or maybe eight or whatever the period of time is but i think were going to see some tremendous talent tremendous talent coming in we have many people for every job i mean no matter what the job is we have many incredible people i think reince you can sort of just confirm that the quality of the people is very good reince priebus mr trumps choice for chief of staff inaudible trump were trying very hard to get the best people not necessarily people that will be the most politically correct people because that hasnt been working so we have really experts in the field some are known and some are not known but theyre known within their field as being the best thats very important to me you know ive been given a great honor its been very tough its been months of brutality in a true sense but we won it we won it pretty big the final numbers are coming out or i guess theyre coming out michigans just being confirmed but the numbers are coming out far beyond what anybodys wildest expectation was i dont know if it was us i mean we were seeing the kind of crowds and kind of everything the kind of enthusiasm we were getting from the people as you probably know i did many many speeches that last four week period i was just telling arthur that i went around and did speeches in the pretty much different places that were the massive crowds we were getting if we had a stadium that held and most of you many of you were there that held people wed have people outside that couldnt get in so we came up with a good system we put up the big screens outside with a very good loudspeaker system and very few people left i would do during the last month two or three a day thats a lot because thats not easy when you have big crowds those speeches thats not an easy way of life doing three a day then i said the last two days i want to do six and seven and im not sure anybody has ever done that but we did six and we did seven and the last one ended at oclock in the morning in michigan and we had people or inside and the rest outside this massive place in grand rapids i guess and it was an incredible thing and i left saying how do we lose michigan i dont think we can lose michigan and the reason i did that it was set up only a little while before because we heard that day that hillary was hearing that theyre going to lose michigan which hasnt been lost in years or something but years and they didnt want to lose michigan so they went out along with president obama and michelle bill and hillary they went to michigan late that sort of late afternoon and i said lets go to michigan it wasnt on the schedule so i finished up in new hampshire and at oclock i went to michigan we got there at oclock we started speaking around actually and we had people and i said really i mean there are things happening but we saw it everywhere so we felt very good we had great numbers and we thought were going to win we thought we were going to win florida we thought we were going to win north carolina we did easily pretty easily we thought strongly we were going to win pennsylvania the problem is nobody had won it and it

a federal judge in texas issued a nationwide injunction on tuesday against an obama administration regulation expanding by millions the number of workers who would be eligible for time and a half overtime pay the regulation was scheduled to take effect on dec it would raise the salary limit below which workers automatically qualified for overtime pay to from the judge amos l mazzant iii of the eastern district of texas ruled that the obama administration had exceeded its authority by raising the overtime salary limit so significantly the ruling was hailed by business groups who argued the new rules would be costly and result in fewer hours for workers the labor department said it strongly disagreed with the decision and was considering all of our legal options raising the possibility of an appeal in the waning days of the obama administration ross eisenbrey of the economic policy institute whose writings on the subject helped shape the administrations regulation called the ruling a disappointment to millions of workers who are forced to work long hours with no extra compensation while the injunction is only a temporary measure that suspends the regulation until the judge can issue a ruling on the merits many said the judges language indicated he was likely to strike down the regulation we are assuming that this preliminary injunction holds and there isnt an appeal or some other thing that disrupts it done with this regulation said marc freedman executive director of labor law policy at the u s chamber of commerce which had challenged the rule the fate of the regulation had already been thrown into question by the election of donald j trump as president two weeks ago mr trump has promised to reverse many regulations approved during the obama administration and the republican congress has generally criticized the scope of the expansion of overtime eligibility still because undoing the regulation could have required a months or yearslong rule making process similar to the one that produced it the new overtime limit appeared likely to survive in some form some business lobbyists had anticipated a legislative compromise that phased in the new limit over a longer period of time and eliminated an automatic increase in the limit every three years the injunction would appear to make such a reprieve far less likely although the question remains whether the trump administration will seek a legislative deal that would raise the salary limit above the that has prevailed since but below the obama administrations preferred level theres no question that this decision changes a number of different points of leverage over the future of the rule said david french senior vice president for government relations at the national retail federation which opposed the new rule mr french added however that his group and many other business organizations were open to some increase in the limit were years past the last update he said supporters of the regulation have observed that the politics of essentially withdrawing a planned salary increase from many workers could prove complicated for an incoming president elected on a message of improving workers economic circumstances further complicating the picture is the fact that many large employers have already raised the pay of some employees over the new limit concluding that it would be more cost effective than paying them overtime it is rare for employers to reverse such pay increases making large employers potentially sympathetic to an overtime compromise that would effectively extend the salary increase to some of their smaller rivals tuesdays ruling arose from a case filed by a coalition of states who argued that the administration had exceeded its statutory authority in raising the overtime salary limit so significantly a large number of business groups filed a similar lawsuit and the suits were later consolidated in his ruling judge mazzant whom president obama appointed agreed with that logic and appeared to go even further suggesting that the administration lacked the authority even to establish a salary limit which the labor department has raised repeatedly since congress enacted the underlying legislation in the courts decision suggests that the department of labor has no authority whatsoever to regulate a salary minimum said allan s bloom of the law firm proskauer rose in a statement the labor department defended how the rule was created the departments overtime rule is the result of a comprehensive inclusive rule making process and we remain confident in the legality of all aspects of the rule the statement said
washington struggling to respond to donald j trumps victory a group of shellshocked democrats moved swiftly to endorse representative keith ellison of minnesota for chairman of the democratic national committee hoping that he would be a fresh face for a party with a depleted bench but after steadily adding endorsements from leading democrats in his bid to take over the party mr ellison is encountering resistance from a formidable corner the white house in a sign of the discord gripping the party president obamas loyalists uneasy with the progressive mr ellison have begun casting about for an alternative according to multiple democratic officials close to the president the battle pits the titans of the democratic party against one another with mr obamas camp at odds with figures like chuck schumer the new senate democratic leader and senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts mr obamas advisers some of whom discussed the party leadership race at a white house meeting last week have talked about whether labor secretary thomas e perez and former gov jennifer granholm of michigan would be willing to run for the post mr perez met with vice president joseph r biden jr last week and had lunch tuesday in the white house mess with valerie jarrett mr obamas senior adviser while also visiting with david simas mr obamas political director some in mr obamas circle were even holding out hope that mr biden himself could be persuaded to step into the chairmanship as a unifying force for a party reeling after losing the presidency and making scant gains in the house and senate but mr bidens office said tuesday that he was not interested in being d n c chair though he plans to remain deeply involved in helping shape the direction of the democratic party moving forward the tumultuous tenure of representative debbie wasserman schultz who was forced out as party leader in july convinced a wide range of democrats that whoever takes over the committee must make it their sole focus theres too much at stake for us not to have somebody working in a full time capacity said michael blake a new york assemblyman and veteran of both of mr obamas campaigns who is considering a d n c vice chairmanship this has to be your priority but there are other reasons for the discomfort with mr ellison that illustrate lingering divisions after a bruising presidential primary fight and a general election in which hillary clinton suffered deep losses among working class whites and could not match mr obamas support among young and nonwhite voters some democrats in mr obamas orbit and beyond say that elevating mr ellison would amount to handing the party to senator bernie sanders of vermont mrs clintons primary race opponent and his liberal followers mr ellison was a high profile backer of mr sanderss presidential campaign and mr sanders has been rallying support for mr ellisons d n c bid already a polarizing figure among democrats he ignited new controversy this week by saying the party needed to go beyond identity politics its not good enough for someone to say im a woman vote for me mr sanders told students in boston on sunday a comment widely seen as a criticism of mrs clinton no thats not good enough what we need is a woman who has the guts to stand up to wall street to the insurance companies to the drug companies to the fossil fuel industry this call for an economic centered brand of liberalism is what galvanized so many of his supporters but his blunt language also served to remind some democrats of the divisive primary race there is little appetite for a replay of that fight in the d n c race which will be decided by members of the committee when they gather in february for their winter meeting some top democrats had hoped to pre empt a contest by backing mr ellisons bid mr schumer ms warren and an array of house members and unions were lining up behind him even before he formally entered the race but along with his inability to do the job full time and his links to mr sanders mr ellisons past criticism of mr obama and praise for louis farrakhan the nation of islam leader worry some democrats looking for a figure to lead the opposition to mr trump mr ellison a muslim defended mr farrakhan in the saying he was not an anti semite and has positioned himself on the left flank of congressional democrats on israel jonathan greenblatt the head of the anti defamation league called mr ellison an important ally in the fight against anti semitism but said he had taken positions on the israeli palestinian conflict on which we strongly differ and that concern us we hope that all candidates for this post will make clear where they stand on these issues and that the democratic national committee will make a choice that affirms the longstanding bipartisan consensus on a strong u s israel relationship he said aides to mr ellison were going to make him available for a telephone interview but then declined when informed that he would be asked about his past comments on mr farrakhan they emailed a list of his links to the jewish community and a statement that said democrats need an organizer who will energize the grass roots across this country to build the party from the bottom up a handful of state democratic leaders have entered or are considering entering the race and howard dean the former vermont governor and d n c chairman has also expressed interest but it is mr perez a son of dominican immigrants whom many prominent democrats would like to see enter the race and who appears most willing to consider it the a f l c i o has been considering an endorsement of mr ellison but delayed its decision in part because organized labor has a good relationship with mr perez

houston before the election gun rights activists were so worried hillary clinton would win the presidency that some of them bought extra ammunition and guns fearing a crackdown on certain weapons bullets and magazines theyre not worried now instead since the election of donald j trump gun advocates have been rejoicing crowing about their political clout and plotting ways to eliminate many remaining curbs on gun ownership and use as they await one of the most vocal pro gun presidential candidates ever to enter the white house weve been threatened weve been bullied weve been ridiculed for eight years said alice tripp legislative director of the texas state rifle association the state affiliate of the national rifle association i expect the tone to change if tone sets policy then weve got it made it was more than just the outcome of the presidential race gun advocates played a role in flipping the state senate in iowa from blue to red and helped defeat a ballot initiative in maine that would have required universal background checks for gun sales the national rifle association spent million in seven races this year by supporting mr trump and six republican senate candidates and it lost only one race in nevada according to an analysis by the center for responsive politics and the trace a nonprofit news outlet that covers gun violence smart politicians all across the country are realizing that if we dont play ball with the second amendment we will find ourselves unemployed said aaron dorr executive director of iowa gun owners whose members distributed information about candidates perceived as hostile to the second amendment in five state senate districts in each the democratic incumbent lost in kansas and indiana voters approved amendments enshrining the right to hunt and fish in their constitutions and in maine david trahan executive director of the sportsmans alliance of maine which opposed the ballot question on universal background checks there said concerns about restricting lawful gun transfers and a sense that outsiders were dictating maines political process had led to a backlash the measure was backed by everytown for gun safety a group founded in part by michael r bloomberg a former mayor of new york supporters of gun control said the national situation was more nuanced than the gun activists jubilation suggested they said it was impossible to say what role gun issues had played in mr trumps victory and disputed that the election was a national referendum on gun rights of the four high profile state ballot measures gun control advocates won three and lost one in maine in washington state voters passed an initiative allowing for emergency court orders to temporarily block the right to possess a gun for people perceived as being at a higher risk of harming themselves or another person californians passed a measure requiring background checks to buy ammunition and nevada voters approved a ballot measure requiring background checks for almost all gun transfers beyond what is required by federal law jennifer crowe who campaigned for the background check measure in nevada known as question said concerns about homicides and unchecked online gun sales had helped her side win despite opposition the more we spoke about the online marketplace and how robust it is the more people seemed to understand the importance of question as a public safety measure ms crowe said erika soto lamb a spokeswoman for everytown for gun safety which supported the ballot items in maine washington state and nevada said the only true referendums on how americans view the issue of gun safety are the ballot measures she said the open discussion of gun control in the campaign and the state level wins suggested that what has long been considered a third rail issue was in fact a winning issue gun rights advocates say just the opposite calling mrs clintons defeat a sign that gun control is an untouchable issue and anticipating an expansion of gun rights with a trump administration and a republican majority congress one of the policies being discussed would lift the restrictions that prohibit service members on military bases and at recruiting centers from being armed weapons rules at most military bases and centers prohibit service members who are not police or security personnel from carrying firearms and mr trump has said he supports banning so called gun free zones on military bases the issue gained new attention after shootings at military sites including at fort hood tex and in chattanooga tenn if nidal hasan had had somebody shoot him back he might have hurt and even killed a few people but he wouldnt have killed as many as he did said valente gonzalez an administrator for the advocacy group open carry texas in the houston area referring to the gunman who killed people at fort hood in disarming law abiding people invites chaos other policies include a national right to carry which would allow those with concealed handgun permits in one state to have their permits honored in the other states such a move known as national reciprocity also has the backing of mr trump there is also a push to make silencers easier and less costly to purchase by removing them from the national firearms act we want broad deregulation of firearms said dudley brown the president of the national association for gun rights its high time republican majorities in the executive and legislative branches come in and make some broad broad changes as the saying goes dance with the ones who brung ya some gun owners were as surprised as anyone by mr trumps upset victory c j grisham a retired army sergeant and the president of open carry texas bought two ar rifles and an ammunition making kit shortly before the election out of concern about a possible clinton victory a lot of people in the gun rights community can breathe again he said i dont think anybody is complaining that they went and bought extra guns mr
the election has resurrected the fiasco of how to fix fannie mae and freddie mac shares of the two bailed out mortgage agencies have rocketed over the last two weeks on hopes that the trump administration might end government oversight big political roadblocks remain though fannie and freddie which buy or guarantee home loans needed billion of taxpayer aid in the financial crisis and were placed under government conservatorship debates about whether to reduce their role went nowhere because they play a large role in the year mortgage market allowing them to shake off their government training wheels is a long way off even representative jeb hensarling a republican and the house financial services committee chairman reckons his plan to do so is a long shot worries about hurting the housing market and in turn angering voters are strong enough that some republican lawmakers would probably join their democratic rivals in opposing any such attempt there is one relatively easy tweak though that could please most sides allowing fannie and freddie to keep their earnings since they have been forced to hand over all profit as dividends to the treasury so far they have sent billion none of which counts toward repaying the bailout that would allow them to rebuild their capital they currently have just million each set aside against a total of trillion of loans on their books and that is scheduled to fall to zero in that raises the embarrassing prospect of one or both of them having to go cap in hand to uncle sam for another bailout in even a mild housing downturn avoiding that ought to appeal to lawmakers william a ackman john paulson and other hedge fund managers who bought fannie and freddie stock after the crash have been pushing for this for some time too including in the courts donald j trumps ascendancy to the white house has emboldened them not least because steven mnuchin a former goldman sachs partner who is a leading candidate to become treasury secretary was a co investor with mr paulson in the mortgage lender indymac recapitalizing it after its collapse and selling it last year to cit ending fannie and freddies status as an a t m for the government would still leave their bailout unpaid and their future status unresolved but it would be a smart first step
vilnius lithuania lawmakers in lithuania chose as their new prime minister on tuesday a former police chief and interior minister who supports donald j trumps call for nato members to spend more on defense the choice of saulius skvernelis to lead the government came a month after an election won by the peasants and greens union in a populist whirlwind the party is hard to classify it is an unorthodox grouping of farmers and environmentalists that leans left on economic issues but to the right on social issues other populist politicians in europe like marine le pen in france geert wilders in the netherlands and frauke petry in germany oppose the european union but the peasants and greens union favors membership in the bloc which lithuania joined in the party strongly supports maintaining the sanctions imposed by the european union after russias military incursion in ukraine in some ways lithuania is in a comparable situation to neighboring poland where a right wing government took power last year polands new leaders are leery of the west but also of mr trumps overtures toward the russian president vladimir v putin lithuanias foreign minister linas linkevicius said last week that he was very afraid for the baltic states lithuania latvia and estonia which sit along natos increasingly tense frontier with russia he expressed concern that russia might try to test the united states before mr trump takes office as president on jan during the american election campaign mr trump called on nato members to spend more for their collective security and rely less on the united states members are supposed to spend at least percent of gross domestic product on their military but only the united states britain greece poland and estonia do so now mr skvernelis said in a statement after his election on tuesday that lithuania would join them we are ready to increase financing for our military up to percent by the end of at the latest he said on top of that we will increase spending on interior security systems such as border control civil defense and intelligence services mr skvernelis said his government had full trust in the united states as well as other partners in nato the european unions sanctions should be relaxed only when there is real progress on the ground from russias side he said but so far the involvement of russian forces in georgia and ukraine does not imply willingness to cooperate in a neighborly spirit unlike the more prosperous countries of northwestern europe lithuania worries about emigration not immigration young people leave in search of jobs and higher living standards and the population has been falling the peasants and greens union promised to stem the exodus by emphasizing the nations cultural heritage luring investment to rural areas and cleaning up corruption especially in the health and defense ministries mykolas majauskas a new lawmaker from the homeland union party said the countrys political establishment bore much of the blame for the populist wave in the election last month people are clearly disappointed and want someone to come in and make a change he said mr skvernelis the new prime minister is viewed by some as the public face of a more powerful figure ramunas karbauskis the businessman who financed the peasants and greens union mazvydas jastramskis a political scientist at vilnius university said that the new prime minister was partly a mystery even for seasoned political observers lithuanians trust in the business sector is not that high but they trust people who are seen as successful he said referring to mr karbauskis
president elect donald j trump on tuesday tempered some of his most extreme campaign promises dropping his vow to jail hillary clinton expressing doubt about the value of torturing terrorism suspects and pledging to have an open mind about climate change but in a wide ranging hourlong interview with reporters and editors at the new york times which was scheduled canceled and then reinstated after a dispute over the ground rules mr trump was unapologetic about flouting some of the traditional ethical and political conventions that have long shaped the american presidency he said he had no legal obligation to establish boundaries between his business empire and his white house conceding that the trump brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before still he said he would try to figure out a way to insulate himself from his businesses which would be run by his children he defended stephen k bannon his chief strategist against charges of racism calling him a decent guy and he mocked republicans who had failed to support him in his unorthodox presidential campaign in the midday meeting in the floor boardroom of the timess publisher arthur sulzberger jr mr trump seemed confident even as he said he was awed by his new job it is a very overwhelming job but im not overwhelmed by it he said he displayed a jumble of impulses many of them conflicting he was magnanimous toward mrs clinton but boastful about his victory he was open minded about some of his positions uncompromising about others the interview demonstrated the volatility in mr trumps positions he said he had no interest in pressing for mrs clintons prosecution over her use of a private email server or for financial acts committed by the clinton foundation i dont want to hurt the clintons i really dont he said on the issue of torture mr trump suggested he had changed his mind about the value of waterboarding after talking with james n mattis a retired marine corps general who headed the united states central command he said ive never found it to be useful mr trump said he added that mr mattis found more value in building trust and rewarding cooperation with terrorism suspects give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and ill do better i was very impressed by that answer mr trump said torture he said is not going to make the kind of a difference that a lot of people are thinking mr trump repeated that mr mattis was being seriously seriously considered to be secretary of defense i think its time maybe for a general he said on climate change mr trump refused to repeat his promise to abandon the international climate accord reached last year in paris saying im looking at it very closely despite the recent appointment to his transition team of a fierce critic of the paris accords mr trump said that i have an open mind to it and that clean air and crystal clear water were vitally important he held out assurances that he did not intend to embrace extremist positions in some areas he vigorously denounced a white nationalist conference last weekend in washington where attendees gave the nazi salute and criticized jews asked about his antagonism with the news media and his vow to toughen libel laws mr trump offered no specifics but told the group i think youll be happy despite his frequent attacks against what he has dubbed the failing new york times mr trump seemed to go out of his way to praise the institution which he called a great great american jewel world jewel he did however say he believed the times had been too tough on him during the campaign pressed to respond to criticism in other areas he was defiant he declared that the laws totally on my side when it comes to questions about conflict of interest and ethics laws the president cant have a conflict of interest he said he said it would be extremely difficult to sell off his businesses because they are real estate holdings he said that he would like to do something and create some kind of arrangement to separate his businesses from his work in government he noted that he had turned over the management of his businesses to his children which ethics lawyers say is not sufficient to prevent conflicts of interest he insisted that he could still invite business partners into the white house for grip and grin photographs he said that critics were pressuring him to go beyond what he was willing to do including distancing himself from his children while they run his businesses if it were up to some people he said i would never ever see my daughter ivanka again mr trump did not dispute reports that he had used a meeting last week with nigel farage the u k independence party leader to raise his opposition to offshore wind farms mr trump has long complained that wind farms would mar the view from his golf course in aberdeenshire scotland i might have brought it up mr trump said then argued he had done so because of policy concerns about wind farms rather than any personal interest mr trump rejected the idea that he was bound by federal antinepotism laws from installing his son in law jared kushner in a white house job but he said he would want to avoid the appearance of a conflict and might instead seek to make mr kushner a special envoy charged with brokering peace in the middle east the president of the united states is allowed to have whatever conflicts he or she wants but i dont want to do that mr trump said but he said that mr kushner who is an observant jew could be very helpful in reconciling the longstanding dispute between the

president elect donald j trumps foundation has acknowledged that it may have run afoul of self dealing rules that guard against using money meant for charity to benefit principals of the organization according to its tax filing on the filing the president elects charity the donald j trump foundation checked yes to answer a question about whether its resources had been directed or used to benefit a disqualified person meaning one of the organizations central people the tax filing offers new details about mr trumps charitable giving which became the subject of intense scrutiny during his presidential campaign after news reports raised questions about whether he had followed through on pledges he made to donate money and his lack of financial support for the foundation the washington post which first reported the self dealing admission on the form earlier reported that mr trump had used from the charity to settle legal disputes involving his businesses possibly violating self dealing provisions a spokeswoman for mr trump did not answer messages seeking comment on the filing mr trump and his advisers have defended his charitable practices in the past noting that mr trump has made significant donations personally and through the foundation lawyers for the foundation uploaded the tax filing on friday to guidestar a national database of nonprofits and it was then made publicly available according to representatives from guidestar it is unclear whether the internal revenue service has received the filings the form showed that mr trump donated a total of that year to his nonprofit foundation his first contribution to it since and his largest donation in a decade the payments were made through two trump businesses the trump corporation and trump productions llc the next largest contribution that year was from a foundation connected to victor pinchuk a ukrainian steel magnate mr pinchuk has been a major donor to the clinton foundation a relationship that drew scrutiny during the presidential campaign as an example of hillary clintons complex ties to foreign business interests douglas e schoen a senior adviser to the board of mr pinchuks foundation said in an email that the payment to mr trumps charity was in support of appearance he did by video link at a conference mr pinchuks foundation organizes every year in september in kiev ukraine mr schoen said that mr pinchuk and mr trump had met many years ago in new york prompting the invitation for mr trump to speak at the september conference he said the two did not have any business relationship during the speech mr trump praised mr pinchuk and ukrainians saying you have had to endure a tremendous amount and i just think it is all going to work out well in the future for the ukraine mr trumps charity reported paying out in grants for some of which was disclosed during the campaign the donations included support for health causes like cancer research and the american red cross as well as for the private school attended by mr trumps youngest son barron in late september eric t schneiderman new yorks attorney general ordered the charity to cease fund raising in the state after his office found that the foundation was not properly registered to solicit donations mr schneidermans office is currently investigating mr trumps foundation to determine whether it is in compliance with state laws
donald j trump through decades in public life has been consistent on one core policy idea that the united states has gotten a raw deal from its major trading partners in the agreements that bind their economies renegotiating those terms will surely be a top priority for his administration but what will that mean in practice while the broad thrust of mr trumps thinking on trade is clear and he has mentioned a few specific policies he would embrace he and his appointees will have wide latitude in how they pursue more favorable trade arrangements for the united states a youtube video released on monday reiterated a campaign promise to withdraw from the trans pacific partnership and more vaguely vowed to negotiate fair bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto american shores since election day trade experts have been gaming potential scenarios of what trump administration trade policy might look like in detail some of those possibilities would risk only modest disruptions to the world economy and could very well result in better long term arrangements for american companies others would blow up the underpinnings of the modern global economy endanger trillions of dollars worth of cross border commerce and stand a good chance of prompting a worldwide recession heres what those possibilities look like from the most benign to the most disruptive there really are some elements of the united states existing relationships with major trading partners that are dysfunctional and disadvantageous to the united states by taking more aggressive stands on some of them a trump administration may be able to get better deals mr trump has said repeatedly that he wants to renegotiate the north american free trade agreement a lot of things can fit under the rubric of renegotiate though and there is room to update the deal in ways that would prove beneficial to the united states the agreement is years old after all and there is plenty of room to adjust terms in ways that preserve the deeply intertwined north american economy there are too many parts of it that are not working said david malpass an economist on the trump transition team at an event in october there is supposed to be regular annual review between the parties of nafta to see where its not working well and to have kind of a constant process of renewal thats been dropped away and so thats something that needs to be looked at the trump administration could also pick a variety of industries where it believes trade partners have treated the united states unfairly and bring cases before the world trade organization paired with targeted duties to punish what it sees as unfair behavior the approach could win more favorable deals the bush administration did just that with steel tariffs in as did the obama administration with a percent tax on chinese tires in trade experts are generally skeptical that these efforts prove worthwhile gary clyde hufbauer and sean lowry of the peterson institute for international economics calculated that american consumers paid an extra billion for tires in to safeguard a mere american tire making jobs thats per job saved but mr trumps administration could bring a series of such cases and if as he promises his team members prove to be made up of tougher smarter negotiators than their predecessors perhaps they could get better results even if they dont the trillion united states economy will most likely be o k mr trump has said he will instruct his treasury secretary to declare china a currency manipulator the george w bush and obama administrations didnt do this although they also thought that china artificially depressed the value of its currency to the benefit of chinese exporters however they calculated that subtle diplomacy would be more likely than head on confrontation to get results but who knows maybe that calculation was wrong and a more confrontational approach would have led china to allow its currency to respond to market forces the chinese government has allowed its currency to rise relative to the dollar over the last few years putting it roughly in line with economic fundamentals and reducing the urgency of the issue naming china a currency manipulator merely triggers negotiation over what to do about it such negotiation would most likely be hard fought and it might result in a better long term arrangement for the united states or not but either way it wouldnt need to disrupt day to day trade relations that assumes that mr trump takes a more aggressive stance using existing channels and authorities and wages the battle with the trading partner over specific cases and industries if so it will keep lawyers and lobbyists for those industries busy there would be pushback but youd be working within the relevant legal frameworks and using existing institutions as they were intended by congress and the w t o and our trading partners said scott lincicome a trade lawyer at white case who has been critical of mr trump everybody will talk about it but it wont change the global macroeconomic outlook ambiguous language in the statutes grants the president broad authority over trade policy mr trump could be the kind of president willing to use that authority to its fullest rather than focus on targeted duties on individual products as part of a w t o case the government could invoke emergency authority to place broad based tariffs on goods from a given country think of the percent tariff on chinese imports that mr trump at one point threatened during his campaign or perhaps an escalating tariff set to rise until the trade deficit with a given country declines moves along those lines would get everyones attention but they would also create enormous ripple effects there would surely be legal challenges by the targeted countrys industries as well as swift and potentially painful retaliation from trade partners china wouldnt take these kinds of measures lying down with these
president elect donald j trump said on tuesday that he had no intention of pressing for an investigation into hillary clintons use of a private email server or the financial operations of her familys foundation dropping the lock her up pledge that became a rallying cry for his campaign for the white house mr trump who branded his rival crooked hillary and said she would go to jail if he were president said in an interview with reporters and editors at the new york times that he was no longer interested in pursuing mrs clinton in part because he wanted to heal the wounds of a divisive campaign i dont want to hurt the clintons i really dont mr trump said during the interview she went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways and i am not looking to hurt them at all the campaign was vicious his reversal on prosecuting mrs clinton was particularly striking given the outsize role the issue played during the presidential campaign in which her use of a private email server as secretary of state became a prominent theme and one she has blamed for her loss to mr trump mr trump said he wanted to move forward from the subject without elaborating he said that well have people that do things perhaps a reference to the f b i or republicans who might continue to press for prosecutions in the email or foundation cases but the president elect made clear that he would not seek to pursue an investigation himself nor make it a priority after he assumes office the decision angered some of his most fervent supporters who immediately criticized his seeming change of heart broken promise blared the headline on breitbart news a conservative news site that has strongly backed mr trump its not something that i feel very strongly about mr trump said at the times unlike health care or immigration this has been a very painful period of time clinton aides did not respond to a request for comment about mr trumps remarks during their second debate mr trump turned to mrs clinton and vowed if i win i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because theres never been so many lies so much deception after mr trumps turnaround on tuesday the conservative commentator ann coulter one of his staunchest supporters during the campaign suggested on twitter that mr trump was overstepping his role whoa i thought we elected realdonaldtrump president she wrote did we make him the fbi doj his job is to pick those guys not do their jobs tom fitton president of judicial watch a conservative advocacy group that has been a relentless critic of mrs clinton said on tuesday that it would be a mistake for mr trump to drop the threat of appointing a special counsel to look into her email use mr fitton said that although the f b i had already investigated the matter twice that inquiry was flawed his group has gained access to thousands of pages of mrs clintons state department emails through lawsuits and is pressing its case in court even after her defeat representative jason chaffetz a utah republican who leads the house oversight and government reform committee said last week on fox news that his committee would continue to investigate the matter as well because weve got to get to the truth mr chaffetzs office said on tuesday he was unavailable for comment about mr trumps statements although the f b i s email investigation is closed the agency still has an open inquiry into the clinton foundation that inquiry began after the publication of clinton cash a book by peter schweizer that asserted that some foreign entities had given money to the foundation in return for state department favors when mrs clinton was there the clintons have denied the assertions the f b i and justice department conduct their criminal investigations largely independently from the white house so mr trump cannot tell agents to close their cases a president ordering the f b i to stop a politically sensitive case would be a major scandal it does seem like an extraordinary breach of protocol for him to get involved in that decision glen a kopp a former federal prosecutor in new york said of the president elect i know of no recent circumstances when the president ordered an attorney general not to pursue a criminal matter if as president mr trump were to order the f b i director james b comey to close the foundation inquiry mr comey could choose to rebuff him f b i directors are given year terms to insulate them from political pressure but the president still has the power to fire a director as president bill clinton did with william s sessions in after a justice department investigation uncovered ethical abuses by mr sessions in an interview last week with cbs newss minutes mr trump said he had not yet decided whether to dismiss mr comey over his handling of the clinton email investigation saying the director may have had very good reasons for doing what he did as a practical matter though mr trumps remarks will probably have little impact the investigation into mrs clintons emails is already closed and while the one into her familys foundation remains open senior f b i officials and career justice department officials have said there is little evidence justifying moving forward with a case when the case comes up for review senior agents and prosecutors may decide to shut it down but it will not be because of mr trumps remarks while the president elects decision is likely to frustrate investigators at the f b i who are fiercely protective of their independence to follow the facts they uncover some legal experts applauded mr trumps decision to not pursue investigations into mrs clintons emails or her family foundation rory

each day dozens of families pick their way out some carrying white flags even as they come under mortar or sniper fire from the islamic state billowing black clouds from oil wells set on fire by militants provide a dystopian background to the scenes of flight it is so bad south of mosul that the sheep there have begun turning black the military campaign to retake mosul iraqs second largest city is in its sixth week and bogged down in a grueling fight seeking to escape the fighting more civilians than ever are taking the risk of evacuation hoping to find help if they can make it past the militants gun range the numbers tell one story almost people have been displaced so far roughly half of them children according to the united nations but the exodus is really only getting started there could be a million more people still in mosul most clustered on the west of the tigris river where the fighting has not reached for those who have been able to reach the aid camps miles outside the city there has been an initial glimpse of hope and relief some like these displaced iraqis at the khazer camp outside mosul find that aid workers and soldiers are quick to offer food handing out cookies or iraqs traditional diamond shaped bread but it is a particularly hazardous journey for military age men fearing that islamic state fighters will try to escape by posing as civilians the iraqi forces are separating men from their families for questioning in past offensives the process proved ripe for abuse the word of an unnamed informant can be enough to send a man to prison leaving countless families wondering what happened to their husbands and sons these men were questioned by iraqi intelligence officers outside qayyara south of mosul as the war against the islamic state has intensified more than three million iraqis mostly sunnis are now thought to be displaced with most of them still unable to return to their homes even in cities long ago reclaimed from the islamic state like falluja and ramadi aid camps have had to serve as home amid the worries there are still touching scenes of reunions at the camps as family members who had left two years ago are brought together with loved ones who had stayed behind until now like this group of relatives at the khazer camp a few weeks ago zakea muhsin from the village of topzawa near mosul saw her husband for the first time in more than two years she hadnt even been able to talk with him over those months as the islamic state had banned communication with the outside world they told us if we find a cellphone on you we will behead you she said but just as often there is more separation families cut off from one another amid the chaos of battle last week awad abdullah who had left an area south of mosul and lives in a camp near erbil was grief stricken because he could not find his parents i have not heard from them he said i am always crying as he spoke an older woman approached with a sad story of a lost daughter nobody knows where she is she said when the battle began everyone hoped the islamic state would abandon the city as it had in falluja instead it dug in for a last stand with the fighting becoming ever more brutal and drawn out humanitarian workers are concerned that iraqi forces will adopt more aggressive tactics putting civilians at greater risk when the fight started iraqi officers worried the islamic state would destroy the bridges over the tigris that connect east and west mosul cutting off trapped civilians now coalition warplanes are knocking the bridges out themselves to prevent the islamic state from bringing supplies and car bombs into the battle scarred east already there is talk of an aleppo style siege of the city center and the united nations is busily expanding some camps and building more to accommodate perhaps hundreds of thousands more displaced civilians like in the rapidly expanding jaadah camp below some fear that the increasing number of refugees and their vulnerability could bring another wave of sectarian revenge in a country rife with it sunni extremists who would later identify with the islamic state forged their identity with the widespread killing of shiites during iraqs sectarian civil war last decade and again when the militant group blitzed across iraq in when mosul and other cities were seized but the groups sectarian focus did not keep it from oppressing sunni civilians under its rule now hundreds of thousands of them are refugees flowing into areas like iraqi kurdistan where they are met with suspicion and where memories of abuses under saddam husseins sunni arab oligarchy are still fresh today the fighting drags on and each day there are more families trickling out of the battleground in a new iraqi ritual of coming and going when the mosul offensive began in earnest in mid october some american officials quietly expressed hope that it might be wrapped up by the end of president obamas term but most public estimates envisioned a fight stretching over months and that appears to be coming true many iraqi officials now predict the mosul fight could stretch on until the spring most likely making the battle and its effect on iraqi society part of president elect donald j trumps inheritance
who gains from a trade war with china at the asia pacific economic cooperation summit meeting in peru over the weekend one of the biggest questions was whether donald j trump as the next president would stick to his threat to erect steep trade barriers against beijing dragging the united states into a tit for tat confrontation with the worlds second largest economy no such war has begun yet it seems clear that the united states has already lost china has been steadily gaining in the global economic system waging war against globalization america is making chinas case eswar prasad a former head of the chinese division at the international monetary fund argues that over the long term china comes out a winner no matter what chinas economy would surely suffer if the united states were to impose a percent tariff on nearly billion worth of chinese imports the united states absorbs only percent of chinese exports but it is chinas healthiest export market fears of american protectionism are already stoking capital flight from china but china might be better placed than the united states to take the blow and it would certainly counterpunch an editorial in chinas global times a communist party mouthpiece is probably not far off in its warning that american action would mean a batch of boeing orders will be replaced by airbus u s auto and iphone sales in china will suffer a setback and u s soybean and maize imports will be halted china has several ways to retaliate it could bar state owned companies from doing business with american businesses it could limit access to essential commodities as it did in response to a fishing dispute with japan by stopping exports of so called rare earth minerals essential to the electronics industry it could soft pedal efforts to combat the piracy of american patents and copyrights some of the united states most successful companies would be in for a rough ride most of apples iphones for example are assembled in china the assembly costs though account for less than percent of the value added of the device that means china could force a halt in iphone production at little cost to itself while apple would face a deeply disruptive expensive effort to shift production elsewhere building it from scratch in the united states is nearly impossible how long could american resolve hold an analysis by the pro trade peterson institute for international economics concluded that a full blown trade war with china and mexico would push unemployment in the united states to nearly percent in from percent today that would not improve the economic outlook for millions of working class americans in whose name mr trump proposed this fight and that may not even be the worst part circling the wagons around the american border plays directly into chinas hands in other ways washington would be cast as the villain in the fight no matter how many tricks the chinese government might deploy against american interests it would remain the victim in the eyes of many nations a champion for the cause of open rules based trade even if mr trump is just bluffing as many of his allies say to gain leverage in some future negotiation much of the damage has been done his bluster has changed the perception of the role the united states will play in the world in the face of a turn toward populist nationalism in other rich countries like britain and france china has emerged in the unlikely role of defender of globalized capitalism china is the one major power still talking about increased integration said nicholas lardy a china specialist at the peterson institute china is the only major country in the world projecting the idea that globalization brings benefits and that is the united states loss a great many countries in the developing world still believe prosperity depends on their successful integration into the supply chains that traverse the global economy by turning inward a move already reinforced by the rejection of the trans pacific partnership the united states appears to have little to offer steven ciobo australias trade minister conveyed that point only a few days after the american election by saying that his nation would work to conclude the regional comprehensive economic partnership a chinese initiative among asian and pacific countries that excludes the united states and would support beijings proposed free trade area of the asia pacific ditto for peru and chile which according to a senior chinese official in lima are also now seeking to join the chinese trade initiative almost certainly every economy in the asian region sees its future lying more closely linked with china mr prasad the former i m f official told me with trump talking about withdrawing from trade deals and making allies pay for protection it will be tough for asian countries to resist chinas embrace and if washingtons actions against china start to disrupt asias supply chains the united states could quickly become the regions economic pariah the question is to what purpose it cant simply be about stopping currency manipulation thats an outdated fear instead of working to lower the value of its currency to improve its exports china has spent about trillion lately to prop up the value of the renminbi in the face of capital flight if it stopped the currency would drop like a stone enhancing chinas trade competitiveness moreover slapping trade barriers against china would do little to narrow the american trade deficit american companies building things in china wouldnt bring much manufacturing home in most cases they would go to some other country with cheap labor and to the extent they did reshore production most of it would be highly automated employing few additional americans it does not make economic sense for trump to want to balance trade with china said derek scissors a china specialist at the conservative american enterprise institute balanced trade doesnt bring back jobs
maybe i shouldnt have been surprised that donald trump could be elected president but i was i live in brooklyn and work in manhattan two of the most liberal places in the country but even online i wasnt seeing many signs of support for him how did that blindness occur social media is my portal into the rest of the world my periscope into the communities next to my community into how the rest of the world thinks and feels and it completely failed me in hindsight that failure makes sense ive spent nearly years coaching facebook and instagram and twitter on what kinds of news and photos i dont want to see and they all behaved accordingly each time i liked an article or clicked on a link or hid another the algorithms that curate my streams took notice and showed me only what they thought i wanted to see that meant i didnt realize that most of my family members who live in rural virginia were voicing their support for trump online and i didnt see any of the pro trump memes that were in heavy circulation before the election i never saw a trump hat or a sign or a shirt in my feeds and the only election day selfies i saw were of people declaring their support for hillary clinton to be clear im not blaming the algorithms for what i assume to be their role in augmenting my worldview they did exactly what i told them to do blocking out racist misogynist and anti immigrant comments hiding anyone who didnt support black lives matter all with such deftness that i had no idea that a candidate who ran a campaign on exactly those values had gained enough popularity to win the election but considering that more than percent of our countrys population consumes news on facebook finding alternative perspectives shouldnt have been that hard i knew about eli parisers theory on filter bubbles or the idea that online personalization distorts the type of information we see and even so i still chose to let algorithms shape how i perceive the world everything i could want to see is available at my fingertips and yet i didnt look in april mark zuckerberg chief executive of facebook addressed a room of developers about the importance of his social network facebook he said has the power to bring people together who might otherwise never have the chance to meet the internet has enabled all of us to access and share more ideas and information than ever before he said weve gone from a world of isolated communities to one global community and we are all better off for it but thats not what has happened zuckerbergs idealism is belied by his desire to duck responsibility for mediating the content of his site on facebook the political divide has only been entrenched further its the buzzfeed dress debate only for our entire lives we are two countries one that sees blue and black and the other that sees white and gold the internet once offered outlets we could use to understand one another but they are rapidly disappearing most social media like facebook and instagram is curated by software built to manage the high influx of information flowing into it but there have still been a few islands of digital wilderness a galpagos of sorts where culture thrived untouched they included vine and snapchat and even tumblr which were homes for marginalized ideas theories and lifestyles the video sharing app vine was the first place i got a glimpse of cultures beyond my own including those of the middle east i was able to see how some women there wanted us to see them prospering aware a young woman living in saudi arabia who goes by the name amy roko used vine to show clips of herself living her life her version of normalcy at the mall goofing off at home in her most viral video she stares into the camera her face covered in a niqab save for her perfectly outlined eyes expletive called me ugly she snaps i said expletive where the emphasis on the last word becomes the punch line as she whips off one niqab to reveal a second underneath i was thrilled to realize that women living there could have a sense of humor similar to my own vine was born as an app and intended to be a social community but vine links could be shared independent of the network and people did so with abandon meaning that vines appeared scattershot around the web defying the sorting mechanism of streams and feeds they could land on your screen via text message direct message email rokos vine was a riff on one originally posted by a young black american named brionna london who was miffed that someone thought she needed makeup to be pretty you can draw a straight line from brown women in saudi arabia to black women in america a marvel unto itself a window into the way the internet flattens space and time a vivid example of its fulfilling its promise to bridge divides at vines peak it had more than million monthly users who watched videos billions of times and it excelled at showing these sorts of commonalities that say black kids in new orleans lived and looked a lot like white kids in florida and yet twitter which owns vine and is struggling to turn a profit while keeping its main service appealing to advertisers could seemingly no longer afford to keep the video feature afloat following news about twitters decision to close the service there were rumors that outside companies made inquiries about purchasing vines remains but its most likely too late to salvage the community there in its earlier days snapchat offered its own version of cultural exchange the app had an incredible series on city life that gave users direct windows into different worlds people submitted
in tim obrien then a financial reporter at the new york times published the book trumpnation the art of being the donald talked to sources with an up close view of donald j trumps finances who concluded that the real estate developers net worth was million to million rather than the billion to billion trump had variously claimed trump who had courted obrien by taking him for rides in his ferrari and private jet sued obrien for libel in new jersey in trump called obrien a wack job on the today show while obrien says continuing to curry favor with him privately obriens publisher warner books was also named in the suit and hired top lawyers who put trump through an unsparing two day deposition asked about his finances trump was caught lying or exaggerating times he thought hed get a friendly judge and we would roll over says obrien who is now the executive editor of bloomberg view we didnt the case went through four judges and was dismissed in trumps suit against obrien is one of seven forays president elect trump and his companies have made as libel plaintiffs he won only once when a defendant failed to appear but the standard measure defending his reputation and achieving victory in court isnt how trump says he thinks about his investment i spent a couple of bucks on legal fees and they spent a whole lot more he told the washington post in march about the hefty sum he spent on the case against obrien i did it to make his life miserable which im happy about trump was wrong warner books spent less than he did and obrien paid nothing but that doesnt make trumps central idea any less jarring that libel law can be a tool of revenge its disconcerting for a superrich plaintiff to treat the legal system as a weapon to be deployed against critics once installed in the white house trump will have a wider array of tools at his disposal and his record suggests that more than his predecessors he will try to use the press and also control and subdue it as a candidate trump blustered vaguely that he wanted to open up our libel laws i asked his spokeswoman hope hicks by email what he meant by that but she didnt answer the question its not within the presidents direct powers to change the rules for libel suits but our legal safeguards for writers and publishers arent foolproof in the last few years trump has been joined by at least two billionaires who are determined to exploit cracks in the wall of defense around the press the members of this club are innovators they have sued or funded suits to defend reputations or protect privacy but an underlying aim appears to be to punish critics like obrien or even destroy entire media outlets this kind of manipulation of the law is unfolding at a keen moment of weakness for the press which has already been buffeted by falling revenue and mounting public disaffection only percent of the public the lowest rate since at least the trusts the media to report the news fully accurately and fairly according to a gallup survey conducted in september this mistrust has been growing for a long time but it was stoked by trump during the campaign he called the reporters who covered him scum and whipped up yelling and booing crowds there is no consensus among his supporters that the press should hold those in power accountable a recent pew survey found that only half of trump backers agreed that it was important in a strong democracy that news organizations are free to criticize political leaders media outlets have won many cases by persuading a judge to dismiss them but since they have succeeded in only percent of the libel and privacy suits that have gone to trial a dip from percent in the previous decade according to the media law resource center the median damage award has increased fivefold since the to million the figure includes three big verdicts over the last eight months against gawker rolling stone and the news observer in raleigh n c these include run of the mill libel suits and its too early to say that the sky is falling on the press but its darkening the high bar for winning a libel case in the united states was set in when the supreme court decided new york times v sullivan in that case widely hailed as one of the courts strongest stands for free speech l b sullivan a city commissioner who supervised the police in montgomery ala sued the times over an ad in the newspaper signed by civil rights supporters the ad turned out to include minor factual errors sullivan said its depiction of how the montgomery police responded to civil rights protests made him look bad under the rules at the time a libel plaintiff was entitled to victory if he could show that the content that harmed his reputation was false the alabama jury agreed with sullivan on that point and awarded him in damages with similar cases pending the times pulled its reporters out of alabama but when the newspaper appealed to the supreme court the justices threw out the sullivan verdict and set a far stiffer standard for proving libel the court wrote that a public figure has to prove that a false and damaging statement about him was published with actual malice translated as knowing or reckless disregard for the truth by the the number of libel suits decreased and if suits did go to trial they frequently ended in defeat for the plaintiff in two examples from that era gen william westmoreland sued cbs and ariel sharon the israeli defense minister sued time magazine neither man won damages those outcomes as well as losses in other high profile cases were a major deterrent for plaintiffs and their lawyers says george
washington a federal judge on monday dismissed a lawsuit that accused president obama of waging an illegal war against the islamic state clearing the way for the conflict to continue under president elect donald j trump without explicit congressional authorization in a page opinion judge colleen kollar kotelly of the federal district court for the district of columbia ruled that the plaintiff an army captain who was until recently deployed to kuwait to participate in the conflict lacked the standing to bring the case judge kollar kotelly also said that whether the war had been properly authorized was a question for the two elected branches of government not a court to decide this case raises questions that are committed to the political branches of government she wrote the court is not well equipped to resolve these questions and the political branches who are so equipped do not appear to be in dispute as to their answers the plaintiff capt nathan michael smith had said that while he supported fighting the islamic state as a matter of policy he believed that the current effort violated the constitution and the war powers resolution which limits combat operations to days if congress has not authorized the deployment because he swore an oath to uphold the constitution he said he worried that obeying orders to participate in the operation violated his oath but judge kollar kotelly said captain smiths desire to have a court clarify the legal issues was not a sufficient injury to give him a right to bring the case while there are vietnam war era precedents in which courts ruled that soldiers did have a right to challenge the legality of their orders to deploy she noted that those cases involved plaintiffs who did not support that war effort the dispute began in when the islamic state swept out of syria and rapidly conquered large areas of iraq and mr obama ordered airstrikes to halt the groups advance the president said that while he would like a vote from congress to endorse the campaign he needed no new legal permission because operations against the islamic state were covered by the authorization to use military force against the perpetrators of the sept terrorist attacks that is al qaeda that theory was controversial because while the islamic state used to be al qaedas affiliate in iraq the two organizations had split earlier in but in a court filing the obama administration argued that congress had ratified its theory by continuing to appropriate billions of dollars for the operation knowing how the executive branch was interpreting its authority while the two sides traded briefs judge kollar kotelly said she did not need to hear from them in oral arguments before ruling for the government david remes a lawyer for captain smith said his client was now stationed at fort hood in texas but was subject to redeployment to the middle east to participate in the war operation through the decision is unfortunate mr remes said it makes the war powers resolution a dead letter by closing off challenges to violations its a lost opportunity to clarify the scope of the authorization for use of military force which president obama is using as the basis to fight a foe that didnt even exist back then it sets conditions for standing that few officers will be able to meet we are considering whether to appeal
beirut lebanon the united nations special envoy to syria offered unsolicited advice on monday to president elect donald j trump pay attention to what happens between now and january in syria particularly in aleppo the storied city at risk of obliteration by russian backed syrian forces the envoy staffan de mistura suggested that mr trumps shared desire with russia to collaborate to annihilate the islamist militants ensconced in eastern aleppo and elsewhere presented new circumstances that could alter the war for better or worse while such a collaboration could be effective in eradicating the islamic state mr de mistura said during an interview in beirut the carnage and destruction caused by the syrian and russian militaries in syria increasingly make it more problematic politically for mr trump to align with russia mr de misturas remarks after a weekend of frustrating diplomacy in syria represented the first time that he had spoken about mr trumps potential role in the war through the president elects eagerness to work with russia which backs the government of president bashar al assad of syria if russia desires a new approach with the incoming trump administration on syria mr de mistura said it could be difficult for any president in the united states regardless of his own priorities to ignore the international outrage over the humanitarian tragedy in aleppo unless drastic steps are taken mr de mistura said eastern aleppo will not be there by the new year in terms of structural destruction for now the syrian governments apparent determination to eradicate the anti government insurgents in eastern aleppo appears to have overwhelmed all other considerations while the bombing of aleppo abated during mr de misturas visit to damascus on saturday and sunday it resumed as he was departing on monday humanitarian agencies have pleaded for respite from the assaults which they say have destroyed or incapacitated all hospitals in the rebel held part of the city at the united nations on monday the organizations top relief official told the security council that he was more or less at my wits end as a human being about the suffering in aleppo and other besieged parts of syria we are not just seeing a resumption of violence in aleppo this is not business as usual said the relief official stephen obrien the under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator what has been unleashed on civilians this past week is yet another low in an unrelenting inhuman onslaught mr de mistura went to syria with a short term proposal to help civilians in aleppo which included the evacuation of about wounded people at risk of dying because their injuries cannot be treated in a war zone the delivery of medical supplies and food aid for the most vulnerable the emergency plan would also allow doctors who have been working around the clock to rotate out for rest the syrian government rejected all tenets of mr de misturas plan except the evacuation of the wounded mr de mistura has also proposed asking the fighters who are part of the nusra front the al qaeda affiliate operating in syria to voluntarily leave east aleppo to allow aid deliveries for the civilians there syrias foreign minister walid al moallem has rejected that proposal mr de mistura nonetheless believes the russians are sympathetic to his ideas for aleppo he said because they do not want to be seen as helping to destroy the historic city in articles quoting russian sources and disseminated by the russian based sputnik news agency and by a chinese newspaper russia has sent decidedly mixed messages about its intentions in the sputnik articles the officials criticized the united nations for having failed to use a pause in the aleppo bombing this fall to evacuate wounded people the articles also said traces of chlorine and white phosphorus bombs had been found in attacks on government held western aleppo if true the claims would suggest rebels are using banned weapons mr assads forces have also been accused of using banned weapons including by a united nations panel of inquiry however chinas peoples daily newspaper has asserted that russia is not participating in the bombing suggesting that as mr de mistura indicated russia does not want to be associated with the flattening of aleppo and untold civilian casualties the newspaper also suggested that mr trumps election victory might factor into what it described as russias reluctance at this stage russia all the more does not want any trouble with regard to civilian casualties on the syrian battlefield and other issues that could complicate bilateral relations the newspaper said
washington president elect donald j trump on monday released a two and a half minute infomercial style video turning to social media to deliver a direct to camera message in which he vowed to create jobs renegotiate trade agreements end restrictions on energy production and impose bans on lobbying mr trump offered what he called an update on his transition which he said was going very smoothly efficiently and effectively reading from a script and looking into a camera he steered clear of his most inflammatory campaign promises to deport immigrants and track muslims and his pledge to repeal the affordable care act whether its producing steel building cars or curing disease i want the next generation of production and innovation to happen right here in our great homeland america creating wealth and jobs for american workers mr trump said in the video the brief youtube video offered one of the few opportunities for the public to hear from mr trump directly since he was elected two weeks ago the president elect has declined to hold a news conference since his victory and instead has used early morning twitter bursts to communicate mr trump gave a brief middle of the night speech after hillary clinton called him on nov and he sat for an interview with the wall street journal and an appearance surrounded by his family on cbs newss minutes last week since then he has mostly been behind closed doors as he assembles a cabinet and white house team in the video mr trump described his plans to make america great again on day but his message seemed aimed less at the supporters who chanted that slogan at rallies and more at the americans who remain skeptical about it the president elect appeared to try to emphasize his appeal to those voters at the end of the video and he promised to provide more updates as he worked together with everyone to reach his goals and i mean everyone he emphasized the video underscored the extent to which mr trump intends to try to navigate around the traditional newspaper and television media outlets as he seeks to communicate his message to the public ari fleischer who served as white house press secretary under george w bush said mr trump was using technology to communicate with the public in a format that mr bushs staff would never have dreamed of doing years ago because the news media would have dismissed it as propaganda president obama has become adept at doing the same thing in recent years through videos posted on facebook and other media mr fleischer said hes just doing more of what president obama successfully did and what im fascinated about is what does this mean for the future on monday the president elect met privately with television executives in a confidential session that was described later as a sometimes contentious effort to clear the air after a campaign season in which mr trump often clashed with members of the media mr trump is also scheduled to meet with editors and reporters at the new york times on tuesday but his decision to deliver a highly scripted video message suggests that he like mr obama is eager to embrace new media opportunities by monday mr trumps realdonaldtrump twitter account which he enjoys using had million followers once in the white house he will inherit potus with its million online followers mr trump also spent monday at his office in trump tower interviewing a stream of potential republican cabinet candidates they included rick perry a former governor of texas former senator scott brown of massachusetts and representative tulsi gabbard of hawaii a democrat perhaps the most interesting thing about mr trumps video was what he did not say in it on immigration he avoided any mention of his plan to build a wall along the border with mexico or his desire to deport immigrants here illegally whether or not they have a criminal record he made no mention of ending president obamas program that grants work permits to immigrants who were brought illegally to the united states as children instead mr trump simply promised to direct the labor department to investigate visa abuses the tough talking president elect who has often railed against mr obama and the generals for what he often called their stupid conduct of foreign policy said nothing in the video about fighting terrorism confronting russian aggression or pressuring nato allies to pay more for their common defense instead he said he would ask his top military officials for a comprehensive plan to guard americas vital infrastructure from cyberattacks and all other form of attacks mr trumps other promises in the video recapped points that he made repeatedly during the campaign offering a series of executive actions that he says he will order on his first full day in the oval office some like his pledge to issue our notification of intent to withdraw from the trans pacific partnership trade deal will be well within his power as president to accomplish but his additional promise to negotiate fair bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto american shores will be in the eyes of the beholder and may not produce the results he expects others appear to be overblown political hyperbole like his promise in the video to cancel job killing restrictions on the production of american energy including shale energy and clean coal creating many millions of high paying jobs he did not specify in the short video what restrictions he will lift or how that would result in many millions of jobs even supporters of the keystone xl oil pipeline which mr trump has said he will greenlight once in office do not believe it would create millions of jobs if it was built mr fleischer said mr trumps more inclusive tone in the video was the latest example of a pattern he set during the campaign of dialing back his impulse

president elect donald j trump said during the campaign that he would push companies to bring manufacturing jobs back to the united states he named one tech company in particular apple which is the worlds largest public company and makes many of its gadgets overseas apple does make one product domestically the mac pro desktop computer is assembled in austin tex through the contract manufacturer flex so vindu goel a new york times tech reporter recently visited austin to see what having tech manufacturing domestically has wrought for apple and the area what he found was a more nuanced picture showing that manufacturing is far from the only way for a tech company to provide good jobs and career paths for americans it turns out apple has a campus in austin where the number of jobs has grown rapidly reaching about jobs now up from around seven years ago the roles that apple has created there are varied including fielding tech support calls overseeing logistics with suppliers and updating apples maps software the average salary of apples austin employees including management is a year the manufacturing jobs at flexs austin location located about a mile from the apple campus are also important of course flex added about jobs for the mac pro desktop but clearly they are not the only kinds of jobs a tech company can now create
vatican city the roman catholic church will allow priests throughout the world to grant absolution for abortion the vatican said on monday making permanent a policy that pope francis announced a year ago in a document marking the conclusion of the churchs yearlong jubilee of mercy the pope extended a policy of allowing priests and not only bishops or special confessors to grant forgiveness for abortion which the church considers a sin the announcement was a signal of the popes vision of a more welcoming merciful and inclusive church while firmly restating his opposition to abortion as a grave sin since it puts an end to an innocent life the pope affirmed that there is no sin that gods mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the father the document an apostolic letter was signed on sunday after a mass denoting the end of the jubilee year it was made public on monday pope francis decision last year at the start of the jubilee followed in the footsteps of pope john paul ii who granted priests the same right during the previous holy year in under canon law abortion brings automatic excommunication unless the person receiving or performing it confesses and receives absolution abortion is considered a reserved sin meaning that permission to grant forgiveness usually must come from a bishop bishops could already delegate the authority to grant absolution to parish priests and many bishops in the united states had done so but the practice varied widely by country and even by diocese in parts of the world observant catholics who have sought absolution for abortions have faced delays at times or even rejection in some places priests have been delegated the power to absolve abortions during certain times of year like lent archbishop rino fisichella the president of the pontifical council for promoting new evangelization said at a news conference at the vatican on monday now that right is extended to all priests he said noting that changes would have to be made to canon law to reflect the new practice the decision underscores the popes idea of a church that leaves nobody outside its doors and the apostolic letter calls on the clergy and the worlds billion catholics to reflect and to act upon the message at the heart of the yearlong meditation on mercy in the document a blend of religious teachings and acute social commentary pope francis delineates the path of the future life of the church so that it can always be an instrument of mercy toward everyone without ever excluding anyone archbishop fisichella said the archbishop said that the apostolic letter offered guidelines to priests who were called on to exercise forgiveness referring to an april proclamation on family life that among other things created a path for divorced and remarried catholics to receive holy communion francis letter also noted that the church would celebrate a world day of the poor every november to help communities and each of the baptized to reflect on how poverty is at the very heart of the gospel he also called on the faithful to promote a culture of mercy based on the rediscovery of encounter with others a culture in which no one looks at another with indifference or turns away from the suffering of our brothers and sisters at a ceremony naming new cardinals on saturday the pope warned against what he described as a virus of polarization and animosity he said that in gods heart there are no enemies and chided those who raise walls build barriers and label people the comments were seen by some vatican observers as a rebuke to calls by president elect donald j trump to build a border wall and to restrict muslims from entering the united states pope francis did not single out any country but he has expressed dismay over the harsh tone on immigration that mr trump has taken in february the pope suggested that mr trump was not christian because of the campaign promise to build a wall on the united states mexico border the pope on saturday denounced the tendency to treat a stranger an immigrant or a refugee as the enemy warning that such thinking invited hatred little by little our differences turn into symptoms of hostility threats and violence he said harassment and violence against immigrants and other marginalized groups surged after election day in the united states according to the southern poverty law center which tracks hate crimes and domestic extremist groups
californias trees are dying at an alarming rate late last week the u s forest service said an aerial survey revealed that million additional trees had died while in the grip of persistent drought bringing the total since to more than million those numbers have startled california officials and scientists while adding urgency to a long simmering debate over what should be done about it the tree deaths have been concentrated in the southern and central sierra nevada but experts warn of increasing deaths in forests all the way up to the oregon border as a result forestry officials have asked for more funding to thwart wildfire risks through prescribed burning and the removal of millions of dead trees we must fund wildfire suppression like other natural disasters in the country tom vilsack the agriculture secretary said in a statement but some ecologists say the emphasis on fire danger and its attendant demand for increased logging are misplaced do everything necessary to eliminate risks to humans these experts argue but otherwise leave dead trees alone to decompose or go up in flames and create new habitats far from being disasters wildfires can be an adrenaline shot for biodiversity they say a lot of the hype seems to me a lack of understanding of the naturalness of disturbance in ecology said richard hutto an ecologist at the university of montana the tree die off may ultimately signal a transformation of californias forest ecosystems as a result of climate change many scientists say in some places woodlands would simply give way to grasslands max a moritz a wildfire specialist at the university of california berkeley said the focus on wildfire prevention has taken attention away from addressing what that shift is going to mean for california the question is what are we going to do dr moritz said can we guide these systems as they change can we help push them in directions so that theres not just going to be weeds everywhere kern county at the southern

to alcatraz set up camp and demanded that the former prison outpost be deeded back to them by the federal government the occupiers calling themselves indians of all tribes argued that an treaty gave american indians the right to claim unused federal land alcatraz they said would be developed as a cultural and education center we the native americans reclaim the land known as alcatraz island in the name of all american indians by right of discovery their proclamation read the government refused but took an approach of noninterference a rotating group of american indians stayed in the former prison buildings without fresh water or phone service for months before being removed by federal marshals on june the takeover generated wide news media attention and awakened many americans for the first time to the plight of native americans in the decade that followed american indian activists occupied dozens of other locations including the bureau of indian affairs headquarters in washington more recently historians have characterized the protests on the standing rock indian reservation against the dakota access oil pipeline as an echo of that heyday of activism that was ushered in by the occupation of alcatraz
the election of donald j trump gives the republicans in congress a chance to act on their often stated desire to get rid of obamacare a wish that mr trump mostly says he shares aaron e carroll and austin frakt the health policy analysts for the upshot discuss then what aaron i think its safe to say few in congress thought they would have this opportunity but like the proverbial dog who has finally caught the car after untold futile attempts republicans have finally come within reach of repealing the affordable care act now comes the essential question will they actually do it theyve been promising it forever but i am still skeptical that it will happen i believe you disagree im going to let you go first why do you think theyll do it austin i think theyll do it because they so thoroughly own the idea of repeal having passed bills to repeal partly repeal delay or defund the a c a in the house something like times just the other day senator mitch mcconnell endorsed repeal the house and senate also agreed to do so in large part in a budget reconciliation bill earlier this year the only thing that prevented it was that president obama vetoed it i doubt mr trump would do the same if given a similar opportunity now i know that a budget reconciliation dismantling of the law is not a full repeal because according to the rules it can only touch budget related provisions this excludes things like requiring insurers to take all comers for premiums that vary only by age and smoking status or preventing them from imposing coverage caps and lifetime limits among other measures i also must add that im much less confident of a repeal without agreement on a replacement but ill turn it back to you aaron do you think the g o p has to offer a full replacement to get its members to sign on to repeal or can it offer something that would cover fewer people and with fewer benefits aaron i think they can get away with slightly fewer people and somewhat skimpier benefits but not too much theres a part of me that thinks many in congress were always so willing to vote for a repeal because they knew it had no chance of being signed into law they got credit for the vote without ever having to face the downside actually repealing without replacing would mean effectively stripping more than million people of their health insurance without anything in return this would be an unmitigated political disaster the stories of people with cancer diabetes and more who were suddenly stripped of their insurance and left out in the cold would very likely dominate our discussion for months that leaves more than enough time to lead to significant repercussions in the midterm elections with no democratic leaders in any branch of government to blame i think this would be akin to what happened in the elections but in reverse now if they can coalesce around a replace plan that doesnt leave too many people out then i think they could move forward but in all the years since the a c a was passed republicans havent been able to do that do you think they can what do you think that plan would look like austin one way to get from repeal to replace that minimizes immediate political risk is to pass a plan that doesnt call for repeal for several years at least after the midterms though possibly after the election between now and then there would need to be some kind of transition to whatever replaces obamacare that didnt just dump people off coverage with no alternative but the alternatives could just be not as comprehensive or costly absolutely there will be bad stories but keep in mind there will be bad stories under obamacare too rocketing premiums huge cost sharing and markets with few choices is not a recipe for political success republicans now own the task of fixing those things and doing so in a way that does not look as if theyre making obamacare better theyre actually in a tough policy spot theyll get the blame if they dont fix or repeal the a c a and theyll get the blame if they dont replace it with something people like better health policy is a very difficult and thankless task i think theyll opt for something they can call repeal and replace but they could also just let obamacare struggle and die neither looks good one other way to get out from under the issue is to kick it to the states do you think a trump administration working with a g o p congress will offer greater flexibility to states to design their own coverage plans that could diverge from obamacare if so what are some ideas states might try aaron i think its very likely those in congress could punt medicaid to the states for years theyve been trying to change medicaid funding to a block grant that they can then constrain over time this will be enticing for them because it will allow them to reduce medicaid spending in the future while forcing states to make the tough decisions and take the blame for cuts in either beneficiaries or services fixing the markets for those who are getting health insurance through the obamacare exchanges though is a different story without some sort of market regulation which theyve generally been opposed to the same problems that existed pre a c a with respect to pre existing conditions and individual ratings will exist many people will become uninsured annual and lifetime limits could reappear lots of people will have problems getting insured moreover i have yet to be convinced that a significant number of republicans in the house might coalesce around such a plan maybe for medicaid but im not sure about the exchanges even if
santa rosa calif californias multibillion dollar marijuana industry by far the nations largest is crawling out from the underbrush after voters opted to legalize cannabis in this months election in sonoma county alone an estimated marijuana cultivation businesses are operating in a provisional gray market with few specific regulations and are now looking to follow the path of the wine industry which emerged from its own prohibition eight decades ago and rose to the global prominence it enjoys today but the bruising ordeals of one of the states largest cannabis companies cannacraft have made many in the marijuana industry fearful and they suggest a long and bumpy road from marijuanas approval at the ballot box to the same on the ground acceptance enjoyed by wine and beer businesses cannacraft produces medical marijuana products which have been legal in the state for two decades but operated in a kind of wild west unregulated market in june the companys newly opened headquarters was raided by federal and local law enforcement officers who said the process it used to make marijuana products was dangerous and illegal the agents seized million in equipment inventory and cash this year company drivers have twice been stopped by the california highway patrol and in one case pounds of marijuana was seized the businesss troubles may be a sign of things to come after the drugs broader legalization as medical cannabis companies like cannacraft continue to be whipsawed by the lack of clear state regulations and the glaring contradiction between a federal ban on marijuana and still evolving state laws that should in theory shelter the companies from prosecution cannabis enterprises deal almost exclusively in cash because banks fearing federal consequences will not take their business they are asking people to come out into the open but theres this mistrust said dennis hunter a founder of cannacraft who has spent his entire adult life as a marijuana farmer mr hunter has been arrested three times and he was sentenced in to six and a half years in federal prison for growing marijuana and fleeing during a raid you are basically hiding for years and then you swing the doors wide open its a risk he said and theres no clear path the national election threatens an informal fragile truce between states that have legalized the drug and the federal government president elect donald j trumps proposed choice of senator jeff sessions of alabama to serve as attorney general has roiled the cannabis industry because of comments the republican senator has made about the drug at a senate hearing in april mr sessions described marijuana as a very real danger we need grown ups in charge in washington to say marijuana is not the kind of thing that ought to be legalized mr sessions said at the hearing cannabis advocates believe that during a trump presidency the drug enforcement administration would reinforce its hard line stance on marijuana in august the federal agency reaffirmed the status of marijuana as a schedule drug the most dangerous class of drugs which also includes heroin thousands of cannabis companies in california are now weighing whether they should register with local governments pay local taxes and be regulated like all other businesses or continue to operate in the gray market the plight of cannacraft which despite the june raid has had sales of million so far this year has been closely watched by other companies in the marijuana business here because of the way the company began openly courting state and local lawmakers and applying for licenses like any other business this year the company moved into offices in a corporate park in santa rosa that were once occupied by a company that manufactured heart stents and it obtained a business tax license as a cannabis company and permission to operate agricultural processing machinery their zoning was good the choice of building location was good said julie combs a member of the santa rosa city council they were certainly using an open door policy in may the company hosted nearly lawmakers and regulators from sacramento the state capital to demonstrate the process it uses to produce the soft gel capsules and other cannabis based products that do not involve smoking as technicians in white lab coats operated machines designed to detect impurities in their products mr hunter demonstrated to lawmakers the extractors that produce oils from the plant because cannabis has a stigma around it we really needed to come out and change peoples image of what a cannabis company looked like mr hunter said during a recent interview at the companys headquarters we knew we were going to be one of the first through the gate so we wanted to set a good example for the industry that looked professional and was clean but two weeks after the visit by lawmakers around officers and agents wearing tactical gear and representing multiple law enforcement agencies raided the companys headquarters and four other facilities the officers broke down doors and according to the company seized around in cash machines worth million and million worth of cannabis products mr hunter was arrested and held on million bail which critics of the raid said was an unusually large amount lt michael lazzarini of the santa rosa police departments investigations bureau said the police had acted on the basis of a public safety risk caused by the cannabis manufacturing process which he described as illegal and volatile theres this huge desire to make santa rosa a place for this industry to thrive lieutenant lazzarini said but then a lot of these businesses operate outside of the scope of local state or federal regulations the raid prompted lawmakers in sacramento to enact regulations in september to clarify that the extraction procedure was legal lieutenant lazzarini said that he was aware of the change in the law but that his departments investigation was continuing mr hunter was released two days after the raid and the bail requirement was dropped
ten days removed from the still fresh shock of donald trumps election around lunchtime on a friday i navigated the jagged lines of steel barriers police officers and secret service battalions with big dogs and big guns surrounding trump tower the glass and marble shopping mall tourist trap and tv set had been transformed into the unlikely plotting ground for the nations immediate future it was anybodys guess what was taking shape inside the gilded bunkers clots of media people passers by and protesters crowded the lobby and nearby streets for the occasional clue or at least glimpses of marla maples and prime minister shinzo abe of japan kellyanne conway posed for a selfie with a few lucky cops the locus of the scene was a bank of elevators ferrying staff cabinet candidates and the competing maestros of the trump transition to and from various nerve centers over several floors every time a bell sounded announcing the opening of an elevator door lobby heads would bob expectantly is that what jeff sessions looks like i heard a photographer ask no doubt a host of key trump orchestrators and luminary actors were making ample use of auxiliary entrances and exits sneaking in and out new rumors predictions and potential firestorms seemed to materialize every hour the kremlinology of the incoming white house is shaping up as knotty to say the least not one of trumps initial high level hires has any experience working in a white house how will they work with the volatile real estate and reality show maven in the oval office with his proclivity to make decisions based on the last person he speaks to with his children playing an uncertain role his son in law a possibly ever present whisperer how will it all work with trumps senior adviser steve bannon former head of breitbart news who has a long rap sheet of racial ethnic and sexist affronts and a long running war on washington republicans i had gone to trump tower to see reince priebus the republican national committee chairman whom trump named as his chief of staff five days after his election in the same release in which bannon was named chief strategist and senior counselor bannon was mentioned first for kremlinologists scoring at home and his appointment has consumed the bulk of the attention given his hyperprovocative ways but priebus in a sense filled a more exotic role he would be the chief establishment ambassador for a president whose brief and meteoric political career has been predicated on blowing that establishment up a generous reading is that trump is trying to foster a yin yang tension between his top deputies who will represent his own diametrically opposed impulses the simpler reading is that trump hasnt thought that much about this and is simply trying to reward and surround himself with people he feels served him well in the campaign its almost like a puzzle mystery priebus told me last summer i dont recall what we were talking about but priebus had a knack for homespun wisconsin logic and particularly throwaway lines that would stick with me i kept thinking of the puzzle mysteries that were playing out up and down trump tower even though i showed up friday without an appointment with priebus and was confined to the lobby watching tourists ride up and down its now famous escalators priebus and i started talking last spring as i was undertaking an article for this magazine about the seemingly fracturing state of the republican party we kept in touch during the campaign drank the occasional miller high life in his office and exchanged the sporadic email priebus was constantly going on tv saying he was certain trump would win even though he could read polls and precedents like everyone else still he carried on as the chief carrier of trumps choppy water because thats what a party chairman does he smiles and spins and swallows his best laid plans and audibles in the name of getting his nominee to the finish line in a sense priebus who squired his future wife to a local g o p banquet on their first date was the purest form of political hack that trump would rail against as he bulldozed the g o p for his efforts during the campaign priebus gained the respect and gratitude of trump loyalists especially the fiercest loyalist donald j trump himself he also won derision and ridicule he was the subject of multiple stories in the onion his spirited tv defenses of trumps indefensible behavior drew him comparisons to baghdad bob saddam husseins chief propagandist during the early months of the iraq war whose dubious predictions of imminent victory despite growing devastation all around made him an international laughingstock long before trumps victory back when it seemed like a long shot i asked priebus whether he would consider taking a job in a trump administration maybe a plum ambassadorship to somewhere yes he said wisconsin it was a throwaway answer to a throwaway question which was laughably hypothetical anyway but i never had a sense he had thought that much about a trump administration job besides possibly staying on as r n c chairman whether or not the donald prevailed for all his well honed sheepishness priebuss just a kid from kenosha wisc shtick belies a penchant for main stages big ticket rooms and high level company no shortage of reince priebus photos hang on the walls of the r n c s headquarters on capitol hill he can be a little star struck he travels far and often to appear with candidates and party dignitaries at events where his presence is not necessarily required priebus was giddy when i spoke to him last spring as he prepared to attend a party for times most influential people at lincoln center we were on the phone him walking through the lobby of the j w marriott after a packed day of fund raising
three years ago i read adventures of huckleberry finn to my daughter she smiled as she heard about hucks mischief his jokes his dress up games but it was his relationship with the runaway slave jim that intrigued her most huck and jim travel together as jim seeks his freedom at times huck wrestles with his decision to help in the end tom sawyer concocts an elaborate scheme for jims release when we finished the book my daughter had a question why didnt tom just tell jim the truth that miss watson had already freed him in her will she is not alone in asking scholars have long debated this issue one answer lies in white identity which needs black identity in order to define itself and therefore cannot exist without it identity is a vexing word it is racial or sexual or national or religious or all those things at once sometimes it is proudly claimed other times hidden or denied but the word is almost never applied to whiteness racial identity is taken to be exclusive to people of color when we speak about race it is in connection with african americans or latinos or asians or native people or some other group that has been designated a minority white is seen as the default the absence of race in school curriculums one month is reserved for the study of black history while the rest of the year is just plain history people will tell you they are fans of black or latin music but few will claim they love white music this years election has disturbed that silence the president elect earned the votes of a majority of white people while running a campaign that explicitly and consistently appealed to white identity and anxiety at the heart of this anxiety is white peoples increasing awareness that they will become a statistical minority in this country within a generation the paradox is that they have no language to speak about their own identity white is a category that has afforded them an evasion from race rather than an opportunity to confront it in his campaign for the presidency donald trump regularly tied americas problems to others immigration must be reformed he told us to stop the rapists and drug dealers coming here from mexico terrorism could be stopped by banning muslims from entering the country the big banks would not be held in check by his opponent whose picture he tweeted alongside a star of david the only people that the president elect never faulted for anything were whites these people he spoke of not as an indistinguishable mass but as a multitude of individuals victims of a system that was increasingly rigged against them a common refrain in the days after the election was not all his voters are racist but this will not do because those voters chose a candidate who promised them relief from their problems at the expense of other races they may claim innocence now but it seems to me that when a leading chapter of the ku klux klan announces plans to hold a victory parade for the president elect the time for innocence is long past racism is a necessary explanation for what happened on nov but it is not a sufficient one last february when the subject of racial identity came up at the democratic primary debate in milwaukee the moderator gwen ifill surprised many viewers by asking about white voters by the middle of this century the nation is going to be majority nonwhite she said our public schools are already there if working class white americans are about to be outnumbered are already underemployed in many cases and one study found they are dying sooner dont they have a reason to be resentful hillary clinton said she was concerned about every community including white communities where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism addiction earlier deaths she said she planned to revitalize what she called coal country and explore spending more in communities with persistent generational poverty senator bernie sanders took a different view we can talk about it as a racial issue he said but it is a general economic issue workers of all races he said have been hurt by trade deals like nafta we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country this resonated with me i too come from the working class and from the significant portion of it that is not white neither of my parents went to college still they managed to put their children through school and buy a home a life that for many in the working class is impossible now nine months after that debate we have found out exactly how much attention we should have been paying such families the same white working class voters who re elected obama four years ago did not cast their ballots for clinton this year these voters suffer from economic disadvantages even as they enjoy racial advantages but it is impossible for them to notice these racial advantages if they live in rural areas where everyone around them is white what they perceive instead is the cruel sense of being forgotten by the political class and condescended to by the cultural one while poor white voters are being scrutinized now less attention has been paid to voters who are white and rich white voters flocked to trump by a wide margin and he won a majority of voters who earn more than a year despite their relative economic safety a majority of white women chose him too even though more than a dozen women have accused him of sexual assault no the top issue that drove trumps voters to the polls was not the economy more voters concerned about that went to clinton it was immigration an issue on which weve abandoned serious debate and become engulfed in sensational stories about rapists crossing the southern border
margo solomon has health insurance for herself and her four children but actually getting treatment is another matter ms solomon a year old mother from the bronx says she has struggled to find a doctor who accepts her insurance and with three of her children coping with asthma and one with more complicated medical problems locating a specialist is even more challenging and once in the door she cannot afford the costs including for deductibles and medications i feel like i am all alone out here ms solomon said she is not alone a new study to be released on monday by the childrens health fund a nonprofit based in new york city that expands access to health care for disadvantaged children found that one in four children in the united states did not have access to essential health care though a record number of young people now have health insurance the report found that million people in the nation under the age of lack access to care that meets modern pediatric standards guidelines issued by the american academy of pediatrics say that all children should get health maintenance visits for immunizations and other preventive services management of acute and chronic medical conditions access to mental health support and dental care and have round the clock availability of emergency services and timely access to subspecialists while medicaid and many private insurance plans recommend or require that all of those services be provided under the umbrella of what is known as the medical home the study found that millions of insured children are not receiving many of the benefits there are many children with insurance who cannot get primary care and those who do can often have problems getting specialty care as president elect donald j trump a republican vows to repeal some if not all of the affordable care act which extended health care coverage to an additional million people the reports authors worry that even more children could have trouble receiving the care they need the fact that more than million children in the u s experience insurance and noninsurance barriers to getting comprehensive and timely health care is a challenge that needs to get the highest priority attention from the new administration said the reports lead author dr irwin redlener president of the nonprofit childrens health fund and a professor of pediatrics and health policy and management at columbia university over the past two decades the number of children without health insurance has steadily decreased to million last year from around million in according to an analysis of federal data and the federal governments national health interview survey the effort to extend coverage began years ago with the creation of medicaid which provides health insurance for the poor it continued more recently with the childrens health insurance program which offers low cost coverage to those who make too much money to qualify for medicaid and under the obama administration with the affordable care act offering subsidized coverage and state exchanges the study relied on census data and reports by federal agencies like the centers for disease control and prevention prominent medical journals as well as information extrapolated from the funds clinics and from its national network of programs that provide health care to underserved children across the country the findings reveal a system in which getting quality care is often confusing and expensive with even those who benefit from government programs often becoming deeply frustrated for the insured affordability is still an issue the report noted that employer based health insurance premiums for family coverage increased by percent from to employees contributions to the cost of the premiums climbed by percent over that same period though the rate of increase slowed after the passage of the affordable care act in the average deductible for an individual with health insurance was percent of median income in up from percent in the report said the study also cited a survey that found that percent of pediatricians said they had a hard time collecting patients shares of deductibles and co payments from families covered by private high deductible health plans for those with medicaid like ms solomon difficulties in getting care have also grown many clinics and health systems do not accept patients with medicaid the study said because of the low reimbursement rates ms solomons experience is typical when i was pregnant with my last child i had such a hard time finding prenatal care she said she called to doctors before finding one who took her insurance i mean we would call places and they would be like we take it but it turned out they didnt she said it was so hard even something as simple as getting medicine recently for her sons strep throat was not simple because of a mix up with her insurance card ms solomon had to cover a co payment for a prescription that should have been free she said the report said experiences like hers were common both with government programs and some private insurers the impacts of these barriers are significant the report said parents faced with financial barriers might seek to save money by calling their doctor for advice rather than seeing that doctor in person rather than fill expensive prescriptions a parent might rely on a limited supply of pharmaceutical samples the medical debt incurred by such costs has been linked to reduced access to care creating a vicious cycle perhaps just as significant are the barriers caused by demographics dr michael kappy a pediatric endocrinologist at childrens hospital colorado just outside denver has seen the problem firsthand since he has traveled in colorado montana and wyoming to reach children in areas that do not have large medical centers or specialists my focus has been strictly speaking to solving the geographic barrier dr kappy said the study estimates that around million children live in areas with a shortage of health professionals more than three million low income residents in
beirut lebanon the remaining hospitals on the rebel held side of aleppo syria have been badly damaged and forced to stop providing care amid an intensifying bombardment according to the world health organization bombs launched by the syrian government over the past three days seriously damaged two general hospitals that were providing trauma care in the war zone and hit the only childrens hospital according to doctors nurses and residents the destruction left more than a quarter million people in eastern aleppo without hospital care the w h o said it is unclear if the hospitals will be able to reopen although some health services are still available through small clinics residents no longer have access to trauma care major surgeries and other consultations for serious health conditions the health organization said in a statement issued sunday dr omar the last neurosurgeon in eastern aleppo who declined to provide his full name out of fear for his safety sounded desperate when reached at the height of the bombing on friday we no longer have hospitals to operate in he said you cant imagine what its like living in aleppo right now it feels like we are living in hell our neighborhoods are in flames and bombs are raining down from the sky we urgently call on the international community to send help humanitarian agencies have described the attacks on health care facilities as deliberate the rebel held area of the city is surrounded by government forces and has already run out of most food rations medicines bandages and fuel it has little water the regime is trying to cut off the city said abu roma who uses a nom de guerre and is a rebel commander with the zinki group which opposes president bashar al assad of syria i would say the worst scenario is that we will be martyrs he said referring to all those remaining in the rebel held area aleppo the countrys largest city has been divided since but the situation became markedly worse over the summer in recent weeks there had been a rare respite from airstrikes on rebel held districts but that ended last week now it appears to both fighters and civilians that the syrian government has resolved to press forward regardless of the humanitarian cost and to gamble that western countries particularly the united states will not stop them president obama has never been keen on military action in syria and the incoming american president donald j trump is more sympathetic to russia which has allied with the syrian government aleppo is the pivot said joost hiltermann the middle east and north africa program director for the international crisis group although the government might like to reclaim all of the areas where it has lost control russia and iran another ally are less interested mr hiltermann said but they all agree on aleppo he said it is too big to let go and the interregnum in the united states is a good chance to press their advantage he said as always in the long running syria conflict the sheer numbers of the dead and wounded and the scale of misery and destruction fast eclipses what is imaginable and each individual story recedes but the snapshots from the past few days in rebel held aleppo have been deeply disturbing a video circulating on social media which was taken by al jazeera during the bombing at the childrens hospital showed children being treated with oxygen masks after an alleged chlorine gas attack elsewhere in the city al jazeera captured footage of nurses taking premature infants whom they could balance in one hand out of incubators as clouds of dust from the bombing rose around them one nurse hugged another as they held tiny infants in their arms the babies were carried to a basement shelter and placed together under a blanket in one shot a father cried out for his small son ive lost everything oh ahmad he said ive lost everything you are my life for now the only remaining medical services have gone underground or into peoples homes said mohamed kahil the head of the forensic facility in the rebel held area of the city hospitals have moved to basements to streets to houses he said the medics and staff are still functioning with high energy but under harsh conditions he said four medics were killed in the five days since intensive bombing resumed said mohamed al ahmad a radiology nurse in aleppo reached on social media as the latest fighting took place staffan de mistura the united nations special representative for syria traveled to syria to press for a suspension of the bombing on all sides a humanitarian relief effort to help civilians get medical care food and fuel and a guarantee some sort of safe passage for the insurgents five rebel groups active in and around aleppo including the powerful islamist group ahrar al sham and several groups that receive american support said in a letter late sunday that they supported mr de misturas plan walid al moallem the syrian foreign minister who met with mr de mistura claimed to want to help civilians in the rebel held areas whom the regime views as hostages of the insurgents according to a report by the syrian arab news agency which is close to mr assads government however mr moallem dismissed out of hand any suggestion that eastern aleppo could be self governing he said that would be a reward for the terrorists who he said were still shelling western aleppo which is held by the government he used as an example children killed sunday in a school there mr moallem said that were killed but that number could not be confirmed the syrian observatory for human rights said it had documented people killed in government held aleppo since thursday among them seven children killed on sunday at least people were killed on the rebel held side of the city in the same
friday night the facebook co founder mark zuckerberg went on his vast social network to convince an expanding chorus of critics including the departing president of the united states that he honest to goodness wants to combat the fake news that is running wild across his site and others and turning our politics into a paranoiac fantasy come to life weve been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility seriously he wrote weve made significant progress but there is more work to be done he continued listing various steps facebook was taking like making it easier to report bad information and enlisting fact checking organizations it was heartening to hear especially after his earlier assertion that it was crazy to believe that misinformation on facebook had affected the presidential election in any real way despite copious evidence that it was disturbingly in the mix whether it directly swung the result or not but as mr zuckerberg went on to say that facebook had to be careful not to mistakenly block accurate content he added this we do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves which was why he said facebook would continue to rely on our community and trusted third parties his statement pointed up how much facebook struggles to find the balance between its mission to be a free expression utopia for its billion users and its responsibility to protect them from all that is defamatory dangerous and untrue but more to the point it appeared to buy into the notion that truth is relative at a time when that notion has to finally go away do you really need an outside arbiter to determine whether a video suggesting without basis that hillary clinton was involved in john f kennedy jr s fatal plane crash in should be allowed to stand truth doesnt need arbiters it needs defenders and it needs them now more than ever as the american democracy staggers into its next uncertain phase with a mainstream news media that works hard to separate fact from fiction under economic and political threat facebook which has contributed to that economic threat by gobbling up so much of the online advertising market is going to have a special responsibility to do its part just imagine what things will look like if the unsavory elements that tore through the election false narratives fake news and aggressive efforts to delegitimize traditional journalism come back into play as donald j trump presses to enact his agenda if the past week provided any indication of where politics are going the next four years are going to require an all hands on deck effort to keep the national conversation honest the national security adviser mr trump named last week michael t flynn a retired army lieutenant general has subscribed to the conspiracy theory that shariah law is taking root in the united states contributing to his insistence that americans have every reason to view islam as a threat he recently used twitter to circulate a fake news item that the federal bureau of investigation was sitting on evidence from anthony weiners laptop that would put hillary and her crew away for life mr trumps nominee for attorney general senator jeff sessions of alabama has falsely claimed that hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants are successfully crossing the border annually then there was the announcement by the conspiracy theorist alex jones that mr trump had called to thank him and his radio and internet audience for their support in the campaign add to that the fact that mr trump was the most prominent promoter of the false notion that president obama wasnt born here and didnt hesitate to repeat the outrageous suggestion that the father of senator ted cruz was linked to the assassination of president john f kennedy then consider what it may look like when mr trump pursues policies regarding muslim immigrants and undocumented immigrants its not so outlandish to envision mr trumps attempts to sell his plans getting a lift from the likes of mr jones or a fake site out of macedonia perhaps claiming that democrats are working with isis to use undocumented immigrants to poison local water supplies or some such president obama seemed to have had something like that in mind when he told reporters in germany on thursday if we are not serious about facts and whats true and whats not and if we cant discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda then we have problems mr obama knows of what he speaks he had to muddle through the first wave of this you might remember how his health care plan was marred by a false accusation that the plan included so called death panels that would decide who lived and who died based on their level of productivity to society as former gov sarah palin put it the false death panel allegation was partly based on proposals to reimburse doctors for optional consultations with families over end of life care decisions the accusations took on such power that even newt gingrich signed on to the falsehood despite the fact that he had previously expressed bullish support for end of life planning news organizations including this one debunked the myth but the bills authors stripped out the provision just the same and by then the death panel fiction had negated any shot at a reasoned ideological debate as dan pfeiffer who was the presidents chief communications strategist at the time so grimly put it to me last week the faux death panels were the canary in the coal mine about the coming death of truth things have advanced since then todays fake news is limited only by the imaginations of its inventors and the number of shares it can garner on facebook or twitter thats why people who care about the truth citizens journalists and lets hope social media giants like facebook too will have to come up with a solution to
tehran at first blush the election of donald j trump would seem to be bad news for iran but there is a chance that on balance things could work out surprisingly well for the clerics publicly irans leaders stress that they pay little heed to what happens in the united states that they pride themselves on their independence it makes no difference for iran who the next u s president is the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said in a speech last week yet he could hardly miss mr trumps promises on the campaign trail to tear up the landmark nuclear agreement reached last year which he frequently described as the worst deal ever in response ayatollah khamenei said recently that if mr trump tore it up we will set fire to it but mr trump also presents new opportunities for iran many analysts say while he has criticized the nuclear deal he has also said that the united states should stop backing rebels in syria and focus on the islamic state militant group effectively shifting its support to irans ally in syria president bashar al assad if that happens said mohammad marandi an associate professor of north american studies at the university of tehran it will be good for iran the region and the world with its lebanese ally hezbollah tehran has supported mr assad throughout the uprising which started in morally and later financially and militarily over iranian and shiite afghan soldiers have died in the conflict according to official statistics if such a change would come from trump of all people it would be remarkable professor marandi said in the larger context iran is waiting and hoping for the day the united states packs up and leaves the middle east closing its military bases in the region and moving its aircraft carriers out of the persian gulf while that seems far fetched mr trump has demonstrated an isolationist streak in questioning the value of nato and the nuclear umbrella over south korea and japan they should stop threatening us professor marandi said if the united states under trump is more constructive he will find that iran will respond in kind even with the nuclear deal things could ultimately break irans way last week national security experts signed a report urging mr trump to keep the deal and lately even some republicans in congress and groups that had opposed the deal urged mr trump to go slowly and consider other ways to pressure iran on tuesday the house of representatives did just that voting overwhelmingly to extend some iran sanctions for an additional years even if the agreement is eventually ripped up iran might still stand to gain it has already received tens of billions of dollars in frozen funds is selling oil on the world market and is cutting deals with european businesses if washington were to reimpose sanctions on iran moreover it is doubtful that the other world powers that are signatories to the deal would go along the one area where both iran and the united states stand to lose ground is in personal diplomacy something that was virtually nonexistent after the islamic revolution during the two years of negotiations on the nuclear deal secretary of state john kerry and the iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif developed a strong personal relationship in front of the cameras at least they slapped each others backs joked and seemed to get along very well a breakthrough for two countries that do not even have embassies in each others capitals mr trump has not yet decided on his secretary of state but with people like rudolph w giuliani a former mayor of new york and john r bolton a former united nations ambassador being mentioned it seems unlikely that the same level of personal rapport will be matched lets face it the honeymoon is over said saeed laylaz an economist close to president hassan rouhani these two guys and their teams have talked for hundreds of hours in a period of two years who can replace that nader karimi joni an analyst close to the reformist movement of mr rouhani said mr kerry and mr zarif knew each other for years mr kerrys son in law is of iranian descent mr zarif has hosted mr kerry in his home in new york when he was an ambassador to the united nations you can be sure such relations are now a thing of the past with the names that are being mentioned out there of course iran does stand to lose a lot if the nuclear deal is rescinded since the january signing iran has returned to world oil markets providing much needed income for irans leaders who also have gotten access to some of their frozen funds abroad business delegations are pouring in and iran is even planning to purchase boeing aircraft american planes that will also bring american business culture to iran at the same time large international banks are still not providing any line of credit to iran related projects nor are they allowing bank transfers out of fear of trespassing unilateral american sanctions on iran although the obama administration is working to clear up ambiguities that are holding back financing a republican administration is likely to halt those efforts some analysts adhere to the traditional view saying that americas enmity toward iran has never diminished only the conditions surrounding the relationship the difference is now that because of all the regional crisis there are chances for both of us for cooperation in syria iraq afghanistan and yemen for instance said hossein royvaran a political analyst this means that because of our influence any u s president has to keep dealing with iran be it obama clinton or now trump normal iranians have their own ideas about mr trump many seeing him as a harbinger of chaos the worldview of countries that have suffered at the machinations of colonialism and western power plays is conducive to
heres a look at whats coming up this week insurance industry the first of two proposed health insurance mega mergers goes to trial in federal district court for the district of columbia on monday the billion combination of anthem and cigna two of the nations largest insurers is being challenged by the justice department as being bad for consumers expect more than the usual drama anthem and cigna have accused each other of breaching the merger agreement and cigna is viewed as less than enthusiastic about the deal going through the case will be followed by a second trial involving the proposed merger of aetna and humana economy mario draghi the president of the european central bank will answer questions on monday at the european parliament and will probably be asked about how the eurozone may be affected by the presidency of donald j trump the changes in washington come as europes central bank is still trying to breathe life back into the slow growing eurozone economy on wednesday at a m the commerce department will report data on durable goods orders in october economists are looking for a percent increase mostly resulting from higher aircraft orders excluding the volatile transportation category durable goods orders are expected to inch up percentage point the manufacturing sector has been uneven in recent months hurt by a strong dollar but benefiting a bit from a rebound in oil prices economists will be watching to see which of these trends prevails later on wednesday at a m the commerce department will release figures for new home sales in october economists estimate the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales for last month will come in at barely changed from in september while multifamily construction has been weaker the market for new single family homes continues to be robust the federal reserves policy making committee last met before the presidential election so the account of the early november meeting that the fed will publish on wednesday may seem like a time capsule from a different era but the account which is expected to portray fed officials as increasingly eager to raise interest rates remains relevant because the feds short term plans have not changed the economy is still growing asset prices are still rising and the fed is still getting ready to raise its benchmark interest rate at its next meeting in mid december retail industry retailers across the united states have been promoting their sales for black friday traditionally one of the busiest shopping days of the year but as sales begin earlier and earlier in the season stores are having an increasingly difficult time luring shoppers out of their warm beds on a cold november day
three days after the presidential election an astute law professor tweeted a picture of three paragraphs very slightly condensed from richard rortys achieving our country published in it was retweeted thousands of times generating a run on the book its ranking soared on amazon and by days end it was no longer available its worth rereading those tweeted paragraphs mr rorty an american pragmatist philosopher died in were he still alive hed likely be deluged with phone calls from strangers begging him to pick their stocks when achieving our country came out it received a mixed critical reception writing for this newspaper the critic christopher lehmann haupt called the book philosophically rigorous but took umbrage at mr rortys warnings about the countrys vulnerability to the charms of a strongman calling this prophesy a form of intellectual bullying donald j trump enthusiasts might dispute the word strongman but the essence of mr rortys argument holds up surprisingly well where others saw positive trends say a full throated dawn chorus praising the nations diversity mr rorty saw dead canaries in a coal mine his basic contention is that the left once upon a time believed that our country for all its flaws was both perfectible and worth perfecting hope was part of its core philosophy but during the shame over vietnam over the serial humiliation of african americans transformed a good portion of the left at least the academic left into a disaffected gang of spectators rather than agitators for change a formalized despair became its philosophy the system was beyond reform the best one could do was focus on its victims the result was disastrous the alliance between the unions and intellectuals so vital to passing legislation in the progressive era broke down in universities cultural and identity politics replaced the politics of change and economic justice by when mr rorty gave three lectures that make up the spine of achieving our country few of his academic colleagues he insisted were talking about reducing poverty at all nobody is setting up a program in unemployed studies homeless studies or trailer park studies he wrote because the unemployed the homeless and the residents of trailer parks are not other in the relevant sense does this overlooked category sound familiar mr rorty did not deny that identity politics reduced the suffering of minorities but it just so happened that at the very moment socially accepted sadism good phrase that was diminishing economic instability and inequality were increasing thanks to globalization this world economy will soon be owned by a cosmopolitan upper class which has no more sense of community with any workers anywhere than the great american capitalists of the year again ring any bells this group included intellectuals by the way who he wrote are ourselves quite well insulated at least in the short run from the effects of globalization which left the white working class guy and gal up for grabs open to right wing populists maybe even strongmen in mr rortys view no one within academia was thinking creatively about how to relieve white working class anxiety this was a problem outside the academy he wrote americans still want to feel patriotic they still want to feel part of a nation which can take control of its destiny and make itself a better place sounds an awful lot like make america great again at the time mr rorty was staring at a slightly different political landscape but it wasnt that different ultimately todays just has more mature trees in achieving our country he wrote about the perils of the north american free trade agreement today hed probably have cautioned against the trans pacific partnership in achieving our country mr rorty railed against the scurrilous demagogue pat buchanan who in talked about building a fence at the mexican border today mr rorty would have railed against mr trump and his proposed wall why could not the left he asked channel the mounting rage of the newly dispossessed is his analysis a bit oversimple yes even within universities there have always been optimistic champions of america those who ever passionately believe in the moral arc bending toward justice and work ever diligently on formulating concrete actionable policies that would make the country more just by focusing only on his own environment academia mr rortys arguments also seem strangely parochial during the the academic left may have started to turn its back on poverty but actual politicians on the left were still thinking a great deal about it robert f kennedy was visiting poor white families in appalachia lyndon b johnson was building the great society right through the and into the we had left of center politicians singing the praises of hope rather than the hopelessness that mr rorty decries bill clinton explicitly campaigned as the man from hope and barack obama would later campaign on a platform of hope and change in passing health care reform mr obama genuinely did something for the immiserated underclass and both men in their ways rejected identity politics but it wasnt enough obviously under presidents carter and clinton mr rorty wrote the democratic party has survived by distancing itself from the unions and from any mention of redistribution mr clinton was particularly guilty of this charge passing nafta appointing robert rubin as his treasury secretary and enthusiastically embracing financial deregulation mr obama pushed the trans pacific partnership and he was one of those fancy elites which brings us to hillary clinton she may have had a plan to relieve the misery of the working class but she didnt speak about it much she was in favor of the partnership until she was against it in a paid speech to a brazilian bank she spoke of a hemispheric common market for energy and though her slogan was stronger together her campaign was ultimately predicated on celebrating difference in the hope that disparate voting blocs would come out and vote for her here mr rortys most inflammatory
kanye west likened himself to donald j trump at a concert on saturday in california before tumbling into a minute free associative speech addressing radio programmers mtv his friends and collaborators jay z and beyonc hillary clinton mark zuckerberg and more after getting an array of grievances off his chest from real world politics to awards show politics mr west ended the performance with a microphone drop having played only three songs leaving fans bitter and upset according to reactions on social media its a new world hillary clinton its a new world mr west said from his floating platform stage above the crowd feelings matter because guess what everybody in middle america felt a way and they showed you how they felt the brief concert at the golden center in sacramento came two nights after mr west shocked his audience by announcing at a show in san jose calif that he had not voted but would have cast a ballot for mr trump if he had though the rapper affirmed his belief in the importance of issues like black lives matter and womens rights he praised mr trumps method of communication as very futuristic on saturday night in a trademark polemic the likes of which had been mostly absent from his current saint pablo tour mr west doubled down on his embrace of trump like political incorrectness and opined on the state of the media yeah im taking his lead mr west said of the president elect a lot of people here tonight felt like they lost the rapper began you know why because yall been lied to google lied to you facebook lied to you radio lied to you turning his focus on the music industry mr west questioned gatekeepers for promoting songs by drake but not frank ocean and wondered once again why he is often overlooked at awards shows referring to this years mtv video music awards mr west pulled back the curtain on what he said was the political behind the scenes dealings that go into booking celebrities for such events beyonc i was hurt because i heard that you said you wouldnt perform unless you won video of the year over me and over hotline bling he said sometimes we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win he continued ive been sitting here to give yall my truth even at the risk of my own life even at the risk of my own success my own career however mr west said such truth telling was necessary for real progress obama couldnt make america great because he couldnt be him to be who he was he said black men have been slaves obama wasnt allowed to do this the rapper screamed and still win he had to be perfect but being perfect dont always change things when more music failed to follow the impromptu stump speech disappointed fans turned to social media to demand refunds on sunday the golden center announced that ticketholders would be paid back in full including ticketmaster fees on monday a representative for mr west said that remaining dates on the second leg of the saint pablo tour have been canceled even amid his raw spontaneous and sometimes rambling monologue mr west seemed to know he was courting controversy im not always going to say things the perfect way the right way he said but im going to say how i feel he added get ready to have a field day press get ready get ready because the shows over
in for the first time the census bureau counted more people living in urbanized america than in the countryside this hasnt been a rural nation ever since yet the idea of thomas jeffersons agrarian america has receded slowly despite demographic change we still romanticize the family farm though relatively few of them exist anymore we view even suburbia in pastoral terms the crabgrass frontier as the historian kenneth t jackson put it and as the recent electoral college results make clear we still live with political institutions that have baked in a distinctly pro rural bias by design the democratic candidate for president has now won the popular vote in six of the last seven elections but in part because the system empowers rural states for the second time in that span the candidate who garnered the most votes will not be president rural america even as it laments its economic weakness retains vastly disproportionate electoral strength rural voters were able to nudge donald j trump to power despite hillary clintons large margins in cities like new york in a house of representatives that structurally disadvantages democrats because of their tight urban clustering rural voters helped republicans hold their cushion in the senate the least populous states are now more overrepresented than ever before and the growing unity of rural americans as a voting bloc has converted the rural bias in national politics into a potent republican advantage if youre talking about a political system that skews rural thats not as important if there isnt a major cleavage between rural and urban voting behavior said frances lee a professor of government and politics at the university of maryland but urban and rural voting behavior is so starkly different now so that this has major political consequences for who has power and its not just in terms of policy outcomes she continued this pervasively advantages republicans in maintaining control of the u s national government the electoral college is just one example of how an increasingly urban country has inherited the political structures of a rural past today states containing just percent of the american population a historic low can theoretically elect a senate majority dr lee said the bias also shapes the house of representatives it exists as a result in the formulas that determine where highway funds are spent or who gets homeland security dollars it exists in state capitols where bills preferred by urban delegations have been much more likely to be rejected today the influence of rural voters also evokes deeply rooted ideals about who have power in america jefferson and james madison argued that the strength of the nation would always derive from its agrarian soil they had this vision of what they called the yeoman farmer this independent free standing person who owed nothing to anybody who didnt receive any payments from the government who didnt live by a wage but who could support himself and his family on a farm growing everything they needed and that these were the people who were going to be the backbone of democracy said gerald gamm a political scientist at the university of rochester describing what could be the forefathers of the rural voters who tilted this years election when the framers of the constitution were still debating the shape of institutions we have today percent of america was rural as the census classified the population the connecticut compromise at the time created the senate one chamber granting equal voice to every state to counterbalance the house where more populous states spoke louder and they made sure the compromise stuck today equal state representation in the senate is the only provision in the constitution that remains singled out for protection from the amendment process no state can lose its full complement of senators without its permission but even as a deliberately undemocratic body the senate has slipped further out of alignment with the american population over time the senate hasnt simply favored sparsely populated states politicians in washington sparsely populated states to leverage the senates skewed power when we talk about small state bias all of that was an intentional policy choice said jowei chen a political scientist at the university of michigan republicans in congress passed the homestead act offering free land to settlers who would move to territories that would eventually become states creating more senate seats and electoral college votes for a republican party eager to keep government control away from southern democrats they even managed to divide the dakota territory into two states worth twice the political power as the plains later depopulated and american cities then suburbs swelled the senate became even more unrepresentative jeffersonian suspicion of big cities also appears in the sites of state capitals albany and not new york jefferson city and not st louis springfield and not chicago political scientists at the university of california davis have found that most state capitals were located near what was then the population centroid of each state typically closer to the geographical center of the state and not the place where the most people already lived breaking with how much of the world sited its capitals the state legislatures there also grew significantly less representative as america urbanized in when lawyers in tennessee brought what would be a seminal case before the supreme court challenging the practice the state legislature had not reapportioned its districts to reflect population change in years maryland was still using districts drawn in even states that had constitutions requiring equal population districts were ignoring them florida georgia and new mexico gave small counties times the voting power of the most populous ones decades ago in california amador county had the same representation in the states senate as los angeles county they justified it because that was a cultural norm it was just the way things were said stephen ansolabehere a harvard professor of government rural legislators had no incentive to change a system that favored them they
lima peru president obama said here on saturday that while president elect donald j trump was unlikely to reverse the warming of ties with cuba he would almost certainly re examine trade deals in latin america there are going to be tensions that arise probably around trade more than anything mr obama told an audience of students and young leaders from latin america because the president elect campaigned on looking at every trade policy and potentially reversing those policies even on trade though mr trump will have a tough time making drastic changes to united states policy mr obama said but once they look at how its working i think theyll actually determine that its working for both the united states and our partners mr obama said the friendships weve established with countries like peru the reopening of diplomatic relations with cuba investments were making in trade environmental policies and so forth all those things i expect to continue he added mr trump has offered contradictory views on cuban relations early in his campaign mr trump claimed to support restoring ties but he said more recently in miami that mr obama should have gotten a better deal mr obama was speaking to aspiring entrepreneurs and civil society leaders about how to improve their lives and countries one of his preferred activities during the last stop of his final overseas trip as president he began his trip on tuesday in greece went to germany on wednesday and flew to peru on friday to attend the asia pacific economic cooperation summit meeting along the way he has tried with limited success to reassure audiences that mr trump will not discard the agreements and priorities that mr obama has devoted much of his presidency to advancing his toughest task was here at a summit meeting of an organization that helped birth the trans pacific partnership trade agreement an accord that is almost certainly dead as a result of mr trumps victory also one of mr trumps signature campaign strategies was to demonize immigrants from latin america and he referred to those crossing the border from mexico as rapists and criminals just about every question posed to mr obama from the audience here had to do with the anxiety mr trump has stirred in this part of the world the united states is such a big country that after any election people are uncertain mr obama said i think it will be important for people around the world to not make immediate judgments he also predicted that relations between latin america and the united states would not change much the main message i want you to know is that you have a partner in me and you have a partner in the united states government mr obama said to applause and we are going to work together part of the reason relations are unlikely to change dramatically he said is that the united states security depends on latin american nations faring well enough that their people decide to remain home instead of attempting the arduous journey to enter the united states illegally the best way for my daughters to be secure in america is to make sure that people in guatemala or el salvador are also feeling secure because if theyre not that may spill over the borders to us he said while the illegal migration of mexicans has largely halted in recent years gang violence in el salvador honduras and guatemala has combined with economic desperation to drive migrants from those countries to seek safety in other countries mainly the united states answering a question on saturday from a venezuelan audience member mr obama painted a dark portrait of the progress of freedom around the world and said the wave of countries adopting democratic governance had reversed itself youre seeing some countries that are going backward rather than forwards in terms of freedom of press freedom of the internet in terms of respecting political opposition and civil society he said venezuelas economy is nearing collapse as its government cracks down on opposition leaders in an increasingly desperate effort to cling to power mr obama also said a growing number of people were now arguing that democracy is incompatible with development chinas success over the past years in creating a manufacturing colossus through its authoritarian measures has some leaders particularly in asia insisting that too much democracy can be detrimental but mr obama said that over the long term countries that pursue democracy transparency and accountability fare far better than those that do not in this time that we live in development is based on knowledge and innovation and education and new thinking and sharing of ideas mr obama said in authoritarian systems economies respond poorly to change because their populations are not as well informed or as flexible he said you can maintain order for a while with repressive nondemocratic governance but it will rot from within mr obama said over time those governments fail and those economies fail mr obama told the crowd here to avoid fervent nationalism and identity politics which he said could lead to conflicts if the most important thing about you is that you are an american mr obama began drawing an implicit contrast with mr trump if thats the one thing that defines you then you may end up being threatened by people from other places when in fact you may have a lot in common and you may miss opportunities mr trump has defined his governing philosophy as america first and has already appointed avowed nationalists to top positions in his administration mr obama described himself as a proud american but said the world was far too interconnected for leaders to be wholly focused on their own nations if theres pollution in china then that affects you here in peru he said
there is a group of friends in charlotte n c all women all in their all white theyre college educated with successful careers and they have a message for the new york times come visit us they voted for donald trump and dont consider themselves homophobic racist or anti muslim but now they say thanks to the times and its fixation on trumps most extreme supporters most people think they are they would like a chance to show otherwise and one of them cindy capwell wrote my office to extend the invitation since the election i have been on the phone with many times readers around the country including capwell to discuss their concerns about the timess coverage of the presidential election the number of complaints coming into the public editors office is five times the normal level and the pace has only just recently tapered off my colleague thomas feyer who oversees the letters to the editor says the influx from readers is one of the largest since sept many people are commenting on the election but many are venting about the timess coverage readers are also taking to the comments section of times articles to talk about it says the community editor bassey etim others are calling into customer care at multiple times the usual rate they have a variety of concerns including the election coverage last week president elect donald j trump jumped in tweeting that the times had lost thousands of subscribers since the election the paper says quite the opposite is the case it reports having the largest one week subscription increase since the first week of the digital pay model in i assume that the times has more accurate data than trump but i hope any chest thumping about the impressive subscriber bump wont obscure a hard eyed look at coverage because from my conversations with readers and from the emails that have come into my office i can tell you there is a searing level of dissatisfaction out there with many aspects of the coverage readers complain heatedly and repeatedly about the forecasting odometer from the upshot that was anchored on the home page and predicted that hillary clinton had an percent chance or better of winning they complain that the timess attempt to tap the sentiments of trump supporters was lacking and they complain about the liberal tint the times applies to its coverage without awareness that it does few could deny that if trumps more moderate supporters are feeling bruised right now the blame lies partly with their candidate and his penchant for inflammatory rhetoric but the media is at fault too for turning his remarks into a grim caricature that it applied to those who backed him what struck me is how many liberal voters i spoke with felt so too they were clinton backers but they want a news source that fairly covers people across the spectrum horst gudemann of jackson wyo says he doesnt want to be spoon fed opinions that the times thinks he should have and he doesnt want his primary news source to stereotype half the country as racists we shouldnt judge black lives matters by its most extremist members and we shouldnt judge trump followers by theirs gudemann told me the national desk of the times has correspondents around the country and they filed a steady stream of compelling stories from voters between coastal america and yet between the horse race and the campaign drama much of their work was simply drowned out that left many of the readers i spoke with feeling like the times was a swirl of like mindedness gudemann and other readers said the timess liberalism sounds the loudest the closer you get to the opinion section perhaps not surprisingly still too many of the voices of both the regular columnists and even guest writers are from people with similar views ive read the times for years and im tired of the old guard said james harris of great barrington mass he said hed welcome some fresher voices judy barlas of silver spring md raises a different issue she supported bernie sanders in the primary but she told me she saw evidence early on that the times believed clinton would win the nomination and kept pushing that scenario it anticipated an outcome and it stuck with it when sanders would have a victory they would cast it in terms of what it meant for clinton barlas said it was the same approach through the election in her view editors and reporters developed a story line and thats the only perspective they presented i expect more from the times she said the timess executive editor dean baquet and its publisher arthur sulzberger jr sent an extraordinary post election letter to subscribers that was in part an attempt to assure readers there was some self reflection going on in the newsroom about its coverage it included a vow to rededicate ourselves to the fundamental mission of times journalism that is to report america and the world honestly without fear or favor striving always to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences but they also used the occasion to congratulate themselves on their swift agile and creative coverage on election night and they praised their journalism as fair to both candidates and unflinching in its scrutiny i suspect that gesture soothed some readers but many others were expecting more of an apology and some were repelled by what they described as a self congratulatory tone and what several viewed as a lack of sincerity chavi eve karkowsky an obstetrician in new york city saw the letter through the lens of her own profession in medicine when something goes wrong we ask where did we get this information why what should we do differently we break it down to its very basic level she said karkowsky would have preferred a real apology she said and some sense that the times was looking

the markets are always fickle but since the presidential election the tastes of traders in stocks bonds and commodities have conspicuously changed in the first hours of donald j trumps victory stock futures plunged only to reverse themselves and surge upward bonds at first strengthened and then fell sharply in price as yields leapt higher specific sectors reversed themselves too financial stocks which were earthbound began levitating utility stocks which were in high demand fell out of favor we havent seen changes like these in ages said dave mazza head of exchange traded funds and mutual fund research for state street global advisors the question now is whether the markets preferences will change abruptly again some rollback toward pre trump market preferences can be expected of course some of what we saw initially was just animal spirits and momentum said james w paulsen chief investment strategist at wells fargo asset management the market often overreacts and then corrects itself and that has been happening yet it is possible that the election could be remembered as a pivotal moment in the markets and in politics and not just because a new republican controlled government is likely to enact some very different policies it is at least arguable that the election has given the markets the impetus and the excuse to solidify deeper trends that were already underway the election shock has accelerated some changes that were already beginning to be evident in a much smaller way mr paulsen said i think that some of those trends are likely to stick there is no denying that the elections outcome took the markets by surprise the overwhelming assumption in financial circles and in the polls was that hillary clinton would win and that mr trump would lose the further expectation was that in the unlikely event of a trump victory there would be a major stock market decline but that occurred for only several hours and then there was a powerful stock market rally which has slowed but not stopped thats only part of the story a revaluation of a wide range of assets and securities has been taking place recent stars have faded in the markets transitory judgment new investments are in vogue traders have been voting with their dollars using state street sector exchange traded funds as a proxy for the broader market mr mazza reported unusually high inflows into the sector e t f s for financial services health care and industrials and lesser inflows into materials and energy stocks traders stampeded away from utilities technology and consumer staples shares they were neutral or slightly negative about consumer discretionary and real estate shares take financial stocks and utilities until recently investors shunned banks while celebrating utilities for their steady eddie dividend payouts that shifted radically in the five days after the election jpmorgan chase goldman sachs morgan stanley and bank of america gained at least percent four leading utilities exelon firstenergy nextera energy and entergy lost at least percent before the election utility shares were ahead of financials for the year five days later they were trailing the nearly billion inflow into the financial select sector spdr fund for example was the biggest of any week since the e t f s inception in mr mazza said such cash flows generally correlate with market price trends the biggest weekly outflow was billion and it occurred in the week of jan during the financial crisis investors found bank stocks as scary as they now find them attractive utilities on the other hand moved on election week to the avoidance list with net outflows of million in the utilities select sector spdr fund mr mazza said while traders may have shifted gears hastily there is at least a rational basis for their movements the problem lies in the assumptions behind these market shifts predictions about politics are risky those based on underlying economics may be a bit more reliable for example the bond market shift appears at least partly based on a judgment that inflation will rise because of mr trumps policies inchoate though they may be he has called for tax cuts and spending increases in the nations infrastructure and military that could be inflationary if they widen a budget deficit but conservatives in congress may not go along with an increase in deficit spending its not clear what the trump administration will try to accomplish all of these assumptions may not be borne out in fact similarly technology shares have fallen sharply at least partly out of concern for the possibly negative effects of some of mr trumps policies said larry puglia a portfolio manager for t rowe price it is possible he said that mr trumps approach to immigration will make it more difficult for highly skilled foreigners to receive visas for work at american tech companies or that his trade policies will make the logistics of global tech manufacturing more cumbersome and expensive people shouldnt jump to conclusions mr puglia said we dont know what will happen he said he had made few changes to his investment portfolios preferring to wait and see on the other hand some sea changes may be underway in the economy mr paulsen said the election could be giving traders an excuse to act on them recent data indicates that economic growth has been accelerating the election aside he said it makes sense that bond yields will rise under these circumstances and that the federal reserve will increase short term interest rates janet l yellen the fed chairwoman says a rate increase is relatively likely to occur soon perhaps at the central banks next meeting in december rising interest rates generally help bank stocks and hurt utilities whose dividends no longer seem as appealing furthermore rising rates support a stronger dollar justifying a decline in the price of gold which has been out of favor since the election in addition the labor market has been improving for a long time the american economy
behind much of the middle easts chaos the wars in syria and yemen the political upheaval in iraq and lebanon and bahrain there is another conflict saudi arabia and iran are waging a struggle for dominance that has turned much of the middle east into their battlefield rather than fighting directly they wield and in that way worsen the regions direst problems dictatorship militia violence and religious extremism the history of their rivalry tracks and helps to explain the middle easts disintegration particularly the sunni shiite sectarianism both powers have found useful to cultivate it is a story in which the united states has been a supporting but constant player most recently by backing the saudi war in yemen which kills hundreds of civilians these dynamics scholars warn point toward a future of civil wars divided societies and unstable governments f gregory gause iii an international relations scholar at texas a m university struggled to name another region that had been torn apart in this way central africa could be similar he suggested referring to the two decades of interrelated wars and genocides that driven by meddling regional powers killed five million but in the middle east it is just getting started saudi arabia a young country pieced together only in the has built its legitimacy on religion by promoting its stewardship of the holy sites at mecca and medina it could justify its royal familys grip on power irans revolution in threatened that legitimacy iranians toppled their authoritarian government installing islamists who claimed to represent a revolution for the entire islamic world said kenneth m pollack a senior fellow at the brookings institution the revolutionaries encouraged all muslims especially saudis to overthrow their rulers as well but because iran is mostly shiite they had the greatest influence with and tended to reach out to shia groups dr pollack said some saudi shiites who make up about percent of the population protested in solidarity or even set up offices in tehran stoking saudi fears of internal unrest and separatism this was the opening shot in the sectarianization of their rivalry which would encompass the whole region the saudis have looked at iran as a domestic threat from the get go from dr gause said seeing the threat as intolerable they began looking for a way to strike back they found that way the next year when saddam husseins iraq invaded iran hoping to seize oil rich territory saudi arabia dr pollack said backed the iraqis to the hilt because they want the iranian revolution stopped the war over eight years of trench warfare and chemical weapons attacks killed perhaps a million people it set a pattern of iranian saudi struggle through proxies and of sucking in the united states whose policy is to maintain access to the vast oil and gas reserves that lie between the rivals the conflicts toll exhausted irans zeal for sowing revolution abroad but gave it a new mission to overturn the saudi led american backed regional order that tehran saw as an existential threat that sense of insecurity would later drive irans meddling abroad said marc lynch a political scientist at george washington university and perhaps its missile and nuclear programs the provided a pause in the regional rivalry but also set up the conditions that would allow it to later explode in such force saudi arabia wishing to contain irans reach to the regions minority shiite populations sought to harden sunni shiite rifts government programs promoted anti shia incitement in schools islamic universities and the media toby matthiesen an oxford university scholar wrote in a brief for the carnegie endowment these policies dr matthiesen warned cultivated sectarian fears and sometimes violence that would later feed into the ideology of the islamic state in iraq invaded kuwait a saudi ally the united states after expelling the iraqis established military bases in the region to defend its allies from iraq this further tilted the regional power balance against iran which saw the american forces as a threat iraqs humiliating defeat also spurred many of its citizens to rise up particularly in poorer communities that happened to be shiite arab in response dr gause said saddams regime became explicitly sectarian widening sunni shiite divides to deter future uprisings that allowed iran still worried about iraq to cultivate allies among iraqs increasingly disenfranchised shiites including militias that had risen up though it was not obvious at the time iraq had become a powder keg one that would ignite when its government was toppled a decade later the american led invasion by toppling an iraqi government that had been hostile to both saudi arabia and iran upended the regions power balance iran convinced that the united states and saudi arabia would install a pliant iraqi government and remembering the horrors they had inflicted on iran in the raced to fill the postwar vacuum its leverage with shiite groups which are iraqs largest demographic group allowed it to influence baghdad politics iran also wielded shiite militias to control iraqi streets and undermine the american led occupation but sectarian violence took on its own inevitable momentum hastening the countrys slide into civil war saudi arabia sought to match irans reach but after years of oppressing its own shiite population struggled to make inroads with those in iraq the problem for the saudis is that their natural allies in iraq dr gause said referring to sunni groups that were increasingly turning to jihadism wanted to kill them this was the first sign that saudi arabias strategy for containing iran by fostering sectarianism and aligning itself with the regions sunni majority had backfired as sunni governments collapsed and sunni militias turned to jihadism riyadh would be left with few reliable proxies as their competition in iraq heated up saudi arabia and iran sought to counterbalance each other through another weak state lebanon lebanon provided the perfect opening a frail democracy recovering from civil war with parties and lingering militias primarily organized by religion
lima peru a toxic political war over money jobs and globalization killed the vast and complex trade deal that was supposed to be a signature legacy of president obama but the deal between the united states and asian and pacific nations was never just about trade the agreement the trans pacific partnership was conceived as a vital move in the increasingly tense chess match between china and the united states for economic and military influence in the fastest growing and most strategically uncertain part of the world the deal which excluded china was intended to give those nations more leverage in that strained match by providing them with a viable economic alternative and its defeat is an unalloyed triumph for china the country that president elect donald j trump castigated repeatedly over trade mr obama in comments just before meeting his counterparts who laboriously negotiated the pact made no reference to its near certain burial this is always a useful occasion for us to get together and examine how we can make sure that were creating more jobs more opportunity and greater prosperity for all of our countries mr obama said so its wonderful to see all of you again and i look forward to a constructive discussion in remarks during a bilateral meeting on saturday between mr obama and president xi jinping of china mr xi said the relationship between their countries was at a hinge moment and added that china would work with others to ensure a successful summit meeting i hope the two sides will work together to focus on cooperation manage our differences and make sure there is a smooth transition in the relationship and that it will continue to grow going forward he said mr obama will find that his counterparts are already getting pulled deeper into chinas economic riptide because of the pacts demise australia said on wednesday that it wanted to push ahead with a chinese led trade pact that would cover asian nations from japan to india but exclude the united states peru has opened talks with beijing to join the agreement as well even american business leaders are positioning themselves for the potential opportunities in asia two thirds of what we do there ends up in another country said john g rice general electrics vice chairman for international operations so if theyre going to lower tariffs and trade barriers within that region well find ways to do more there for the united states such trade ties have geopolitical undertones much of asia has for decades quietly accepted american security guarantees while also running large trade surpluses with the united states turning them into prosperous manufacturing powerhouses but china is now the largest trading partner for most of the region while at the same time making territorial claims against many of its neighbors the neighbors fear they could soon face a stark choice among money pride and place accede to chinas security demands or lose access to chinas vast market the long term question is whether america pulls back from asia and makes it easier for china to force countries in the region to make a choice between china and the united states said richard bush a senior fellow at the brookings institution when it comes to asia the shift in american policy is likely to be among the most pronounced in the new administration born in hawaii in the middle of the pacific ocean and raised partly in indonesia mr obama has since his earliest days as president pushed asia as his nations best opportunity for growth other than efforts to end two wars begun by his predecessor mr obamas principal foreign policy goal was to shift the nations attention and military resources away from an aging europe and an unproductive rivalry with russia and toward the fast growing asia pacific region it is a goal he partly shared with president george w bush whose administration began the negotiations for the trans pacific partnership mr bush too saw the pact as a bulwark against chinas rising strategic ambitions mr obama has spent much of the last days putting a brave face on the crushing blow that mr trumps surprising electoral victory represented to his legacy hours after the results became clear he told the country and his own weeping staff that were all actually on one team on monday he suggested republicans would find replacing his health care law difficult and in visits on tuesday and thursday to greece and germany he told panicked europeans that mr trump would preserve the nato alliance but the meetings this weekend at the asia pacific trade summit will very likely have a more funereal feel more than on any other issue mr obama and mr trump have diametrically opposing views on asian trade and mr trump has won even white house aides have admitted to their bosss bitter defeat were cleareyed about the current situation but we believe what we believe about the value of trade and the importance of the asia pacific region to the united states said benjamin j rhodes a deputy national security adviser the allegiances are starting to shift after mr trumps election just three days before mr obamas arrival here perus foreign minister eduardo ferreyros said the country still hoped the pacific pact would someday become a reality but given the changing dynamics his government also opened talks this autumn with beijing to join the rival chinese led trade pact the regional comprehensive economic partnership since mr trump is not so interested in requiring economic integration and trade liberalization why not have other countries follow this free trade proposal asked song guoyou a longtime trade specialist who is the deputy director of the center for american studies at fudan university in shanghai since the election australias government has also called for rapid progress in concluding that rival trade pact even japan despite facing territorial demands from china and close but peaceful confrontations between the two countries military jets and
when dylan ratigan was last on daily television he was often in a bit of a rage after two highly publicized rants about unseemly ties between corporations and politicians on msnbc he left his show in disillusioned he decided that rather than complain about the state of the world he would at least try to be part of the solution he was especially intrigued by something he had heard over the years from both silicon valley entrepreneurs and war veterans if you really want to combat conflicts bring the things that we fight over said mr ratigan dont bring more bullets and boots bring water food shelter communications so we can empower women and children who are physically left in the villages that took him eventually to this line of questioning why not use hydroponics solar panels and reverse osmosis water filtration to reduce poverty and conflict in the united states and abroad why not use agriculture technology to help people in inner cities refugee camps or war zones and after natural disasters and why not recruit veterans to help with everything from manufacturing to installation to operations the vets i was meeting argued that easily deployed resource kits that can be packed and unpacked from a container are the best way to do this mr ratigan said this continues the same mission but with a new set of equipment mr ratigan moved to california and volunteered at archis acres in escondido which trains veterans for careers in agriculture he taught communications and business development and his interest grew along with the crops through a mutual friend mr ratigan met kohlie frantzen an oilman from lafayette la who had lived through hurricane katrina at mr ratigans urging mr frantzen completed the six week training class at archis and became a certified hydroponic organic farmer not long after the two men formed a manufacturing and design company helical holdings investing a few million dollars between them the companys first product is the outpost a or foot shipping container that can house a hydroponic farm and a solar power station and provide wi fi and satellite communication the outpost includes a filtration system that can provide up to gallons of clean water a day it can also generate kilowatt hours of solar power and can produce heads of leafy greens a week it uses a fifth of the water and a tenth of the land of a traditional organic farm the company says each unit costs to depending on size and configuration and can be erected anywhere its like a hair dryer with a set of adapters said eric g strauss the executive director of the center for urban resilience at loyola marymount university los angeles you plug into any adapter in the world urban agriculture growing food on vacant lots on rooftops or in inner cities is not new freight farms and podponics grow produce inside shipping containers ikea sells hydroponic indoor gardening kits in its british stores farm from a box which started in takes an approach similar to that of helical holdings brandi decarli a co founder of farm from a box said both companies help communities become more sustainable or can help them rebuild after crises shifting the focus from large scale mass production to production by the masses can help contribute to greater stability in the food system she said the united nations food and agriculture organization estimates that about million people worldwide suffer from chronic undernourishment nearly all live in developing nations where poverty and conflicts over limited resources are rampant while the helical holdings containers have not been used overseas yet mr ratigan said he was in preliminary talks with the united states agency for international development the united states department of agriculture and representatives from the mexican french kuwaiti canadian and philippine governments an outpost has been installed at an elementary school in lafayette la there is also one at patriot farms of america in berryville va which trains veterans in agriculture and is a nonprofit partner of helical holdings patriot farmers was founded by kory apton the wife of phil griffin mr ratigans former boss at msnbc so far mr ratigan said the outposts in louisiana and virginia have purified gallons of water while growing leafy greens and pounds of vine crops such as cucumbers tomatoes and watermelons they have also created jobs mr ratigan said in general he did not miss the grind of daily television although a part of him wishes he were on the air for postelection coverage his temper still flares especially during the news but im better at seeing u s politics for what it is a very sick system in need of help he said the people of america are painfully aware of the fact that a few very wealthy people have controlled our politicians for years and hillary clinton is a symbol for that relationship he said its why senator sanders and president elect trump had so much support and its why mr trump won in addition to his work with helical holdings he stays busy by minding his stakes in two financial companies producing films and serving as a global brand ambassador for hotelplanner com mr ratigan said the biggest surprise was realizing how much time and money it took to start a business but he said he was proud that he was finally putting his money where his opinionated mouth was even though the uncertainty of the entrepreneurial life makes it a double edged sword when im well rested i like it he said when im tired it is scary
warsaw europes right wing populists have scrambled to outdo one another in celebrating donald j trump as an american president who shares many of their nationalistic anti immigrant attitudes less thrilled are the hard liners in poland and the problem is vladimir v putin poland already has one of europes most conservative governments which took office a year ago and top leaders have eagerly cast mr trumps election as the latest and most crucial chapter in a global shift away from western style liberal democracy but they also see a worrisome problem the chummy noises mr trump has made toward mr putin the russian president even as the government may share many of mr putins conservative attitudes and nationalist impulses polish leaders are restrained by a deep almost visceral distrust of him memories of russian domination during the soviet era are still raw here and poland has been one of the most hawkish members of the european union on taking a hard line toward mr putin the polish predicament is yet another reminder of how thoroughly the trump victory has scrambled the geopolitics of europe his campaign remarks undercutting nato and suggesting that the united states could possibly walk away from the trans atlantic alliance alarmed leaders in the baltics and in poland even after mr trump softened his remarks most of all poland and the rest of europe will now wait and see whether the victory of mr trump who apparently has an affinity for mr putin is an opportunity for europe or an existential threat prime minister viktor orban of hungary who had already made friendly gestures toward moscow sees opportunity many poles still see risks what poland can do is keep increasing its military capabilities keep a low profile and just wait for putin to show his true colors said jerzy targalski a right wing political analyst and historian who supports the governing law and justice party and it wont take too long for now polish leaders have a dual track strategy to praise mr trumps victory as a continuation of their own victories focus on areas of agreement with the new american president and play down as much as possible disagreements over things like how to deal with moscow polands prime minister beata szydlo joined other right wing leaders in declaring mr trumps victory a validation of the rise of a more nationalistic and muscular form of government with a strong executive and resurgent patriotism a certain era in world politics ends an era when politics focused on elites and dealing with issues of the elites she said democracy won despite the liberal propaganda but at the same time polands president andrzej duda was quick to add that his country still expected the united states to abide by its nato commitments and to proceed with plans to deploy nato troops including thousands of americans this spring along the european unions eastern flank of course even some members of mr trumps own republican party do not agree on the best way to approach mr putin whether to continue international pressure as poland wishes or to seize the moment to develop a closer relationship that ends russias isolation as poland fears poland and the baltic states geographically closer to moscow have insisted on maintaining pressure on thursday lithuanias parliament voted almost unanimously with just one abstention to maintain economic sanctions as punishment for russias annexation of crimea and aggression in eastern ukraine for instance on friday key european leaders along with president obama pledged to renew those sanctions but other more putin friendly leaders have indicated they might agree to end the sanctions presidents who were elected just this month in bulgaria and moldova had talked during their campaigns about doing just that while political leaders and analysts in poland and elsewhere expect mr trump to move quickly to negotiate a new grand bargain with mr putin they suspect mr putin also wants to move swiftly not only to end the sanctions that are squeezing his countrys economy but also perhaps to head off that planned spring deployment of nato troops polish officials have preferred to express confidence that despite the troubling signs the new president in the end will abide by americas nato and european union commitments i think we can be confident that u s policy toward poland and thus also our relations will not deteriorate that at least they will not become weaker mr duda said after a brief phone conversation with mr trump this past week and maybe we will be able to strengthen them even further polish leaders have focused on the more welcome statements mr trump has made like his promise to try to change rules that force poles to get visas to visit the united states long a sore point and they have steadfastly defended mr trump from criticism in more liberal corners of europe as a result the right wing government which has chafed under international criticism that its moves to marginalize the countrys constitutional court amounted to an undemocratic attack on the rule of law hopes that mr trumps victory will create an atmosphere in which it can resolve that crisis more to warsaws liking the problem is not that there is a perception that poland is under immediate threat from russia said marek menkiszak head of the russian section at the center for eastern studies in warsaw an independent but government funded research group the problem is rather this uncertainty caused by the mixed signals that have come out of the trump team rudolph w giuliani assured a gathering of polish american voters that the trump administration would abide by its treaty obligations including going to the military aid of any nato member state that is attacked but then newt gingrich also acting as a trump surrogate remarked that if he were president he would not necessarily go to the aid of estonia which he described as essentially a suburb of st petersburg sending a shiver down the
here are the top comments of the week on our digital platforms as selected by our readers and the journalists who moderate nearly every comment this is what unqualified looks like trump never expected to win and never planned to govern he just loved the adulation he got from spreading his brand of hate now we have a completely unprepared administration trying desperately to do in weeks what it should have been preparing for over the last months the disaster begins it seems that billy bush has been one of the few to be held accountable for his words and participation in the onslaught of racism and misogyny in the campaign and now post election appointments all others are ascending to the highest offices in the land as a teacher i am already seeing the repercussions of having teflon individuals in high office have no consequences for their bigoted remarks when a student in my diverse classroom does not understand why it is hurtful to yell build the wall in the middle of class i can blame our leaders the anti semitism racism misogyny will continue if we do not hold people accountable bravo someone who understands the threat that islam poses to the west lets avoid the mistakes of france belgium and other countries where the dominating instincts of the worlds most dangerous religion have been allowed to flourish hey i find it really ironic that all the groups that think they have a god given mandate to enforce tolerance are so intolerant of controversial views and people that run counter to their own maybe the moral and ethical standards of mr bannon are not that repugnant in the end like trump who has said some unfortunate things as has everyone that he regrets if political correctness gets pushed to the maximum business and progress grinds to a halt in fear of legal accusations that become paralyzing how many lives have to be ruined by such enforced correctness and what about the controversial manipulators on the other side like george soros who will hold them to account infrastructure spending child tax credits paid maternity leave and dismantling trade agreements hmm sounds a bit like some of bernies platform slice and dice identity politics are all well and good but in the end it is all about the economy and too many of our fellow citizens are hurting wake up dems and return to the partys fdr roots or continue to lose this sad news hurts like the loss of a family member gwen ifills clarity and moderate tone brought so much to the frantic washington scene this is the worst possible moment to lose her special gift for analyzing politics and bringing contending parties together in a civil conversation i am considering many grad schools in the u s for my master course next fall before the election i only looked at the ranking the alumnis feedback the requirements and the fee and campus life now i really have to think about the safety as an asian woman i dont expect anyone to stop me in the street and tell me to get back to china so now although i was so sure about some schools in texas and wisconsin i have to sit down once again and closely look at the cities and hope that they are not too red this election changed my mind about america imagine for a moment you are a white male somewhere in america who just lost his job at a factory your mortgage is in default your car is being repossessed and you wonder whether youll be able to find a job much less one that pays a decent wage you have no particular animosity towards blacks gays women but you constantly hear the message that as a white straight male you are the paragon of privilege and that the hardships in your life are irrelevant or made up you dont feel so privileged are your struggles and fears really so different from those of the minority groups its easy to see why that person voted for the candidate who acknowledged his fears and against the candidate who dismissed his concerns because he was not a minority im less patient with sexism and talking down and more likely to stand up for others gesture wise the day after the election all of the young women in my office dressed in head to toe black no one coordinated no one knew that the other women would be dressed similarly but we all were sending a conscious message of mourning and it was comforting to see and feel that kind of solidarity this is a what locker room talk should be
washington if they squint hard enough they can see hope in the form of an ambitious piece of legislation like a big tax cut then there is the fact that hillary clinton will not be president and mike pence the faithfully conservative vice president elect is there to keep watch those conservatives who insisted that electing donald j trump president would be a grievous mistake a group that included governors senators radio hosts prominent columnists and some of the most savvy political operators in the country are now saying they see an upside to four years of a trump white house but even as they find small reassurances those who counted themselves part of the trump opposition are wondering what their place will be for the next four years in a republican party they can hardly recognize and they have begun to ponder what it all means for a conservative movement they thought they understood better oh god said charlie sykes the wisconsin radio host who became a vocal opponent of mr trumps during the republican primaries he was describing how he had arrived at peace with the election results then he said he realized that he had not done so at all you kind of have to re evaluate a lot of what you thought about the shape of reality he said its not just that youre wrong its that you fundamentally misread what happened what is so disorienting for many conservatives is that the trump victory was the culmination of the unruly populist upwelling in american politics first manifested in the tea party movement that traditional republicans thought they could eventually absorb instead those forces have overtaken them one by one first claiming their house majority leader eric cantor then their speaker john a boehner and then an entire field of presidential candidates now it may claim their party some on mr trumps team are already boasting how they plan to break with decades of conservative orthodoxy on government spending and pursue a huge infrastructure spending package that sounds more roosevelt than reagan the conservatives are going to go crazy stephen k bannon mr trumps senior counselor and chief strategist gleefully told the hollywood reporter in an interview published friday with negative interest rates throughout the world its the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything shipyards ironworks get them all jacked up said mr bannon who has aimed almost as much fire at what he regards as establishment republicans as he has at democrats it will be as exciting as the greater than the reagan revolution some conservatives say they could surely live with a few of the proposals of mr trumps they find worrisome like a big spending bill especially if they come with sweeteners like tax breaks or spending cuts in other areas the easiest way to forge ahead many are finding is to disassociate the man from the policy i will do everything i can to help him said senator lindsey graham republican of south carolina who has refused on numerous other occasions to help mr trump including voting for him or attending the republican national convention mr graham told reporters on capitol hill this week that he believed he could work with mr trump on issues like the military budget which both men support expanding americans for prosperity the political advocacy group supported by david and charles koch that decided not to spend any money on the presidential race this year despite spending tens of millions to help mitt romney in is also cracking the door to mr trump the group however declined to say whether it had met or spoken to anyone inside mr trumps transition team were encouraged on several fronts by the possibility of the republican congress working with the new president said tim phillips americans for prosperitys president citing the prospect of repealing some of president obamas energy policies along with the affordable care act but as with any period of grief acceptance comes in different ways some find catharsis in writing others console themselves in data that show they really were not all that wrong then there are those who still talk as if they are in mourning they have good days and bad days life goes on said bill kristol the weekly standard editor and leading never trump stalwart who has written columns about his coming to terms with president elect trump any given day mr kristol said in an interview he feels a range of competing sentiments im sort of somewhere between trust but verify and distrust but verify he said using modified versions of reagans famous quote about how he approached negotiating with the soviets on the subject of reagan it is hard not to talk to conservatives today about mr trump and not have them wistfully invoke their standard bearer mr kristol said he feared people were drawing parallels to mr trump that risk setting the wrong standards for success the reagan revolution wasnt that he beat jimmy carter in he said not that i didnt love that the reagan revolution was that he governed successfully for eight years and won the cold war others are concerned that the conservative movement missed an opportunity to appeal to a younger and more diverse group of voters and they wonder how it will do so with someone as divisive as mr trump atop the republican party steve deace a conservative radio host in iowa and prominent never trump figure pointed to the tens of thousands of voters in wisconsin and michigan states mr trump barely won who voted in other races but did not cast a vote for president evidently because they could not bring themselves to vote for him thats not lightning in a bottle he said making the point that mr trump repelled so many voters that he almost lost thats like you showed up for work and they said this is your last paycheck and you and your wife go to las vegas put it
marrakesh morocco diplomats from around the world converged here this week with the plan to put details on last years paris climate accord and move the globe closer to controlling the industrial emissions that are heating the planet instead with the election of donald j trump and his threat to withdraw the united states from the accord shellshocked negotiators confronted potentially deep fissures developing in the international consensus on climate change on the sidelines of the negotiations some diplomats turned from talking of rising seas and climbing temperatures toward how to punish the united states if mr trump follows through possibly with a carbon pollution tax on imports of american made goods a carbon tariff against the united states is an option for us rodolfo lacy tamayo mexicos under secretary for environmental policy and planning said in an interview here he added we will apply any kind of policy necessary to defend the quality of life for our people to protect our environment and to protect our industries forcing united states industries to turn to cleaner energy sources with the hammer of an import tariff is not far fetched countries imposing costs on their own industries to control carbon emissions could tell the world trade organization that united states industries are operating under an unfair trade advantage by avoiding any cost for their pollution the tax would be calculated based on the amount of carbon pollution associated with the manufacturing of each product that would impose a painful cost on the heaviest industrial polluters particularly on exporters of products containing steel and cement the paris agreement is meant to get everyone on board in one structure where you can address climate change together said dirk forrister the president and chief executive of the international emissions trading organization a nonprofit organization that consults with governments and companies but if one big country backs out it could trigger a whole wave of trade responses he added there is no need to start a trade war over climate change but it might happen the marrakesh summit meeting was expected to conclude late friday or early saturday with a declaration that all governments will continue to carry out and strengthen the paris accord and a timetable for adopting the details of the pact such as a global system to monitor and verify carbon emission reductions at the national level in washington the obama administration has pressed forward with its environmental agenda as if mr trump had not been elected an offshore drilling plan unveiled friday assumes continued bans on oil and gas exploration in the atlantic and arctic oceans which the trump administration could easily reverse but diplomats are quietly going off their agendas to begin planning how to react if mr trump chooses to reject the paris agreement the pact as it stands contains no enforcement measures such as economic sanctions for countries that do not comply but individual governments could put trade sanctions in place on their own or in concert in mexico which is already preparing for a newly adversarial relationship with an american president who has threatened to build a wall along the border government officials said they have begun considering the idea of a carbon tariff canada the united states largest trading partner is also discussing a tariff some canadian provinces including ontario and quebec already have carbon tax policies that include fees imposed on fossil fueled energy generated across provincial borders i see that extending across the canadian border if the u s pulls out of paris said lisa demarco a senior partner with demarco allan a toronto based climate law firm that advises canadian provinces and international businesses if you want to sell your goods in canada youd have to meet the same emissions standards she said in france nicolas sarkozy the former french president who is campaigning to hold that office again suggested this week that the european union impose a carbon tariff on american imports if washington withdraws supporters of mr trumps climate change policies say they are not worried its an empty threat said thomas j pyle the president of the institute for energy research an organization partly funded by the billionaire libertarian brothers charles and david koch and which mr trump has cited as influential in shaping his energy and climate proposals economists widely agree that the most effective way to attack climate change is to tax or otherwise put a price on planet warming pollution most of the worlds major economies including the european union and china as well as canada and mexico have already begun to put domestic carbon pricing programs in place the european unions cap and trade system capped carbon pollution levels and created a market for companies to buy and sell permits to pollute china plans to implement a similar program next year and mexico which already taxes carbon pollution is on track to put in place its own cap and trade program by canadas national carbon pricing system set to go into force by allows its provinces to mix cap and trade programs and carbon taxes with congress unwilling to pass either a carbon tax or a cap and trade program president obama pushed for climate change regulations to limit carbon emissions while encouraging states to create their own cap and trade programs to comply mr trump who has called climate change a hoax invented by the chinese campaigned on a promise to dismantle the obama administrations climate rules and put coal miners back to work but since he was elected he has not commented publicly on his climate plans mr trumps transition team did not respond to a request for comment while some politicians are already responding belligerently other european officials are taking a wait and see approach in the european union we have a strong climate policy said miguel arias caete the blocs commissioner on climate action but we dont think it is appropriate yet to speak to a u s carbon tariff because the
washington after incurring their wrath for his handling of the investigation into hillary clintons email use some democrats now see james b comey the f b i director as a potential ally in trying to block president elect donald j trumps promises to revive the practice of sending terrorism suspects to the military prison at guantnamo bay cuba and interrogate them using banned techniques such as waterboarding for three years mr comey has helped carry out president obamas counterterrorism vision in which f b i agents have interrogated suspected terrorists and turned them over to the justice department for prosecution in criminal courts during his confirmation hearing in mr comey told the senate judiciary committee that he believed waterboarding was torture mr trumps nominee to serve as attorney general senator jeff sessions has been a fierce critic of the obama administrations approach he has argued that terrorism suspects should be sent to guantnamo bay and interrogated without access to lawyers and the right to remain silent if confirmed mr sessions would be mr comeys boss mr sessions has also said the united states weakened itself by banning techniques such as waterboarding which he said were legal and effective he voted against the detainee treatment act in that prohibited cruel or degrading treatment of detainees last year he voted against legislation requiring all government agencies to use only interrogation methods in the army field manual those techniques do not include waterboarding mr sessions has said he would not rule out waterboarding again this would be unwise advice to the enemy we face the senator said in he has opposed the closing of the guantnamo bay prison and the transporting of terrorists to the united states to face trial in federal court the positions taken by mr comey in recent years could put him at odds with not just mr sessions but other members of mr trumps national security team given the recent slate of appointments from the president elect f b i director comey may well turn out to be a bulwark against the worst abuses and provide some defense of the rule of law said faiza patel of the brennan center for justice at new york university who is a frequent critic of the f b i lt gen michael t flynn who was offered the key position of national security adviser in the trump white house has said he might be open to using enhanced interrogation techniques with certain limits if the country faced a terrorism attack using weapons of mass destruction or another grave threat representative mike pompeo republican of kansas mr trumps choice to run the central intelligence agency is an advocate of restarting the agencys detention and interrogation program which mr obama ended mr pompeo has criticized mr obamas decision in january to shut down the agencys black site prisons and require all interrogators to strictly adhere to anti torture laws and use only army field manual interrogation techniques in he accused mr obama of refusing to take the war on radical islamic terrorism seriously citing among other policies the ending our interrogation program in mr pompeo also took aim at a senate report on the c i a detention and interrogation program saying its release had put american lives at risk under mr comey the f b i has worked with the military to capture and prosecute high profile terrorism suspects in federal court in f b i agents and army delta force commandoes captured ahmed abu khattala a suspected ringleader of the terrorist attacks in benghazi libya and took him to a navy ship in the mediterranean sea republicans including mr pompeo criticized the administration saying mr khattala should have been taken to guantnamo bay daniel jones a former f b i analyst who led the senate investigation into the c i a detention and interrogation program said there was no guarantee that mr comey would ally himself with democrats to oppose a change in policy under mr trump mr comeys refusal while deputy attorney general in the george w bush administration to sign on to a national security agency surveillance program an action that burnished a reputation for political independence doesnt mean hes not a conservative republican in opposition to the democratic agenda mr jones said mr comey drew criticism from democrats after notifying congress on oct that the f b i had discovered emails potentially relevant to the case involving mrs clintons use of a private email server as secretary of state only to say days before the election that they did not change his determination that she should not face charges mrs clinton among others has said his actions contributed to her losing the election ali soufan a security consultant and former f b i agent who has supported criminal trials for terrorists said mr comey deserved credit for making hard decisions in the email case he predicted mr comey would do the same in a new administration will he win all the arguments i dont believe so he said will he stand up and fight i believe so
anyone who has spent time with lt gen michael t flynn president elect donald j trumps choice for national security adviser knows he is nothing if not blunt especially when it comes to his near obsessive focus on radical islamic terrorism he has said on twitter that fear of muslims is rational written that islamic law is spreading in the united states and said that islam itself is more like a political ideology than a religion the united states he wrote in field of fight a book about radical islam published in august is in a world war but very few americans recognize it general flynn a retired military intelligence officer and registered democrat will be the person mr trump turns to when confronted with a crisis abroad whether it is a renewed bloodletting in ukraine a russian cyberattack on the united states or a hurricane hitting haiti the national security adviser is supposed to be a steady hand and honest broker who can provide measured and unbiased guidance to the president about how the united states should respond these are not qualities readily apparent in observing general flynn over the last few years said representative adam b schiff of california the top democrat on the house intelligence committee general flynn was once counted among the most respected military officers of his generation he spent years in the army becoming known as an outspoken and unconventional thinker as he climbed the ranks of military intelligence he seemed to have cemented a stellar reputation during tours overseeing intelligence for special operations troops in iraq and running military intelligence in afghanistan in both wars he proved unusually good at unraveling terrorist networks but general flynns career unraveled after he was named by president obama to run the defense intelligence agency in james r clapper jr the director of national intelligence fired him after his attempts to change the sprawling agency left subordinates squabbling and his superiors alarmed general flynn though has said he was forced out for refusing to toe the administrations line that islamist militants were in retreat a position that was in fact correct in his speeches and writing since his retirement general flynn has veered far from the mainstream in his views of islam and has insisted that islamist militants pose a threat to the very existence of the united states in mr trump general flynn found someone eager to hear his opinions he backed mr trumps campaign early and loudly and the two appeared to reinforce each others views mr flynn railed at a washington elite that he saw as too cowardly to call the enemy by the name radical islamic terrorism he continued to make comments that crossed the line into outright islamophobia and he led the raucous lock her up taunts of hillary clinton drawing the ire of former colleagues in the military most of whom see it as their duty to stay out of politics even in retirement general flynn has made few public statements since the election but in an interview in october he bristled at the criticism saying he got involved in the trump campaign out of the same patriotic duty that led him to join the military the two men have much in common there is a shared fondness for twitter and they both see themselves as outsiders whose successes have never earned them the respect of the elite for mr trump it is the kid from queens versus the swells from manhattan for mr flynn it is the armys reserve officer training program at the university of rhode island his alma mater versus the overachievers from west point he was one of nine children from an irish catholic family from rhode island definitely lower middle class he said in the interview his father was an enlisted soldier who after retiring worked his way up from bank teller to vice president of the bank his mother earned a law degree at age his brother charlie is currently a major general in the army among the hard line republicans who now dominate the party mr flynn has become something of a cult figure for what is seen as his brave stand against the obama administrations perfidy the favorable view of mr flynn is not shared by many in the republican national security establishment most of whom opposed mr trump or many current and former military officers they say he lacks the temperament and broader worldview needed at the white house where he will have to contend with more than just islamist militants they also fear general flynns apparent willingness to work with president vladimir v putin of russia who he has said should be courted as an ally in the fight against islamist militants last year he even sat next to mr putin at a lavish anniversary dinner hosted by russia today a television network funded by the kremlin which also paid general flynn to speak then there is general flynns habit of saying things that are simply not accurate with complete conviction at the defense intelligence agency his subordinates called them flynn facts there are also concerns that the consulting firm he founded after leaving the military the flynn intel group poses potential conflicts of interest the firm has business ties to middle eastern countries and has appeared to lobby for the turkish government representative elijah e cummings democrat of maryland released a letter on friday that he had sent to vice president elect mike pence seeking more information about general flynns apparent conflicts and questioning why he has been allowed to sit in on intelligence briefings with mr trump
something is deeply wrong when the popes voice reputation and influence can be borrowed by a source that describes itself as a fantasy news site to claim that he has endorsed a presidential candidate and then be amplified unchallenged through a million individual shares the attention paid to fake news since the election has focused largely on fabrications and outright lies because they are indefensible easy to identify and extraordinarily viral fake news is created by the kinds of people who when asked might call their work satire or admit that theyre in it for the money or for the thrill of deception theirs is a behavior that can and should be shunned and that facebook is equipped and maybe willing to deal with for many people and especially opponents of president elect donald j trump the attention paid to fake news and its role in the election has provided a small relief the discovery of the error that explains everything but as the attention has spread widely even president obama talked passionately about it on thursday it may lead to an unwanted outcome for those who see it not just as an explanation but also as a way to correct the course it misunderstands a new media world in which every story and source is at risk of being discredited not by argument but by sheer force false news stories posted on fly by night websites were prevalent in this election so too were widely shared political videos some styled as newscasts containing outright falsehoods newslike image memes posted by individuals and shared by millions and endlessly shared quotes and video clips of the candidates themselves repeating falsehoods during the months i spent talking to partisan facebook page operators for a magazine article this year it became clear that while the ecosystem contained easily identifiable and intentional fabrication it contained much much more of something else i recall a conversation with a fact checker about how to describe a story posted on a pro trump website and promoted on a pro trump facebook page and incidentally copied from another pro trump site by overseas contractors it tried to cast suspicion on khizr khan the father of a slain american soldier who had spoken out against donald j trump the overarching claims of the story were disingenuous and horrifying the facts it included had been removed from all useful context and placed in a new sinister one its insinuating mention of muslim martyrs in proximity to mentions of mr khans son and its misleading and strategic mention of shariah law amounted to a repulsive smear it was a story that appealed to bigoted ideas and that would clearly appeal to those who held them this was a story the likes of which was an enormous force in this election clearly designed to function well within facebooks economy of sharing and it probably would not run afoul of the narrow definition of fake news stories like that one get to the heart of the rhetorical and strategic risk of holding up fake news as a broad media offensive position especially after an election cycle characterized by the euphoric inversion of rhetoric by some of mr trumps supporters and by the candidate himself as the campaign progressed criticism of mr trump was instantly projected back at his opponent or at the critics themselves no puppet no puppet youre the puppet this tactic was used on the language of social justice which was appropriated by opponents and redeployed nihilistically in an open effort to sap its power while simultaneously taking advantage of what power it retained anti racists were cast as the real racists progressives were cast as secretly regressive on their own terms this was not a new tactic but it was newly effective it didnt matter that its targets knew that it was a bad faith maneuver a clear bid for power rather than an attempt to engage or reason the referees called foul but nobody could hear them over the roar of the crowds or maybe they could but realized that nobody could make them listen fake news as shorthand will almost surely be returned upon the media tenfold the fake news narrative as widely understood and deployed has already begun to encompass not just falsified fabricated stories but a wider swath of traditional media on facebook and elsewhere fox news fake news mr trumps misleading claims about ford keeping jobs in america fake news the entirety of hyperpartisan facebook fake news this wide formulation of fake news will be applied back to the traditional news media which does not yet understand how threatened its ability is to declare things true even when they are facebook may try to address the narrow version of the problem the clearly fabricated posts facebook has plenty of tools at its disposal and has already promised to use one to bar sites that have been flagged as promoting falsified content from using its advertising platform but the worst identified defenders make their money outside facebook anyway another narrow response from facebook could be to assert editorial control over external forces facebook tried this to a very limited extent with trending topics members of the companys editorial staff wrote descriptions of trending news stories accompanied by links they deemed credible this initiative collapsed in a frenzy of bias accusations and political fear but it is easy to imagine a system in which a story upon reaching some high threshold of shares or a source upon reaching some cumulative audience could be audited and declared unreliable this could resemble facebooks short lived experiment to tag satire articles as such a number of narrow measures could stop a fake story about the pope for example but where would that leave the rest of the media answered and rebutted and barely better positioned against everything else that remained it would be a still dominant news environment in which almost everything there before remained intact the main difference being
the consumer financial protection bureau is fighting back against a federal courts ruling last month that the agencys structure is unconstitutional on friday the bureau filed a widely expected petition for a rehearing asking the full slate of active judges at the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit to reconsider the case when congress created the bureau a three judge panel said last month it improperly gave the agencys independent director too much unchecked power the courts suggested fix allow the president to fire the agencys director at will the decision has taken on added significance with the surprise election of donald j trump if the ruling stands the new president would have the power to dismiss the director of the bureau richard cordray and reshape the agency in his own mold the consumer bureaus petition temporarily stops the clock on that possibility until the court rules on the petition mr cordray cannot be removed without cause and if the court agrees to revisit the case the earlier ruling will be vacated in its petition the consumer bureau said that the courts previous ruling sets up what may be the most important separation of powers case in a generation it added that it could have spillover effects on a number of other independent agencies including the social security administration and the federal housing finance agency legal scholars say that the case will probably end up at the supreme court but the path there is a slow one and right now letting the case play out works in the consumer bureaus favor the appeal process will push off by approximately two years or more the date when the president would have the power to remove the c f p b director at will quyen t truong a former deputy general counsel at the bureau who now works at the law firm stroock stroock lavan wrote in a briefing about the case the consumer bureau has been a battleground between the agencys republican critics who have long wanted to kill or defang it and democrats determined to preserve the changes the agency has imposed on banks and lenders since opening its doors five years ago representative jeb hensarling republican of texas who is chairman of the house financial services committee introduced a bill in september to replace the agencys sole director with a bipartisan five member commission he has been talking about the bill with mr trumps transition team he said this week senator elizabeth warren democrat of massachusetts who helped create the agency pledged to battle any attempt to curtail the bureaus power or independence if trump and the republican party try to turn loose the big banks and financial institutions so they can once again gamble with our economy and bring it all crashing down then we will fight them every step of the way she said in a speech last week
washington president elect donald j trumps trio of hard line selections on friday served notice that he intends not only to reverse eight years of liberal domestic policies but also to overturn decades of bipartisan consensus on the united states proper role in world affairs mr trump is moving quickly to realize his campaigns promise of a nation that relentlessly enforces immigration and drug laws views muslims with deep suspicion second guesses post world war ii alliances and sends suspected terrorists to guantnamo bay or c i a secret prisons to be interrogated with methods that have been banned as torture at a time when american cities have been inflamed by racial tensions police shootings and fears over homegrown terrorism mr trump made no conciliatory gestures toward muslims mexicans or residents of african american neighborhoods all of whom he disparaged during his campaign in his first major national security selections so far senator jeff sessions republican of alabama for attorney general representative mike pompeo republican of kansas for c i a director and lt gen michael t flynn for national security adviser mr trump sent a clear message that he does not intend to use these personnel choices to build bridges to democrats or the moderate and traditionally conservative republicans who opposed the nationalist overtones of his presidential campaign the reaction from democrats was swift and sulfurous senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts demanded that mr trump withdraw mr sessions while senator cory booker of new jersey charged that some of mr trumps choices had degraded and demeaned americans the president elect has created a white house leadership that embodies the most divisive rhetoric of his campaign senator ron wyden of oregon said mr trump swept into office promising to dispense with the political correctness of washingtons establishment and his choices reflect that president george w bush assembled a republican cabinet with a variety of shades of conservative ideology including some members who challenged the president mr trumps early decisions suggest he favors a cabinet that will echo his opinions the choices also suggest that on the perennially vexing question of how the government should balance security and civil liberties mr trump will throw his weight firmly behind security in matters of both counterterrorism and traditional law enforcement mr sessions one of the senates most conservative members defended mr bushs authority to conduct wiretapping without a warrant after the sept attacks he has been a vocal supporter of military detention at guantnamo bay and sharply criticized the obama administration for assigning lawyers to suspected terrorists and giving them the right to remain silent even when arrested on american soil he has said the united states should keep waterboarding a banned technique that the obama administration considered to be torture as an interrogation option because it works a former prosecutor with a history of racially tinged remarks mr sessions has voted against laws that protect gay people and guarantee equal pay for women he has also supported efforts to roll back the voting rights act he has shown over two decades in the senate that he believes the justice department should do more to crack down on illegal immigration and he has supported strict enforcement of drug laws and opposed the dtente that washington reached with states that legalized marijuana while the obama administration has used the justice department to expand the definition of civil rights to cover gays lesbians and transgender people for example mr sessions says the government should not be a sword to assert inappropriate claims that have the effect of promoting political agendas jeff sessions has a decades long record from his early days as a prosecutor to his present role as a senator of opposing civil rights and equality sherrilyn ifill the president and director counsel of the n a a c p s legal defense fund said in a statement it is unimaginable that he could be entrusted to serve as the chief law enforcement officer for this nations civil rights laws as one of mr trumps earliest most vocal supporters mr sessions has supported mr trumps call for a temporary ban on immigration from muslim countries as the nations chief law enforcement officer mr sessions would be in position to help put that ban into effect we have no duty to morally or legally admit people he said this year we need to use common sense with the who what where of the threat it is the toxic ideology of islam along with mr pompeo and general flynn he will thrust the charged phrase radical islamic terrorism to the center of american foreign policy in a way that blurs the lines between a war on terrorism and a war on islam general flynn in particular has used anti muslim language that even the most strident republicans have avoided fear of muslims is rational he posted on twitter in february he has described islam as a political ideology that has turned into a malignant cancer like mr sessions general flynn favors an immigration ban and has expressed support for the idea of forcing muslims in the united states to register with the government he once erroneously wrote on twitter that shariah or islamic law was in danger of taking over the country both mr bush and president obama believed that such assertions inflamed anti american sentiment served as a recruiting tool for terrorists and antagonized countries in the middle east that the united states needed as allies in the fight against violent extremism since sept there has been bipartisan consensus that the best way to combat terrorism was to dismantle al qaeda and other networks while avoiding being seen as attacking islam mr trump has shown no such qualms mr pompeo has said muslim leaders contribute to the threat of terrorism by refusing to repudiate it although islamic leaders and advocacy groups have done so repeatedly and often silence has made these islamic leaders across america potentially complicit in these acts and more importantly still in
erbil iraq many muslims in the middle east reacted with a mix of fear caution suspicion and scorn on friday to president elect donald j trumps appointments of aides with hostile views toward islam from iraq and syria and lebanon and elsewhere a range of people already skeptical about mr trump said their doubts were only reinforced by announcements that senior security positions in his administration would be filled with figures like lt gen michael t flynn known for his outspoken antipathy toward muslims trump chose genflynn as his national security advisor we must not shy away from comparing his anti muslim rhetoric to that of the nazis joey ayoub a well known lebanese blogger said on twitter he echoed the trepidation about general flynns now famous twitter post that fear of muslims is rational struggling to understand what mr trumps ascent means for them and their war ravaged region some however expressed hope that he will confront militant islamist extremists far more aggressively than the obama administration has done yet others fear that mr trumps views and his reliance cabinet appointees who have expressed anti islam views will be exploited as a recruiting tool by islamic state operatives and other violent militants mr trumps suspicions toward muslims reinforces and ratifies the jihadist worldview said charlie winter a senior research fellow at the international center for the study of radicalization and political violence at kings college in london jihadists are always looking for evidence of this conspiracy against islam he said general flynns elevation in particular is deeply deeply worrying in iraq where modern history has been profoundly shaped by the decisions of american presidents officials and citizens alike are weighing mr trumps harsh words against his promise to defeat terrorism surprisingly some iraqis seemed less offended by mr trumps comments linking terrorism to islam than american liberals iraqis have endured years of islam being used to justify mass killing and some see mr trump as a truth teller in calling out islam or a certain brand of it as the problem iraqi shiites say they believe mr trump will take a harder line on saudi arabia the sunni power that many see as the incubator of the extreme form of islam wahhabism that forms a basis of the islamic states ideology the victory of trump is the beginning of the end of extremist islam and wahhabism said mouwafak al rubaie an iraqi lawmaker and the countrys former national security adviser in mr trumps vow to defeat terrorism many iraqis say they have hope that decisive american power will be marshaled to eradicate the islamic state the extremist group also known as isis which has brutalized parts of iraq syria and libya and plotted attacks on the west we have no concerns about the policy of trump because he is against extremism said saad al hadithi the spokesman for prime minister haider al abadi of iraq we think we are facing one enemy and that is fighting isis therefore i do not think there are fears or concerns about a new american policy on friday mr abadi spoke by phone with mr trump for the first time and a statement released by the prime ministers office said the two leaders affirmed their cooperation against the islamic state mr trump told mr abadi you are essential partners to us and you will find strong and deep support but mr trumps invective against muslims during the campaign and his apparent intent to put those feelings into policy with his appointments represented a deep betrayal to the many iraqis who worked as translators alongside the american military in iraq and have dreamed of immigrating to the united states under a special visa program that will now be in jeopardy though six years have passed i was still hoping to get a call at any moment that would represent the fulfillment of the promise they made to me said ali najam abdullah who worked as an interpreter for the american military in anbar province for five years he said seeing mr trump win the presidency has given me a clear image that dream has totally vanished some local leaders in areas of iraq that have known firsthand the islamic states brutality expressed alarm that an american government seen as virulently anti muslim would become a rallying cry for jihadist recruiters there is concern about the policy of trump toward the muslims because america is not just any state said kareem al jibouri a member of the provincial council in diyala province it is a powerful state and we are concerned that any extreme policy toward muslims will help extreme movements by polarizing thousands of the youths and turning them into time bombs by recruiting them
last week our first friday mailbag was mostly election themed with donald trumps surprise victory occupying most readers minds this week has been no different the number of letters only increased over the weekend and during the first half of the week coming in at their highest rate at around per day many readers were still questioning the timess election coverage more on that in sundays public editor column another related topic was the papers plans to cover the trump presidency over the next four years some offered suggestions several other writers proposed methods for responding to a president whose falsehoods thus far have been difficult to keep up with others offered words of encouragement in response to the president elects barrage of angry tweets about the times one reader wrote when the times reported on trumps first white house appointees many readers believed that the paper was already normalizing trumps presidency by inaccurately describing them on the timess description of trumps pick to reshape the environmental protection agency myron ebell as a climate contrarian trained scientists who see only moderate consequences in global warming other doubters political religious whatever need a more deliberate description like people who reject established climate science or subsequently climate denialists or climate contrarians on the timess description of trumps pick for a top white house post stephen bannon as a right wing media provocateur and a nationalist media mogul some readers were mystified by the timess postelection analysis several were concerned with a story that featured a map describing two separate americas one hillary clintons one trumps a story on the trump camps refusal to close the door on putting hillary clinton in jail raised readers eyebrows when it compared trumps possible investigation to president obamas decision over whether to investigate the george w bush administration for torture the sentence has since been updated though readers were not notified the earlier sentence read the decision trump faces echoes one confronted by mr obama and his first attorney general eric h holder jr over whether to investigate bush administration officials for extreme interrogation tactics against terrorism suspects that the obama administration later deemed to be torture it was changed to when mr obama took office he and his first attorney general eric h holder jr also faced a decision over whether to investigate the previous administration one reader wrote the public editors take after a times live briefing included the term death tax a slew of readers wrote in to point out the misstep one reader wrote we raised the concern with the editor of the briefing he told us that the term had slipped by and that hed discuss it with the author notwithstanding the various complaints and trumps claim otherwise the times this week reported a drastic uptick in paid subscriptions since the election to be exact many of the new subscribers wrote in to our office to explain their decisions one reader even asked how he could go a step further another reader said she would will be relying on the times not just for its reporting but also for inspiration although we cant speak for the newsroom we can promise beth that the public editors office will do its best to help the newsroom answer the call
the stock markets turbulent response to the election of donald j trump first down then up presents an interesting quandary was the election result good or bad for investors right now it appears that they have made peace with the prospect of a trump presidency the s p a broad based index of stocks closed last week percent higher than its election eve level but this is a striking reversal from the initial judgment throughout the campaign stocks rose whenever campaign developments made it less likely that mr trump would be elected consider the four events that shifted the race most dramatically stocks rose sharply after the first presidential debate one that most people thought mr trump lost stocks rose again after the release of the video of mr trumps sexually explicit boasts when the f b i announced that it was looking into a new cache of hillary clintons emails mr trumps electoral stock rose but american stocks fell and when the f b i clarified that there nothing new in these emails stocks rose on the increased prospect of a trump loss each of these market responses suggests that investors believed that stocks would be worth much less under president trump i documented this pattern in a pre election column and also in a research paper in which eric zitzewitz a dartmouth economist and i studied these data more carefully we concluded that the market was acting as if it were pricing in a substantial trump discount perhaps as large as percent if this was right then a surprise trump win should have led stocks to fall and fall sharply just how sharply depends how much markets had already priced in the possibility of a trump win and our best guess was that it would lead stocks to fall by to percent markets followed that script at least at first as the votes were tallied through the evening it became clear that mr trump was on track to win the election by midnight the upshots live forecast gave him a better than percent chance of winning as did traders in political prediction markets as predicted traders in overnight markets responded savagely and stocks plummeted when the decline in s p futures hit percent it triggered the circuit breakers at the chicago mercantile exchange foreign stock indexes were also cratering while markets had yet to fall by as much as we had predicted they appeared to be on their way but then an unexpected second act began the futures market reopened and traders who by now had had some time to digest the reality of a trump presidency reversed course over the next four hours stock futures recovered around two thirds of their earlier losses by the time major markets in the united states opened the next morning for regular trading stocks were almost back to pre election levels stocks rose again on each of the following two days what explains this roller coaster some commentators have suggested that markets rallied in response to mr trumps relatively conventional victory speech his emphasis on infrastructure spending in particular might have boosted near term growth expectations but the speech began just before a m three hours after the market turnaround the speech was simply a rehashing of mr trumps previously announced policies a major infrastructure push might be good for stocks but its hard to believe that what was said at a m changed the odds of its implementation moreover the size of the stimulus which would most likely be partly countered by a fed tightening is not large enough to explain a major market movement another possibility is that markets were responding to news that republicans looked likely to hold the house and senate but according to the upshots live forecast that was clearly a sure thing by p m while the market turnaround occurred hours later others have suggested that the market rallied because the election reduced uncertainty and markets hate uncertainty but this is a case where our casual intuitions can be misleading the election did resolve one uncertainty but in a way that increased overall uncertainty the markets went from facing the mere possibility that the riskier candidate would be elected to the certainty that he would be that is risk and uncertainty rose which typically leads stock prices to fall perhaps markets were responding to some other source of good news about the economy ive scoured news feeds from election night for other events that might have moved markets and cant find anything when conventional explanations fail its time to look for something more unorthodox mr zitzewitz thinks what happened is analogous to polling error overnight futures markets are populated by a relatively small number of traders who are attempting to predict how the broader market will respond the next day just as polling errors arise when pollsters survey more democrats or republicans than there are in the broader population overnight markets can send faulty signals when they reflect more bears or bulls than the broader market in his telling the market turnaround really gathered steam when the european financial markets opened for regular trading at around a m and it continued with greater force as more of the worlds traders awoke to discover that mr trump had won and stocks were cheap its a story suggesting that its worth listening to the signals from overnight markets because they get it right on average but it also suggests interpreting signals with greater caution than we showed because theyre an imperfect gauge of broader market sentiment my own view is that last weeks stock market gyrations reflect a more fundamental market failure call it a failure of imagination investors simply failed to imagine how they might feel when they woke up to president elect trump psychologists have documented what they call a focusing illusion daniel kahneman the behavioral economist who studies the psychology of decision making has described it as the idea that nothing in life is

jerusalem americas top diplomat in jerusalem lives in an elegant three story stone house first built by a german lutheran missionary in a short walk from the historic old city but he is not an ambassador and the mission is a consulate not an embassy for decades those distinctions have rankled many israeli jews the united states along with the rest of the world has kept its primary diplomatic footprint not in israels self declared capital jerusalem but in the commercial and cultural hub of tel aviv to avoid seeming to take sides in the fraught and never ending argument over who really has the right to control this ancient city until now maybe president elect donald j trump vowed during his campaign that he would relocate the mission fairly quickly after taking office that in itself is nothing new for years candidates running for president have promised to move the embassy to jerusalem and for years candidates who actually became president have opted against doing so but just as mr trump broke all the rules of campaigning some of his supporters say no amount of hand wringing by the state department will change his mind jason greenblatt an orthodox lawyer who is advising mr trump on israel told army radio after the election that the president elect was going to do it because he was a man who keeps his word already many israelis and palestinians are buzzing about the prospect where would the embassy go would it straddle the line between west jerusalem which is predominantly jewish and east jerusalem which is predominantly arab would it touch off street protests in palestinian cities or a backlash among arab allies like egypt and saudi arabia jerusalem is a symbolic emotional and real issue said itamar rabinovich a former israeli ambassador to the united states and president of the israel institute it matters to many israeli jews because it would indicate that the united states actually recognizes jerusalem as israels capital which now it effectively does not which is why arabs object so strenuously to such a move this is a sign that hes going to side with israel said mustafa alani a scholar at the gulf research center a research organization with offices in saudi arabia and elsewhere if he does it its going to be a wrong start for his relationship with the arab world the status of jerusalem has always been one of the thorniest issues dividing jews and arabs in the united nations recommended that the city be declared a corpus separatum meaning an international city rather than incorporated into either the arab or the jewish states then being contemplated on the land between the jordan river and the mediterranean sea but in the war that followed its declaration of statehood in israel captured the western portion of the city while jordan seized the east israel took control of east jerusalem in its war with its arab neighbors and annexed it declaring that the city would remain whole and unified as its eternal capital the united states and most other countries refused to recognize the annexation and kept their embassies in or near tel aviv the last two countries with embassies in jerusalem costa rica and el salvador moved out a decade ago bill clinton and george w bush both promised during their presidential campaigns to move the embassy to jerusalem both later backed away from those promises convinced by middle east experts that doing so would prejudge negotiations for a final settlement between israelis and palestinians in congress passed a law declaring jerusalem to be israels capital and requiring the embassy be moved there by or else the state department building budget would be cut in half but the law included a provision allowing presidents to waive its requirement for six months if they determined it was in the national interest so every six months mr clinton mr bush and eventually president obama signed such waivers fearing a violent response in the arab world if the embassy moved every president who reversed his campaign promise did so because he decided not to take the risk said dennis b ross a longtime middle east envoy who advised multiple presidents including mr obama jerusalem has historically been an issue that provoked great passions often as a result of false claims that did trigger violence whether such advice might sway mr trump is unclear despite mr greenblatts declaration another trump adviser on the middle east walid phares told the bbc that mr trump would move the embassy under consensus he later clarified that he meant a consensus at home since no one could imagine a consensus including arabs at this point elliott abrams a former middle east adviser to mr bush said mr trump should follow through because even if east jerusalem is eventually ceded to the palestinians as the capital of their own state no plausible settlement would deny west jerusalem to israel there is simply no reason not to put a u s embassy there he said the issue remains so delicate that the obama administration went all the way to the supreme court to block a law passed by congress allowing american parents of children born in jerusalem to list israel as their birthplace on their passports when mr obama came to jerusalem in september for the funeral of shimon peres the former israeli president and prime minister the white house initially released a transcript of his eulogy that listed jerusalem israel as the location of his remarks a few hours later it issued a corrected transcript that literally crossed out the word israel the consulate currently in jerusalem run by the consul general donald blome a career diplomat deals mainly with the palestinians while the embassy in tel aviv run by ambassador daniel b shapiro an obama appointee handles relations with israel mr trump could simply declare the consulate to be an embassy and move the ambassadors home as a stopgap but there are
washington president elect donald j trump moved quickly on friday to begin filling national security posts at the top echelons of his administration selecting a group of hawks and campaign loyalists who reflect the hard line views that defined his run for president mr trump said he would nominate as attorney general senator jeff sessions of alabama who has been a fierce supporter of a crackdown on undocumented immigrants the president elect also moved to install michael t flynn a retired lieutenant general who has said that islamist militancy poses a global existential threat as his national security adviser and as director of the c i a mr trump selected representative mike pompeo of kansas who harshly criticized hillary clinton during the house investigation of the attack on the united states diplomatic compound in benghazi libya all three are regarded in some ways as outliers from conventional republican thinking shunned at times for strident statements controversial positions or highly partisan moves the flurry of announcements indicated that mr trump was gaining control over a transition operation that had been entangled in infighting during its early stages the results were the first seeds of an administration in waiting that will break starkly with that of president obama transition officials said mr trump would meet over the weekend with a broad array of potential cabinet members and other advisers as a signal that he wanted to build a diverse team without regard to political affiliation or support for his presidential bid among them are mitt romney the republican nominee and one of his partys harshest critics of the president elects campaign who is a contender for secretary of state and michelle a rhee a democrat who pursued sweeping reforms during her controversy filled tenure as the district of columbias chancellor of schools mr trump also planned to meet on saturday with james n mattis a retired marine corps general who headed united states central command and is being considered for secretary of defense but there was no evidence in fridays selections that mr trump who has hinted that he might pursue a more centrist agenda once he sits in the oval office is inclined to moderate his approach on key questions of national security and civil rights in a statement on friday mr trump called mr sessions a world class legal mind and added that mr pompeo would be a brilliant and unrelenting leader for our intelligence community of general flynn he said i am pleased that lieutenant general michael flynn will be by my side as we work to defeat radical islamic terrorism navigate geopolitical challenges and keep americans safe at home and abroad both mr sessions and general flynn were early and fervent supporters of mr trumps presidential campaign even as many establishment republicans were criticizing mr trump for inflammatory statements and dismissing his chances of winning the nomination mr pompeo initially supported senator marco rubio of florida in the republican primary but switched after it became clear mr trump would be the nominee mr pompeo is also close to vice president elect mike pence who is heading the transition effort in mr sessions who if confirmed would be charged with safeguarding civil rights in the united states was blocked from becoming a federal judge by the senates republican controlled judiciary committee because of previous racially charged comments and actions in testimony before the committee former colleagues said that mr sessions had referred to the n a a c p the southern christian leadership conference and other civil rights groups as un american and communist inspired an african american federal prosecutor thomas h figures said at the time that mr sessions had referred to him as boy and testified that mr sessions had said the ku klux klan was fine until i found out they smoked pot a remark mr sessions later dismissed as a joke aides to mr trump dismissed the past statements and described mr sessions as a champion of civil rights citing as evidence a number of desegregation lawsuits he filed while serving as a united states attorney in alabama his votes to extend the voting rights act and to confirm eric h holder jr as the first african american attorney general and his efforts to award the congressional gold medal to rosa parks senator sessions is someone whos universally respected across party lines in the united states senate said jason miller a spokesman for mr trumps transition team calling him very well qualified for this position senator jeff flake republican of arizona said on twitter that mr sessions was well liked and well regarded even by those who dont always agree with him he added i look forward to supporting his nomination other republican senators and conservative groups likewise rallied behind mr sessions while democrats have pledged to keep an open mind on confirming him but in a reflection of the tough questions he is likely to face in his confirmation hearing civil rights groups and their champions in congress condemned the choice given some of his past statements and his staunch opposition to immigration reform said senator chuck schumer of new york the new minority leader i am very concerned about what he would do with the civil rights division at the department of justice and want to hear what he has to say mr trumps selection of general flynn which does not require senate confirmation was similarly cheered by conservative organizations and met with alarm by democrats he has called islam a political ideology that has metastasized into a malignant cancer after building a reputation as a respected military officer he was fired by president obama after two years as the chief of the defense intelligence agency general flynn has since been a vociferous critic of a washington elite he contends has refused to name radical islam as the enemy and is therefore doomed to fall short in defeating it his statements about muslims are profoundly un american as well as damaging to the
for a brief moment after a white supremacist carried out a massacre of black churchgoers in charleston s c it seemed as though the confederate battle flag that most divisive of symbols might soon be on its way out of the american political arena but now that explosive and complicated vestige of the old south is back in a new and to some americans newly disturbing context during president elect donald j trumps campaign followers drawn to his rallies occasionally displayed the flag and other confederate iconography since the election his supporters and others have displayed the flag as a kind of rejoinder to anti trump protesters in places such as durango colo st petersburg fla hampton va fort worth and traverse city mich on election day in silverton ore the flag appeared at a high school trump rally where students reportedly told hispanic classmates pack your bags youre leaving tomorrow the day after at kenyon college in ohio the colleges president sean m decatur spoke to a worried campus describing his discomfort at seeing confederate flags on display in the nearby city of mount vernon dorothy robinson said that seeing the battle flag flying at a traditional postelection unity parade in her hometown georgetown del felt like someone had punched me in the gut those who have publicly embraced the flag are a small minority of the more than million americans who voted for mr trump in the nov election but these incidents and hundreds of reports of insults and threats directed at minorities and others are forcing americans to confront vexing questions about the future of race relations under mr trump and the extent to which his campaign has animated white resentment and even a budding white nationalism the emergence of the flag in a postelection context also comes as liberals and others have harshly criticized mr trump for appointing as his chief white house strategist stephen k bannon the former head of breitbart news a website they accuse of trafficking in anti semitic misogynist and anti muslim ideas shortly after the june charleston massacre an article posted on breitbart argued that the confederacy was a patriotic and idealistic cause and that its flag proclaims a glorious heritage every tree every rooftop every picket fence every telegraph pole in the south should be festooned with the confederate battle flag the author gerald warner wrote hoist it high and fly it with pride how much the flags resurgence reflects anything more than the sentiments of those who fly it remains unclear mr trump a native new yorker declared shortly after announcing his candidacy that he supported a call by gov nikki r haley of south carolina to remove the flag from the grounds of the statehouse there after the mass shooting in charleston the state legislature after passionate debate eventually agreed to remove the flag i think they should put it in the museum let it go respect whatever it is that you have to respect because it was a point in time and put it in a museum mr trump told reporters at the time historians say the battle flag has had shifting meanings over time a symbol of white resistance to integration during the civil rights era a more complicated but still racially charged symbol now grace elizabeth hale a professor of american studies and history at the university of virginia who has written extensively about the south segregation and white americans said the flag had long been a symbol for outsiders and a rebuke to the forces of decorum and political correctness she said its use now both in the south and outside it could be seen as an expression of concern that white culture has been displaced as the norm maybe for the first time ever definitely in my lifetime people outside the south are in a very public way claiming a white racial identity she said stephen moss a republican state representative from the small town of blacksburg s c was one of a number of lawmakers who voted against removing the flag from the statehouse grounds in july to mr moss a supporter of mr trump the flag represents the heritage of those who fought for the confederacy but he acknowledged that the flag had also been hijacked by hate groups asked why the flag was turning up in the hands of trump supporters he said he thought that it might be part of a backlash of working white voters who suspect that people in their minds often minorities are taking advantage of the federal welfare system a lot of these people who go to work every day are in the line at the grocery store and over half the people are bringing out these cards to pay for the groceries he said two days after the presidential race concluded ms robinson a writer and editor who lives in maplewood n j was back in her hometown to watch the return day parade a long running tradition in which winners and losers of local elections ride through town together in a show of unity and party leaders come together to bury an actual hatchet there were marching bands and smiling faces and ms robinson felt that perhaps the country was on its way to healing after a particularly ugly election then a white chevrolet pickup rolled by flying an american flag a trump flag and the battle flag ms robinson a white hillary clinton supporter was standing next to a black friend at the time i wasnt shocked i was horrified ms robinson said she suspects that some white trump supporters are indulging in new freedom to be politically incorrect now that the nations first african american president is on the way out mr trump declared his candidacy on june the day before the charleston massacre he would go on to see his political stock rise at the same time as pro flag backlash was emerging particularly among people who felt their heritage

two different sides of the wall craigs father says this gay lifestyle and everything i didnt grow up with it he describes once when he was younger being followed by a man who was trying to pick him up i just wanted to beat the hell out of him he tells craig and then he and his friends caught the guy to do just that ive come a long way as far as acceptance and tolerance he says reflecting on that past i get that you have acceptance and tolerance craig responds you accept me as your gay son but to me thats you being a good parent and what i need and what ive told you is i need you to be more

with it i feel like im trying who they are amy dawn both live in green river wyo their relationship co workers and neighbors the women and their families have grown extremely close why it feels personal as the mother of a child with a disability amy was deeply offended by how mr trump mocked a disabled reporter during the campaign dawn has her own personal stake in the election her husband works in the mining industry a job she worried was threatened by mrs clintons policies this election was different for me amy tells dawn if say john kasich won i would be like well you win some you lose some i would not have been as upset as i have been primarily because of some of the behavior that president elect trump has exhibited throughout the campaign she continues trump was not my first choice for the candidacy for the presidency dawn says though she is a republican and votes republican she says she was disturbed by the way he acts and the way he thinks he can do and say these things and can get away with it and its okay but ultimately she tells amy i had to refocus and reprioritize the reasons i wanted to vote for him not that i condone his behaviors but the other issues were huge for me she explains who they are aaron lee ponce landaverde is kyle hill is both live in peoria ill their relationship attended high school together and were teammates on the wrestling and football teams why it feels personal as an african american who supported mrs clinton mr hill took offense at what mr ponce landaverde a trump supporter posted on facebook during the election ive heard race more than anything throughout this whole election throughout this whole year mr ponce landaverde says this whole year is just race i feel like there needs to be more unity in this country he continues mr hill explained to his friend why to him race was a crucial factor in this election and is a big part of why he is struggling to understand friends who voted for mr trump a lot of what he has said its disparaging for marginalized people in this country african americans latinos gay people women its disparaging mr hill says to a certain extent voting for donald trump after all he

a movement is growing to bring together women across race creed and political beliefs by luring them off social media and arranging for them to meet in person its a nice idea but theres one catch the womens march on washington is being organized on facebook the nations preferred platform to battle over race gender politics and just about everything else the timing of the event which organizers began planning the morning after the election but are careful not to call a protest is aimed at the coming administration of president elect donald j trump more than people have said on facebook that they will travel to the capital to participate the plan is to walk from the lincoln memorial to the white house on jan the morning after mr trumps inauguration were doing it his very first day in office because we are making a statement one organizer breanne butler said the marginalized groups you attacked during your campaign we are here and we are watching and like welcome to the white house since election day there has been momentum around supporting groups that are opposed to mr trumps espoused views on women and minority groups nonprofit organizations including the planned parenthood federation of america and the american civil liberties union have reported a surge in donations after the election but the election taught americans that women are deeply divided along party lines education level and race percent of white women voted for mr trump according to exit poll data on the march groups facebook page it is easy to see how complicated the idea of the womens vote an already mythological concept has become and how difficult it might be for organizers to fulfill their aim of gathering women who remain fiercely divided on reproductive rights gun control same sex marriage and immigration among other issues not everyone on the page believes for instance that hillary clinton would have made a good president or that stephen k bannon a chief strategist under mr trump holds divisive views about minorities debates over both have sprung up in recent days bob bland one of the march organizers said in an email that organizers in maryland had to change a facebook page from public to private to protect the safety of women who want to attend evvie harmon a yoga teacher from greenville s c who is helping state based efforts to organize for the march said the group had nixed a possible idea for a slogan human rights are womens rights and womens rights are human rights because it was something that mrs clinton once said this is not an anti trump protest ms harmon said this is the reaction of women and minorities across the world who are very disturbed by the rhetoric that was said over the last year and a half aside from dueling political views organizers are trying to take feedback from a cacophony of voices in real time as they try to assemble a network of state volunteers plan programming and arrange transportation and lodging for the event ms butler a chef who is organizing the event in her spare time said the march had no official means of funding yet there are women on the page who have said that the march is not inclusive enough and that they dont want an event organized by white women ms butler acknowledged the criticism but stressed that the women who are organizing are from different racial and religious backgrounds ms butler said the greater concern would be helping local groups raise money to help women who cant afford to travel to washington the reality is that its incredibly expensive to fly to d c on inauguration weekend ms butler said we dont want only an upper middle class of people at this march because no one else can afford to go tabitha st bernard jacobs who plans to help sign up attendees by visiting churches synagogues and community centers in new york city said she had been working to include all types of people including those who have not been on facebook lately i am a woman of color and i am an immigrant said ms st bernard jacobs who lives in brooklyn she said of the march for me it has been completely inclusive this is all plenty of pressure for a days old grass roots movement without a concrete path to funding itself but organizers are optimistic as they look ahead to january according to ms butler the groups request for a permit to march is still pending on friday michael litterst a spokesman for the national park service said in an email that the groups request to march is one of at least requests currently under review for areas the agency administers in the nations capital those also include rallies and demonstrations mr litterst said the park service was also reviewing five requests for official inauguration events
the early stock market reaction to donald j trumps election victory was overwhelmingly positive but that doesnt mean a trump presidency will be good for the economy stock markets often serve as an economic scoreboard increasing stock prices are equated with economic victory but these inferences are too facile because some increases connote good news while others do not reading market movements such as the steep rise in stock prices in the early postelection days as well as the subsequent ups and downs requires a rosetta stone constructing one takes an understanding of what drives stock prices and how that relates to the overall health of the economy buying stock in a company entitles the owner to a percentage of present and future profits the share price should be equivalent to a prediction of what these future profits will be thats the theory anyway and stock markets when they work excel because these stocks are traded assets and all traders can contribute to the markets overall prediction if traders feel stock prices are low relative to future profits they will bid up prices if they feel prices are high they will sell and drive down prices in this way the final price represents a collective prediction by the entire market an increase in stock prices therefore signals an expected increase in future profits the movement in stock prices has a direct effect shareholders are immediately wealthier anyone holding a retirement portfolio knows the all too familiar feeling of reading stock price movements through the narrow lens of how well you can retire this does not benefit all people in the economy some shares are held by citizens of other countries and the shares held in this country are not equitably held but at the least a surge in stock prices equals more wealth for the citizenry but rising stock prices can spell good news for other reasons even many of those who do not own stocks can expect a brighter future this is because when companies prosper consumers frequently also do well this notion can be somewhat counterintuitive after all we often reflexively assume that when businesses make more money they do so at our expense that is by overcharging us in a well functioning market though the interests of companies and consumers are aligned businesses profit when customers enthusiastically buy their products higher profits mean happier customers the economy as a whole is doing well by way of example suppose apple unveils a new iphone that buoys its stock price traders are bullish about the iphones robust sales they are focused on the fact that these sales add to apples coffers but each sale assuming consumers are choosing wisely is also presumably producing joy for consumers this example also makes clear when the stock market can be a poor scoreboard for the economy sometimes companies can profit without improving consumers lives or possibly even by worsening them for example part of the stock surge after the election most likely occurred because of a widely held belief that a trump administration would slash regulations that may be good for some companies bottom lines but is that good for everyone else it depends do those regulations hinder only products that were profitable and good for consumers or do they also hinder products that are bad for consumers take the case of wells fargo which was recently found to have created millions of accounts in customers names without their knowledge these accounts were profitable for wells fargo but surely not good for consumers the extent of this behavior was uncovered because of the work of a regulatory watchdog the consumer financial protection bureau mr trumps election increases the possibility that the bureau will be shut down or that its powers will be curtailed but if this prospect raises the value of bank stocks because it makes it more likely that behavior like wells fargos can flourish thats hardly cause for celebration and its not good news for the economy in short whether a rise in stock prices is good or bad for nonshareholders depends on whether the increase in profits arises because companies are serving consumers or because they are profiting at consumers expense there is a final factor to consider the capacity of traders to make predictions about future profits is limited in michael rashes then a doctoral student in economics at harvard and now a principal at bracebridge capital noticed something funny about stock prices on oct worldcom made a bid for mci communications shares listed under the symbol mci went up that day in itself that wasnt surprising good news raises prices the problem as mr rashes noted was that the ticker symbol mci belonged to massmutual corporate investors this fund had nothing to do with mci communications which traded under the ticker symbol mcic his paper was published in the journal of finance in under the title massively confused investors making conspicuously ignorant choices this was not a freak event traders are highly fallible on oct for example after twitter announced its initial public offering the stock price of the boston based consumer electronics chain tweeter which had filed for bankruptcy in rose to cents a share from the previous days close of less than cent trading was eventually halted a large body of research now emphasizes a basic fact despite the rise of computers and artificial intelligence markets are at their root made up of human traders yes the crowd is often smarter than the individual but smarter does not mean perfect many of the biases of individual traders become broader market biases in fact some new biases are introduced when traders feed off one another and compound their mistakes on election night the votes at the ballot box mattered in the financial markets another kind of vote counting took place just as the presidential election tells us only who voters believe is good for the country the market can tell us only what traders believe is
berlin president obama and several european leaders unanimously agreed on friday to keep sanctions in place against russia for its intervention in ukraine amid concern that president elect donald j trump would soften the united states stance against moscow the show of solidarity came as american allies and ukrainians themselves have been unsettled by uncertainty regarding what kind of foreign policy mr trump will pursue with surging populist movements straining alliances and mr trumps election upending the political calculations of many countries ukraine may be among the most vulnerable to the shifting political winds fighting in ukraine has continued since moscow stealthily fomented an uprising among ethnic russians in eastern ukraine with the help of undercover russian forces and then annexed crimea in march as a candidate and as president elect mr trump has frequently expressed admiration for president vladimir v putin of russia and a former trump campaign manager paul manafort previously worked for a former ukrainian president viktor f yanukovych who is now exiled in russia meeting in berlin mr obama and the european leaders agreed that the sanctions should stay until moscow upheld its pledge for a cease fire and to withdraw heavy weapons from front lines in eastern ukraine according to the white house those in attendance on friday included the german chancellor angela merkel and the french president franois hollande as well as the prime ministers of britain italy and spain the agreement on ukraine followed remarks by mr obama on thursday warning mr trump to stand up to moscow when it violated international agreements ms merkel also reminded russia that peace in europe had been possible over the past several years only because all nations respected the boundaries drawn after world war ii fridays meeting concluded a weeklong visit to european allies by mr obama whose terms ends in january but what was supposed to be a valedictory lap turned into an exercise in calming anxieties about the future of trans atlantic relations spurred by the victory of mr trump who repeatedly called the nato alliance into question during his election campaign the group also discussed tensions in the middle east including the situation in syria the white house said the leaders agreed that attacks on the city of aleppo should be halted immediately and they called on russia and iran to end their support for the government of president bashar al assad on syria of course looking at aleppo we were united in our condemnation of the atrocities that are taking place there mrs may told reporters standing alongside ms merkel after mr obama had departed we agreed the need to keep up pressure on russia including the possibility of sanctions on those who breach international humanitarian law that consensus too was another potential point of departure from the incoming mr trump who has signaled that he may side with russia in backing the assad government against the opponents trying to unseat it including the islamic state after the meeting in berlin mr obama left germany for latin america
washington representative mike pompeo was once pointedly asked why his committees inquiry into the attacks on the american diplomatic compound in benghazi libya had dragged on longer than the watergate investigation he did not flinch this is worse in some ways he said during an appearance on meet the press in late a sharp pugnacious kansas congressman and former army tank officer with degrees from west point and harvard mr pompeo was often an unyielding critic of former secretary of state hillary clinton accusing her of orchestrating a wide ranging cover up of the benghazi attacks on friday president elect donald j trump who defeated mrs clinton after a bitter campaign selected mr pompeo to run the central intelligence agency if confirmed by the senate mr pompeo would become one of the most overtly partisan figures to take over the c i a a spy agency that at least publicly is supposed to operate above politics and avoid a direct role in policy making at the same time the c i a has been central to americas secret wars waged in the years since the sept attacks giving the agency a shadow role in the counterterrorism policy of the past two presidents as a member of the house intelligence committee mr pompeo has used his platform to denounce efforts in recent years to rein in some of the most polarizing counterterrorism programs of the post sept era he has advocated a return to the bulk collection of americans domestic calling records which congress restricted though legislation last year and he has denounced president obamas decision in to close c i a black site prisons and also to require government interrogators to strictly adhere to the rules of the army field manual after a visit to the military prison at guantnamo bay cuba in he told a congressional committee that a hunger strike by detainees was a political stunt on friday some lawmakers even democrats complimented mr pompeos work ethic and grasp of policy details representative adam b schiff of california the top democrat on the house intelligence committee praised mr pompeo as bright and hard working while we have had our share of strong differences principally on the politicization of the tragedy in benghazi i know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage both key qualities in a c i a director mr schiff said it appears that mr pompeos role in the benghazi inquiry was a significant factor in mr trumps decision to select him to lead the c i a some members of the president elects transition team viewed a competing candidate for the position former representative mike rogers of michigan as soft on benghazi because mr rogers as chairman of the house intelligence committee oversaw a report that they believed was not tough enough on mrs clinton by contrast mr pompeos relentless questioning of mrs clinton during her october appearance before the house select committee on benghazi raised his profile in republican circles when the committee concluded its work this year mr pompeos position on mrs clintons role was an outlier even from most of his republican colleagues the select committee found no new evidence of wrongdoing by the obama administration or mrs clinton but mr pompeo and another republican member of the committee representative jim jordan of ohio said they were convinced that there had been a cover up when the committee released its findings in june mr pompeo and mr jordan filed a page addendum that said the attacks showed the state department was seemingly more concerned with politics and secretary clintons legacy than with protecting its people in benghazi the chairman of the select committee representative trey gowdy republican of south carolina did not put his name on the addendum after graduating first in his class at west point mr pompeo served as an armored cavalry officer and was deployed in germany during the final years of the cold war after leaving the army he attended harvard law school and was an editor of the harvard law review he arrived in congress in after a sometimes bitter campaign against raj goyle a democratic state representative during the campaign one of mr pompeos aides promoted an article on twitter that referred to mr goyle an indian american as a turban topper in an interview friday mr goyle said that mr pompeo personally apologized to him for the incident but that the campaign staff member was never fired as we are entering an era where relations with muslim and minority communities in america are extremely sensitive his record and his approach should be scrutinized during the confirmation hearing mr goyle said mr pompeo has close ties to charles g and david h koch the billionaire conservatives who are among the most significant activists in financing republican candidates nationwide their company koch industries and its employees have contributed to mr pompeo since he has common cause with many senior republican lawmakers on a range of issues including a distaste for the agreement the united states and five world powers struck with iran in to significantly limit tehrans nuclear ability for more than a decade in return for lifting international oil and financial sanctions in an op ed this summer on the fox news website mr pompeo wrote that the united states should walk away from this deal indeed some members of the transition team pushed for mr pompeo because they believe that picking an incumbent lawmaker would help foster better relations between congress and the intelligence agencies representative devin nunes republican of california and now the chairman of the house intelligence committee said in a statement friday that mr pompeo will undoubtedly develop a close working relationship with congress in his new post but some senate democrats indicated that mr pompeo could face a difficult confirmation hearing citing some of his past comments particularly his praise for the c i a s former detention and interrogation program that program was ineffective it was
washington jefferson beauregard sessions iii as the courtly senator from alabama used to be known was a stalwart justice department prosecutor for almost years a job he called the adventure of a lifetime today mr sessions has a growing list of gripes about how the obama administration has run his old department from its breathtaking stance on immigration to its shameful refusal to defend a federal ban on gay marriage im not happy about whats happened to my department of justice mr sessions said last year jabbing his reading glasses in the air at the senate confirmation hearing for attorney general loretta e lynch after nearly a quarter century away mr sessions now known simply as jeff is poised to return to the department to clean house as president elect donald j trumps nominee for attorney general with a mandate to carry out the law and order agenda mr trump promised on the campaign trail if he is confirmed mr sessions who is considered one of the most conservative members of the senate will most likely push for wholesale changes and hard line stances on immigration terrorism crime drugs and guns democrats fear he could wipe away progress in civil rights changes in sentencing and police accountability the justice department is likely to be one of the most transformed departments in the cabinet in a trump administration and with an attorney general sessions youd obviously see a very strong law and order figure at the top said jonathan turley a george washington university law professor much of his self identity is as a prosecutor a real in the trenches prosecutor said mr turley who testified before mr sessions at a senate hearing last year about the obama administrations use of executive authority mr sessions was the first senator to endorse mr trump in february when many republicans were still shunning the businessman he has since become a close adviser the senate judiciary committee where mr sessions has served for years and sometimes clashed with fellow members will consider his nomination democrats are eager to interrogate him on the rockier patches of his long career particularly the accusations of racially charged comments in the that derailed his nomination as a federal judge critics charge that the controversy was a harbinger of hostility toward minorities that has continued in his two decades as a senator hes one of the most strident anti immigrant anti muslim anti l g b t voices in the senate said marge baker executive vice president of people for the american way a liberal civil rights group in washington mr sessions like mr trump has made tougher immigration policies a central priority he has said president obamas justice department flouted the will of congress by failing to deport millions of undocumented immigrants when many republicans distanced themselves from mr trumps startling campaign proposal to ban muslim immigration mr sessions said he was open to considering it in a breitbart interview last december with stephen k bannon who was chosen by mr trump this week as a top white house adviser mr sessions acknowledged in the interview that the proposal was treading on dangerous ground because of the countrys long history of religious freedom at the same time were in an age thats very dangerous and were seeing more and more persons enter and a lot of them have done terrorist acts and a lot of them believe its commanded by their religion he said so i think its appropriate to begin to discuss this as the nations top law enforcement officer mr sessions and the political appointees under him would hold wide discretion in shaping policies across the federal government and in overseeing the enforcement of federal laws at the f b i and other agencies within the justice department his department would also play an important role in advising the white house on supreme court nominees and working to get them confirmed in the senate mr sessions an avid student of constitutional history has called justice antonin scalia who died in february a model hailing him for an unwavering commitment to the rule of law rather than judicial activism mr sessions was born in selma ala the son of a country store owner the diminutive mr sessions was an eagle scout known as buddy as a child his parents he said instilled in him the values of honesty hard work belief in god and parental respect with a law degree from the university of alabama mr sessions worked as a private attorney and as an assistant federal prosecutor before president ronald reagan tapped him in as the united states attorney for the southern district of alabama he held that post for years accusations of inappropriate racial remarks one black prosecutor said mr sessions called him boy and another prosecutor said he referred to groups like the n a a c p and the american civil liberties union as un american doomed his nomination for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench in but mr sessions took satisfaction not only in winning election to the senate a decade later but also in earning a seat on the powerful judiciary committee the same panel that had rejected his nomination as a judge
denver uranium mines around the grand canyon oil drilling rigs studding the arctic national wildlife refuge new coal and timber leases in the national forests states divvying up millions of acres of federal land to dispose of as they wish to environmental groups it would be a nightmare to miners loggers ranchers and conservative politicians in resource dependent areas it would be about time either way donald j trumps election presages huge potential change on americas million acres of federal public lands from the deep seas east of maine to the volcanic coasts of hawaii into a new world said bruce babbitt who ran the interior department under president bill clinton in western states where about half of all land is controlled by federal agencies mr trumps supporters hope the pendulum swings back from what they say are overbearing obama administration regulations that put sage grouse and owls ahead of economic growth environmental groups are urging president obama to push through last minute preservation projects such as naming a new national monument in the bears ears area of southern utah and they are already preparing for battles over mr trumps campaign promise to unleash coal oil and gas production much of it on public land but the unknowns and political variables are huge too mr trump himself while promising to push resource extraction has also at times spoken about preserving public lands for future generations history also suggests that changing lands policy is not so easy president george w bush a republican tried to change direction with new agency rules only to be blocked by federal appeals court decisions automation in the timber industry means that even an expanded license to cut trees in the national forests might not restore old mill towns to their blue collar glory and the cost of managing federal lands especially in fighting wildfires billion last year a record total matched by the most acres burned in at least years continues to soar threatening communities even as many of them look for new direction from the white house in how those lands are managed we have a huge and growing inventory of timber in the forests and theyre going to decompose or burn and nobody has addressed that said robert h nelson a professor in the school of public policy at the university of maryland and a former economic analyst for the interior department theres bipartisan consensus that the federal lands system is dysfunctional he said but the hopes and the fears about how that system might now change are boundless my big hope is that people would be able to go back to work in san juan county and these rural areas said phil lyman a county commissioner in southern utah where antigovernment feelings run as deep as the slot canyons you just feel like everything has been stifled with regulations at the western watersheds project a conservation group focusing on the rocky mountain region legal teams are on deck and ready to fight back were getting ready for an onslaught of anti environmental policy and were arming up to litigate said erik molvar the groups executive director the trump administration is going to find it very difficult to take away all of the federal laws which have been adopted over the past years in the decades long struggle for control of americas public lands the obama years were a flush time for conservation groups the administration imposed moratoriums on uranium drilling near the grand canyon and blocked new coal leases public lands were also adapted for new uses on mr obamas watch notably a wave of national monuments based around cultural or historical significance and a big expansion of solar energy on federal lands in nevada conservatives who loathed those regulations or new uses are now hoping mr trump shifts the balance decisively in their favor republicans in congress have proposed bills weakening federal laws that protect wilderness water quality endangered species or that allow presidents to unilaterally name new national monuments some conservatives hope mr trump will support their efforts to hand federal land over to states which could sell it off or speed up drilling approvals to see where change may come the quickest look to the edges of glacier national park in montana at a quilt of rocky peaks and wetlands held sacred by the blackfeet tribe in march the obama administration capped a three decade fight over oil and gas drilling in the area called the badger two medicine by canceling a louisiana energy companys lease on acres the company solenex sued a lawyer for the company william perry pendley of the mountain states legal foundation said the incoming trump administration could simply decide that canceling the lease had been wrong all it would take he said is for the justice department to enter the case and say weve re evaluated we will lift the suspension and well permit the drilling to go forward this week the interior department announced that a separate energy company with oil and gas leases on acres in the same area had voluntarily canceled them blackfeet tribal leaders called it a victory for cooperation among industry conservation activists and the government proponents of two major oil pipeline projects are also optimistic mr trump has said he would move quickly to approve the keystone xl pipeline which mr obama blocked the chief executive of the texas company building the dakota access pipeline near the standing rock sioux reservation in north dakota said he believed that now delayed project would sail through under mr trump to see where things get more tangled head into the damp woods of the cascade range in central oregon and the olympic peninsula of washington state where a long economic decline began in the late as international trade shifted timber markets to places like canada and automated mills eliminated tens of thousands of jobs those computer run mills are not going away even if more logs start arriving we really dont

re states of confusion thank you jim yardley you beat me to the punch having left the united states in to live in spain for a year which turned into i returned in and have daily made a mental list of the changes during that quarter century yardley eloquently speaks to many of these and i would add a few more some trivial but still noteworthy the rampant advance of capitalism ranging from the commercialization of halloween to the corporate naming of our sports stadiums and other public buildings feminism and civil rights becoming dirty words the rebirth of exclusiveness and elitism like the greek system and brand only consumerism and wearing ones religion like a lapel pin i could go on i left when george h w bush was elected and came back because barack obama had passed health care reform maybe it was too soon speaking as an american expat this piece certainly resonated with me the palpable anxiety the extreme wealthy class the police state militarism at every turn the partisan acrimony etc all seem to be intensifying since when i left with my family when we return from visiting i usually feel exhausted from the stress of my vacation however while this is all often true its also true that the states can also be a wonderful place to live and travel these places you covered are all exceptional cases the u s mexico border detroit baton rouge san francisco and even the evangelical zeal of kansas are not the best examples of average america i spent three of the past four years in mongolia in both rural and urban environments reading the news from home obsessively in a much shorter period of time than yardley has spent i too felt like a stranger i am back in the u s a now and i am very much trying to hang on to my view of the u s as a foreigner someone who has not gradually adapted to the boiling water of american citizenship situated between russia and china mongolia depends on the u s for its commitment to democracy and stability and especially to its resolve to enforce these principles with its allies in asia what mongolians saw in july before i left was the continued ineffectiveness of american democracy to fix the problem of mass shootings by americans with guns that are or seem to be sanctioned by our government those who make the assault weapons support the representatives that make them legal even with mongolias ineffective government this would be an easy problem to fix then comes the news that the police are shooting anyone with a nervous twitch especially if they have a skin color that might have a grudge against their races treatment by the police yardley has only scratched the surface the entire world is waiting for us to get our act together re clinton trump maureen dowds article inspired a thought that it wouldnt be surprising if this past election contest was nothing more than the result of a friendly bet not unlike the one by the two duke brothers in the movie trading places instead of a pygmalion like endeavor to nurture a street hustler into becoming a successful commodities broker it was for running for president with the goal of destroying the republican party the percent have more in common with each other than with the rest of the country many politicians have more in common with each other than with the people they sometimes try or sometimes purport to serve no surprises in this article and yes its as if were in that greek myth in this election choosing between two flawed options that do have at least one thing in common wealth and power what i get out of this is that politics is not for those with a weak stomach or an inclination to be kind perhaps the same applies for new york city the ability to manipulate people money and crowds is not an uplifting way to spend a day much less a life the piece is hugely informative but the story within is less a sensational plot than a sad expos on bad characters americans need to move away from entertainment as a way of life because if we dont this is who our leaders will be
despite overwhelming scientific evidence that the worlds climate is changing the president elect of the united states donald j trump has long been on the side of the deniers in he posted on twitter a couple of messages that asserted that climate change was a hoax that china had devised to secure an unfair trade advantage presumably because the obama administration was seeking to curb coal consumption in the united states the concept of global warming was created by and for the chinese in order to make u s manufacturing non competitive mr trump wrote that message has been reshared more than times and liked nearly times on wednesday a deputy foreign minister of china liu zhenmin told reporters at a climate conference in marrakesh morocco that starting from the the administrations of mr trumps republican predecessors presidents ronald reagan and george bush supported climate change negotiations under a united nations panel that was apparently an important moment in chinas realization of the onset of climate change mr liu said that president xi jinping brought up the issue in his call with mr trump on monday saying that china would continue its struggle to curb climate change whatever the circumstances according to bloomberg news chinas lecturing the united states on the need to fight climate change is a reversal from the usual roles and a sign that with the united states governed by mr trump china may have to take the leadership position in the global campaign under president obama the united states government persuaded china to announce important pledges in the fight against climate change in mr xi stood next to mr obama in beijing and said that china would ensure that its greenhouse gas emissions peaked by and that percent of its energy would come from non fossil fuel sources by that year mr obama pledged to greatly reduce coal use by diplomats and climate negotiators have been meeting in marrakesh this week to discuss steps needed to carry out the paris climate agreement which was negotiated last year and which china and the united states signed this year there has been much anxiety over whether mr trump might try to withdraw the united states from the pact after he takes office but the agreement now has enough countries as signatories to make it legally binding and mr trump may have a hard time extricating the united states from the deal in addition other countries have said they intend to go ahead with the plan on their own it is a new world order erik solheim the executive director of the united nations environment program said in marrakesh leadership on climate change policy has now gone to the developing countries china among them however having the united states on board would be hugely helpful in trying to meet the ambitious goal of keeping the future increase in global temperatures below degrees fahrenheit the united states is the second leading emitter of greenhouse gases after china researchers say greenhouse gas emissions have leveled off for at least three years now mostly because of a drop in coal consumption in china a major reason is the slowing chinese economy but it is still unclear whether chinas emissions have hit a peak well before the deadline china is already grappling with the direct consequences of climate change like melting glaciers in western mountain ranges and expanding deserts
washington president elect donald j trump claimed credit on thursday night for persuading ford to keep an automaking plant in kentucky rather than moving it to mexico the only wrinkle ford was not actually planning to move the plant mr trump wrote on twitter shortly after p m that fords chairman william clay ford jr had just told him that ford will be keeping the lincoln plant in kentucky no mexico minutes later mr trump wrote in a second post i worked hard with bill ford to keep the lincoln plant in kentucky i owed it to the great state of kentucky for their confidence in me mr trump won percent of the states popular vote in the presidential election during the campaign he repeatedly criticized ford for moving production to mexico and he threatened to impose a percent tariff on vehicles made there ford makes the lincoln mkc a sport utility vehicle at a factory in louisville last week ford said it planned to move production of the vehicle elsewhere on thursday night after mr trumps twitter messages the company said that mexico had been the intended destination and that it would now keep mkc production in kentucky but ford had not planned to close the louisville factory instead it had planned to expand production of another vehicle made in louisville the ford escape and the change had not been expected to result in any job losses whatever happens in louisville it will not lose employment jimmy settles a union official told the detroit free press they cannot make enough escapes now thanks to mr trump the plant will make fewer escapes and more mkcs we are encouraged that president elect trump and the new congress will pursue policies that will improve u s competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the united states ford said in a statement

washington president elect donald j trump has offered the post of national security adviser to lt gen michael t flynn potentially putting a retired intelligence officer who believes islamist militancy poses an existential threat in one of the most powerful roles in shaping military and foreign policy according to a top official on mr trumps transition team general flynn a registered democrat was mr trumps main national security adviser during his campaign if he accepts mr trumps offer as expected he will be a critical gatekeeper for a president with little experience in military or foreign policy issues mr trump and general flynn both see themselves as brash outsiders who hustled their way to the big time they both post on twitter often about their own successes and they have both at times crossed the line into outright islamophobia they also both exhibit a loose relationship with facts general flynn for instance has said that shariah or islamic law is spreading in the united states his dubious assertions are so common that when he ran the defense intelligence agency subordinates came up with a name for the phenomenon they called them flynn facts as an adviser general flynn has already proved to be a powerful influence on mr trump convincing the president elect that the united states is in a world war with islamist militants and must work with any willing allies in the fight including president vladimir v putin of russia during the transition general flynn has been present when mr trump has received his daily intelligence briefing as national security adviser he would have the last word on how the president should respond to crises such as a showdown with china over the south china sea or an international health crisis like the ebola epidemic but like mr trump he would enter the white house with significant baggage the flynn intel group a consulting firm he founded after he was fired by president obama as head of the defense intelligence agency has hazy business ties to middle eastern countries and has appeared to lobby for the turkish government general flynn also took a paid speaking engagement last year with russia today a television network funded by the kremlin and attended the networks lavish anniversary party in moscow where he sat at mr putins elbow those potential conflicts of interest had led mr trumps transition team to worry that general flynn might have difficulty winning confirmation for any post that unlike the national security adviser role requires congressional approval such as director of the c i a but for mr trump he has one overriding virtue he was an early and ardent supporter in a campaign during which most of the washington national security establishment openly called mr trump unfit to lead general flynn did not respond to repeated interview requests yet in numerous speeches and interviews before the election and in a book published in august he laid out a view of the world that sees the united states as facing a singular overarching threat that can be described in only one way radical islamic terrorism all else is secondary for general flynn and any other description of the threat is the worst kind of political correctness he said in an interview three weeks before the election islamist militancy poses an existential threat on a global scale and the muslim faith itself is the source of the problem he said describing it as a political ideology not a religion he has even at times gone so far as to call it a political ideology that has metastasized into a malignant cancer for general flynn the election of mr trump represents an astounding career turnaround once counted among the most respected military officers of his generation general flynn was fired after serving only two years as chief of the defense intelligence agency he then re emerged as a vociferous critic of a washington elite that he contended could not even properly identify the real enemy radical islam that is never mind figure out how to defeat it in mr trump general flynn found someone who was more than willing to listen he readily signed on to the campaign and quickly emerged as the angry voice of the national security establishment leading chants of lock her up against hillary clinton at rallies and the republican convention and now after months of the two men talking to each other it can be hard to tell where mr trumps views end and general flynns begin they both believe that the united states needs to start working with mr putin to defeat islamist militants and stop worrying about his suppression of critics at home his attempt to dismember ukraine or the russian militarys indiscriminate bombing of syrian cities the same goes for president abdel fattah el sisi of egypt who took power in a coup and who was the first world leader to speak with mr trump after the election mr trump looks at people and leaders of countries and says can i work with this guy do we have a common threat that we can focus on mr flynn said in the interview before the election he knows that when it comes to russia or any other country the common enemy that we all have is radical islam general flynn and mr trump also agree that the united states needs to sharply curtail immigration from predominantly muslim countries and possibly even force american muslims to register with the government the similarities run beyond political views like the boy from queens who made it in manhattan general flynn came into the military without a west point pedigree he graduated from the armys reserve officer training program at the university of rhode island and earned a reputation as outspoken and unconventional as he climbed the ranks to the top of military intelligence yet general flynn still nurses the grudge of an outsider believing he never quite got the respect he deserves for example he
in the days since an election that will substantially reduce the likelihood of your going to midtown more than three times over the next four years the pervasive mood in new york has been grief stricken and despairing the city has emerged perhaps unpredictably as the nations capital of discontentment the frontier of enmity to the potential hardships and catastrophes donald j trumps impending presidency might produce in manhattan hillary clinton defeated mr trump nearly nine to one thousands feel distraught many have marched or plan to march many more are searching for something constructive to do and weighing the value of symbolic gestures some mothers in brooklyn said they were thinking about a transcontinental hand holding palms clutched from cobble hill to santa monica but actions like these are as likely to invite accusations of liberal cluelessness as they are to change minds about the deportation of undocumented immigrants this past week lena dunham posted a video of a call she made to the house speaker paul d ryan on instagram relaying her concern over the appointment of the former breitbart news head stephen k bannon as a chief strategist in the trump administration just days earlier the actress who had campaigned around the country for mrs clinton a democrat wrote a blog post expressing her dismay over the fact that so many white women had voted for the republican candidate describing them with no apparent fear of invoking a tone of alienating condescension as unable to look past their own violent privilege and inoculated with hate for themselves in the age of instagram activism it is not necessarily a simple thing to tell the earnest do gooder from the self promoter particularly when history has just made it clear that social media celebrity is the path to world domination within the professional political class mayor bill de blasio and gov andrew m cuomo both democrats now seem to be elevating their longstanding rivalry to one for the role of progressive opponent in chief in the days immediately following the election the mayor tweeted and emailed and tried to comfort on wednesday mr de blasio met with the president elect at trump tower and then held a news conference in which he proceeded to recount the concerns he had raised about a rolling back of wall street regulations tax cuts for the wealthy rising fears among immigrants the prospect of increased conflict between the police and the people they serve without divulging anything of mr trumps responses a spate of television appearances followed as well as the announcement of a speech planned for next week at cooper union asked about the potential effects of mr trumps high security presence on fifth avenue near major businesses like gucci and tiffany mr de blasio offered that those stores werent his central concerns in life as if the tax and tourist revenue they generated for the city were dismissible in the face of the good sound bite he could produce by deriding luxury brands later in the day the mayor sent out a twitter storm repeating everything he had already said then using his re election campaign letterhead he sent out an email asking new yorkers to share their thoughts and feelings with him about the coming four years of a trump administration as though the answers werent obvious the day after the election governor cuomo called into a program on to say that he had had a good conversation with president elect trump and that his service in the white house could be a bonus for new york certainly two boys from queens could find a way to bridge some differences particularly when so many actual bridges in new york required federal money for repairs a few days later with perhaps a more accurate sense of the way voters in new york were processing the election the governor initiated a statewide emergency call in system to handle reports of bias crime following mr trumps victory he took to his facebook page to declare that there is no place for racism there is no place for hate and to remind everyone that he had been behind new yorks an hour minimum wage effort it is hard to imagine the outcome of this election as anything other than a net political positive for both the governor and the mayor in the same way that the dullest colleagues can suddenly seem a lot better once you realize that all you have is one another and a new boss who seems unhinged mr de blasio had been facing a campaign for re election next year in a climate in which white voters particularly in the brownstone brooklyn precincts that first elected him were disaffected by his performance despite the fact that enthusiasm for him remains tepid his recent approval ratings measured since the election are better than last summer percent of voters say they approve of the job he is doing up from percent in august at least for now it is hard to imagine anyone coming in and robbing him of a second term but if we have learned anything this year it is never to count on a given

blood on the mountain is a clumsily made attack on the coal industry in west virginia but it benefits considerably from the events of the past two weeks the film jumps around chronologically and thematically in a way that dilutes its impact but it still provides plenty of cause to question the wisdom of president elect donald j trumps stated intentions of reviving coal mining and reducing environmental and other regulations the film by mari lynn evans and jordan freeman traces the unpleasant history of coal in west virginia including obvious black marks like the explosion at a massey energy company mine in which people died and less obvious ones like vanishing pension and health care benefits coal companies have carried out a sort of mass brainwashing the film suggests using their status as the only significant employer around to generate support even among the workers they are exploiting and exposing to hazardous conditions most interesting in light of mr trumps campaign pledge to increase the number of coal industry jobs is a segment that suggests expanded coal production would not generate a significant number of jobs because mountaintop removal mining methods now in use are not as labor intensive as underground mining was the industry also has a long legacy of environmental degradation even with federal regulation bruce stanley a lawyer who has represented clients suing coal companies uses a war analogy the war is the one that coal has waged on west virginia for the last years he says as the camera pans a desolate landscape you dont believe its a war you go find a battleground thats as war torn and scarred as the mountaintops of southern west virginia you go find a place where more explosives are set off in a month anywhere on earth the film may be one sided but if nothing else it is a reminder that the coal equals jobs equation is a serious oversimplification
phoenix alan williams and his mother jeri watched on television this summer as san francisco quarterback colin kaepernick protested police brutality and racial injustice by refusing to stand during the national anthem kaepernicks political statement was personal for both williams a second year player for the phoenix suns and his mother who had recently agreed to become the citys police chief they began a pointed discussion over kaepernicks gesture and its potential to unravel their tightly knit relationship alan williams said he felt obliged to support his teammates if they decided like several other professional athletes to join kaepernick his mother reminded him that his actions would reflect on her and vice versa were kind of like this connected entity she said in the end alan williams and his teammates decided to emphasize community outreach over gestures of outrage it was a relief for williams who could not have imagined his career and his mothers intersecting in a way that reflected some of their countrys deepest divisions its kind of crazy how its worked out williams said saturday after the suns home loss to the nets it had been an eventful night for williams a foot reserve center who got into his second game of the season and made the only shot he took in minute seconds of playing time and it was the end of an eventful week for williamss mother whose officers were deployed to keep the peace on election day after several hundred students from both her alma mater maryvale high school and alans north high staged walkouts to protest the candidacies of donald j trump and sheriff joe arpaio of maricopa county an immigration hard liner who lost his bid for a seventh term on election eve when the possibility loomed that hillary clinton would become the first woman to win the presidency chief jeri williams sat in her corner office at the police department headquarters downtown and talked for nearly an hour about her own turn as a trailblazer she is the first woman and the second african american to become the phoenix police chief chief williams pointed out a framed piece of art she had received as a gift it depicts a young black girl holding an american flag her eyes fixed on the stars and stripes i just kind of look at her and it reminds me that anything is possible the chief said williams had sky high aspirations in after earning an undergraduate degree in fine arts from arizona state she applied for her dream job as a flight attendant with pan american airlines but did not make it past the first interview i got told i was too heavy to be a pan am girl she said they did measurements of my elbows and my wrists and i didnt fit the mold she found a plan b on a bulletin board that advertised openings in the police department the prospect of holding a job where no two days were the same appealed to her and she said the departments equal pay for women was also a huge selling point she quickly realized that she had found her calling most days i went home amazed that someone was paying me to do this job she said i get to engage with a bunch of people i get to help people and then i get to put bad guys in jail at first she didnt dwell much on the dangers they became more of a concern after she and her husband cody williams sr a justice of the peace who played two years of basketball at the university of oklahoma started a family in addition to alan they have a younger son cody jr a student at the university of california santa barbara when alan was a child he watched an episode of cops the reality series that follows police officers on duty he stayed up until his mother returned from work late and tearfully asked if she was going to get hurt doing her job she lifted her shirt and revealed her bulletproof vest encouraging her son touch it i said as long as im wearing this vest im safe she recalled during the interview she undid a few of her shirt buttons to show that she continues to wear it always she said just as a reminder of the promise i made to my kid her first two decades in the department included a stint as an assistant chief in she left phoenix to become the police chief in oxnard calif where she oversaw a person force while there she dealt with an episode involving a bystander fatally shot by officers in a case of mistaken identity and another episode involving the death of a person in custody it was almost like for two years i couldnt breathe because i didnt know what was going to happen next chief williams said she sought advice from an advisory board made up of people from the business and religious sectors and said she made sure her department held itself accountable for its actions during this time alan williams was about miles north of oxnard at santa barbara the university he had settled on before his mother got the chiefs job she tried not to let what was happening in her workplace affect his world but headlines critical of her department cast a long shadow i always tried to be there for her as much as possible said williams who starred on the gauchos basketball team she understood i was on my journey too he signed with the suns in as an undrafted free agent and appeared in games last season his value to the team coach earl watson said goes far beyond statistics i can go on and on about how much we love him and his energy on the bench watson said adding he has an edge to him so he is not just a nice guy he has toughness to him
narva estonia barely a few hundred yards inside natos jittery eastern border with russia a high school teacher asked students in his social studies class this week to address a topic of paramount importance for their future the election of donald j trump as the next president of the united states mr trumps surprising victory has sent shock waves around the world but the possible consequences are particularly acute here in the baltics a region long seen as a potential flash point because of its physical linguistic and cultural proximity to russia if world war iii starts we will be the first to know about it said one of the students in the grade class who in keeping with school policy gave only his first name nikita odd though it may seem in view of the threat that a newly aggressive russia may pose he and many other students in this russian speaking town welcomed mr trumps victory because they said the billionaire wanted to cut a deal with moscow and calm tensions jurgen another student in the class described hillary clinton the democratic candidate as a menace because she wants war with russia adding trump wants friendship in a war we would be just in the way such views widespread in russian speaking communities in the baltics and beyond contrast starkly with the alarm even panic at mr trumps triumph among an estonian speaking political and foreign policy elite in the countrys capital tallinn where russias president vladimir v putin is viewed as a threat who must be resisted not appeased during the campaign mr trump raised alarms in baltic capitals by calling nato obsolete and questioning why the united states should defend alliance members that fail to shoulder their share of the costs but president obama has said that mr trump assured him during their oval office meeting last week that he remained committed to the security guarantees that have underpinned natos system of collective defense and peace in europe since but the baltic states remain on edge mr trump demonstrated a mercurial streak during the campaign and they are the most at risk if he should change his mind again and decide to back away from nato adding to their worries pro kremlin politicians just scored gains in elections in bulgaria and moldova yet the reaction to mr trumps victory in estonia and neighboring latvia which also has a large russian population is complex a reflection of their tangled ethnic cultural and political situation even as political leaders in tallinn and the latvian capital riga are in shock many ethnic russians see a silver lining hoping that a trump presidency can improve relations with russia tanel mazur the teacher of the class in narva said that around a third of his students were of russian descent a third estonian and a third from mixed families but that they defied easy labels all speak estonian which is used in class english and russian the dominant language in narva not all of his students cheered mr trump and several including one with a russian background said they worried that he might encourage trouble by trying to appease mr putin asked what they wanted from mr trump now that he had been elected leader of the free world one student said he must keep his emotions back another said he should make america great again while the class joker advised that mr trump change his hair to be taken seriously mr mazur who teaches in estonian and stayed up late on election night to follow the results said he never liked mrs clinton much but added that she at least had a much clearer message and you knew what to expect more or less mr trump by contrast has said so many different things nobody knows what he really wants to do adding to the uncertainty and alarm are statements by some of mr trumps supporters like newt gingrich who described estonia as the suburbs of st petersburg and not worth a confrontation with russia that could risk nuclear war mr gingrich is now a long shot candidate for secretary of state the idea that our country is just a suburb of st petersburg is a nightmare for every estonian said eerik niiles kross a member of estonias parliament and the countrys former intelligence coordinator mr trumps election he added has sent a shiver through the whole region because it reopened security questions that were thought to have been closed with the expansion of nato more than years ago ojars kalnins the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the parliament of neighboring latvia said mr gingrichs comments about estonia were unfortunate to put it mildly it is one thing to talk about having a dialogue with russia but to question the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a country is outrageous mr kalnins said yet he added that profound worry over mr trumps intentions has calmed somewhat because the president elect has pulled back from statements he made on the campaign trail in an effort to head off any weakening of american support for the baltic states mr kalnins and a group of fellow legislators from latvia estonia and lithuania will travel to washington early next month to press their case to the senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and others who might help influence mr trump we abhor unpredictability and confusion said juri luik a former estonian defense minister and foreign minister we are a small country and like a lot of predictability adding conditions to nato support as mr trump has proposed doing would mean a total and profound change in the alliance he added that he doubted that this would happen as it is quite likely that a number of foreign policy proposals will significantly change once he takes office the baltic states which are among the most outspoken critics of mr putin and are dogged advocates within the european union of sanctions against russia also worry that
march trilogyby john lewis andrew aydin and nate powellillustrated pp top shelf productions black lives matter is the cry of the new civil rights movement a slogan so broadly and willfully misunderstood that marchers often shout an addendum this is what democracy looks like the implication is that americans have forgotten and it just might be true in the half century since mass protest ended jim crow and expanded the franchise to millions the civil rights legacy has become a sort of catechism its images of nonviolent confrontation have been blurred into a vision of dignified compliance and its contentious activism into the predestined evolution of the american way the result is a picture of democracy domesticated by remembrance fixed as the granite likeness of the rev dr martin luther king jr in washingtons west potomac park there are few people better qualified to remind us of what democracy really looks like than john lewis the georgia congressman civil rights icon and most recently the author with the writer andrew aydin and the artist nate powell of a three part graphic memoir called march a galvanizing account of his coming of age in the movement its a capsule lesson in courage of conscience a story that inspires without moralizing or simplifying in hindsight the trilogys title is season setting and imperative march begins and draws to a close with scenes from the march lewis led in selma ala on march forever known as bloody sunday after state troopers and the local police attacked the nonviolent protesters the opening panels depict the marchers gathered at the edmund pettus bridge then move from their tense prayerful faces to the phalanx of billy clubs and white helmets on the opposite bank lewis then only was beaten that day five months later lyndon johnson signed the voting rights act the three volumes of march arent just a record of lewiss activism but one of its brilliant examples designed to help new generations of readers visualize the possibilities of political engagement the model is martin luther king and the montgomery story a page comic about the montgomery bus boycott that begins with a young martin luther king jr in church like most effective lessons march is the story of an education an introduction to the difficult art of principled dissent or as lewis has called it necessary trouble the three books recount major events of the civil rights movement from lewiss position as a leader and later the chairman of the student nonviolent coordinating committee the first volume encompasses his childhood in rural alabama his religious education and his involvement with the sit ins protesting nashvilles segregated businesses after enduring harassment beatings and incarceration the students triumph from their efforts emerges sncc later victories come at a high cost book centers on the freedom rides protesting segregation in interstate transportation which are met with bombings bus burnings mob attacks and the mass imprisonment of riders at mississippis state penitentiary parchman farm danger impels division when dr king declines to join sncc organizers on the buses some mock him by calling him de lawd backstage at the march on washington lewis the events youngest and most radical speaker is criticized for questioning the proposed civil rights legislation lewiss address so often eclipsed by kings punctuates the second volume recasting this capstone event for a generation less certain of the endurance of its message march is more movement blueprint than civil rights monument avoiding the old testament spectacle of good versus evil in favor of the clashing visions and fractious passions of those pledged to the same fight as in ava duvernays film selma the spotlight is on strategic thinking and organization politics the choreography behind moments whose seminal status has become at least for present day figures whose activism is measured by its yardstick a hindrance the graphic novel genre proves to be the perfect means of showing us the friction at the movements seams vivid and dynamic yet easily accommodating political nuance this form lends itself to depicting the complex confrontations and negotiations of a wide range of individuals nate powells illustrations shine in the testimony of fannie lou hamer a mississippi sharecropper who was arrested beaten and tortured by the police after attempting to register to vote hamers speech at the democratic national convention in atlantic city serves as the fulcrum for the third volumes account of the freedom summer she was attending as a leader of the mississippi freedom democratic party organized to challenge the states segregated delegation for its seats her nationally televised address confidently delivered as an indictment of americas character was so alarming to lyndon johnson that he interrupted the broadcast with an improvised news conference hamers speech zigzags like a thunderbolt across the panels as they sketch the shocked audiences journalists in the convention ballroom ordinary families watching at home president johnson plotting his countermove from the oval office its hard to imagine a better medium for representing a movement so defined by its rapid and sophisticated manipulation of publicity in a year when black demonstrators have been beaten at rallies for donald trump and denounced for interrupting bernie sanders and hillary clinton the emphasis on hamer and the freedom democratic party resonates while march doesnt extend beyond its triumphal framing story the morning of barack obamas first inauguration it speaks to an era defined by blacklivesmatter started on twitter by opal tometi patrisse cullors and alicia garza emphasizing disruption decentralization and cooperation over the mythic ascent of heroic leaders this graphic novels presentation of civil rights is startlingly contemporary lewis may be one of the great men of the movement but his memoir is humble and generous carving out much of its space for less well known organizers figures like jim lawson ella baker and diane nash young people deserve a future in which they can conceive of their own participation and this requires a past that however long the shadow of its achievements begins at their scale
heres how president elect trump could unify a bitterly divided america provide well paying jobs to many of the millions of disaffected workers who voted for him and lift the economy stock market and tax rolls all he needs to do is what he presumably does best build something and i dont mean a few miles of asphalt or a paint job on a rusting bridge build something awe inspiring something americans can be proud of something that will repay the investment many times over for generations to come build the modern day equivalent of the golden gate bridge the hoover dam the lincoln tunnel or the timberline lodge or even given mr trumps passion for the sport another bethpage state park black course the first public golf course to host the prestigious united states open all of these are depression era public works projects that are still in use can anyone name even one infrastructure project from president obamas billion american recovery and reinvestment act i didnt think so in fairness to mr obama republicans in congress bitterly opposed his public works spending plans and he lamented there were too few shovel ready projects that didnt stop franklin delano roosevelt his public works administration and works progress administration using combinations of public and private money solicited proposals from states and cities hired millions of workers and eventually built bridges miles of roads miles of airport runways playgrounds and military and civilian buildings including more than schools in most cases to high standards of quality and design the federal government built the la guardia ronald reagan washington national and los angeles international airports the upper mississippi locks and dams the bonneville power project on the columbia river the robert f kennedy bridge in new york and the florida keys overseas highway most are still in use today to a large degree this is the infrastructure that made america great to borrow mr trumps catchphrase what roosevelt accomplished is astounding said scott myers lipton a sociology professor at san jose state university and author of the books rebuild america solving the economic crisis through civic works and ending extreme inequality but its not so much the numbers people remember today most people just know there was an alphabet soup of organizations he said what they see and remember are the landmarks the bay bridge reagan national airport or the baseball stadium in san jose were living on that legacy today repealing obamacare lowering taxes for businesses and mostly wealthy people overhauling the immigration system and privatizing medicare what congressional republicans have cited as their top legislative priorities would be divisive in a nation bitterly split along partisan and geographic lines but nearly everyone agrees that america has grossly neglected its infrastructure even as the rest of the world notably china has raced ahead our airports are like from a third world country mr trump said at hofstra university during the first presidential debate you land at la guardia you land at kennedy you land at lax you land at newark and you come in from dubai and qatar and you see these incredible you come in from china you see these incredible airports and you land weve become a third world country who could disagree hillary clinton also called for a big increase in infrastructure spending the single best thing the federal government can do to promote economic growth is to repair and build the transportation network the highways railroads and airports said roger noll an emeritus professor of economics at stanford and a senior fellow at the stanford institute for economic policy research its been neglected for years last year dan mcnichol author of the book the roads that built america a history of the interstate highway system and a white house adviser on transportation issues for president george h w bush navigated the country in a hudson commodore on a mission to investigate the state of americas infrastructure i was trying to see if this was really a crisis or a media sensation he told me this week from california where hes working on the states high speed rail project i found out its pretty dire in terms of total infrastructure for a nation that leads the world in global trade our systems are failing mr trump has pledged trillion over years but no one i spoke to thought that was enough doubling that would be more realistic mr mcnichol said and mr trumps campaign proposal was limited to infrastructure projects that could pay for themselves out of user fees which seems like a shortsighted approach most economists say the best way to finance a big public works program particularly given todays low interest rates would be for the government to borrow most of the money from investors pulling off something on the scale of the depression era public works programs would be no small feat recent federal infrastructure efforts including reconstruction after hurricanes katrina and sandy as well as the obama stimulus program hardly inspire confidence alan brinkley a professor of history at columbia said he doubted mr trump could replicate roosevelts achievements roosevelt had a coherent mission if not always a consistent way to address the depression and the economic crisis mr brinkley said he was eclectic in his approach because he was pragmatic even more important roosevelt was informed surrounded himself with informed people and was prepared on day to begin im not sure that trumps policies go beyond his electioneering slogans mr brinkley said im afraid a new p w a he added referring to the public works administration will stand for promises without actions but in the spirit of magnanimity lets give mr trump the benefit of the doubt as mr obama has suggested hell need his own versions of harold l ickes roosevelts interior secretary who ran the p w a and his close adviser harry l hopkins who ran the w p a mr trump will also need to be hands on
san francisco an automated army of pro donald j trump chatbots overwhelmed similar programs supporting hillary clinton five to one in the days leading up to the presidential election according to a report published thursday by researchers at oxford university the chatbots basic software programs with a bit of artificial intelligence and rudimentary communication skills would send messages on twitter based on a topic usually defined on the social network by a word preceded by a hashtag symbol like clinton their purpose to rant confuse people on facts or simply muddy discussions said philip n howard a sociologist at the oxford internet institute and one of the authors of the report if you were looking for a real debate of the issues you werent going to find it with a chatbot theyre yelling fools dr howard said and a lot of what they pass around is false news the role fake news played in the presidential election has become a sore point for the technology industry particularly google twitter and facebook on monday google said it would ban websites that peddle fake news from using its online advertising service facebook also updated the language in its facebook audience network policy which already says it will not display ads in sites that show misleading or illegal content to include fake news sites in some cases the bots would post embarrassing photos make references to the federal bureau of investigation inquiry into mrs clintons private email server or produce false statements for instance that mrs clinton was about to go to jail or was already in jail the use of automated accounts was deliberate and strategic throughout the election the researchers wrote in the report published by the project on algorithms computational propaganda and digital politics at oxford because the chatbots were almost entirely anonymous and were frequently bought in secret from companies or individual programmers it was not possible to directly link the activity to either campaign except for a handful of joke bots created by mrs clintons campaign they noted however there was evidence that the mystery chatbots were part of an organized effort there does seem to be strategy behind the bots dr howard said by the third debate trump bots were launching into their activity early and we noticed that automated accounts were actually colonizing clinton hashtags a hashtag is used to indicate a twitter posts topic by adopting hashtags relating to mrs clinton the opposition bots were most likely able to wiggle their way into an online conversation among clinton supporters after the election the bot traffic declined rapidly with the exception of some pro trump programs that gloated we won and you lost dr howard said trump campaign officials did not respond to requests for comment twitter executives argued that more people would not follow the programs and so they would be picked up only by those who looked for particular hashtags anyone who claims that automated spam accounts that tweeted about the u s election had an effect on voters opinions or influenced the national twitter conversation clearly underestimates voters and fails to understand how twitter works said nick pacilio a twitter spokesman the researchers based their study on a collection of about million twitter posts gathered in the first nine days of november they selected tweets based on hashtags identifying certain subjects and identified automated posting by finding accounts that post at least times a day for example the top accounts which were mostly bots and highly automated accounts averaged over tweets a day and they generated more than tweets the researchers noted the top accounts which still used high levels of automation generated around tweets at an average rate of tweets per day the oxford researchers had previously reported that political chatbots had played a role in shaping the political landscape that led to britains brexit vote the researchers have coined the term computational propaganda to describe the explosion of deceptive social media campaigns on services like facebook and twitter in a previous research paper dr howard and bence kollanyi a researcher at corvinus university of budapest described how political chatbots had a small but strategic role in shaping the online conversation during the run up to the brexit referendum the bot managers seem to repurpose the programs as well during the british campaign they discovered that a family of bots that had been tweeting around israeli palestinian issues for three or four years had suddenly become pro brexit after the vote the bots returned to their original issue in the case of the american election the researchers noted that highly automated accounts the accounts that tweeted or more times with a related hashtag and user mention during the data collection period generated close to percent of all twitter traffic about the presidential election they also noted that bots tend to circulate negative news much more effectively than positive reports one of the consequences of the intense social media campaigns will be a rise in what social scientists call selective affinity clinton supporters will cut the trump supporters out of their network and trump supporters will do the same dr howard said the polarization of the election is going to make this stuff worse as we self groom our news networks
campaign promises are easy governing is hard it is a truism that donald j trump and his team will soon learn and a fascinating example has emerged since the election courtesy of global currency markets it is a study in the kind of complex trade offs that mr trump rarely grappled with during his campaign but will face many times a day in the oval office a centerpiece of mr trumps campaign was the united states trade deficits he pledged to eliminate them and create a resurgence in american manufacturing he has also pledged tax cuts infrastructure spending and deregulation that set of policies has led markets to expect speedier economic growth and thus higher interest rates in coming years that in turn is driving the value of the dollar higher since election day the dollar is up percent against an index of six other major currencies the value of the mexican peso has fallen percent against the dollar a remarkable swing for the united states third largest trading partner you dont need to be an economist to see what that means a pricier dollar makes it harder for american manufacturers to compete overseas it gives an advantage to companies that locate operations elsewhere and it will all else being equal tend to make the trade deficit higher rather than lower this is not to suggest that the shift in the currency so far is a major disaster for american manufacturers and other exporters there was a bigger rise in the dollar in and that damaged export sectors even more but lets imagine that mr trump follows through on the policy mix hes hinted at so far a combination of loose fiscal policy and tighter monetary policy at that point the dollar could move decisively higher creating a tension that the president and his advisers would have to resolve one way or the other as a rule of thumb said joseph gagnon a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics a percent rise in the dollar would be expected to increase the current account deficit by to percent of g d p in the ensuing two to three years in that case mr trumps pledge to eliminate the billion united states trade deficit would have just become billion to billion harder this is the kind of dilemma presidents face all the time the oval office debate might go something like this the commerce secretary complains mr president this strong dollar is just killing our manufacturers they cant compete with this kind of appreciation the treasury secretary who is in charge of the currency responds its a necessary evil mr president our economy is booming so much that global investors just cant get enough of united states assets when there are these kinds of disputes the president has to decide and when a president tries to find a solution that answers both concerns there are always complex ripples for example lets appoint fed officials who will cut interest rates might temporarily let you have both a booming domestic economy and a competitive export sector but would mean an increase in inflation which will make both the bond market and many retired americans living on fixed incomes unhappy the tension between currency policy and trade policy is just one example mr trumps promises to repeal obamacare while keeping some of its most popular features would be hard to carry out in practice virtually every issue in tax policy diplomacy and regulatory policy features similar complex trade offs none of this is to say that these tensions are unsolvable or that mr trump wont overcome his lack of a policy background to arrive at good solutions but he will almost certainly find out that make america great again is a slogan not an answer
boston millions of americans suffer from alcoholism or addiction to legal and illegal drugs but only a fraction are being treated according to a report released on thursday by the surgeon general one in seven people in the united states is expected to develop a substance use disorder at some point the report said but as of now only one in will receive treatment the report is the first from a surgeon general to address substance use disorders and the wider range of health problems related to alcohol and drugs it calls for among other things a cultural change in understanding that addiction is a brain disease not a character flaw its time to change how we view addiction dr vivek h murthy the surgeon general said in releasing the report not as a moral failing but as a chronic illness that must be treated with skill urgency and compassion the way we address this crisis is a test for america the report is intended to try to prompt the public policy makers and health care professionals to better address these issues those who work in the fields of addiction and recovery liken it to the landmark surgeon general reports of the and that said smoking caused lung cancer and led congress in to require health warnings on cigarette packs but it is not clear that this report will be nearly as influential for one at least one senator is calling it a missed opportunity the deaths caused by prescription drug heroin and fentanyl overdoses are growing exponentially every year yet this report fails to provide any detailed road map for how best to curb opioid addiction senator edward j markey democrat of massachusetts said in a statement the magnitude of the opioid epidemic he said demanded a far more detailed discussion in addition the report comes at the tail end of the obama administration which pleaded unsuccessfully with congress this year for billion to fight the opioid epidemic congress instead set aside million a move that a disappointed president obama said was better than nothing and it comes as the incoming president donald j trump prepares to appoint his own surgeon general and has his own ideas about how to combat the epidemic mr trump has said that he will try everything we can to get americans unaddicted to drugs but his chief proposal is to build a wall on the border with mexico the wall he said in new hampshire last month would keep out drug dealers and keep out the heroin poisoning our youth even if a wall kept some heroin out of the united states it would not necessarily solve the problem while many americans are dying of overdoses of heroin many more are dying from opioid painkillers legally prescribed within the united states and in some states deaths from synthetic opioids like fentanyl which are coming from china are overtaking deaths from heroin on a conference call dr murthy was asked how mr trumps plans to roll back the affordable care act might affect his call to action on substance abuse the issue of addiction affects everyone regardless of political party race ethnicity or socioeconomic status he said adding that the effort to combat the drug epidemic has been bipartisan the urgency to address addiction is only growing dr murthy said he vowed to continue his work to change how were talking about addiction and get people to step forward and ask for help the new report said that people die every day in the united states from opioid overdoses a number that has nearly quadrupled since it estimated that the annual economic toll related to alcohol is billion and that the toll related to drugs is billion the majority of people who misuse substances do not develop a use disorder the report said but roughly one in seven americans percent of the population are expected to develop such a disorder at some point only about percent of people with a substance use disorder receive any type of specialty treatment the report said and while more than percent of people with such a disorder also have a mental health condition fewer than half receive treatment for either from percent to percent of a persons risk for developing a substance use disorder is genetic the report said but many environmental factors like how old he or she is when first drinking or trying drugs can influence the risk people who first drink alcohol before age are four times more likely to become addicted at some time in their lives than are those who have their first drink at age or older the report said nearly percent of those who try an illicit drug before the age of develop a substance use disorder within seven years the report said compared with percent of those who first try an illicit drug after the age of
donald j trumps victory could well push the american party system toward a clash between an overwhelmingly white ethnic party and a cosmopolitan coalition of minority groups and college educated whites despite the unexpected result mr trump lost the popular vote in an election that in some respects closely resembled barack obamas victory over mitt romney in an ordinary end to a very abnormal campaign the power of party identification held approximately percent of republicans in mr trumps camp however mr trumps campaign may set in motion a process that reorients american politics toward the cosmopolitanism versus nationalism divide that he emphasized reconfiguring our party system and shaping our politics for decades to come the power of social identity suggests that such a dynamic could be difficult to stop once set in motion in recent years the democrats and republicans have battled along a liberal conservative axis of conflict that emphasizes disagreement over the size and scope of government rather than divisive disputes about racial identity during the and presidential elections for instance john mccain and mr romney ran against mr obamas domestic policy proposals on issues like health care and the economy after the republican party hoped to continue along this path and expand its appeal to young people minorities and women but as the political scientists gary miller and norm schofield note candidates and parties sometimes engage in flanking moves so as to enlist coalitions of disaffected voters by changing positions on social issues that cut across party lines they seek to attract voters who are only loosely attached to the other party mr trump seems to have pulled off one of these maneuvers in shifting from traditional conservatism to a kind of race inflected nationalism though the move cost him votes among college educated whites he attracted support among the larger group of whites without a college degree pulling in just enough votes in the rust belt to tip the election despite all the attention paid to economic anxiety as the basis for mr trumps appeal the evidence to date is more consistent with his brand of identity politics being the most important cause of this shift in voting patterns from mr trumps approach has the potential to transform the party system first the success of his campaign may encourage other republicans to adopt his model he has shown that the penalty for deviating from orthodox policies is minimal and that an ethno nationalist style can have significant electoral advantages second though presidents cannot impose their will on most of domestic policy they can help define the issues on the political agenda in the choices that he makes mr trump may play down conflict over the size and scope of government and shift the political debate toward questions of national identity immigration and culture finally few republicans are likely to want to cross mr trump and his energized supporters given the threat of a potential primary challenge in consider for instance mr trumps decision to name as his chief strategist steve bannon the head of breitbart a website described in an article in the conservative national review as catering to a small but vocal fringe of white supremacists anti semites and internet trolls though the move lacked recent precedent no republicans in congress objected which made the issue into a partisan dispute with democrats mr trump has also stirred emotions by promising to deport two to three million undocumented immigrants by contrast the fate of a tax cut normally the top g o p domestic policy priority has received less attention mr trumps success is likely to provoke a response from democrats that could accelerate this shift they face an outraged liberal base that is likely to reject conciliatory messages intended to win back votes among the white working class the party might instead double down on cosmopolitan appeals to the minority voters and college educated white voters who were the main target of hillary clintons campaign the strategy failed in but the incentive to try again is clear democrats came closer to winning several sun belt states where minority and college educated white populations are growing like arizona and georgia than they did some traditional midwest strongholds with higher numbers of noncollege whites like ohio and iowa a focus on cosmopolitanism might make electoral sense for democrats given the changing demographics of the country but it could further weaken their appeal to whites without college degrees dividing the electorate by race and class even more nothing about this process is preordained of course republicans may yet succeed in steering mr trump toward a traditional g o p agenda of tax cuts and deregulation but the effects he could have on americas party system could be of far more lasting consequence than almost any policy he might propose

washington lurking behind the turmoil and the jockeying for advantage in president elect donald j trumps effort to assemble a national security team lies the more fundamental question of how he will address the immediate and complex challenges he inherits upon taking office mr trump has never articulated any detailed foreign policy vision beyond the vague slogan america first the diverse and shifting cast of potential appointees under consideration for top administration jobs has only highlighted the deep splits among conservatives about how the new administration should confront fast evolving threats involving iran north korea syria and russia among others and how it should manage relations with allies in europe and asia im america first mr trump said in a march interview with the new york times describing for the first time what the phrase meant to him we have been disrespected mocked and ripped off for many many years by people that were smarter shrewder tougher now from his personnel appointments to his first major meeting with a foreign leader it came thursday in new york with prime minister shinzo abe of japan mr trump faces a series of decisions that will begin to flesh out his approach to the world and provide some clue as to how he might respond to whatever crises confront him as commander in chief does america first mean he will use americas military and cyberpower pre emptively to wipe out emerging threats from rogue nuclear states to terrorist groups before they can do harm to the united states or does it mean he calls americas forward deployed troops back home building them into a defensive retaliatory force that can lash out if the nation is attacked at moments during the campaign he suggested both approaches he said he would take the oil from islamic state controlled areas of iraq and he criticized president obama for pulling troops out too soon but he is also the man who rejected nation building and asked why is it always the united states that gets right in the middle of things he added at some point we cannot be the policeman of the world no one knows what response to expect from mr trump a man who said he prided himself on following his instincts and has little patience for careful legalisms of his predecessor but while presidents change the challenges do not here are some places and issues where america first will first take shape mr trump called the agreement reached with iran in july intended to constrain tehran from building nuclear weapons one of the most incompetent deals of any kind ive ever seen and he promised to fix it because the iran deal is an executive agreement not a treaty the new president has great latitude to alter or scrap it but two can play that game the iranians are deeply unhappy with the accord too arguing that they never got the relief from sanctions that they were promised any effort to reopen the bargaining will also give irans mullahs military officers and conservatives a chance to alter the pact or threaten to resume their race for nuclear capability to mr trump the iran deal was not only misguided but also badly negotiated they shouldve walked he said of secretary of state john kerry and his negotiating team mr trump said he would have left the negotiating room doubled down on sanctions and never agreed to give back billions of dollars money that belonged to iran and was frozen in american financial institutions but when pressed he struggled to name any part of the deal he would have walked out of the negotiations to alter with some prompting he finally settled on a common critique that after years iran will be free to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium again in any quantity in america first terms mr trumps decision about what to do with the iran deal will be an early test of his willingness to act unilaterally the nations that joined the united states in the negotiations britain france russia and china not only support the deal but are rushing to take economic advantage of it by building commercial ties with iran if mr trump wanted to abandon the deal or reimpose sanctions they would almost certainly refuse to go along the iranians hold a few cards too in january they shipped percent of their nuclear fuel out of the country disabled a plutonium reactor and took thousands of centrifuges which enrich uranium out of service if the deal were to be declared dead they would be free to re create their nuclear infrastructure and rebuild their stockpile now frozen until by obama administration estimates it would take about a year for them to produce enough new material for a weapon longer to produce the weapon itself one option for mr trump advocated by many republicans is to simply reimpose sanctions on iran for non nuclear reasons including its activities in syria and its continued support of terrorism the iranians would say that violates the spirit of the agreement and irans leadership has already threatened that such action would nullify it it is hard to say which has sounded more confrontational in recent years about north korea the obama administration which has regularly warned of a devastating response to any north korean use of its expanding nuclear arsenal or the republicans who spent much of the bush years plotting ways to make the countrys regime collapse but if there is likely to be an early test of mr trumps reaction to provocations north korea is probably it the nation has accelerated its nuclear tests and its arsenal is growing it could have to weapons during mr trumps term in his security briefings mr trump will be hearing the latest estimates for how long it will take the north to build a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach america the public figure is five years or so though some intelligence officials believe it
congress should exercise greater scrutiny over trade and investment practices between the united states and china in order to prevent china from taking advantage of the economic relationship a congressional commission said in a report released on wednesday in its long list of recommendations the commission advised congress to authorize a government panel that reviews foreign takeover deals to bar chinese state owned companies from acquiring or gaining effective control of american companies it also said congress should ask a government watchdog agency to write a report on whether large scale outsourcing of manufacturing to china is leading to the hollowing out of the defense industrial base in addition the commission suggested ways in which congress could better bring antidumping cases against china each year the u s china economic and security review commission releases a report to congress with recommendations based on months of research the commission aims to make suggestions after examining trade investment and national security issues between the two nations its recommendations are not binding the report this year took a critical look at the free trade relationship between the united states and china for example implying that the countries are not competing on a level playing field it follows a populist airing of grievances over the downsides of free trade and a globalized economy in western nations this year that helped lead to the election last week of donald j trump as the next united states president and to the vote by britons in june to leave the european union china in its recent public statements has emphasized the tight economic ties between the two major trading partners and said the countries would benefit more from working together during his campaign mr trump said he would bring manufacturing jobs back to middle america and consider imposing a percent tariff on chinese exports as well as labeling china a currency manipulator some economists have said a trade war with china would harm the united states economy and lead to a recession in september after prodding from some lawmakers the government accountability office a watchdog agency said that it would examine whether reviews of foreign purchases should include a stricter look at more types of foreign investments and be broadened to define more industries as important to the nations economy the review process is done by the committee on foreign investment in the united states or cfius which approves most of the foreign purchases that it examines the report released on wednesday said it is that panel that congress should authorize to reject purchases by chinese state owned enterprises such companies are the main drivers of chinas economy the new report said congress should also create an office in the international trade administration to identify and bring antidumping and countervailing duty cases countervailing duties are imposed on goods to offset the fact that the goods may have been made with the help of subsidies besides trade and investment the report covers topics like security relations chinas global footprint and the united states rebalancing to asia in one section the authors criticize what they see as meager american government efforts to block intelligence collection by china the obama administration has expressed concern over what it sees as state sponsored hacking from china in recent years the u s government response to the threat from chinese intelligence collection has suffered from the lack of an integrated coordinated effort within the u s intelligence community the report said the u s governments efforts to counter chinese intelligence collection operations have manifested largely as a series of espionage prosecutions rather than a strategic whole of government response it added the obama administration has taken steps to improve cybersecurity among u s government agencies and defense contractors but these measures could mitigate not eliminate the significant cyberespionage threats to these organizations
prime minister shinzo abe of japan is planning to sit down with donald j trump in new york on thursday in what would be the president elects first meeting with a foreign leader since his election mr abe wants to find out how serious mr trump was during his campaign when he repeatedly criticized japan on trade issues and for not paying more of the cost of its own defense and since the japanese establishment was expecting hillary clinton to win the presidency mr abe wants to assure mr trump that he is willing and eager to work with him the prime minister is concerned about mr trumps commitment to protecting japan the united states is japans most important ally and is legally obligated to defend it against attack there are around american troops stationed in japan a powerful deterrent against the rising threat of north korea and an increasingly assertive china during the campaign president elect trump suggested he might withdraw american troops not without resistance from members of congress officials at the state department diplomats and military advisers the united states japan alliance has been in place since the end of world war ii and has a lot of backing on both sides of the pacific ocean maybe there are signs that japan might be willing to pay or do more but many experts contend american troops are not only defending japan but the united states own interests in asia the pentagon is budgeted to spend about billion to support troops and bases on okinawa and elsewhere around japan this year japan is set to spend billion to support the bases in addition to at least billion on related expenses including compensation for the communities that host the bases and funds for relocating american troops under its constitution which was written by american occupying forces after world war ii japan can keep an army for defensive purposes but mr abe has said he wants to revise the constitution and expand the military in august his government requested the latest in a series of increases in military spending japan has committed to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and mr abe will probably remind mr trump of that on the campaign trail mr trump decried the cost of providing a so called nuclear umbrella to allies such as japan and south korea that do not have their own nuclear arms in march mr trump told the new york times that he was open to those countries building their own nuclear arsenals but on twitter this week he denied having said so mr abe has reaffirmed his countrys commitment not to develop atomic weapons any move to do so would face severe public opposition in japan the only country that has suffered a nuclear attack he has been one of the biggest enthusiasts for the trans pacific partnership or tpp as it is known though japan was the last of a dozen pacific rim countries to join the sweeping trade pact mr trump repeatedly criticized the tpp during the presidential campaign mr abe made politically painful concessions on agricultural imports to close the deal and get japanese manufacturers tariff free access to export markets in the united states and elsewhere the trade partnership could bolster the limp economic growth rate in his country and serve as a counterweight to china the regions fast rising superpower mr abe acknowledged after mr trumps victory that the trans pacific partnership was in a very difficult situation but his government still plans to have parliament ratify the agreement and he has not given up on selling it to mr trump mr abe may also seek to soften mr trumps angry campaign stance in which he accused japan of crushing the united states on trade and manipulating its currency to gain an economic advantage mr trump says hes for free trade in principle but wants a better deal for the united states what that means for now remains a mystery
washington hillary clinton held back tears on wednesday as she asked her supporters not to lose heart after a crushing election loss and to continue working for a better country i will admit coming here tonight wasnt the easiest thing for me mrs clinton said at a gala for the childrens defense fund where she worked as a young law student there have been a few times this past week when all i wanted to do is just to curl up with a good book or our dogs and never leave the house again in her first public remarks since conceding to president elect donald j trump last week mrs clinton told the crowd she was struggling to recover from an unexpected defeat that she said had left nonwhite children and vulnerable people across the nation afraid i believe the measure of any society is how we treat our children and as we move forward into a new and in many ways uncertain future that must be the test for america and ourselves mrs clinton said in a minute speech no child should be afraid to go to school because theyre latino or african american or muslim or because they have a disability introduced by marian wright edelman the groups president and founder as the peoples president and the first woman to win the popular vote mrs clinton who had accepted the groups invitation before the election said she had had to overcome deep sorrow to keep the commitment but she came bearing a message of resolve i know many of you are deeply disappointed about the results of the election i am too more than i can ever express she said i know this isnt easy i know that over the past week a lot of people have asked themselves whether america was the country we thought it was she implored her supporters though to believe in our country fight for our values and never give up mrs clinton has stayed out of the public eye since the day after the election but in a private call with donors over the weekend she cast blame for her loss on the announcement by james b comey the f b i director that he was reviving the inquiry into her use of a private email server as secretary of state she said that decision by thrusting the email controversy back into the news days before election day had halted her momentum in the crucial closing days of the race and prevented her from ending her campaign with an optimistic argument to voters a second letter from mr comey clearing her two days before the election compounded the harm to her chances mrs clinton told the donors feeding into a narrative that the contest was rigged and causing wavering voters including white suburban women to abandon her on wednesday though there was no talk of opportunities missed or messages muddled instead mrs clinton was regretful and the slightest bit defiant she said she wished she could go back in time and tell her mother abandoned at a young age not to despair look at me and listen mrs clinton said she would have told her mother her voice thick with emotion you will survive you will have a family of your own three children and as hard as it might be to imagine your daughter will grow up to be a united states senator represent our country as secretary of state and win more than million votes in her campaign for the presidency democrats stunned and dejected over last weeks electoral losses are struggling to rebuild their party re energize supporters and determine what lessons to draw from their defeat president obama told supporters in a call on monday afternoon that he expected to be a part of that debate starting in january when he leaves office but it is not clear what role if any mrs clinton plans to play the event on wednesday a beat the odds gala honoring at risk children who have found success was in some sense a capstone to mrs clintons life in national politics the same event in was the first public appearance she and her husband bill clinton made after he won the presidency
after lebron james criticized knicks president phil jackson for using the word posse to describe james his friends and his business partners stan van gundy took a moment to consider his own use of the term van gundy the detroit pistons head coach has been coaching in the n b a for two decades and has lately become a liberal vanguard in the league but he said that he had used the word too and in a way that might cause the same consternation that jacksons use did for james van gundy said he had asked himself if he had ever used posse when talking about a white player the answer was discomforting the answer is no he said wednesday before the pistons played the knicks at madison square garden i think look you have to be aware of the language and you have to be aware a little bit of your own biases if youre going to overcome them i took that seriously i understand why its offensive ive never used that word publicly with anybody but i have used it in just talking to people i know and things like that it has never been in conjunction with a white player so i think at a time where youre going to call out other people on attitudes you need to be willing to look in the mirror and call yourself out jackson has remained silent since monday when espn published an interview with him that drew jamess ire in the interview jackson told an anecdote about james then with the heat trying to keep the team in cleveland for an extra night after a road game you cant hold up the whole team jackson said because you and your mom and your posse want to spend an extra night in cleveland james responded angrily saying that he had lost respect for jackson and that jackson was using the word in a way that was racially coded though he has not spoken publicly jackson on tuesday reposted a twitter message by clarence gaines jr a knicks executive that mentioned the posse foundation a nonprofit that supports multicultural groups of students as a worthy and positive organization van gundy who said he had no problem with jackson also continued to speak out against president elect donald j trump last week he called trump brazenly racist and misogynistic on wednesday he added that all n b a teams should examine whether to stay at trumps hotels after an espn report came out saying three teams had already decided not to do so this season van gundy said the pistons were not among those teams because they had no plans to stay at those hotels in the first place but not for political reasons i think every teams got to take a look at that van gundy said i think teams are getting tuned in politically and everything else he continued give the players a great deal of credit ive been really proud of our own players but players throughout the league and that theyre attuned to whats going on and theyre going to stand up for their values i think thats impressive particularly the fact that we have a really young team and guys in their normally that kind of no matter where you stand on the spectrum normally that kind of social awareness and activism is something you come to later in life
washington more than a million people have signed up for health insurance coverage on healthcare gov and more than of them selected plans in the three days after donald j trump won the presidential election the obama administration said on wednesday about one fourth of those using the online exchange to sign up people were new to the federal marketplace and the other were renewing coverage they had this year the data covered plan selections from nov the first day of the fourth annual open enrollment period to nov for the states that use the health care website federal officials said the total was more than the number of selections in the first days of the enrollment season last year andrew m slavitt the acting administrator of the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services said he was pleased with the pace of plan selections it shows that health insurance is something people want and need he said christen linke young the deputy director of the agency that runs the federal marketplace said the obama administration was moving forward with planning for it is business as usual with respect to how we are talking to insurers she said in the presidential campaign mr trump said repeatedly that congress must completely repeal obamacare which he described as an absolute disaster but in the last week he indicated that he would like to preserve certain popular features of the law including ones that guarantee access to insurance for people with pre existing conditions and that allow young adults to stay on their parents insurance until age since nov the day after republicans secured control of the white house and both houses of congress the federal marketplace has received telephone calls from people wanting to know how the election would affect their insurance coverage mr slavitt said he said the government had assured callers that nothing is changing now and in the short term republicans and democrats disagree over the law but nobody wants to do something disruptive to consumers he said mr slavitts agency is responsible for health programs that account for about one fourth of all federal spending but he said he had not had any contact with mr trumps transition team for the current open enrollment period which runs through jan the administration has declared a goal of having million people sign up for coverage an increase of million over the last enrollment season major insurers have pulled out of the marketplace in many parts of the country and premiums for many of the remaining plans have shot up but the obama administration is trying to counter those trends with the message that federal subsidies will also increase so that the consumers share of the premium will not rise much especially if consumers are willing to switch to less costly plans one reason for rate increases next year is that the federal government has not paid insurers as much as they were expecting to receive to help offset financial losses under the affordable care act the united states court of federal claims recently rejected a lawsuit filed by an illinois insurer the land of lincoln mutual health insurance company a nonprofit cooperative that had sought damages for the governments failure the ruling is ominous for insurers because many of them contend that they too were shortchanged and a number have filed similar lawsuits at issue is a program intended to compensate insurers that lose substantial sums in the federal marketplace losses far exceeded expectations and the obama administration did not have enough money to make the promised risk corridor payments judge charles f lettow of the claims court said the government had neither a statutory nor a contractual obligation to pay the company more than it did percent of the amount lincoln was expecting for and nothing for the money was supposed to come from profitable insurers but the government did not collect enough to pay the amounts owed to unprofitable insurers the affordable care act did not provide money to make up the difference and no valid contract exists between the government and the land of lincoln insurance company judge lettow said
washington over the past month president vladimir v putin of russia has received two starkly different messages about hacking into american computer networks from the current and future presidents of the united states dont you dare and dont worry were not even sure it was you the white house confirmed in a statement on wednesday that eight days before the presidential election the united states contacted the russian government directly regarding malicious cyberactivity that was targeting u s state election related systems it sent the message over a rarely used system a hotline connecting the nuclear risk reduction centers in both countries which they had agreed three years ago could also be employed to deal with major cyberincidents the pre election warning only the latest after verbal cautions by president obama his defense secretary and the director of national intelligence was reported by the washington post the warnings to russia against further hacking into polling or registration systems or any further effort to affect the outcome of the election are being hailed by the obama administration as a success in deterrence after all they argue a year and a half of russian hacking activity seemed to slow or halt and there is no evidence that voting or counting of ballots was disrupted on election day but more than a few experts in deterring cyberattacks take a more skeptical view they say the russians had already achieved their main goal to demonstrate how they could disrupt the american electoral process with the leak of hacked emails including from the democratic national committee and hillary clintons campaign chairman john d podesta mr putin suffered nothing worse than a warning they note no sanctions no counter cyberstrikes no embarrassing revelations engineered by the united states and he now has the satisfaction of dealing with president elect donald j trump who during the campaign praised him promised to build a more productive relationship with russia and maintained there was no evidence that the russians were behind the hacking anytime anything wrong happens they like to blame the russians mr trump said in an oct debate with mrs clinton she doesnt know if its the russians doing the hacking maybe there is no hacking mr trump contended that the allegations of russian activity were intended to tarnish me for advocating a new relationship with moscow he frequently repeated similar sentiments in the last weeks of the campaign suggesting the hacking was a fabrication the leaks of emails worked largely to his advantage embarrassing democratic leaders like representative debbie wasserman schultz of florida who was forced to resign as the chairwoman of the democratic national committee mr trumps larger strategic message is that the united states and russia need to cooperate on a range of issues but for now the situation underscores the uncertainty around the world about the direction of american foreign policy and gives mr putin the opportunity to exploit differences between the current president and his successor until mr trump is inaugurated on jan it is also raising the question of whether the obama white house pushed back hard enough when american intelligence agencies concluded on oct that only russias senior most officials could have authorized these activities james a lewis a computer expert at the center for strategic and international studies in washington dismissed the administrations claim that it had deterred russias hacking it seems a little bold to claim this is a success for deterrence since the russians werent deterred from doing anything he said their hacking work was mostly complete the issue now is whether they will be deterred in the future and the guessing is they will not strong private warnings arent enough to constitute deterrence in fact the russians appear to have paid less of a price for their hacking around the election than north korea did for its attack on sony pictures entertainment in that attack melted down about percent of sonys computers and servers at its studios wreaking considerable damage and embarrassed many sony executives it was in response to the release of a movie the interview that imagined a c i a plot to kill kim jong un the north korean leader after the sony episode the united states issued more sanctions against north korea and encouraged china to limit the norths internet access all of which runs through chinese switching centers many experts had expected the white house to follow a similar path with russia instead the white house concluded that the warnings and the unstated suggestion that the united states had the power to reach inside russian networks and see the origin of attacks might suffice it is not clear if the administration plans any other actions against russia before mr obamas departure from office but that seems less and less likely the oct warning did not deal with the hacking of the democratic national committee or mr podestas account which james r clapper jr the director of national intelligence had previously said was conducted with the knowledge of the russian leadership instead it referred only to the concerns about hacking around the election process itself and the fear it was originating from russian territory though it stopped short of saying it was a state sponsored attack
mexico city mexicos ministry of foreign affairs apparently responding to promises by president elect donald j trump to step up deportations announced a plan on wednesday to provide more protection and support for mexican immigrants in the united states and urged the mexican population to stay calm in a statement and an accompanying video both titled we are with you the ministry laid out an point plan intended to help mexicans in the united states get accurate information about possible changes in immigration policy and avoid falling victim to abuse and fraud fellow countrymen these are moments of uncertainty mexicos foreign minister claudia ruiz massieu said in the video stay calm do not fall to provocations and do not let yourself be deceived she added we want to inform you about possible migratory actions that could take effect starting in february the ministrys strategy promised an expansion of services offered by mexicos embassy in washington and its consulates around the united states including a hour toll free consular hotline to address migration concerns and report possible fraud an increase in outreach efforts in neighborhoods with large mexican populations and more help for mexican immigrants to secure identification documents for them and for their american born children while the statements did not specifically mention mr trump or his deportation plans mexican officials have been worried about the possibility that he might follow through on his campaign promises to step up deportations beyond even the record rates that president obama has achieved mr trumps victory has rattled the entire region on wednesday the governments of el salvador guatemala and honduras issued a joint statement announcing their intention to develop a unified strategy to contend with a trump administration on shared concerns like migration el salvadors foreign minister hugo martnez told reuters that the three countries intended to seek mexicos collaboration central america is now a bigger source of migrants than mexico as people flee gang violence and poverty in el salvador honduras and guatemala mr trumps deportation proposals would certainly result in the return of many central americans to countries suffering widespread poverty and crime in a television interview broadcast on sunday mr trump said he planned to focus his deportation efforts on people that are criminal and have criminal records estimating that this population numbered as many as three million he suggested a focus on the most serious and dangerous criminals gang members drug dealers he said but left the details vague his estimate contrasted with that of the obama administration which put the number of removal criminal aliens at about million including undocumented immigrants as well as legal permanent residents and immigrants with temporary visas as a candidate mr trump took specific aim at mexican immigrants but it remained unclear how many of the deportees in his promised dragnet would be mexican in about percent of the estimated million unauthorized immigrants in the united states were mexican according to the pew research center and their numbers are thought to have declined since then immigrants and their advocates in the united states are worried that an acceleration of deportations could tear apart families and communities in anticipation of policy changes community based organizations around the country are moving to help immigrants secure their footing and protect them against a possible rise in scams that often accompany changes in immigration policy for the mexican authorities mr trumps deportation policy could also have major domestic implications in mexico including the return of hundreds of thousands of mexicans who might struggle to find jobs in an economy already troubled by high unemployment rates mass deportations might also result in the loss of many millions of dollars in remittances for mexico
hundreds of american companies including mars nike levi strauss and starbucks have urged president elect donald j trump not to abandon the paris climate deal saying a failure by the united states to build a clean economy endangers american prosperity in a plea addressed to mr trump as well as president obama and members of congress companies and major investors emphasized their deep commitment to addressing climate change and demanded that he leave in place low emissions policies in the united states failure to build a low carbon economy puts american prosperity at risk the companies said in a joint letter announced on wednesday in marrakesh morocco where global leaders are determining the next steps for the paris deal but the right action now will create jobs and boost u s competitiveness the companies also said that they would push ahead with their own targets to reduce their carbon footprints regardless of steps taken by mr trump once he is in office during his campaign mr trump who has called climate change a hoax pledged to leave the paris accord dismantle the environmental protection agency and undo mr obamas climate change policies this doesnt change our commitments said kevin rabinovitch global sustainability director at mars which has pledged to eliminate percent of its greenhouse gas emissions from its factories and offices by were doing this because we see a real business risk we see a real business problem businesses large and small have scrambled in the days since mr trumps victory to chart their next moves in an uncertain regulatory situation mr trumps campaign pledges and musings have been driven by the belief that the economy will grow faster if businesses are freed from cumbersome federal regulations especially those that limit carbon emissions the president elect has heightened environmentalists fears that his administration will take on an anti climate anti environment bent by appointing the climate contrarian myron ebell to lead the e p a transition climate change activists have denounced mr ebell whose competitive enterprise institute has received funding from oil and gas interest groups some corporations like the countrys largest automakers have already seized on a potential upside to the president elects leanings urging a rethinking of stringent federal auto emissions standards an easing of federal standards for passenger cars which together with the rest of the transportation sector emit more carbon dioxide than any other part of the american economy could have immense implications for overall emissions others like solar and wind power companies have raced to find common ground with mr trump pressing for reassurances that his administration will not slash investment in renewable energy or alter federal tax credits on renewable energy projects mr trump talks about infrastructure he talks about jobs said michael skelly founder and president of clean line energy partners a company based in houston that builds transmission lines for renewable energy what were creating are welding jobs steel manufacturing jobs in kansas oklahoma iowa he said these are projects that create income for landowners create jobs in the middle of the country the stakes are high damage from climate change especially from extreme weather events like hurricanes flooding and drought could shave as much as percent off annual global gross domestic product by according to a study commissioned by the british government that is considered one of the most comprehensive environmental groups have been left with the daunting prospect that with a climate skeptic in the white house they will need to look directly to corporations to assume the mantle of leading the countrys response to climate change but without strict regulatory standards or oversight companies will be left freer to pick and choose which climate friendly policies to pursue and which they will choose to ignore or abandon still some american corporations have already made significant efforts to reduce their environmental footprints so reversing them now would be disruptive not just for the environment but for their bottom line and even with a move away from climate friendly policies back home american corporations face tightening regulations overseas now more than ever levi strauss believes it is important to reaffirm our commitment to address climate change by supporting the paris climate agreement said michael kobori the companys vice president for sustainability building an energy efficient economy in the u s will ensure our nations competitiveness he said and position u s companies as leaders in the global market all while doing the right thing for our planet
moscow president vladimir v putin of russia instructed his government on wednesday to withdraw from the treaty that created the international criminal court while his government assailed the tribunal as ineffective and one sided the action was largely symbolic because russia like the united states has not ratified the treaty and is not under the courts jurisdiction but it was another setback for the fairly young court which handles cases of war crimes and crimes against humanity and is an emblem of the international order that is being shaken by populist revolts across the west essentially this is just a gratuitous slap in the face not a body blow said kate cronin furman a human rights lawyer and political scientist at the harvard kennedy school who predicted that the election of donald j trump as president of the united states would lead to more harm for the court burundi gambia and south africa moved recently to withdraw from the court calling it biased because all the people it had convicted so far had been africans or because in the case of south africa it disagreed with the courts mandate to prosecute any individual including a head of state zeid raad al hussein the united nations high commissioner for human rights tried on wednesday to rally support for the court a new trend of isolationist and unprincipled leadership is building up across the world he said in an address to the general assembly of the courts member countries in the hague renewed attacks on the court may well be in the offing mr al hussein has sharply criticized the divisive and racist rhetoric of several european right wing politicians last month he said that mr trump would without any doubt be a threat to global stability if the president elect stood by his campaign pledges to bar muslims from entering the united states to deport millions of undocumented immigrants and to endorse the use of torture in a world that seems increasingly adrift the turmoil yet to face humanity may be far greater than any challenge we have yet experienced mr al hussein said on wednesday we face a choice we can safeguard our societies by standing firm on the principles of justice which anchor this institution or we can cast away the moorings of law laid down to save the world from horror in announcing russias withdrawal from the treaty the russian foreign ministry said the court had failed to live up to expectations that it would serve as an impartial and authoritative arbiter of international law this week the courts top prosecutor called russias annexation of crimea an ongoing state of occupation a judgment affirmed by a united nations human rights committee which reiterated the world bodys commitment to ukraines sovereignty over the black sea peninsula the ministry cited the courts approach toward russias brief war with georgia in the court has said it would investigate possible war crimes in georgia which is a member of the court by all parties including russian armed forces an even sharper rebuke to the russian government came on monday when the courts chief prosecutor fatou bensouda said in a report that the situation within the territory of crimea and sevastopol factually amounts to an ongoing state of occupation russia has insisted that its capture of crimea was warranted by the legitimate popular vote of the crimean people in a referendum the prosecutors report also said that the information available points to russias direct military involvement in the armed conflict in eastern ukraine something that the russian authorities have denied repeatedly the russian federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of the ukrainian territory without the consent of the ukrainian government the report said russia might also be concerned about calls by western officials including secretary of state john kerry to have the court look into the bombing campaign in syria the court is the worlds first international tribunal with permanent jurisdiction to prosecute war crimes genocide crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression it was founded in when countries adopted the rome statute and began operations in the court has headquarters in the hague mr putin directed russia to sign the rome statute in but parliament did not ratify it the united states never ratified the rome statute though the obama administration has cooperated with the courts proceedings ms bensouda the chief prosecutor said this week that she was considering an investigation into allegations of war crimes torture and related treatment by american military forces and intelligence agencies in afghanistan raising the prospect of a confrontation with the trump administration given that the i c c is a relatively young institution and the norms surrounding it are not firmly entrenched the loss of american leadership on accountability for mass atrocities could be profoundly damaging said ms cronin furman the human rights lawyer vladimir frolov a scholar of international relations called russias move a symbolic gesture prompted by ms bensoudas report on crimea at the time when russia signed the rome statute in it wanted to be a part of the modern world he said now it doesnt he added that he believed that many of russias actions in syria could potentially be subject to an investigation by this court
washington the briefing materials are ready loaded into tablet computers secure internet sites or cloud computing applications officials from the white house and federal agencies are on standby waiting to meet landing teams from the president elects staff and brief them on how things really work in government the organizational charts have been meticulously mapped but eight days after president elect donald j trump won election in a stunning upset surprising even himself the process of transferring power from the obama administration to the trump administration has yet to grind into motion delayed by a series of shake ups at trump tower that have sown confusion and discord one associate of mr trumps has told people that his operation is a month behind schedule under ideal circumstances the process months in the planning by the obama administration and aides to both mr trump and his defeated opponent hillary clinton looks far different parts of it are governed by a statute president obama signed this year to streamline the transition process and ensure an early start to a task that has been compared to a giant corporate merger involving a trillion budget but for all the drama surrounding his transition to power mr trump is hardly the first president elect to preside over a disorderly takeover the transition from ronald reagan to george bush was particularly nasty because many reagan administration aides assumed wrongly as it turned out that they would be in line to keep their jobs in a government that remained in republican hands bill clintons transition in was marred by a staff shake up that upended a carefully planned process mr clinton replaced his transition chief mickey kantor who had been mr clintons campaign chairman with warren christopher who would become secretary of state it was also hobbled by mr clintons campaign promise to slash white house staff by percent which made it more difficult to manage the government and even in the transition from george w bush to mr obama that members of both parties consider a model of efficiency mr obama had to replace his head of personnel several times there is a long history of unfortunate transition activity said max stier the president and chief executive of the center for presidential transition a project run by the nonpartisan partnership for public service still he added the trump transition is different in that it appears to lack guidance from seasoned government professionals who grasp the magnitude of the bureaucracy he is about to inherit you have a president elect who has been elected on a platform of change from the outside mr stier said this is distinctive in that there is not anybody in the inner orbit who has deep understanding of the institution that trump is going to have to run a memorandum of understanding between the white house chief of staff and the leader of the president elects transition team is typically signed by both immediately after the election as was the case when mr obama was preparing to take office the document governs the terms by which the presidents staff and that of the president elect collaborate including important nondisclosure requirements for both sides and its completion unlocks the rest of the transition process gov chris christie of new jersey signed such an agreement on nov before the election result was determined but it was invalidated on friday when mr trump turned over the transition operation to vice president elect mike pence a transition spokesman said late tuesday that mr pence had signed the document but brandi hoffine a white house spokeswoman said the transition team had not yet provided the list of officials who would be participating in the process a requirement before the handover can begin within a few days of the election the landing teams are supposed to begin work at federal offices to learn about their inner workings functions and responsibilities to determine how to staff crucial positions there and to figure out how they fit in with the new administrations goals and priorities they receive briefings about the pressing issues facing the agencies and immediate tasks that the president elect must undertake on day this crucial time period in november is when the incoming presidents team typically devises plans for carrying out top policy priorities and develops a budget proposal that will be presented early the next year defining the administrations goals and laying out a pathway for achieving them as of wednesday evening nobody from mr trumps transition team had arrived at a federal agency to begin the review process according to obama administration officials the transition team typically works quickly based on plans put in place months before to recruit vet and hire the presidential appointees needed to run the government including about who will require senate confirmation presidential candidates typically pre vet hundreds of potential appointees well before the election cognizant of how quickly they must move once elected to build out their teams the obama administration which found the process cumbersome and the governments mechanisms for managing it outdated in has built a new software system for the president elect to track candidates for the appointments and process those selected according to the independent nonpartisan center for presidential transition a project of the partnership for public service the president elect should aim to select top cabinet appointees and key white house personnel before thanksgiving since the sept terrorist attacks national security preparedness has taken on outsized importance in transition planning in january the week before mr obama was inaugurated the bush administration held a war game exercise in the white house situation room simulating a series of explosions in american cities so that current national security officials could guide incoming aides on how to respond to such an attack the obama administration is planning two such exercises for mr trumps team one in december and one in january as of tuesday mr trump had dismissed two top national security officials on his transition team
what are the economic benefits and drawbacks of global trade who are the winners and losers in this story of economic change these are the questions students will consider as they learn why trade became such an important issue in the election as part of the lesson they will also consider the implications of president elect donald j trumps related campaign promises background global trade was one of the core issues mr trump returned to over and over during his presidential campaign in the end the states that effectively handed mr trump his election day victory were the rust belt states of pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin states that were predicted to vote for hillary clinton yet have been hard hit by an exodus of well paying manufacturing jobs why has mr trumps message that our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization moving our jobs our wealth and our factories to mexico and overseas resonated with so many voters why has he condemned the north american free trade agreement as the worst trade deal in history and declared that chinas entrance into the world trade organization has enabled the greatest jobs theft in history the lesson begins by having students investigate where their possessions are manufactured then they use a times video and article to help them better understand the complex consequences of increased trade further down we offer opportunities for debate and argument writing analyzing the effects of global trade abroad and doing additional research warm up what countries make the products we buy this activity can be started for homework the night before or completed entirely during class then using a computer or their phones students should find out the minimum wage and the g d p per capita of three or more countries that produced the highest number of goods for the class or their small group they should find the same information for the united states assuming the u s is not included in their list already be sure students understand what these economic terms mean after they have gathered this data students should consider any trends they notice about the countries that produce most of the goods they and their classmates identified how do wages and economic activity in these countries compare to the same categories for the united states all of this information can be recorded using this handout video the iphone economy to better understand how global trade works and the consequences of it students should watch this times video here are questions for writing and discussion how is the iphone a product of global trade how has the u s economy lost some higher wage jobs as well as a job multiplier as manufacturing has moved abroad how does comparing the united states largest employers today with those in tell a story about how the american economy has changed over the past years how does apple fit into this story what groups are the winners and losers in the american economy today according to the video why are our economic problems so hard to solve an article to read annotate and discuss more wealth more jobs but not for everyone what fuels the backlash on trade next students should read and annotate peter s goodmans in depth article more wealth more jobs but not for everyone what fuels the backlash on trade heres an excerpt from the article so you can quickly assess its reading level and get to the heart of its argument below are questions for writing and discussion the article states for generations libraries full of economics textbooks have rightly promised that global trade expands national wealth by lowering the price of goods lifting wages and amplifying growth what went wrong why was global trade such an important issue in the election for many voters the article states successive administrations in the united states led by democrats and republicans alike have embraced liberalized trade as a central component of the nations foreign policy yet only percent of american voters said trade with other countries created more jobs in the united states according to a new york times cbs news poll released in july why is there a disconnect between government trade policy by both democrats and republicans and what american voters think the consequences of increasing global trade for american workers and the american economy are complex who are the winners who are the losers and how are some groups both winners and losers the article states american factories produced more goods last year than ever by many indications yet they did so while employing about million workers roughly the same number as in when production was roughly three fourths what it is today how can this be that american factories are producing more than ever before but while employing fewer workers what is nafta what is the w t o explain how each has affected american workers and the american economy douglas a irwin an economist at dartmouth college stated we have a public policy toward trade we dont have a public policy on automation what point is he making and why is it relevant to this discussion what kind of safety net do government programs provide for workers displaced by increased global trade how does this safety net fall short in the united states activity debate discussion or argument writing is increasing global trade a force for positive or negative change or both and should the united states pursue more free trade agreements or trade protectionism as the best solution to the negative consequences of globalization after watching the video and reading the article students have enough information to support both sides in an evidence based discussion debate or argument writing piece they can also suggest policy proposals for supporting workers or businesses hurt by the changing economy for example is there anything government policy can do to raise wages and working conditions for service workers now that many manufacturing jobs have disappeared if you want

athens having warned of the risks of a trump presidency president obama returned on wednesday to a more optimistic vision of the future of the united states as part of his final international tour while in office american democracy is bigger than any one person mr obama told an audience in athens before he departed for berlin that is why we have a tradition of the outgoing president welcoming the new one as i did last week but he also acknowledged that such transfers of power were not always easy and he noted that the diversity of american society made governing a challenge as you may have noticed the next american president and i could not be more different mr obama said to a ripple of laughter mr obama took advantage of his trip to greece to make his first visit to the acropolis the ruins were a reminder that great powers even democratic ones with remarkable cultures can fall mr obama has largely spoken positively about the coming presidency of donald j trump saying in a monday news conference that the president elect had reassured him that he would remain committed to nato and that he would keep portions of mr obamas health care law on tuesday mr obama seemed to change tack warning against what he said were dangerous divisions of race religion and ethnicity we are going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of nationalism or ethnic identity or tribalism that is built around an us and a them he said on wednesday he said that even if progress follows a winding path sometimes forward sometimes back democracy is still the most effective form of government ever devised by man mr obama did acknowledge that democracy could be challenging and in multiethnic multiracial multicultural societies like the united states it can be especially complicated he said believe me i know but he said that globalization and automation which have created the most prosperous and advanced society in history were also creating extraordinary anxiety technology and automation mean that goods can be produced with fewer workers the president said it means jobs and manufacturing can move across borders where wages are lower and rights are less protected those trends have also created a global elite that seems to live by a different set of rules such as being able to avoid taxes mr obama said that kind of inequality breeds resentment he said and is among the greatest challenges to modern democracies and to the economic formula that has yielded such benefits it fuels a feeling that globalization only benefits those at the top the president said adding and if people feel that they are losing control of their future they will push back weve seen it here in greece and across europe we saw it in the vote in britain to leave the e u and now weve seen it in the united states mr obama said that remaining a connected world is still crucial but that the current path of globalization demands a course correction to ensure that the fruits of those trends will be more broadly shared standing in the stavros niarchos foundation cultural center which was bedecked with greek american and european union flags mr obama made a fervent pitch for the european union which some greeks have advocated leaving in recent years because of the costs of remaining tied to the euro european integration the european union remains one of the great political and economic achievements of human history mr obama said today more than ever the world needs a europe that is strong prosperous and democratic and he praised greece for its efforts to shelter thousands of syrian refugees like the woman here in greece who said of the refugees arriving on these shores we live under the same sun we fall in love under the same moon we are all human we have to help these people mr obama said to sustained applause women like that give me hope
washington president bashar al assad of syria condemned by the obama administration and much of the west for waging a brutal war of suppression against islamist opponents in his country said this week that president elect donald j trump could be a natural ally in the fight against terrorism the comment underscored the degree to which the new administrations approach could reverse central tenets of american foreign policy in an interview with the portuguese broadcaster rtp published on tuesday mr assad whom president obama wants removed from office welcomed the prospect that mr trump would make good on his campaign promise to focus exclusively on fighting the islamic state and to align the united states with russia a close ally of mr assads in doing so the islamic state also known as isis or isil is one of an array of moderate and extremist groups seeking to topple mr assad the statements by mr assad a leader who secretary of state john kerry has said should be investigated for war crimes along with russia highlighted both the complexity of the foreign policy challenges awaiting mr trump and the extent to which he has signaled a break from mr obamas approach especially in the middle east in syria mr trump will inherit an especially tangled set of alliances and trade offs a situation that has bedeviled mr obama in a region where the united states military is acting in support of efforts to contain or destroy the islamic state while allowing that what he called opposing forces within the administration could cast doubt on whether mr trump can deliver on his promises mr assad said that if if he fights the terrorists it is clear that we will be a natural ally together with the russians iranians and many other countries who want to defeat the terrorists his comments while cautious were the latest evidence of a growing expectation among both opponents and allies of the united states that mr trump will reverse mr obamas policy on mr assad which lays much of the blame for the syrian civil war at his feet a european diplomat said wednesday that officials in germany and britain were bracing for an american about face on mr assad and arab diplomats expressed a similar worry in an interview last week with the wall street journal mr trump signaled as much suggesting that once he took office he would drop american support for certain syrian opposition groups that have been fighting both the islamic state and the assad government and focus solely on bombing the islamic state my attitude was youre fighting syria syria is fighting isis and you have to get rid of isis mr trump said but foreign policy experts both republican and democratic say such a move will probably leave the new president with a very different problem deciding how to finesse the battleground of the syrian civil war which will still be going on without putting back in place all of the factors that led to the rise of the islamic state in the first place the islamic state is in retreat regardless of mr trump the american backed campaign to retake the last islamic state stronghold in iraq the city of mosul is well underway in syria the american led coalition has been gaining ground on the islamic states stronghold of raqqa while raqqa may not be retaken by jan when mr trump is sworn in pentagon officials say that mosul probably will be and that raqqa could fall not long afterward but the battleground defeat of the islamic state is almost the easy part mr trumps administration will then have to confront hard choices on the other war in syria namely balancing the competing forces of traditional american opponents syria russia and iran with traditional american allies these include turkey a nato ally and the sunni arab countries like saudi arabia and the united arab emirates who want to arm and bolster groups opposed to the syrian government mr assad russia and iran are fighting not only the islamic state but also any syrian groups opposed to the government including those backed by the united states and the sunni arab countries if mr trump abandons that alliance for the russia syria iran axis he will effectively be strengthening mr assads government that is the same government whose repressive anti sunni policies are blamed by american european and arab governments for fueling the rise of the islamic state and other extremist groups to begin with you might win the battle against isis in raqqa but you cant win the overall counterterrorism war and achieve a favorable balance in the middle east unless its linked to addressing the civil war with assad said michael g vickers a former top pentagon official aligning with russia and implicitly with assad and the iranians would be a strategic blunder with our sunni allies some syrian rebel groups long frustrated that the obama administration has not given them greater military support say they are bracing for a complete cessation of american aid but they express hope that allies like saudi arabia and turkey will continue to supply them even in defiance of the trump administration emile hokayem a scholar at the international institute for strategic studies said mr assad had long calculated that over time western countries would either adopt his view that the rebels were all radicalized jihadists or prioritize fighting terrorist groups over support for the moderate forces challenging mr assads rule this was a waiting game par excellence one perfected by his father and now him and one that seems to be paying off give up nothing feed and survive the chaos and wait for the others to cave or rethink mr hokayem said in an interview mr trumps expressed fondness for deal making could open the door for the return to the united states of austin tice a journalist and former marine officer who disappeared in syria in mr tice is believed
as negotiators meet in morocco to hammer out details of the landmark global climate change accord reached in paris almost a year ago the independent international energy agency warned that the nearly nation deal was too weak to meet its avowed temperature target the i e a s annual world energy outlook stated that reaching the paris targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was possible and that meeting those targets would slow climate change yet the agencys estimates also showed that the result of those reductions was not likely to keep the temperature increase beyond preindustrial levels well below degrees celsius as hoped instead the reports authors estimated meeting the national commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions would still allow temperatures to rise degrees celsius by meeting the most ambitious temperature goal discussed at the conference would be next to impossible the report stated the transformation required for a reasonable chance of remaining within the temperature goal of degrees celsius is stark a shifting mix of energy sources that favors renewable energy and more efficient energy use are putting those targets within reach the annual report of the international energy agency based in paris noted that renewable energy was booming with more capacity added in than for coal oil and nuclear power combined still fossil fuels will have a substantial role to play in the global energy mix for many years to come especially natural gas which is rapidly displacing coal the era of fossil fuels is far from being over even if the paris pledges are fully implemented said fatih birol executive director of the agency today he said the share of fossil fuels in the global energy mix is about percent if paris goals are met the share will drop only to percent by this is in part because even though renewable energy sources are finding their way into electricity generation oil is still an important source of power for transportation and petrochemical production still there are winners and losers within fossil fuels dr birol said the biggest winner worldwide in the groups projections is natural gas and the biggest loser is coal china the worlds largest coal producer and user has been pulling back and appears to have reached the peak of its coal use in dr birol declined to discuss the effect on the groups projections of the election of donald j trump who has called climate change a hoax and pledged to abandon the paris deal and to promote a revival of coal we are a technical organization dr birol said governments come and go around the world and this is a perfectly normal thing he said the group would be watching the actual policies and actions that emerge from the trump administration since these changes may have global implications once the policies do emerge we will include them in future reports dr birol said the report predicted that by percent of the new energy generated to meet global demand would come from natural gas and renewable sources like solar and wind power a push to use energy more efficiently is expected to help in the fight against climate change dr birol said citing predictions that world energy use is expected to rise more slowly than in the past even in the face of continued economic growth tim buckley an analyst with the institute for energy economics and financial analysis a progressive research organization based in cleveland said that the decline of coal and the explosion in low cost renewable energy provided a simple lesson those who exit fossil fuels and embrace solar and wind will reap financial rewards and avoid stranded assets stranded assets is a term applied to fossil fuel reserves such as oil coal and natural gas that are still in the ground in many scenarios of addressing climate change companies would not be able to exploit their reserves oil companies like exxon mobil have disputed the issue the new report states that unless governments work hard to address the issue for a smooth and orderly transition away from fossil fuels there is a risk that major losses will be incurred

lod israel it would be easy to miss the mosque in a temporary building with a concrete floor and corrugated roof but it is impossible to miss the constellation of six loudspeakers atop a giant metal structure resembling the eiffel tower five times a day starting well before dawn these loudspeakers broadcast the muezzins call to prayer in lod a city of arabs and jews near ben gurion international airport and therein lies one more friction point in a country full of them one groups expression of faith is anothers noise pollution and israels government is planning a crackdown a proposal backed by prime minister benjamin netanyahu and initially endorsed this week by his ministers would authorize the government to ban the use of loudspeakers by mosques and other houses of worship across israel for many on both sides of the nations sectarian line few questions could prove more provocative than whether the muezzin should be muzzled the call to prayer is a symbol of islam said adel elfar the imam of the lod mosque one of several that have been controversial here this is something thats existed for years he said that he could hear bells from a christian church in town and that jewish residents drove around the city every couple of months broadcasting from loudspeakers on their vehicles the call of every religion if you get rid of extremism shouldnt bother anybody he added and yet it does among those bothered is lods mayor yair revivo who is jewish and announced last month that the city would broadcast the shema a central prayer that begins hear o israel to counter the mosques call the first of islams five daily prayers begins before dawn noted col motti yogev a member of parliament who introduced the new ban the goal of the law is to prevent peoples sleep from being disturbed he said we have no desire to harm the prayer of the muslims the fight over the muezzin underscores a fundamental societal challenge for israel beyond its conflict with palestinians living in gaza or the occupied west bank about percent of israels citizens are arabs and cities like lod where about a third of the nearly residents are arab perennially struggle to find a comfortable balance the conflict has also grown in jerusalem which is divided between largely jewish and arab communities the proposed ban approved on sunday by mr netanyahus ministers and sent to parliament has drawn denunciations from jordan and the palestinian authority in a sign of the complexity of the issue it drew surprise opposition on tuesday from israels ultra orthodox health minister yaakov litzman who temporarily blocked parliamentary debate and sent the issue back to the ministers because it might also affect the use of sirens to announce the beginning of the jewish sabbath ahmad tibi a leader of the arab members of the israeli parliament or knesset said mr netanyahu was inflaming anti muslim sentiments if the muezzin law passes the knesset i call on the arab public in israel to rise up i call for a civil popular uprising he told a lebanese television outlet all muslims must be called to protect mosques to defend the calls from the mosques amnon beeri sulitzeanu of the abraham fund initiatives a nonprofit organization that promotes coexistence between jews and arabs said the proposal conflicted with mr netanyahus recent drive to increase investment in arab communities to reduce gaps in educational and economic opportunities you see those two conflicting trends yet again which basically tells me that the israeli establishment still hasnt made up its mind in regard to its arab citizens he said what do we want from the arab palestinian minority do we want to really integrate it and include it as an integrated part of israeli society the text of the proposed ban on mosque loudspeakers says that hundreds of thousands of citizens in parts of israel suffer habitually and daily from loud and unreasonable noise that is caused by the call of muezzin from mosques colonel yogev said it could be narrowed to apply only to sleeping hours mr netanyahu has said he is trying to balance competing interests israel is committed to freedom for all religions but is also responsible for protecting citizens from noise he said this week in lod which traces its history to the days of canaan frustration over the mosques has grown as more jewish residents have moved in since the evacuation of settlements in gaza a decade ago there is already a noise law on the books but advocates of the new legislation said it was not applied to the muezzin if someone is having a karaoke party with loudspeakers at night and you call the police they will come and take down the loudspeakers said amichai langfeld a member of the city council but if you call about the mosque they wont under existing law mr langfeld added the police must test the level of the call to prayer or of any noise to see if it exceeded the limit the new law would simply ban loudspeakers at mr elfars mosque the call to prayer was broadcast on tuesday at a m a m p m p m and p m the tension over the loudspeakers was easy to detect in a visit to a clothes and jewelry market a few blocks away several jewish shoppers and salespeople said that they did not mind the call during daylight hours but that the earliest one invariably woke them up some described trying to muffle the noise with curtains or blankets often to little effect naama reichmann who moved to lod about five years ago said the a m call made it hard for her and her year old daughter to sleep through the night we dont say they cant do it but not so loud she said chaim koti who was selling clothes was more pointed they do it intentionally loud in order to bother
washington congressional republicans are settling in for what they hope is a long run in the majority but president elect donald j trump doesnt want them to get too comfortable were going to put on term limits which a lot of people arent happy about but were putting on term limits mr trump said in an interview with minutes that aired on sunday were doing a lot of things to clean up the system if one thing could put mr trump on a collision course with his new allies on capitol hill it is his embrace of proposals such as term limits and tougher restrictions on allowing lawmakers and top aides to become lobbyists in the lucrative world of washington influence peddling members of congress like to talk about returning power to the people but many would prefer not to vote to limit their own tenure or future employment opportunities bringing up term limits is seen by some as raining on their postelection parade senator mitch mcconnell republican of kentucky and the majority leader made that quite clear last week when he said the senate outlook for term limits was severely limited i would say we have term limits now mr mcconnell told reporters theyre called elections and it will not be on the agenda in the senate still mr trumps highlighting of his call for term limits it is no on his list of priorities to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in washington d c revives an initiative that has been dormant in washington for years after republicans rode it to the house takeover in but then failed to make it happen mr trump found a surprising kindred spirit on term limits on monday when president obama seemed to endorse the concept i think we want to see new voices and new ideas emerge mr obama said at a news conference thats part of the reason why i think term limits are a really useful thing aides said later that mr obama might have been referring more to the limit on presidential tenure and his view that george washington set the right precedent by leaving after two terms but his words could certainly be extended to congress proponents of term limits say mr trumps position has put new energy behind the campaign to adopt a constitutional amendment restricting house members to three two year terms and senators to two six year terms the other part of the pressure is going to come from the public said nick tomboulides the executive director of the group u s term limits when they know term limits is an issue on the table they will make it very difficult for congress to ignore i think congress is going to be forced to vote on it term limits have always been popular with voters and got a surge of momentum in the throw the bums out political atmosphere of the early leading multiple states to adopt them for their legislatures through ballot initiatives and other means as part of the contract with america in republicans led by representative newt gingrich of georgia promised the citizen legislature act and a first ever vote on term limits to replace career politicians with citizen legislators the mantra helped them topple speaker thomas s foley of washington a staunch opponent of term limits via a challenger george nethercutt who promised to serve just six years that term limits vote did come in march and won a majority but fell more than votes short of the two thirds majority necessary to advance a constitutional amendment forty republicans many of them committee and subcommittee chairmen joined democratic opponents in defeating the proposal the amendment again fell short a year later opponents argued then and argue now that arbitrary term limits would rob congress of the institutional knowledge and expertise needed to conduct business and that voters had regular opportunities to end the service of their lawmakers they dont talk about how gerrymandering and the advantages of incumbency make it hard to defeat sitting lawmakers whether the proposal can go anywhere this year will depend on how serious mr trump and his advisers are about pushing it against the wishes of congressional leaders or whether it was just part of his message to stir up frustrated voters at this point it is impossible to say but it was a primary element of his call to drain the swamp that appeared to resonate with the public and term limits are just one issue conservatives also are raising the alarm about a move by house republicans to restore congressional earmarks special home state spending as long as they are directed to a government agency rather than a private interest a source of corruption in the past some lawmakers have argued that restoring the ability of individual lawmakers to earmark money would make it easier to pass spending bills but critics are moving quickly to quash any effort to bring them back with the earmark proposal on the verge of being adopted by republicans on wednesday speaker paul d ryan called off the vote fearing it would send a bad signal so soon after the election he promised a review of the idea and a vote early next year like other self professed outsiders before him mr trump will discover that draining the swamp is much easier said than done

there were shouts and moans and finger snaps at a weekend performance of party people at the public theater tears and laughter joined together so did sympathy and rage commissioned by the oregon shakespeare festival for its american revolutions cycle developed by the director liesl tommy and written by the spoken word collective universes this semidocumentary work is a disjointed exploration of two radical groups the black panther party and the young lords party in the current political climate it may be the most frightening and exciting piece of theater now up party people begins as a young african american man in a beret malik who also uses the name mk ultra bluffs a tough speech for a camera hes a contemporary artist riffing on the macho bravado of the panthers an organization to which his father now serving a life sentence once belonged malik and his latino friend jimmy whose alter ego is a clown provocateur named primo have conducted numerous interviews with former party members and spliced them into a video those members will soon gather at a gallery to watch it once the former revolutionaries assemble the evening segues into reminiscences interspersed with musical numbers and occasional goading from primo who sports an acid house court jester ensemble there are tributes and apologies rants and infighting and a mildly bizarre self reflexive section in which a character sits down next to a spectator and says i dont know how i feel about anything i saw tonight i liked some of it i hated some of it party people written by the spouses steven sapp and mildred ruiz sapp and by mr ruiz derives its language vibrant and volatile from actual interviews yet the storytelling is less than cohesive like most parties political or festive this piece has a slow beginning a terrific middle and an ambiguous ending conflicting impulses shift party people toward drama at some moments toward history lesson at others toward agitprop occasionally it is too long too unfocused and perhaps too democratic with nearly every character receiving his or her spoken word aria yet in a room full of people distraught and enraged by the election of donald j trump to the presidency party people felt heartbreakingly timely and intensely necessary many in the audience had visceral responses to the piece which asked them to confront a century history of civil disobedience and to then contemplate what resistance they might offer in the seen one way the two parties here failed the work of the panthers did not end police brutality or obviate the need for black lives matter the efforts of the young lords did not give puerto rico self determination the collectives disbanded berets went out of style but viewed another way these groups demonstrated that small bands of citizens using a variety of methods some troubling could have a striking impact on politics and culture they could get garbage collected and children fed and sick people treated they could make young men and women feel pride and power in their ethnicity and inheritance achievements malik and jimmy admire they were working so hard at such a young age makes me feel so inadequate jimmy says makes me wonder what i would be doing if i were alive back then malik says or what he might do now
before this month new balance was lucky if it generated a few hundred reactions to posts on its facebook page now the sneaker companys page is flooded with impassioned commentary and it has found itself compelled to make a statement distancing itself from white supremacists it started when matt lebretton the companys vice president for communications told the wall street journal last week that we feel things are going to move in the right direction under donald j trump mr lebrettons comments were made in the context of mr trumps opposition to the trans pacific partnership a trade deal that new balance says will hurt its production of shoes in the united states while rewarding competitors that make more of their products overseas some consumers however saw that comment as a full throated endorsement of mr trump and reacted immediately circulating images that showed new balance shoes being burned or thrown in the trash that led the brand to clarify its position through a statement in which it noted that it publicly supported the trade positions of hillary clinton bernie sanders and donald trump prior to election day that focused on american manufacturing job creation it also posted a statement to facebook saying from the people who make our shoes to the people who wear them we believe in acting with the utmost integrity and we welcome all walks of life but that was only the start over the weekend the daily stormer a website rife with anti semitic anti gay hate speech and white supremacist language derided the complaints and championed new balance as the official shoes of white people encouraging readers to buy them the ensuing support from white supremacists and other members of what is known as the alt right led new balance to distance itself from such commentary and address the nature of its remark about mr trump new balance based in boston wrote on its twitter and facebook pages on monday night that it does not tolerate bigotry or hate in any form and that a recent comment about trade policy was taken out of context it added as a year old company with five factories in the u s and thousands of employees worldwide from all races genders cultures and sexual orientations new balance is a values driven organization and culture that believes in humanity integrity community and mutual respect for people around the world on facebook the post has attracted more than reactions and hundreds of comments some lauding the company and others from supporters and detractors of mr trump criticizing its response the company did not immediately respond to requests for comment on tuesday the daily stormer responded with a claim that new balances denouncement was a hoax in a post on tuesday that turned into an anti semitic rant
two nights after donald j trump won the presidential election archbishop jos h gomez convened an interfaith prayer service at the roman catholic cathedral in los angeles and gave an emotional homily vowing not to abandon children and parents who are living in fear that mr trump will follow through on his promise to deport millions of immigrants this should not be happening in america said archbishop gomez who is himself an immigrant from mexico and a naturalized united states citizen we are not this kind of people we are better than this five days later on tuesday archbishop gomez was elected by his brother bishops at their meeting in baltimore to be vice president of the united states conference of catholic bishops with nine candidates in the running including some prominent prelates it was the days most closely watched vote especially since the vice president is traditionally elevated to president in three years keeping to custom the bishops voted to bump up cardinal daniel n dinardo archbishop of galveston houston to president the choice of archbishop gomez was only one sign that catholic bishops are preparing to defend immigrants and refugees against a newly elected president who has threatened deportations and who critics say has uncorked an ugly backlash against immigrants and minorities they opened their meeting by endorsing a strongly worded letter to mr trump that extended congratulations but also put him on notice that the church was committed to resettling refugees and keeping immigrant families intact a lot of bishops told me they were surprised by the actual fear they were hearing on the ground said dylan corbett the executive director of the hope border institute an advocacy group on united states mexico border issues he formerly worked for the bishops conference and attended the meeting in baltimore in the past week latino parishioners and students at catholic colleges have been turning to the church calling their pastors and pastors are calling their bishops and asking what to expect mr corbett said the bishops wanted to send a clear message of solidarity on many other priorities the bishops may find common cause with mr trump they are eager to see him follow through with campaign promises to end or limit abortion reverse the contraception mandate in the affordable care act and create exemptions for religious people and institutions objecting to same sex marriage however the protection of immigrants is not only a biblical imperative for catholic leaders but also a matter of pastoral care more than one third of american catholics are now latinos and many others are immigrants from dozens of other countries latinos represent the future of the church sixty percent of catholics in the united states younger than are latino and percent of them were born here the bishops of the united states recognize the presence of latinos in our community in our country and also in the church archbishop gomez said of his election at a news conference in baltimore i think our mission is to help people be united in our country and have hope archbishop gomez is in line to become the first latino president of the bishops conference he was appointed to lead the los angeles archdiocese the largest in the nation in by pope benedict xvi who preceded pope francis the archbishop is a member of the catholic group opus dei and is seen as a conservative on doctrine it surprised many church observers when pope francis recently passed over archbishop gomez in naming new cardinals three from the united states because los angeles is usually a cardinals seat beginning in january catholic dioceses are undertaking a nearly two year initiative to reach out to hispanic catholics and better integrate them into the church pope francis the first pope from latin america applauded the effort in a video message to the bishops suggesting that it could have a broader impact for a society gripped by disconcerting social cultural and spiritual shifts and increasing polarization the election starkly revealed the polarization not only within the country but also within the church white catholics preferred mr trump over hillary clinton percent to percent while hispanic catholics favored mrs clinton over mr trump percent to percent according to an analysis by the pew research center the catholic church is the largest in the country with million members and about percent of the electorate
the house of representatives voted overwhelmingly on tuesday for legislation to extend american sanctions on iran for years a move that proponents called critical economic leverage to ensure iranian compliance with an international nuclear agreement the legislation known as the iran sanctions extension act needs senate approval and president obamas signature before the end of the year when american sanctions are set to expire under the nuclear agreement which took effect in january between iran and six world powers including the united states many economic sanctions were suspended or relaxed in exchange for irans verifiable pledges of peaceful nuclear work but the deal also contained a snapback provision that would allow for the reimposition of sanctions if iran were found to have violated the terms the legislation approved by the house on tuesday would also extend longstanding american sanctions against iran that predate the dispute over that countrys nuclear activities iran has increasingly complained about these non nuclear sanctions particularly the prohibition on iranian access to the american financial system and use of the dollar the iranians say such restrictions have discouraged many foreign companies from investing in iran subverting the economic rewards it expected from the nuclear agreement republicans and many democrats opposed the agreement asserting that iran was untrustworthy and had gained too many concessions during the negotiations president elect donald j trump said during his campaign that he would renegotiate the accord or renounce it in a march speech to the american israel public affairs committee the most powerful pro israel lobby group in washington he said his top priority was to dismantle the disastrous deal with iran whether he will follow through on that pledge remains unclear the other countries that agreed to the deal with iran britain china france germany and russia have said they intend to honor it president franois hollande of france said on tuesday that he did not believe mr trump would scrap the agreement telling the france television channel that the absence of an accord would be very serious iranian leaders reacting to mr trumps victory have also asserted that he will not be able to undo the agreement president hassan rouhani of iran told his cabinet ministers the day after the american election that the agreement cannot be overturned by one governments decision according to the official islamic republic news agency on monday national security experts including former officials of republican and democratic administrations exhorted mr trump not only to accept the nuclear agreement but to use it as a way to ease tensions with iran on other longstanding problems
dozens of major regulations passed recently by the obama administration including far reaching changes on health care consumer protections and environmental safety could be undone with the stroke of a pen by donald j trump and the republican controlled congress starting in january thanks to a little used law that dates back to and it comes with a scorched earth kicker if the law is used to strike down a rule the federal agency that issued it is barred from enacting similar regulation again in the future the obscure law called the congressional review act was passed years ago at the behest of newt gingrich then the house speaker and now a member of mr trumps transition team it gives congress legislative days to review and override major regulations enacted by federal agencies in the senate the vote would not be subject to filibuster the president can veto the rejection which usually renders the law toothless but when one party controls both the white house and congress it can be a powerful legislative weapon so far it has only been successfully used once in a republican congress invoked it to eliminate workplace safety regulations adopted in the final months of president clintons tenure president george w bush signed the repeal two months after his inauguration wiping out stricter ergonomics rules that had been years in the making on jan when mr trump takes office with a republican controlled congress one that has indicated its zeal for undoing president obamas doings more than rules adopted since late may are potentially vulnerable to the ax according to an analysis by the george washington university regulatory studies center it allows the election results to be applied almost retroactively to snip off activity that happened at the end of the last administration said adam levitin a law professor at georgetown the regulations at risk include many environmental mandates including limits on formaldehyde use and stricter truck fuel efficiency rules a food and drug administration ban on the sale of antibacterial soaps a requirement that federal contractors provide paid sick leave for their workers stricter consumer protections on prepaid debit cards federal loan forgiveness for students at schools that shut down a rule that bars nursing homes that receive federal funding from requiring residents to resolve all disputes through arbitration rather than in court under speaker paul d ryans leadership the house has used the law several times to try to reject a number of the obama administrations policies those challenges were symbolic president obama vetoed every one that reached his desk but president elect trump can approve any sent to him after he takes office mr ryans office did not respond to requests for comment i dont think theyll go after every single rule but i think youll get eight to that may be targeted said sam batkins the director of regulatory policy at the american action forum a right leaning group that has been tracking which regulations are subject to congressional review the threat posed by the law may slow the usual rush of midnight regulations that administrations typically race to finish in their final days this year it will be a high stakes game of chicken put out a rule and hope it survives or hold off to preserve the chance to revisit it in the future i would imagine there will be a serious discussion about regulations that they were planning to finalize said susan e dudley the director of the george washington university regulatory studies center the bluntness of the c r a may be exactly what makes it appealing to the next congress and president the labor department has never tried to revive the rule that president bush struck down because this has only been done once before theres no litigation history said stuart shapiro a rutgers professor of public policy who previously worked at the office of information and regulatory affairs the unit that coordinates reviews of executive branch regulations it wipes the rule out for quite a while at the very least he said we dont know what would happen if an agency eventually decided to go back and try again because congress takes so many breaks legislative days stretches out for many calendar months the congressional research service estimates that the review deadline for the obama administrations rules will fall at the end of may based on the planned schedule for the rest of this year adjourning early would buy congress some extra days when the new congress convenes the clock resets and lawmakers have additional time to review eligible rules some republican lawmakers are eager to slash where they can on tuesday the interior department issued a new regulation designed to control emissions of methane a powerful greenhouse gas from oil and natural gas wells on federal and indian tribal lands it is a relatively small part of a larger set of regulations that the obama administration has been rolling out to prevent inadvertent leaks from wells processing plants and pipelines with a few exceptions the oil and gas industry has opposed the regulations as unnecessarily costly senator jim inhofe republican of oklahoma fired off a scathing statement congress has many tools with which to rescind this rule and i look forward to working with the incoming trump administration to ensure economic expansion prevails over misguided bureaucratic interference he said daisy letendre mr inhofes communications director said the congressional review act was one of those tools to which he referred
following the election last week of donald j trump as the next president of the united states the turkish government thinks that the united states isnt the safest travel destination for its citizens the turkish ministry of foreign affairs posted a travel warning saturday on its website citing the protests that erupted in several cities immediately after the election including new york miami los angeles and seattle the statement was issued only in turkish said aydan karamanoglu a spokesman for the turkish embassy in washington d c and made no mention of mr trump it did say that the demonstrations occasionally become violent and that the united states has seen an increase in anti foreign and racist physical attacks and harassment the statement advised turkish citizens to take increased security measures and be cautious in the cities where the protests are occurring turkey is the latest of several countries that have issued warnings against travel to the united states this year for reasons that range from zika to police shootings the trend is unprecedented said george taylor the vice president of global operations for ijet international a travel intelligence firm based in annapolis md there are more travel warnings to the united states recently than there have been in the past he said this warning is a turning of tables for the united states following the series of terrorist attacks in turkey over the last year the u s department of state has issued numerous warnings to its citizens against traveling to turkey in the most recent advisory updated on oct it said u s citizens should avoid travel to southeast turkey and carefully consider the risks of travel to and throughout the country the u s department of state is updating this travel warning to reflect the october decision to order the departure of family members of employees posted to the u s consulate general in istanbul turkey the department of state made this decision based on security information indicating extremist groups are continuing aggressive efforts to attack u s citizens in areas of istanbul where they reside or frequent turkeys warning may be in part retaliation for this strong statement mr taylor said we came down pretty hard on turkey after their terrorist attacks and attempted coup and this is a little bit of tit for tat he said but while tourism to turkey from the united states has decreased since the terrorist attacks there over percent fewer american tourists visited turkey in the first five months of this year compared with the same period last year according to the turkish culture and tourism office in new york city mr taylor said that the warning from turkey is unlikely to result in a dramatic decline of turkish citizens coming to the united states tourism from turkey might be impacted in the cities where the protests are happening in the u s but only a little and i dont think business travel will be affected he said in turkey some residents said that the warning wasnt big news bike gursel the chairman of marmara hotels a chain of five hotels in turkey and two in new york lives in istanbul and said that while locals were aware of the advisory it wasnt necessarily top of mind we have had press about the warning and know about the protests in america but its not the most important news in turkey right now she said warnings from other countries about traveling to the united states include one in april when the british foreign service office advised gay lesbian bisexual and transgender britons to be cautious if they were traveling to north carolina or mississippi because of the anti l g b t laws in both states and in early july following the shooting at a gay nightclub in orlando fla that left people dead and a racially fueled shooting in dallas that left five police officers dead the bahamas advised its young male citizens traveling to the united states to be especially cautious when interacting with police the ministry of foreign affairs and immigration has taken note of the recent tensions in some american cities over shootings of young black males by police officers the statement reads we wish to advise all bahamians traveling to the us but especially to the affected cities to exercise appropriate caution generally also several countries including canada and the united kingdom have advised pregnant women as well as women who plan to get pregnant against traveling to zika affected areas in the united states specifically certain parts of florida despite these specific warnings travel warnings generally are not cause for concern said tim horner the head of the security risk management practice at the security firm kroll at any given time there are hundreds of travel advisories around the world related to personal safety health risks and the weather theyre meant to keep travelers informed not scare them he said
a federal program meant to encourage investment in the united states from wealthy foreigners is increasingly supporting large luxury real estate projects not the development in the rural and downtrodden districts that some say were the original targets of the program with billions of dollars flowing in mostly from wealthy chinese the program faces an uncertain future in september congress reset the expiration date on parts of the so called eb program to dec the program grants permanent residency in the united states to those who are willing to immigrate and invest in a business that creates at least jobs many of the projects that have received money have been in real estate though investments have also gone to charter schools medical centers and manufacturing plants some billion of investments have been made through the program since according to the eb coalition an industry group in washington critics have derided the program as essentially a legal way for immigrants to buy their way into the country donald j trumps election adds a new wrinkle he campaigned heavily on immigration reform pledging to build a wall on the mexican border and increase the deportation of criminal noncitizens he also said he wanted to reduce legal immigration and ensure jobs are offered to americans first whether president elect trump will actually follow through on these pledges remains to be seen said stephen w yale loehr a law professor at cornell university and an immigration lawyer it is always difficult for congress to enact significant immigration changes because immigration is so complex and controversial the united states is not alone in offering residence for investment germany australia and canada have versions of the program as do several small countries competition among caribbean nations is rising for their citizenship by investment programs with st lucia being the most recent to revamp its program foreign interest is growing according to an analysis by professors at new york university investments in the program are increasingly financing large scale luxury or entertainment oriented real estate developments among them nearly billion gathered in the last year from investors to build a chinese style casino in las vegas million from investors for new yorks mixed use hudson yards project and million from investors to construct the beverly hills waldorf astoria the program was intended to reward people for putting money into the united states projects that raised more than billion were practically nonexistent in the program before prof jeanne calderon of new york universitys stern school of business wrote in a march report on the program but when banks turned off the credit spigot around the financial crisis developers started getting more creative in finding alternative financing n y u tracks projects across the united states that have raised more than billion from foreign investors many of these projects are run by large commercial developers who could proceed without any foreign investment but are reaching out to foreign investors for cheaper financing than they would receive from banks reformers from both political parties are calling for a much tighter definition of the areas eligible for investment through the program to remove the tracts in prosperous urban areas and get money to underserved ones they are also looking at raising the investment minimum to in addition they hope to make the projects more accountable by requiring better disclosures to protect potentially vulnerable immigrants from fraudulent schemes federal securities regulators have filed several enforcement actions against people committing fraud through the program in recent years the issue has friends and foes on either side of the political aisle senators from rural parts of the country want more development dollars coming to their districts while those from large cities want to maintain the status quo as for the immigrants themselves they are entering the program mostly in an effort to gain permanent residency in the united states which gives project developers more power like so many things there are a lot of people who are adversely affected but only by a little and there are a very small group of developers who benefit they win said david north a fellow at the center for immigration studies in washington the beverly hills waldorf astoria is being developed by beny alagem an israeli born american entrepreneur who also owns the beverly hilton it has nine acres and stories and includes a hotel and a residential condominium tower three hundred investors contributed million to the project in the form of a loan it is estimated to create jobs the wanda group which is the largest commercial developer in china and is owned by the nations richest man is said to be seeking foreign investment program financing for its wanda vista hotel in chicago the city approved the project last november the wanda group is also developing one beverly hills hotel next to the new waldorf in that city the genting group a global development conglomerate based in malaysia is developing resorts world las vegas with nearly billion of program money the billion project includes rooms and square feet of gambling space restaurants shops a panda habitat and a seat theater jeffrey berkowitz is developing skyrise miami a square foot multipurpose entertainment complex and observation tower along biscayne bay that will be the citys highest building when completed foreign program investors are contributing percent of the financing through a million loan about investors are involved in the project which is expected to create more than jobs and foreign program investors put up million for empire outlets a mall and hotel complex planned for staten island goldman sachs is a partner in the project which aims to create jobs all of this investing has created a backlog of uncertain futures currently petitions are pending with the citizenship and immigration services which is directed under the department of homeland security

from the start the central enigma was donald j trump how did this loose lipped celebrity tycoon with no political experience get so far who were the americans supporting him and why when i started my unusual assignment of covering the american presidential campaign from the perspective of a foreign correspondent for this an american news organization one of the first things i did was to invite questions from international readers the bulk of them revolved around mr trump whose unorthodox romp through the republican primaries propelled him to the partys nomination and ultimately to the presidency going back through my monthslong journey across america there were many clues to mr trumps rising tide although not all were easy to read i drank with trump supporters in bars and casinos i approached them at rodeos i chatted with them at gun clubs and diners and roaring political rallies the broad topography of trump country is in many respects easy to trace it is a place of anger and frustration gripped by a feverish anti establishment sentiment people wanted change and a chance to raise a throbbing finger to the forces they blame for their lot in life yet other factors were at play too in this unruly insurgency factors that sometimes made it hard to see clearly racism xenophobia bigotry talk radio social media bubbles and a simmering culture war separating thriving coastal areas and the wounded interior of the country it wasnt always clear which elements were powering the trump train as the movement called itself and which were being buoyed along one of my first stops was williamson a decimated coal town in west virginia it had a sports bar which offered beer for on thursdays and a biker bar where it was said patrons sometimes squealed tires inside until the room filled with smoke both were filled with trump voters little surprise since he had promised to reopen coal mines shuttered by the obama administrations environmental regulations and cheap natural gas in williamson i also saw how mr trumps message about change was overshadowing other issues that many analysts thought would have disqualified him from winning over the social conservatives who have long been a core republican constituency in conversations after church on sunday many christians glossed over the candidates three marriages and boasts of his battle with sexually transmitted disease it was hard to square but perhaps that was the lesson that a mysterious alchemy was at work in this election one in which outrageous rule breaking might offer a route to success around that time apple released its seventh iteration of the iphone that glossy black totem of progress inscribed on the back of every iphone are the words designed in california assembled in china as if california is a separate country and thats how many in trump country saw it that instead of being part of the iphone economy they were living in a land that sent jobs overseas one thing that i like many europeans and other foreigners had long seen as distinguishing the united states was its restless optimism and innate self belief mr trump though traded on pessimism his slogan make america great again embodied a nativist vision that aimed to restore pride in the countrys military and business but also scapegoated immigrants minorities and muslims at mr trumps rallies most of the faces in the crowd were white people flew confederate flags they spoke impatiently about the blacks broad brush prejudice toward muslims was openly expressed danny popma a factory owner in michigan told me that children in dearborn which has the countrys largest percentage of muslims had stayed home from school in droves on sept because they had secretly received advanced warnings of the attacks the atmosphere at trump rallies was permissive if someone said something offensive or loutish there was little fear of being hushed or contradicted yet in another confounding twist a significant minority of trump supporters were minorities themselves i met people who defied neat categorization a black woman in her who worked at a record label in miami a japanese uber driver in las vegas a guyanese doorman in queens n y at a rally in the campaigns final week in michigan a rust belt state that would prove central to mr trumps victory i saw how the candidate connected with crowd when he spoke it was if he held an invisible tuning fork held to his ear listening for the smallest murmur of applause which he would seize upon and amplify it reminded me of powerful preachers and populist politicians id seen during my years based in pakistan what was hard to know was how far the electric energy inside this hall was radiating maybe these were just the hard core loyalists state by state polls suggested that mr trump was behind in many places critical to electoral college victory political professionals including republicans dismissed the notion that mr trump could win mainly by consolidating the support of white voters its like the hunt for the lost tribes of the amazon was how stuart stevens a consultant who had worked for the republican nominee mitt romney put it early on if you paddle your canoe far enough up the river and bang your drum hard enough they will come to the riverbank but theyre just not there but when i mentioned the polls showing mr trump lagging to his supporters they snorted derisively everyone they knew was voting trump colleagues relatives children some were former democrats others were people who hadnt voted for decades the polls they said were either asking the wrong questions or were being manipulated by the news media the polls themselves were part of the system these people were trying to overthrow at the time i discounted the conspiratorial talk as a product of the facebook echo chamber that became so powerful in this election but in broad terms the trump supporters were right in key states their votes were

scott base antarctica a group of hikers in red parkas approached a half dozen seals resting on floating sea ice the leader of the entourage secretary of state john kerry raised his arms and ordered everyone to halt as an ethereal silence descended mr kerry cocked his head in the stillness of one of the worlds last truly wild places in that moment the frozen landscape seemed timeless but it is actually in grave peril as mr kerry had been told by scientists only minutes before the ice across large parts of west antarctica may be starting to disintegrate because of global warming and if it goes the worlds coastal cities face destruction too the presence of mr kerry the highest ranking united states government official ever to visit antarctica lifted the morale of scientists working to understand the icebound continent yet the visit at the end of last week was shadowed by anxiety in his nearly four years as secretary of state mr kerry has hurled himself into conservation issues making them a central focus of american diplomacy and winning a string of ambitious deals to limit global warming and protect the oceans but with last weeks election results the prospect looms that donald j trump will rip up the obama administrations work and throw global efforts against climate change into confusion mr kerry and the aides traveling with him to antarctica many of them young liberal democrats were not expecting mr trump to win the trip began a day before the election and mr kerry had confidently predicted a hillary clinton victory he was flying over the south pacific toward new zealand the next day when the results began to come in his aides rushed around the plane shocked at some of the states mrs clinton was losing the results were not definitive until he was in his hotel room that night in christchurch in an interview the next evening and in a series of chats on the trip mr kerry trod carefully declining to offer any direct criticism of mr trump he and his aides plan to welcome the trump appointees who will soon run the state department hoping to build relationships with them and possibly persuade them to keep some of mr kerrys diplomatic deals but mr kerry also made clear that when he leaves office jan he will rejoin the political struggle over climate change speaking publicly on the issue and perhaps campaigning against members of congress who dispute the validity of climate science im ready to continue to fight mr kerry said weve made too much progress on wednesday in marrakesh morocco mr kerry is expected to urge delegates at a united nations climate conference to redouble their efforts to limit emissions but the worlds climate diplomats are intensely worried that under mr trump the united states will renege on its commitments potentially leading to a collapse of the global political will to tackle the problem mr kerry can make no promises that will bind the trump administration after a campaign in which mr trump made little more than broad brush pronouncements on climate and energy the details of the president elects policies remain largely unknown but he has described climate science as a hoax perpetrated by the chinese to undermine the american economy and his electoral coalition includes climate change denialists who are likely to press him to abandon american commitments on the issue myron ebell a libertarian who is mr trumps choice to lead the transition at the environmental protection agency which the president elect has vowed to dismantle has long dismissed concerns about global warming and has called prominent climate scientists alarmists mr ebell has said that the e p a s clean power plan one of the obama administrations signature climate efforts is illegal mr kerrys tenure as secretary of state has been the capstone of a career working on environmental protection in as a veteran just back from the vietnam war he helped organize massachusetts events for the first earth day a mobilization that sent million people into the streets across the country in decades as a senator from massachusetts he urged the united states government to tackle global warming but won only a handful of legislative goals including tougher efficiency standards for cars his state department tenure by contrast has featured diplomatic achievements including a deal in paris last year to limit emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction and separate pacts to reduce certain other greenhouse gases limit emissions from airplanes and protect enormous swaths of the ocean if global climate change keeps moving at the pace it is there are going to be climate refugees there are going to be climate conflicts there are going to be food conflicts mr kerry said in his years as secretary of state mr kerry turned up at obscure negotiating sessions where he was by far the most senior diplomat in the room he cajoled the leaders of russia china india and other countries he won cooperation from china helping to spur the paris deal the meeting in marrakesh is supposed to be a major step toward putting it into practice as he approached antarctica on friday mr kerry an experienced pilot rode in the cockpit of the c globemaster cargo plane transporting his entourage one of the regular flights from new zealand to antarctica run by the united states air force in the cockpit he recounted lobbying president vladimir v putin of russia to help win protection just weeks ago for square miles of the ross sea off the antarctic coast as the plane steered toward the american logistics base at mcmurdo station mr kerry looked down at the stretch of ocean he had helped to preserve over two days he hiked for hours listening to scientists explain evidence that the antarctic landscape is undergoing profound change he lingered to discuss a project led by john stone of the university of washington who was at mcmurdo station preparing
when victoria woodhull ran for president of the united states she couldnt even vote for herself if the women can be allowed to vote the new york herald claimed when woodhull announced her bid in mrs woodhull may rely on rolling up the heaviest majority ever polled in this or any other nation after all the paper said women always take the part of each other the herald called for passage of a womens suffrage amendment and then victory for victoria in that was before the sex scandal hit woodhull was a divorced woman and sexual history was already a point of controversy but soon the papers dredged up a truly salacious item she once shared her home with both her first and second husbands woodhull defended herself in the press she explained that her family had taken in her alcoholic disabled ex husband as an act of charity not bigamy but the headlines branded her disgraced and called her career busted woodhull was evicted from her home and forced to withdraw her year old daughter from school the cartoonist thomas nast literally drew her as the devil and the conventional wisdom that women would always support each other turned on its head the suffragist support that had boosted woodhulls candidacy fractured a columnist for the cincinnati commercial wrote that while under certain circumstances men may vote for a candidate who is somewhat less than immaculate a female candidate must present as a paragon of propriety if she hoped to secure the feminine vote of the country in support of her political ambition in the theory that women would vote together in the interest of their gender soared and crashed once again this was supposed to be the election where women formed a coalition to block the man who boasted of groping them who has been accused of sexual assault by more than a dozen women who said women who have abortions deserved to be punished who said women facing sexual harassment at work should find another career who implied that a female journalist was on her period when he didnt like her question who said his female opponent didnt look presidential it was supposed to be the election in which women rejected the candidate who hates women in favor of the candidate who is one instead although hillary clinton won women last week cnn exit polls showed that percent of women voted for her she also lost women the womens vote was drawn and quartered by race education geography and marriage percent of black women voted for clinton while percent of white women voted for donald j trump percent of married women voted for him percent of white women who didnt attend college did too over all initial polls suggest that female voters were slightly less likely to vote for the democrat than they were in and the most offensive thing mitt romney ever said about women was that he had consulted binders full of their rsums in order to hire them to his staff the idea of a womens vote is both a lofty american dream and an ugly little myth its been in circulation before women could legally cast a ballot in a proponent of womens suffrage argued in the new york times that women display more of the virtues of good citizens forethought temperance industry and self restraint than men do and in susan b anthony claimed that when women earned the right to vote theyd collectively seize the moral high ground female voters propose to do away with vice and immorality to prevent the social evil sex work by giving women remunerative employment to forbid the sale of spiritous liquors and tobacco and to teach men a higher and nobler life than the one they now follow she said one man at a new york parlor meeting in said he supported womens suffrage only because he knew it would not challenge the status quo if there was danger that women might overthrow anything good he said there might be a reason to prevent their voting last week on election day female clinton supporters traveled to the new york cemetery where susan b anthony is buried they wore yellow roses and affixed their i voted stickers to her tombstone in an act of feminist tribute but the suffragists who fought for a womans right to vote were invested in enfranchising a particular kind of woman their pitch for womens political consciousness was rooted not in the collective experience of american womanhood but in an image of white feminine virtue many white suffragists pointedly ignored the women of color in the movement rosalie jones a white socialite turned suffragist gave herself the title of general and led an army of women from new york to washington in when a group of southern men confronted her to ask if she favored suffrage for black women she hedged telling them that the states must solve their own problems and when a group of black women tried to join her march in maryland she refused to acknowledge their existence they took up the back of the line for a few hundred feet before falling away in a white woman at a meeting of the brooklyn woman suffrage association complained that new york had become asylum for the trash of all nations and argued that womens suffrage ought to be carefully restricted to keep undesirable women out of the ballot box think what it means to give it to all women she said our criminal and pauper men have wives there are thousands of female operatives in tobacco factories and similar fields of labor there are probably two million negro women in this country who are but little uplifted above the plane of animals here was a woman who was denied one of her countrys most basic rights and yet she was content to argue that she should get the vote only once it was safely denied to most other women
this election year has often felt like one enormous swarm of poll numbers vote forecasts and nonstop statistical analysis and post election coverage has provided little relief how key was the working class vote to donald j trumps success did young voters shy away from hillary clinton what about hispanic voters all this number crunching led the two of us a videographer and a polling editor to wonder what might be missed when we try to explain entire groups as being pro trump or pro clinton if we write that rural voters were especially likely to back mr trump are there assumptions that we might be reinforcing but that actually dont hold true for many rural dwellers if we say that millennial voters were unlikely to support him are we getting the full picture the video above is our attempt to unpack just a few of these broad stroke terms we hope it will serve as an invitation to keep digging and to look at the headlines we see reporting exit poll statistics as only telling part of the story
president elect donald j trump will not be sworn in for two more months but as of next week the big gold letters spelling out his name will be removed from three large apartment buildings on the upper west side of manhattan tenants were told on tuesday hundreds of tenants at the buildings at and riverside boulevard which contain a total of apartments signed a petition to dump the trump name last month after mr trumps provocative campaign statements had offended women immigrants and liberals on the upper west side the buildings between and streets along riverside boulevard are owned not by mr trump but by equity residential a publicly traded company based in chicago which bought them in for million mr trump a republican had been involved in the development known at various times as riverside south and trump place equity residential kept the name trump place on the exterior of the buildings and on their letterhead signage and uniforms tenants got a hint that change was afoot in late october when doormen told residents that they were being measured for new uniforms that would no longer bear the trump name then on tuesday they received an email from mary pawlisa a senior regional manager for equity it read this week the trump place building names will change to the street addresses and riverside boulevard the purpose of this change is to assume a neutral building identity that appeals to all current and future residents asked whether the t r u m p letters on the buildings had hurt the companys ability to lease vacant apartments martin mckenna equity residentials vice president for investor and public relations said i dont have a comment on that a more neutral identity going forward is the path were taking equity residentials portfolio consists of about apartments in new york boston seattle southern california and washington coincidentally all areas where hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee won a majority mr mckenna preferred to describe those markets as gateway cities linda gottlieb a resident who started the petition was elated we won ms gottlieb a film and television producer said we used the power of protest to say that we dont have to accept the spread of the mans influence into our very homes to me it feels like a cleansing of the place where i live but in an interview on tuesday sam zell the chairman of equity residential said the tenants had no role in this mr zell said he and don as he called mr trump had talked about it a year ago we didnt want anything to happen while the election was going on he said according to mr mckenna equity entered a use of name contract with the trump organization which did not require it to pay mr trump to use his name that contract has now expired amanda miller vice president of marketing for the trump organization issued a statement saying the change was mutually agreed upon
all models are wrong the statistician george box once said this year was no exception on oct a model built by donald j trumps campaign gave him an percent chance of winning bloomberg has reported at that point in the race the upshots model gave him the same chances by election day his odds were higher but mr trump was still not favored to win near the end of the race a model built by the republican national committee showed him losing over all and in states like florida iowa pennsylvania and wisconsin according to politico so did mr trump simply beat the odds or were the odds wrong all along one of the reasons assessing models is so tricky is that its difficult to know for sure its only over the long run that a model can be judged to be well calibrated what we can do though is check to see how fragile our model was to different assumptions what we said on the last day of the campaign based on pre election polls we said mrs clinton had about an percent chance of winning and mr trump percent or slightly less than a one in six shot the final result is of course far from what we thought was the single most likely outcome and our live forecast was quick to adjust as votes began coming in but mr trumps final electoral count most likely to mrs clintons once the race in michigan has been called is well within the range of what we said was plausible the chart below shows which outcomes we thought were most likely were we too slow at various points during the campaign nate silver the editor of fivethirtyeight called the upshots model slow to react to new polls we preferred stable yougov analysis suggested that very few voters changed their minds and that the impact of most campaign events was small given the amount of uncertainty in the race a model should not overreact to a single poll released three months before election day but in her post election analysis mrs clinton blamed letters from the f b i director james b comey delivered to congress and two days before election day and campaign models moved sharply in the last few weeks as did our own so what if we had used only the final days of polls would we have given mr trump higher odds we would have but not by much if we had used only the final days of polls we would have given mrs clinton about an percent chance of winning only slightly lower than what we actually said and still far above percent even shorter windows give similar results theres no window of polls that would have pushed mr trump to be the favorite what if we had assumed michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin would all shift together in addition to whether older polls are useful one of the biggest differences between models involved the question of how much the states move together does a polling miss in one state tell you much about a polling miss in other states the technical word for this is correlation if the states are more correlated the possible distribution of outcomes gets wider if the states move independently the distribution gets narrower our model kept this parameter at a middle value the states were neither perfectly correlated nor perfectly independent even at its most extreme making the states move together more flattens the distribution and makes a win from mr trump more likely but at best he would have been just a percent favorite what if wed fit our model somehow knowing the results of it probably would not have changed much the state polls missed by larger margins in than they had in recent elections but the results werent completely unexpected it feels like an even larger miss because the polls missed by enough in enough swing states to give the election to the trailing candidate via the electoral college national polling performed better than a lot of people think mrs clinton is increasing her lead in the popular vote by the day it may take months for analysts to determine why state polls were far off in the midwest and northeast modern polling faces challenges including the decreasing use of landlines and the increasing difficulty in finding people willing to participate but we can expect the polling industry to work to adapt what would we do differently what would we think next time about a state like wisconsin dozens of polls showed clinton with a lead most above four points none showed mr trump ahead in our polling database of presidential polls since we found examples in which a candidate led in every poll of a state conducted in the final days of the campaign including where the margin was within points the trailing candidate won in only two cases three if you count wisconsin even among races won by less than points thats a win rate of percent about the same as the percent chance we gave mrs clinton in wisconsin all models are wrong mr box said continuing but some are useful was the upshot forecast useful we think a quantitative forecast can help people to take a step back from obsessing over the latest daily poll release by averaging polls together and arriving at a probabilistic forecast the aim is to help people take a more nuanced view of the campaign one that is less driven by whatever the latest polling number happens to be and instead summarizes all of the available evidence with the context of history but we humans are bad at understanding uncertainty reactions to mr trumps victory suggest that despite our efforts we failed at explaining that an percent chance is not a percent chance if we did it all again we would probably emphasize uncertainty in a more visceral way rather than using a simple statement of probability an analogy
washington the expansion of medicaid a central pillar of the affordable care act faces immense uncertainty next year with president elect donald j trump and top republicans in congress embracing proposals that could leave millions of poorer americans without health insurance and jeopardize a major element of president obamas legacy but influential figures in surprising quarters of the new administration might balk at a broad rollback of medicaids reach favoring new conditions for access to the government insurance program for the poor but not wholesale cutbacks mike pence the vice president elect is proud of the medicaid expansion he engineered as governor of indiana one of states that expanded eligibility under the affordable care act the indiana program has conservative features that emphasize personal responsibility and require medicaid beneficiaries to make monthly contributions to savings accounts earmarked for health care another trump adviser gov chris christie of new jersey hails the expansion of medicaid in his state saying more than half a million people are receiving more and better health care the federal government pays the full cost for newly eligible beneficiaries from through and at least percent of the costs in later years under the health law it is hard to overstate the importance of medicaid which insures million people pays for more than half of all births in some states covers about two thirds of nursing home residents and provides treatment for many people addicted to opioids spending on medicaid by the federal government and states combined exceeds billion a year of the million people who have gained coverage under the affordable care act officials estimate million are insured by medicaid with few of the problems that have plagued the new insurance exchanges or marketplaces but change is coming in his campaign manifesto mr trump said congress must repeal the affordable care act and give each state a lump sum of federal money a block grant for medicaid congress passed legislation in january to repeal the health law and roll back its medicaid expansion mr obama vetoed the measure but speaker paul d ryan of wisconsin has vowed to put similar legislation on a republican presidents desk without even waiting for legislation the trump administration is almost certain to give states more leeway to run their medicaid programs as they wish federal and state officials say a number of states have already proposed co payments and work requirements for people on medicaid in an effort to protect beneficiaries the obama administration has limited the use of co payments and has not allowed work requirements but state officials say that such changes are likely to be allowed in some form in a trump administration cindy gillespie the director of the arkansas department of human services said that with the election of mr trump she saw a real chance for states to take back a bit of control over medicaid and other safety net programs darin gordon who stepped down in june after years as the director of tennessees medicaid program predicted that there will be greater receptivity in the new administration to state proposals that were shut down by the obama administration cindy mann the top federal medicaid official from to january said it was entirely possible that a trump administration would make different judgments about medicaid waivers the vehicle for a wide range of state innovations and experiments the federal government has broad discretion to approve state demonstration projects if the secretary of health and human services finds they are likely to assist in promoting the objectives of the medicaid program on nov the obama administration rejected a waiver request from new hampshire which wanted to impose a work requirement and more stringent standards for medicaid beneficiaries to show they were united states citizens and residents of the state the requirements could undermine access efficiency and quality of care the administration said new hampshire will have a republican governor for the first time in years and could submit similar proposals to the trump administration in september the obama administration approved a waiver allowing arizona to charge premiums to people with incomes above the poverty level but federal officials refused to allow work requirements or a time limit on coverage and they said the state could not charge premiums to people below the poverty level the obama administration also rejected ohios request for a waiver to charge premiums and suspend coverage for people who failed to pay them a policy it said would jeopardize coverage for more than people in kentucky where more than people have gained coverage because of the expansion of medicaid gov matt bevin an outspoken republican critic of the health law is seeking federal approval for a waiver allowing work requirements premiums and co payments negotiations over a proposed medicaid block grant would need to answer difficult questions how is the amount of the initial federal allotment determined will this amount be adjusted to reflect population growth the effect of an economic downturn or increases in the cost of medical care or in consumer prices generally will it be adjusted to reflect the advent of costly but effective drugs like those to treat hepatitis c will states have to continue spending their own money on medicaid will medicaid beneficiaries still have a legally enforceable right an entitlement to coverage and care if they meet eligibility criteria set by the federal government and states medicaid block grants have been a favorite of republicans in washington proposed in various forms by president ronald reagan in congressional republicans in and president george w bush in the house republicans better way agenda unveiled in june would give states a choice of a fixed allotment for each medicaid beneficiary or a block grant for medicaid either way states would get less money than they expect to receive under current law under the proposal for a per capita allotment states that had not expanded eligibility as of january would not be able to do so the enhanced federal payments that states
the harvest had just begun when agents from the immigration and naturalization service stormed across the onion fields of vidalia ga in sweeping up immigrants who were trudging behind tractors without legal authorization to work in the united states pulling onions out of the ground for cents per pound bag the fallout was unexpected senator paul coverdell republican of georgia wrote to the immigration service complaining of its indiscriminate and inappropriate enforcement tactics against honest farmers who are simply trying to get their products from the field to the marketplace representative saxby chambliss blasted the immigration officials bullying tactics and immigration enforcement caved shortly after the raid onion growers in counties were granted a temporary amnesty to keep their workers as long as their paperwork looked legitimate welcome to reality last week donald j trump was elected president based on a straightforward promise to make the united states great again he aimed his message primarily at tens of millions of white working class americans who feel left behind in the growing economic prosperity undercut by the advancement of minorities and women competition from illegal immigrants at home and cheap workers in other countries this week mr trump is being forced to acknowledge that his straightforward solutions are in fact much less straightforward than he promised they would be the big and beautiful wall might look more like a fence most of the estimated million illegal immigrants wont be summarily deported he said backing off a line from stump speeches earlier in the campaign perhaps only two or three million just the bad guys that number is in the ballpark of deportations in the obama administration undocumented immigrants who are not criminals he said are terrific people mr trump has not yet clarified his promises on trade but most experts say it will be very hard to simply walk away from nafta and impose a percent tariff against imports from china in an age of global supply chains said dani rodrik of the kennedy school of government at harvard you cannot take a chain saw to trade agreements and not end up cutting your foot off sure but where does that leave donald trumps supporters to larry bartels the political scientist at vanderbilt university the apparent shift in mr trumps position is unsurprising politicians dont follow the interests of average voters he argues they hew to the interests of the rich trumps populist instincts on economic policy seem to have fallen by the wayside over the course of the campaign mr bartels told me and the need to work with republicans in congress will probably reinforce that shift in his book unequal democracy published this year mr bartels offered a snapshot of voter preferences in before the onset of the financial crisis on the bottom of the income scale most voters supported policies to provide jobs and equalize incomes but at the top most opposed them the picture was reversed when voters were asked about cuts to government spending the rich were much more supportive than the poor and what did voters get after a brief flurry of fiscal stimulus to stop the economy from careening into the abyss they got a round of automatic budget cuts called the sequester the transformation of mr trumps populist agenda into a rather more orthodox list of republican goals may well follow the same script his proposal for huge tax cuts which would reduce federal revenue by as much as trillion over a decade according to the nonpartisan tax policy center would shower favors mostly on upper income americans even as he backs away from mass deportation mr trump is now talking about modernizing medicare echoing paul ryan the house speaker who wants to weave his goal of replacing government sponsored health care for the elderly with vouchers to buy private insurance into the campaign promise to overhaul the affordable care act what is going to happen is unclear said jacob hacker a yale political scientist but what paul ryan will want to do is quite clear finally while mr trump has pitched deregulation notably the repeal of president obamas clean power plan as an engine for job growth in the nations rust belt he is also set to deliver enormous gains to wall street by undoing core provisions of the dodd frank act which was established to hem in the financial sector and prevent a repeat of the crisis of there is definitely a silver lining if mr trump is really letting go of the most extreme elements of his agenda the economic and social dislocation that would be caused by deporting percent of american workers would be immense nafta may not be the best agreement in the world china certainly cheats but igniting trade wars with the nations biggest trading partners would not improve the livelihoods of americas working class but the only real sliver of good news for blue collar workers is in mr trumps proposal for infrastructure spending on a yet unspecified but surely huge scale but how will mr trumps base respond if that program is financed largely by temporarily cutting corporate taxes to percent or so to encourage businesses with profits parked abroad to bring them home and would it be enough to restore prosperity to the working class for decades political analysts on the left have been perplexed by working class americans who give their vote to a republican party whose motivating principle revolves around delivering tax cuts to the rich this time around however they delivered their vote to a republican who promised to directly address their plight he has already come up short oxford economics under its most upbeat assumptions a big tax cut and infrastructure spending delivering a lot of economic stimulus while new trade barriers are limited foresees growth picking up for a while before falling back to the rate of roughly percent a year that the united states has been living with for the last seven years if mr trump pursues all
washington rudolph w giuliani facing a flood of questions about whether his business dealings should disqualify him from being named president elect donald j trumps secretary of state on tuesday defended his lucrative years in the private sector as a credential for the job i have friends all over the world mr giuliani the former new york mayor said in an interview this is not a new thing for me when you become the mayor you become interested in foreign policy when i left my major work was legal and security around the world as secretary of state mr giuliani a loyal often ferocious backer of mr trumps candidacy would make fighting islamist terrorism the centerpiece of the incoming administrations foreign policy he vaulted to national prominence because of his leadership after the sept terrorist attacks and he still views foreign policy through the prism of that day but mr giulianis business ties are a major red flag he built a lucrative consulting and speechmaking career after leaving city hall his firm giuliani partners has had contracts with the government of qatar and the canadian company that is building the keystone xl oil pipeline and mr giuliani has given paid speeches to a shadowy iranian opposition group that until was on the state departments list of foreign terrorist organizations in one year mr giuliani reported in a financial disclosure report that he had made speeches for as much as each and had earned a total of million he often made extravagant demands in return for agreeing to make a speech including that the private plane that flew him to the engagement be a certain size during the presidential campaign mr trump repeatedly criticized hillary clinton for her speeches to goldman sachs as well as for contributions qatar made to the clinton foundation which he claimed betrayed her commitment to womens and gay rights because of qatars poor record on both this week senator rand paul republican of kentucky and a member of the senate foreign relations committee questioned mr giulianis fitness for the job pointing to his list of paid speeches his work for foreign governments and his support for the iraq war mr trump has long claimed erroneously that he opposed the war it is worrisome some of the ties to foreign governments because that was a big complaint about many of us with hillary clinton and her ties and the money she received from foreign governments mr paul told cnn on tuesday mr giuliani defended his firms work for qatar which he said included training the qatari police and analyzing the security of a desalinization plant because he said it was done under the previous emir sheikh hamad bin khalifa al thani who abdicated in mr giuliani said he had consulted the state department about the contracts and had been told that sheikh khalifa was friendly toward the united states mr giuliani said he was one of dozens of prominent americans who worked for the iranian opposition group known as the mujahedeen khalq or the m e k drawing payments at the same time it was on a state department list designating it a terrorist organization he sought to persuade the state department to revoke its terrorist listing which the americans did in september my ties to them are very open mr giuliani said we worked very hard to get them delisted by hillary clinton by the way another giuliani client the energy company transcanada applied to build the keystone xl pipeline in the united states and was rejected last year by president obama after a recommendation by secretary of state john kerry if it decided to apply again for permission and mr giuliani ended up at the state department the application would land on his desk mr giuliani did not address that issue directly in the interview saying only that his firm had offered security advice to transcanada when it had a partnership to build a natural gas facility on long island sound the proposal was turned down ive done no work on the pipeline he said his other clients have included a long list of prominent american corporations including bear stearns uber and cb richard ellis the real estate giant under contract with purdue pharma the maker of the often abused painkiller oxycontin mr giuliani used his clout with the justice department to press the federal authorities to offer a less onerous punishment to the company after allegations that security problems at its warehouses might have contributed to black market sales but it is the lesser known names that may draw the most scrutiny triglobal strategic ventures a company that aims to assist western clients in furthering their business interests in the emerging economies of the former soviet union according to its website is among the more obscure clients records show mr giuliani has had ties dating to at least to triglobal a company that has provided image consulting to russian oligarchs and clients with deep kremlin ties they have included transneft russias state owned oil pipeline giant which is the target of western sanctions imposed after president vladimir v putin annexed crimea and began meddling in ukraine triglobals advisory board includes ara abramyan listed on the companys website as a very close advisor to the russian governments inner circle including the president and the prime minister the companys founding partners are andrey drobyshev who claims to have strong relations with regional and municipal governments in russia and vitaly pruss whose website profile says that he has focused on international image development and pr for russian ukrainian companies and that from to he worked closely with giuliani partners llc jeffrey berman one of triglobals managing partners is also vice president of berman enterprises a family run company that worked with giuliani partners in to form a commercial and residential real estate investment vehicle called the berman opportunity fund its purpose was to target foreign investors looking to take advantage of the weak dollar through real estate
san francisco social media companies are under increasing scrutiny for the amount of hate speech that thrives on their platforms especially since the presidential election now twitter has unveiled several new measures to curb the online abuse though the changes are unlikely to be far reaching enough to quiet the companys critics on tuesday twitter said it was making it easier for its users to hide content they do not wish to see on the service and to report abusive posts even when those messages are directed at other users the company has given its support teams training to better identify mistreatment on twitter theres a fine line between free expression and abuse and this launch is another step on the path toward getting rid of abuse said del harvey twitters vice president of trust and security weve been launching new products to address this and the cadence of product releases is picking up we have a lot planned on this path online harassment and hate speech have long festered on twitter but the incidents appeared to rise during the presidential campaign exchanges between supporters of president elect donald j trump and hillary clinton grew personal and acrimonious many of mr trumps supporters also relied on a series of images some anti semitic and others quietly coded as racist to circulate hate speech on twitter since mr trumps victory last week twitter has been filled with reports of racist and derogatory taunts against minorities many users have expressed fear and concern about the escalation of such behavior when asked about harassment of minorities mr trump told minutes that his supporters should stop it twitter has not had a comprehensive response for dealing with hate speech largely because the company did not want to limit freedom of expression on the service but over time twitter has rolled out measures to tackle the problem it has let people mute the accounts of other users effectively making their content disappear from view last year it issued an explicit prohibition against hateful conduct the company is now taking more action it is letting people more specifically block out what they do not want to see on the service including muting words phrases and even entire conversations twitter is also making it easier for people to report abusive behavior even if they are only bystanders to the abuse and for the company to evaluate those reports and it has overhauled its approach to training support teams holding special sessions on cultural and historical context for hateful conduct someone looking at user complaints in asia may not recognize something happening in the e u or the u s as hateful ms harvey said we need to make sure there is a universal familiarity with the most common trends and themes were seeing that are abusive but may not seem so at first glance critics said that while the steps are positive they will not eliminate hate speech twitters changes dont stop the problem of posting abusive content said mark s luckie a former twitter manager who now runs a digest of the topics trending among twitters african american users called today in blacktwitter people will find a way to abuse others online but these changes may put users at ease and curb the perception of abuse on twitter part of the reason abuse has thrived on twitter is because the company allows anonymity mr luckie said but unlike other sites with anonymity twitter lets users broadcast to the world so their abuse has a huge potential impact he said if you fight with a celebrity and the celebrity fights back then you have potentially reached a global audience with your abuse ms harvey acknowledged that twitter has not always moved fast enough to clamp down on abusive behavior she said that the problem would probably never be entirely solved but that the company was doing more to identify repeat offenders who create new accounts when twitter shuts them down or who incite users to gang up on others when i hear that twitter only cares about this now that were only going through the motions i understand where that perception comes from ms harvey said but this is important to us because people are experiencing these abusive things and we need to make sure they know what options they have and that were taking action to make things better
beirut lebanon warplanes resumed airstrikes on the besieged rebel held sections of aleppo syria on tuesday as russia began a major new offensive against insurgents battling syrias president bashar al assad russias defense minister sergei k shoigu said it had started a big operation to deliver massive strikes against the islamic state and the levant victory front formerly known as the nusra front in idlib and homs provinces jets taking off from russias aircraft carrier the admiral kuznetsov conducted their first strikes on syria the russian military said noting that its forces were hitting targets in the two provinces it was unclear whether the strikes on aleppo were by russian or syrian government warplanes the fighting shattered the relative calm that had prevailed in the rebel held eastern parts of aleppo for about three weeks our house is being shaken modar sheikho a nurse and antigovernment activist in rebel held aleppo said in a text message the warplane is still in the sky he shared an audio recording with the roar of a plane and the sound of explosions residents reported airstrikes on at least five aleppo neighborhoods the extent of the casualties was unclear but they appeared to include at least three civilians including a woman who were killed in the neighborhood of masaken hanano and others who were wounded there were conflicting reports about whether the attack had consisted of barrel bombs which are usually dropped from helicopters or an assault by fighter jets since this morning until now dozens of shells and rockets have bombed aleppo mohammad al sheghal a resident of eastern aleppo said in a text message adding that he believed the planes were russian fighter jets mr shoigu at a meeting in sochi russia with president vladimir v putin said that a russian warship the admiral grigorovich was taking part in this operation launching cruise missiles against insurgent targets for the first time in the history of russian navy the admiral kuznetsov aircraft carrier took part in combat too he said today our su fighter jets began to work from this warship mr shoigu also briefed mr putin on what he called the use of chemical weapons by the insurgents the russian military said that chemical weapons used by insurgents had caused three deaths of syrian soldiers and the hospitalization of dozens of soldiers on monday a russian fighter jet crashed off the syrian coast as it tried to return to the admiral kuznetsov the pilot ejected safely and the russian defense ministry blamed a technical failure the fighting broke out a day after mr putin spoke to president elect donald j trump and agreed to cooperate on fighting international terrorism and extremism according to a kremlin statement that declaration echoed mr trumps recent comments that he would try to work with moscow and with mr assad to fight against the islamic state also known as isis isil or daesh mr trumps comments concerning syria also received a favorable reaction on tuesday from the united nations special envoy for syria staffan de mistura what hes been saying is quite interesting mr de mistura said speaking on the bbcs hardtalk program the focus the priority is daesh fighting terrorism second to do if possible a deal with russia both points make a lot of sense the diplomat said he had yet to speak directly to mr trump or his associates he also emphasized that in his view the syria conflict still required a completely new approach to what is a political solution the syrian government has tended to call all its opponents terrorists and russia makes little distinction among the different groups fighting mr assad a constant sticking point has been that some of the rebels that the united states has supported have made battlefield alliances with qaeda linked groups considered terrorists by moscow and washington alike mr de mistura has estimated that perhaps a few hundred of the or so fighters inside besieged eastern aleppo are affiliated with al qaeda rebels say that number is lower and the government says it is higher the obama administration has said that fighting the islamic state is the priority of the united states not toppling mr assad though that is another stated american aim under mr obama the united states government has continued to support some rebel groups that washington deems not to be extremist and it has shunned direct cooperation with moscow and damascus contending that their campaign in syria has been focused less on defeating extremists and more on battling opposition groups fighting mr assad the obama administration has also condemned what it says is indiscriminate bombing by the syrian government and its russian allies a change in american policy under mr trump who is to take office in january could involve a shift toward direct cooperation with mr assad and with russia against the islamic state
last weeks news quiz covered an extra day in order to take in the results of election and most of you did very well there were three questions however that stumped many of you one was about the republican majority in the senate another was about the paris climate change agreement and the third was our weekly question that asks students to differentiate between fake news and real news we were surprised so many got that one wrong have you paid attention to the news as closely this week as you did last week take our quiz and see the photo at the top of this post from a nov article trump and obama hold cordial minute meeting in oval office the caption reads president obama spoke with president elect donald j trump at the white house on thursday to discuss the transition of power president obama said they had an excellent and wide ranging conversation
arthur brooks hi gail so just when we thought that couldnt get any more shocking it did with a trump victory i told you last week that strange happenings were afoot in the universe what with the cubs winning the world series and all i hear that new yorkers are taking it pretty hard are people stocking up on canned goods gail collins greetings from the land of duck and cover arthur not sure its quite sunk in but yes freeze dried foods and subterranean real estate are in demand arthur duck and cover sounds like a hunting club so where shall we begin gail im a little weary of the why it happened conversations lets get right to it what do you think will happen next arthur donald trump will set up an administration the sun will rise in the east my dog chucho will chase squirrels the world will go on gail glad to hear chuchos taking it well arthur he stayed cautiously neutral in the election but hes a very good boy i think you once made the point to me that there are no permanent victories or defeats in politics so perhaps thats a good place to start a conversation about the future ive been amazed since i came to washington at the collective failure to understand that point it is patently true upon the most cursory inspection of recent history in democrats were popping champagne over the dawn of a permanent era of progressive politics now they see most of their dreams being unraveled and republicans celebrating today will sooner or later be miserable gail hey i made a point things are looking better already arthur both winners and losers who ignore this reality make silly unforced errors the losers err on the side of excessive fatalism like the classic threats to leave the country gail reader email has informed me its way harder to leave the country than one might think we americans arent in all that much demand arthur and the winners fail when they convince themselves that since victory is permanent they can set an agenda that attracts no one from the other side gail well looking at a president trump and a republican controlled house and senate id say we are in for a stretch of dumb things presidents generally get most of their big changes done in the first year or two president obama did that with health care his agenda was nothing compared to george w bush who did everything from tax cuts to getting authorization for the iraq invasion but obamacare was certainly a big lift it was also a central campaign promise i know you think it was a bad idea arthur i think that strategy is enormously shortsighted i remember thinking when the democrats held the white house and both houses of congress in even though they dont have to it might be wise to give a little to bring some centrist republicans into obamacare some day the republicans might be in a position to reverse everything if they have zero political investment in it and sure enough here we are my point is that of course a president should have a vision that matches his ideology thats why he got elected but i think it is impractical and imprudent to forgive me for another reference to this is spinal tap turn it up to give on a few things where you dont have to because someday youre going to need friends to protect the stuff you care about most the trump administration might learn from the outgoing administrations horror at seeing some or all of obamacare repealed gail we part company here my perception of obamacare was of a democratic party willing to work on compromise legislation while the republicans just stalled there was no unified republican position just a ton of people who wanted to be deal makers but kept changing their mind but the bottom line is that weve left behind the old lets have a drink after work congress weve now got guys who sleep in their offices and dont even talk to the other side at the house gym arthur secretly a lot of them are actually friends but i take your point and thats another recommendation i would make to president trump make friends everyplace that was the l b j reagan clinton magic dont golf with the same people every week gail since i have no choice im prepared to look on the bright side for a while the republican hatred of obamacare is so great that even if hillary clinton had gotten elected it would have been really hard to get the necessary fixes through congress trump has promised something better and as of his minutes interview something better that preserves the most popular parts of the program so well see what he comes up with i know youre a big paul ryan fan his agenda and trumps agenda really dont match do they arthur congress is set to have a big influence on the agenda over the next years and ryan and trump will figure out how to make their ideas jibe ryans plan includes a health care replacement plan for obamacare it will actually do some of the things liberals really want like getting more people covered i realize that its very disappointing for progressives to see obamacare repealed but its not like it will be replaced by nothing gail this is one area where the product doesnt usually resemble the recipe i remember presidential candidate barack obama saying all health care negotiations could take place in public on c span grab your crystal ball and give me a couple of other predictions im seeing a big tax cut and huge spending on infrastructure repair followed by a stupendous rise in the national debt arthur its certainly true that neither party has been great at getting the deficit under control in my lifetime nobody calls his
moscow russians awoke to an extraordinary scandal on tuesday with the minister of economic development detained on charges of soliciting a million bribe the highest level official arrested in russia in decades the minister aleksei ulyukayev a liberal stalwart with a trademark porcupine haircut was detained in the middle of the night a soviet like tactic against officials who had fallen into disfavor that many thought had been retired mr ulyukayev was charged with extorting a million bribe from rosneft the state oil giant as a thank you for endorsing a deal for it to buy a chunk of bashneft a smaller government owned oil company that the kremlin recently confiscated from an oligarch late on tuesday president vladimir v putin dismissed mr ulyukayev from the ministers job he had held since citing a lack of trust it was a rare bribery case to reach behind the high red walls of the kremlin though relatively small in a country where corruption is rampant and to an unusual degree parted the curtains on the extended opaque battle within the ruling elite over the direction and control of the sickly russian economy amid myriad questions about what actually happened which may never be made public one explanation emerged as the favorite the kremlin and its allies struggling to right an economy waterlogged by two years of recession are seeking a life raft analysts said mr ulyukayevs mistake was to question their methods publicly in this line of thinking mr ulyukayev was being punished for initially trying to block rosneft from expanding its reach by purchasing bashneft and for generally restraining its growth on a larger scale the arrest served as a warning from the increasingly dominant security services that no one should challenge them i think the purpose of the whole thing was to eliminate resistance said vladimir s milov an opposition politician and former deputy minister of energy who now leads a think tank the message is dont stand in my way a clear message for all future deals the basic scenario goes something like this as the head of rosneft igor sechin a former k g b agent and putin confidant is sitting on about billion in cash with the states two main reserve funds dwindling the russian government covets that cash mr sechins purchase of state assets transfers that money directly into the russian treasury it also increases his power though there was a small wrinkle in the form of a law suggesting except in extreme instances that state assets should be sold into private hands a private company lukoil also expressed interest at a lower price as minister of economic development mr ulyukayev had to sign off on the sale of any state assets so bashneft was a major test case mr sechin wanted it for rosneft despite the law and the widespread negative public perception that the elite was once again as it did in the abusing privatization laws to seize commodity resources at bargain prices mr ulyukayev tried to postpone the deal but mr putin backed the sale after initially hesitating in october it was announced that rosneft would acquire a little more than half of bashneft for more than billion mr sechin is known for a take no prisoners attitude toward anyone who challenges him so the bribery charges against mr ulyukayev were interpreted as revenge for mr putin the nations special reserve funds have served as russias main tangible economic cushion the reserve funds have been something sacred putin always refers to them when he talks about economic difficulties mr milov said they have been used as a strong public indicator that the state still has capabilities but they are shrinking fast with no economic revival in sight two sovereign funds the reserve fund and the national wealth fund are now down to less than billion compared with a combined billion at the beginning of according to the finance ministrys website the financial reserves are expected to run out by the end of just as mr putin faces a campaign for a fourth term in the spring of the rosneft stash would help tide over the country for a longer period while the kremlin ties its hopes to a rebound in the price of oil and the possible lifting of western sanctions imposed over russias annexation of crimea and the ukraine crisis prospects for the latter brightened with president elect donald j trumps criticism of the american policy of isolating russia for now the russian economy hovers around zero growth and consumers still struggle with inflation caused by a sharp drop in the ruble along with food restrictions imposed in response to the western sanctions with minimal outside investment russias economic fate is increasingly in the hands of the state new statistics from the federal antimonopoly service show that the government controls about percent of the economy compared with percent in olga v kryshtanovskaya a leading sociologist who studies the russian elite said the ulyukayev case cast a shadow over the entire government people resent the fact that they had to give up french cheese in order to support the presidents policies and such corruption cases still erupt she said in an interview on tuesday the kremlin cranked its information machinery into high gear to paint the arrest as part of a continuing anticorruption crusade that has included the arrest of three governors in the last two years a report called fight against corruption was the top one for much of the day on the main state run television news network a caravan of politicians appeared on screen to praise the arrest as evidence that nobody was above the law mr ulyukayev was charged with extorting a large scale bribe svetlana petrenko a spokeswoman for russias investigative committee said on state television mr ulyukayev threatened to use his official standing to create future problems for rosneft she said and was detained on monday while accepting million russian security services had monitored mr ulyukayevs

washington president elect donald j trumps promise to deport two million to three million immigrants who have committed crimes suggested that he would dramatically step up removals of both people in the united states illegally and those with legal status if carried out the plan potentially would require raids by a vastly larger federal immigration force to hunt down these immigrants and send them out of the country addressing the issue in an interview broadcast sunday on the cbs program minutes mr trump adopted a softer tone on immigrants than he did during his campaign when he called many of them rapists and criminals he instead referred to them as terrific people saying they would be dealt with only after the border had been secured and criminals deported but by placing the number of people he aims to turn out of the country as high as three million mr trump raised questions about which immigrants he planned to target for deportation and how he could achieve removals at that scale if he wants to deport two to three million people hes got to rely on tactics that will divide communities and create fear throughout the country said kevin appleby the senior director of international migration policy at the center for migration studies of new york he would have to conduct a sweep or raids or tactics such as those to reach the numbers he wants to reach it would create a police state in which they would have to be aggressively looking for people the details are crucial to understanding the approach of a president elect who centered his campaign on a promise to build a border wall and deport lawbreakers on monday president obama said he would urge mr trump to consider leaving in place his executive actions that have shielded from deportation immigrants brought to the united states illegally as children asked on minutes whether he would seek to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants mr trump said his priority would be to remove people that are criminal and have criminal records what we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records gang members drug dealers we have a lot of these people probably two million it could be even three million we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate mr trump said but were getting them out of our country theyre here illegally the obama administration has estimated that million removable criminal aliens are in the united states that number includes people who hold green cards for legal permanent residency and those who have temporary visas it also includes people who have been convicted of nonviolent crimes such as theft not just those found guilty of felonies or gang related violence they certainly have that many to start said jessica m vaughan director of policy studies at the center for immigration studies a group that supports reduced immigration but even if mr trumps numbers are correct and many immigration activists dispute them it is not clear mr trump could carry out those deportations quickly without violating due process in many cases convicts would have to go through immigration courts before they could be deported those courts are overwhelmed with huge backlogs so obtaining deportation orders from judges can take many months if not many years thousands of immigrants are serving jail sentences that under current law cannot be curtailed according to official figures as of june only about immigrants had been convicted of crimes and also had deportation orders so they could be detained and removed quickly mr trumps approach would in some ways be a continuation of policies mr obama has pursued to focus immigration enforcement on convicted criminals in his administration issued guidelines instructing agents to make criminals the highest priorities for their operations in according to immigration and customs enforcement figures the majority of the people deported percent were convicted criminals while percent were removed for immigration violations under the obama administration we have already managed to calibrate our policy with heavy emphasis on criminal aliens said muzaffar chishti the director of the new york university school of law office of the migration policy institute a nonpartisan research group since mr obama has presided over the deportation of about million immigrants prompting sharp criticism from advocacy groups he did so in part to build political support for a broad revision of immigration laws that would have provided a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally under a now defunct program known as secure communities the obama administration used digital fingerprints shared by local law enforcement departments to find and deport immigrants who had committed crimes immigration and customs enforcement also partnered with local authorities to prioritize the arrest and detention of criminal aliens both measures helped drive deportations to roughly per year during mr obamas first term multiplying that number by many times would almost certainly require reinstituting a program like secure communities and employing vastly more immigration agents as well as using more aggressive tactics to find and remove immigrants who may have broken the law according to mr appleby of the center for migration studies of new york if mr trump seeks to revive programs of close cooperation between local police and federal immigration authorities he is likely to encounter legal challenges and resistance from dozens of cities and counties that have curtailed or rejected cooperation mr trump has said he would cut off federal funding for cities that refuse to help federal agents detain unauthorized immigrants during his campaign he highlighted terrible crimes by immigrants he said had escaped detection because of protective policies at a news conference in chicago on monday mayor rahm emanuel a democrat sought to ease fears of deportation and harassment as he reiterated chicagos status as a sanctuary city for immigrants it is important for families that are anxious it is important for children and adolescents that are unsure because
washington the f b i reported monday that attacks against american muslims surged last year driving an overall increase in hate crime against all groups the data which is the most comprehensive look at hate crime nationwide expanded on previous findings by researchers and outside monitors who have noted an alarming rise in some types of crimes tied to the vitriol of this years presidential campaign and the aftermath of terrorist attacks at home and abroad since that trend appears to have spiked in just the last week with civil rights groups and news organizations reporting dozens of verbal or physical assaults on minorities and others that appear to have been fueled by divisions over the election in its report on monday the f b i cataloged a total of hate crimes in a rise of about percent over the previous year including assaults bombings threats and property destruction against minorities women gays and others attacks against muslim americans saw the biggest surge there were reports of assaults attacks on mosques and other hate crimes against muslims last year a jump of about percent over it was the highest total since when more than attacks occurred in the aftermath of the sept attacks attacks against transgender people also sharply increased blacks were the most frequent victims of hate crimes based on race while jews were the most frequent victims based on religion according to the f b i data but the increases in attacks on these groups were smaller than the rise in attacks against muslims and transgender people over all percent of the hate crimes that the f b i recorded were based on the victims race ethnicity or ancestry religious bias accounted for about percent of all attacks and about percent of attacks were based on sexual orientation law enforcement officials acknowledge that the statistics give an incomplete picture because many local agencies still have a spotty record of reporting hate crimes years after congress directed the justice department to begin collecting the data we need to do a better job of tracking and reporting hate crime to fully understand what is happening in our communities and how to stop it james b comey the f b i director said monday the f b i regards the prosecution of hate crimes under federal jurisdiction as the top priority of its civil rights branch since the election hate crime monitors like the southern poverty law center have reported a rash of verbal or physical abuse targeting minorities and others at schools mosques and elsewhere some supporters of president elect donald j trump however say they too have been victimized
jerusalem emboldened by the republican sweep of last weeks american elections right wing members of the israeli government have called anew for the abandonment of a two state solution to the conflict with the palestinians the combination of changes in the united states in europe and in the region provide israel with a unique opportunity to reset and rethink everything naftali bennett israels education minister and the leader of the pro settlement jewish home party told a gathering of the foreign press association in jerusalem on monday mr bennett who advocates annexing percent of the occupied west bank to israel exulted on the morning after donald j trumps victory the era of a palestinian state is over that sentiment was only amplified when jason greenblatt a lawyer and co chairman of the trump campaigns israel advisory committee told israels army radio that mr trump did not consider west bank settlements to be an obstacle to peace in a stark reversal of longstanding american policy members of prime minister benjamin netanyahus likud party and other rightist politicians jumped to make hay of the change yoav kish a likud member of parliament called for the expansion of israeli sovereignty into the west bank meir turgeman the chairman of jerusalems municipal planning committee said he would now bring long frozen plans for thousands of jewish homes in the fiercely contested eastern part of the city up for approval aryeh deri the interior minister who is ultra orthodox hailed mr trumps victory as a miracle asserting it would lessen the influence of liberal non orthodox streams of judaism popular in america he added we must truly be in messianic times when everything will turn out favorably for the people of israel mr netanyahu whose previous three terms in office all coincided with democratic administrations in the united states has been more cautious adding to his troubles israels supreme court on monday rejected a government request for a seven month delay of the demolition of an illegal west bank outpost built on privately owned palestinian land the court ordered demolition is slated for dec and the government had argued for the delay in part to temper a potentially violent settler response on sunday a ministerial committee of rightists within the likud party and the governing coalition approved a contentious bill to retroactively legalize illegal settlement on privately owned palestinian land prompted by the effort to salvage the amona outpost it may be a precursor of things to come although the pro settler camp was promoting the bill long before mr trumps victory the decision was taken unusually over mr netanyahus vehement objections and despite his exhortations for it to be postponed tzipi livni a centrist former foreign minister and justice minister who now sits in the parliamentary opposition denounced the settlement bill writing on twitter that it constitutes major damage to the rule of law at home damage to israel abroad and primarily conveys a message that might makes right when faced with a weak prime minister mr netanyahu warmly welcomed mr trumps victory calling him a true friend of israel but mr netanyahu has also since instructed his ministers and legislators to be discreet saying the incoming administration should be allowed to formulate together with us its policy vis vis israel and the region through accepted and quiet channels and not via interviews and statements mr netanyahu endorsed the principle of a palestinian state in under american pressure and with caveats since then he has tried to balance between world opinion and his right wing constituency by declaring support for a solution based on two states for two peoples without going out of his way to advance it israeli analysts point out that the trump campaign has spread contradictory messages while many here assume that he will have more pressing priorities than the long running israeli palestinian conflict mr trump told the wall street journal on friday that he would like to seal an israeli palestinian peace agreement calling it the ultimate deal mr netanyahus critics on the right however assume a trump administration will at least give israel a freer hand in areas like settlement construction they say mr netanyahu will have to decide which side he is on acknowledging that mr trumps positions are not entirely clear mr bennett the leader of jewish home said we have to say what we want first amit segal a political commentator for israels popular channel news said that during the tenures of presidents clinton and obama mr netanyahu could disguise his worldview the obama administrations sharp condemnation of all settlement activity gave mr netanyahu the ultimate excuse for not building with abandon in the west bank mr segal said in an interview adding i am not sure that the right wing with its appetite will be prepared to suffer another few years of that asked what mr netanyahu would probably be rooting for israelis who generally reflect the prime ministers thinking said he was unlikely to forswear the two state solution israel has its own interest in reaching a negotiated solution with its neighbors said dore gold a longtime netanyahu adviser who recently resigned from his position as director general of israels foreign ministry this is not a function of pressure or arm twisting prime minister netanyahu has made it clear that this is his goal but mr gold suggested that a trump administration was likely to roll back the demand that israel withdraw to the lines and support borders that are more accommodating to israel trumps policy paper spoke about israel having defensible borders which are clearly different from the lines he said michael b oren a deputy minister in the prime ministers office and a former israeli ambassador to the united states told israel radio we have to ask ourselves what is in israels interests the interest of the israelis and in my view of the government is indeed to achieve peace with the palestinians through direct negotiations without preconditions at any time
seventy six national security experts urged president elect donald j trump on monday to reverse his hostility to the nuclear agreement signed with iran last year and to use it as a tool to ease other tensions with the country a report signed by the experts including former officials from both major political parties argued that the nuclear agreement had reduced the threat of war in the middle east mr trump has called the nuclear agreement a foreign policy disaster he vowed during his campaign to renegotiate or renounce the deal one of president obamas signature achievements the report stated the deal proved that diplomacy with iran can bear fruit despite skepticism about iranian sincerity the inclination of irans supreme leader to abide by the deal or the ability of iranian hard liners to sabotage diplomacy it urged the incoming trump administration to use the nuclear agreement as the basis for cooperation on other issues including a desire by iran and the united states to eliminate the islamic state which has convulsed the middle east and carried out attacks in the west the report was produced by the national iranian american council a washington group that has advocated improved relations with iran even while sharply criticizing iranian leaders over human rights issues trump may have been critical of the iran deal during the campaign but he will need the deal to remain intact to achieve his other stated goals trita parsi the president of the council said in a statement andrew j bacevich a professor of international relations and history at boston university who endorsed the report said the question over whether mr trump seeks to sustain and broaden the opening to iran or distances himself from this opportunity promises to reveal much about his approach to statecraft other prominent experts who endorsed the report included lawrence j korb a former assistant defense secretary under president ronald reagan lawrence wilkerson who served as chief of staff to former secretary of state colin powell chas w freeman jr a former ambassador to saudi arabia and assistant defense secretary for international affairs and gary sick a columbia university scholar who served on the national security council under reagan as well as presidents gerald ford and jimmy carter the nuclear deal relaxed many economic sanctions on iran in exchange for reductions in its nuclear efforts and verifiable pledges to keep that work peaceful critics of the agreement said iran was an untrustworthy partner and had been granted too many concessions how easily or even whether mr trump can make good on his promise to renegotiate or scrap the agreement remains unclear it was negotiated among iran and six major powers including the united states and was endorsed by the united nations security council the countries who joined the united states in signing the deal iran russia china britain france and germany have said they intend to honor the agreement which would isolate the united states should it withdraw and would weaken the effect of any unilateral american sanctions on monday european union ministers added their endorsement of the agreement the agreement which officially took effect in january has released hundreds of millions of dollars in impounded iranian funds and spurred a rush of european business interest in iran trade and investment deals generating momentum that would be difficult to reverse should the pact collapse iran would presumably be free to develop nuclear weapons an outcome that many nations including irans middle east neighbors say would destabilize the region mr trumps repudiation of the agreement would also put him at odds with russia risking new tensions after vowing to improve washingtons relationship with moscow
global investors have rendered their verdict on donald j trump as president sell government bonds and pile into stocks that will benefit the most from a resurgent united states economy from indonesia to the united states government bonds are undergoing a sharp sell off as investors large sovereign wealth funds and hedge funds as well as the accounts of american retirees restructure investment portfolios to try to capture the fruits of what they expect will be a free spending trump presidency across the board the yields of these bonds which move up as their prices decline are pushing higher the yield on the year united states treasury note a benchmark for mortgages and other lending rates has risen to percent from percent in less than two months for such a widely held and traded security that is an unusually abrupt move other safe haven bonds have had similar reactions the yield on germanys year notes has gone to positive in just a week it has gone to percent from negative percent and the swiss year is now on the cusp of paying investors to borrow money after close to two years of trading in negative interest rate territory if the trend continues it will signify a jarring philosophical shift from the view put forward by many prominent economists like the former treasury secretary lawrence h summers that the global economy is destined to stagnate for some time under a regime of low growth zero interest rates and deflation a series of earlier signals pointed to a move away from bonds in the weeks before the election including higher wages in the united states and signs of increased inflation in europe but what has resonated deeply with countless risk averse investors who have been camping out in government bonds for years now is mr trumps promise to have the federal government take responsibility for stimulating the economy in the form of infrastructure investments and tax cuts away from global central banks it does not surprise me that the markets have reacted this way said luciano siracusano chief investment strategist for wisdomtree asset management in new york this is a very pro growth agenda and we have not had that in a while after the financial crisis unleashed an unprecedented wave of activism on the part of global central banks investors the world over followed the lead of central bankers and loaded up on long term government bonds until recently it has been a no fault trade with global growth stagnant governments divided and political risk omnipresent the numbers tell the story according to j p morgan central banks and financial institutions in developed markets are sitting on trillion in bonds or percent of the tradable market for these securities that figure is up from percent in and it highlights the extent to which worries about deflation and stagnation have resulted in a nonstop bull market for government bonds most investors and many policy makers as well have become fed up with this so called stagnation trade and they have been calling for lower taxes and more government spending not just in the united states but also in europe and japan investors have been frustrated with the limits of monetary policy said michael zezas a bond strategist with morgan stanley there has been a presumption of the necessity of fiscal stimulus with a trump presidency the political rationale aligns with the economic rationale soaring bond yields are not the only way that this new reflation trade is playing out investors are betting that a pickup in government spending will push up the price of basic building commodities like copper the price of which was up percent in the last month bank stocks have also gotten a lift because investors believe they will face less regulatory pressures and cash in on higher interest rates which help their lending margins even the long suffering stock price of deutsche bank for example has bounced back by nearly percent in the last week more broadly the standard poors stock index gained percent last week while on monday the major market measures ended largely flat of course such an investment trend carries with it serious risks if bond yields shoot up too starkly investors in the stock market will get jittery and all the fast money that has recently piled into stocks could turn tail leaving chaos in its wake for example billion has poured into exchange traded funds that invest in the united states stock market in the last three days alone moreover a sharp increase in bond market rates will put pressure on emerging markets which have enjoyed a renaissance in recent months stock markets ranging from brazil india and taiwan have been down sharply over the last week the exchange traded fund that invests in these and similar countries and is the markets truest gauge of sentiment toward developing markets is off more than percent since mr trump was elected it is worth recalling that the so called taper tantrum in when panicky global investors escaped en masse from most of the major developing economies was driven by an expectation of higher interest rates and a strong dollar which is exactly what the markets are factoring in right now a trump inspired inflationary surge could also force the federal reserve to be overly aggressive in raising rates a dynamic that no investor wants to see the trick of course for a trump administration will be to ensure that fiscal stimulus proponents do not get a totally free hand and in addition to pushing for a building boom cut taxes radically and increase military expenditures that could result in a yawning budget deficit and inflation spiraling out of control for now such a dire situation is far from the minds of investors who prefer to see in mr trump an antidote to nearly a decade of low growth low interest rates and intense regulatory scrutiny all of which pushed them into the safety and security
of all the climate policies the trump administration has promised to undo auto emissions standards could be the most consequential americas million cars together with other modes of transport now emit more carbon dioxide than any other segment of the united states more than its power stations factories or households the sheer volume of auto emissions has made the fuel efficiency goals introduced by president obama intended to reduce auto pollution and drive up gas mileage one of the single biggest steps any nation has taken to fight global warming those targets are now likely to be scaled back or even scrapped aides to mr trump who campaigned on promises to revive the fossil fuel industry roll back environmental regulations and cancel the paris climate deal signaled over the weekend that he would look for a quick exit from americas commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions a trump senior adviser john mashburn better known for his advocacy of anti abortion issues told the wall street journal that the administration intended to begin a comprehensive rethinking of all federal regulations including a review of the fuel economy and emissions standards to make sure they are not harming consumers or american workers the trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment automakers are seizing on the change in administration to argue for re evaluating fuel economy and emissions rules which are set to become progressively more stringent starting with model cars in a letter dated nov to the trump transition team the alliance of automobile manufacturers which represents a dozen of the biggest car and light truck makers urged a reassessment of emissions rules that the group said posed a substantial challenge for the auto industry those rules are designed to deliver a new car fleet averaging miles per gallon in compared with about miles per gallon now the obama administration already has a review of that target underway as car prices rise it becomes vital to look at the full cost of regulatory initiatives the industry groups chief executive mitch bainwol said in the letter climate protection advocates are nervous automakers are asking him to let them guzzle oil and pollute more and increase our oil addiction daniel f becker director of the safe climate campaign said referring to mr trump are they going to go back to making early century vehicles the possible easing of federal emissions rules throws a wrench in good news from scientists at the global carbon project an international science policy advisory group which projected on monday that global carbon dioxide emissions would grow by just percent this year compared with levels in the third consecutive year emissions stayed relatively flat the scientists who measure both emissions from human activity and absorption by oceans and plants attributed the flat growth to lower emissions especially from coal by the worlds largest emitters china and the united states those two countries together make up percent of the worlds carbon dioxide emissions the environmental protection agency had estimated that based on current fuel efficiency targets lifetime carbon dioxide emission reductions for all vehicles sold from to would total nearly two gigatons and save american consumers billions of gallons of fuel but climate change forecasts remain grim the world meteorological organization said monday that preliminary data through september showed on course to be the hottest year on record beating record breaking temperatures in despite growing climate concerns american automakers have struggled to make significant gains in overall fuel efficiency in recent years as they increase the production of gas guzzling light trucks minivans and sport utility vehicles which are subject to less stringent emissions standards and better for companies bottom lines and in the united states automakers enjoy generous incentives for selling hybrid or electric vehicles for each green car sold automakers earn credits that then allow them to meet less stringent fuel efficiency targets for their entire fleet as currently practiced those credits can have unintended consequences in a startling study published in february researchers at carnegie mellon found that those incentives meant that each time an electric vehicle or other green car was sold in place of a conventional vehicle fleet carbon dioxide emissions increased by as much as tons and gasoline consumption increased by as much as gallons a year the e p a has said it thinks this trade off is worthwhile because green car sales could lay the foundation for a bigger switch to electric vehicles but a relaxing of fuel emissions standards could derail that assumption jeremy michalek a professor in the department of engineering and public policy at carnegie mellon said that putting a price on carbon in the form of a carbon tax would be a simpler and more effective way to pursue fuel efficiency in the nations vehicles the idea of a carbon tax has been a contentious one in american politics last week voters rejected a ballot proposal in washington state that would have imposed a tax on greenhouse gas emissions starting at per metric ton but mr michalek remains a proponent of carbon taxes carbon pricing is giving people freedom he said adding that might be a virtue mr trump would appreciate i could buy a fuel efficient car or a smaller car i could still get the car i want and drive it less he said or i could continue to drive it as much as i want but pay for the damage
moscow president vladimir v putin of russia and president elect donald j trump spoke by telephone for the first time on monday agreeing to review what both consider the poor state of relations between the two countries according to a statement from the kremlin the two agreed on the absolutely unsatisfactory state of bilateral relations said the statement and they both endorsed the idea of undertaking joint efforts to normalize relations and pursue constructive cooperation on the broadest possible range of issues the issues discussed included trade and economic ties as well as combating terrorism mr putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate mr trump last wednesday sending him a telegram about an hour after he had emerged the victor but the two men have not met nor had they spoken previously mr putin repeated the congratulations over the phone the russian president said he hoped that moscow could build a collaborative dialogue with washington on the bases of equality mutual respect and noninterference in the others internal affairs the release said the two men also discussed syria in the context of the need to work together in the struggle against the no common enemy international terrorism and extremism the statement said although mr putin maintained studied neutrality during the presidential race the state run news media which answers to him clearly pulled for mr trump among other issues mr putin blames hillary clinton then secretary of state for the mass demonstrations that greeted his return to the presidency in after mrs clinton lost the flagship state television news broadcast took to referring to her as the blonde woman during the campaign senior united states security officials accused russia of hacking the computers at the democratic national committee headquarters and releasing emails that proved embarrassing to the clinton campaign mr putin denied any state role in the hacking the russian government was one of the few around the world that was openly gleeful about the american election result with members of the state duma the lower house of the russian legislature breaking into applause at the announcement the united russia party loyal to mr putin dominates the duma mr trump and mr putin developed something of a mutual admiration society during the election particularly after mr trump suggested that crimea which moscow annexed from ukraine should belong to russia and that the united states should ally itself with russia and the syrian government of president bashar al assad to fight the islamic state mr trump also suggested the united states might dilute its support for nato which russia considers a main threat much of the brief statement from the kremlin about the telephone call echoed previous statements that mr putin had made about his goals for relations with washington including a return to pragmatic mutually beneficial cooperation mr putin openly endorses the idea that the world should return to the era when two superpowers assumed a general responsibility for global stability and security some analysts however have suggested that mr trump is unpredictable and the traditional republican penchant for painting russia as a dire threat could still emerge the putin administration is hoping that the west will lift sanctions imposed over the crisis in ukraine on the phone call which the kremlin said was arranged by mutual consent the two men agreed to stay in contact and to meet at an unspecified date in the future earlier mr trump described the note on his victory that he received from mr putin as beautiful for its part russia has continued its glowing tributes to mr trump as a paragon who triumphed in what is repeatedly depicted in the russian media as the swamp of american politics the main weekly news program on state television every sunday night tends to focus mainly on the united states with dmitry kiselyov the anchor suggesting this week that europe follow the american lead in replacing its leaders under president trump mr kiselyov said the american government would finally drop what the russian anchor called its annoying slogans about human rights and democracy russia has a lot of trust in trump he said

the prosecutor of the international criminal court said monday that she had a reasonable basis to believe that american soldiers committed war crimes in afghanistan including torture the international prosecutor has been considering whether to begin a full fledged investigation into potential war crimes in afghanistan for years in mondays announcement the prosecutor fatou bensouda signaled that a full investigation was likely still the prosecutor did not announce a final decision on an investigation which would have to be approved by judges and it is unlikely that the united states will cooperate the united states is not a party to the court which was established to prosecute war crimes crimes against humanity and genocide but afghanistan is a member of the court so allegations of crimes committed in its territory no matter the nationality of the perpetrators are widely considered to be fair game the international court is under great pressure to show that it is unbiased in its targets for investigation almost all of its full fledged investigations have focused on africa and in recent weeks three african nations south africa gambia and burundi have announced their intention to withdraw from the court ms bensouda in an annual report published monday said there was a reasonable basis for her to open investigations into war crimes of torture and related ill treatment by u s military forces deployed to afghanistan and in secret detention facilities operated by the central intelligence agency the focus she said would be mostly on any crimes that occurred in and david bosco an indiana university professor who follows the court said the language of the report suggested that ms bensouda was ready to seek its permission to proceed to an investigation in a matter of days or weeks mr bosco said he was also struck by references in the report that signaled an interest to broaden her inquiry into prisoner abuse in secret detention facilities in other countries that belong to the court including poland and romania the report also said she had found evidence of torture and related ill treatment by afghan government forces particularly by its intelligence agency and the police war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the taliban and its affiliated networks would also be a target of investigation the report said the investigation could also set up a potential showdown with president elect donald j trump who has said he supports torture as a tool of counterterrorism the rules of the court set a very high bar for the prosecutor to begin a full investigation that can often take years to meet frustrating the courts critics and champions alike the prosecutor has to conclude for instance that the courts in individual nations are not taking adequate steps to hold perpetrators accountable the prosecutors report said that american soldiers and c i a officials had while interrogating detainees in american run facilities in afghanistan resorted to techniques amounting to the commission of the war crimes of torture cruel treatment outrages upon personal dignity and rape soldiers subjected at least detainees to these practices and c i a officers did so to at least detainees mostly between and the report found these alleged crimes were not the abuses of a few isolated individuals the report said rather they appear to have been committed as part of approved interrogation techniques in an attempt to extract actionable intelligence from detainees the report went on to note that american officials ordered that the practices be discontinued the prosecutor has come under criticism for not acting faster on the afghanistan cases she has blamed a lack of resources and cooperation the united states has assiduously sought to avoid scrutiny by the international court arguing that its national authorities have investigated allegations of abuse the prosecutor pointed out that american soldiers had not been prosecuted through the court martial process as for the c i a officers the justice department had carried out an inquiry into ill treatment of detainees it decided not to prosecute anyone in connection to the death of a prisoner the report said it was still seeking clarity from the american authorities on the inquiries into the conduct of c i a officials before making a final decision on whether to open a full investigation that decision would be made imminently the prosecutor said the prosecutors annual report comes at a delicate moment for the court of its current investigations nine involve african politicians or warlords the one exception is in georgia the prosecutors preliminary examinations the prosecutors first look at a case before diving into a full fledged investigation are geographically broader including inquiries in ukraine afghanistan iraq and the palestinian territories
what do you do when things dont turn out as you expected this week carl richards sketches out a solution and a five point plan for uncertain times he also introduces a new term into the financial lexicon the industrial certainty complex as you might expect hes not a fan when returns began turning donald j trumps way tuesday night and markets started to respond i spent the next four hours putting together a column for people to read wednesday morning its a reminder of sorts no matter what happens to stocks in the short term if your long term goals havent changed its not clear why your investments ought to once the election results were clear paul sullivan returned to a topic he knows more about than nearly anyone the estate tax my weekend column looked at the question of whether we might all be able to agree on the fact that people who work for smaller employers ought to have easier access to workplace retirement plans and it sure would be simpler if this could happen on a national scale self reliance plus a safety net ought to be bipartisan enough concepts to make a majority of congress happy right
the consumer financial protection bureau the nations top consumer watchdog is stepping up an investigation into seller financed home sales that target lower income home buyers unable to get a traditional mortgage the regulatory agency on monday disclosed that it recently ordered two major companies that offer high interest installment contracts called contracts for deed to comply with a civil investigative demand for documents the request is a sign that the investigation is advancing the two firms which challenged the demand for documents are harbour portfolio advisors of dallas and national asset advisors of columbia s c the agency began informally looking at seller financed homes and specifically contracts for deed this year enforcement lawyers at the agency have been investigating the prevalence of these types of transactions to determine whether they violate federal truth in lending laws the agency posted the orders signed this month on its website on monday several recent reports including a front page article in the new york times have explored a revival of these kinds of transactions and the abuses in the market harbour portfolio bought more than single family homes after the financial crisis of most of them from fannie mae a government controlled mortgage finance firm through bulk sales harbour paid or less for most of the homes which were foreclosed on during the financial crisis and sells them as is this year harbour began to sell off more than homes with existing contracts for deeds in place to other investment firms and individual investors harbour has been regulated at the state level since its inception and it has always prided itself on following the law and treating consumers fairly said a harbour spokeswoman we dont believe contracts for deed are a consumer financial product or service under the c f p b s authority since these investigations are quite daunting and costly for a small organization such as our own we thought it appropriate to exercise our right to challenge the c f p b s basis for jurisdiction harbour portfolio is represented by lawyers with hudson cook a maryland based law firm that specializes in consumer finance regulatory matters a lawyer for national asset said the firm stood by its legal filing sent to the agency opposing the document request the five year old regulatory agency has recently sought to flex its muscles with enforcement action announcing new rules this year that would prevent many financial companies from forcing consumers to resolve disputes through mandatory arbitration it has also worked on a new set of regulations for payday loans which often carry high interest rates and predatory features yet after last weeks election of donald j trump the future of the regulatory agency seems more uncertain than ever president elect trump has signaled that his administration will seek to roll back some of the financial reform regulations and legislation enacted by the obama administration after the financial crisis the consumer financial protection bureau has been a favorite target for critics in congress and on wall street who contend the agency has been too aggressive and strayed from its mandate of better regulating the mortgage market by venturing into subprime auto loans mandatory arbitration and payday lending but the investigation of contract for deed firms would seem to fall within the broad purview of the agency to oversee national standards for the mortgage market contracts for deed and similar products such as rent to own deals for buying homes have become more prominent since the financial crisis because of the unavailability of smaller mortgages in urban and rural communities these alternative deals in which the seller retains ownership to a home until a contract is paid off are popular in some midwestern states hit hard by the foreclosure crisis seller financed transactions are particularly popular in michigan and ohio two states that helped propel mr trump to victory realtytrac a property data service estimates that on average homes a year have been sold nationally through contracts for deed since and the pace of deals has quickened since the crisis but it is difficult to know just how many homes are sold through contracts for deed or rent to own leases because not all states require such transactions to be publicly recorded this summer the national consumer law center issued a report in which it said many seller financed deals were toxic and were transactions that were built to fail and that had harmed consumers
donald j trumps election victory was powered in part by forceful opposition to what he described as an economic and political system rigged against the american people for the benefit of shadowy forces in the news media the banks and the government president elect trump and his allies often describe that system with one word globalism it is a word that conjures many images none of them good shuttered factories unchecked immigration and a distant cabal that believers say controls the economy and the media analysts who track extremist groups in the united states have expressed alarm at the use of the word by the president elect they say it carries multiple meanings from benign to sinister and often serves as a dog whistle for racist anti semitic and antigovernment conspiracy theorists globalism is a principle driver for the fears that animate the radical right in the united states said ryan lenz the editor of hatewatch a blog published by the southern poverty law center it is the enemy ultimately globalism is often used as a synonym for globalization the system of global economic interconnection that has been critiqued for decades by liberal groups like labor unions environmental organizations and opponents of the international monetary fund and the world bank but for the far right the term encapsulates a conspiratorial worldview based on racism xenophobia and anti semitism according to mark pitcavage a researcher at the anti defamation league lauren southern a host on the right wing canadian media site rebel media explicitly rejected its use as a synonym for globalization in a video she posted online in september she said the word meant rule by autocrats such as president obama former president george w bush and the united nations who value the false flag of diversity and unchecked immigration from the third world globalists almost always sneer down their nose at tradition disdain national culture laugh at religion and generally despise the west while holding a creepy affection for the third world she added they want open borders cheap labor and antinationalism to benefit their business and political visions and are all too willing to shaft the little people to achieve it breitbart news the hard right website run by stephen k bannon mr trumps newly appointed chief white house strategist frequently attacked globalism and so called globalist elites during mr bannons tenure there but no one may have done more to popularize the idea of a globalist conspiracy than alex jones a far right radio host who commands an online audience of millions through his infowars media empire he has been called the most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary america by the southern poverty law center among his claims the sandy hook school massacre in newtown conn was a hoax and the sept terror attacks were an inside job mr jones posted his own definition of globalism to youtube in in his trademark shout he described it as a global digital panopticon control system engineered by shadowy corporate and political elites he called it the total form of slavery the host who has enthusiastically supported mr trump hailed the republican as a george washington level historical figure mr trump who appeared on his show last year has in turn heaped praise upon mr jones your reputation is amazing mr trump said i will not let you down you will be very very impressed i hope and i think well be speaking a lot so what is mr trump talking about when he talks about globalism his spokeswoman hope hicks provided a definition in an email before the election last week far right groups in the united states began to refer to globalism at the end of the cold war when it replaced communism as an idea that was an ever present danger to the nation mr pitcavage said they have also referred to it as the new world order and soon they saw its tentacles everywhere the shape of that conspiracy had distinctly anti semitic overtones in part because many of communisms foes had historically seen communism as inextricably linked to judaism mr pitcavage said members of the far right became fixated on prominent jews like the businessman and philanthropist george soros those conspiratorial beliefs were bolstered when former president george bush celebrated the end of the cold war in a speech by saying it was the dawn of a new world order his use of the phrase was taken as proof by many that a globalist conspiracy really was afoot it was very easy for them especially because he was the one who said it to take that ball and run with it mr pitcavage said from that point on the phrase became the short hand for that kind of globalism conspiracy theory the terms multiple meanings have made it a powerful political tool and mr trumps and his allies frequent references to globalism have drawn in a wide and varied audience anti globalism is a very efficient net to unite disparate parts of the right from the mainstream to the extreme said brian levin the director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at california state university san bernardino professor levin called globalism the defining folklore and narrative for the racist right but said it had also become a convenient boogeyman to explain the various declines that the united states is perceived to be in globalism was an important theme in the final weeks of mr trumps campaign for example when he told a rally in florida in october that his opponent for the presidency hillary clinton had sat at the heart of a globe spanning conspiracy with international bankers to plot the destruction of u s sovereignty the anti defamation league criticized the speech for evoking classic anti semitic themes conspiratorial talk has continued after the election mr

this year will be very likely the hottest on record with global temperatures breaking the previous record set in scientists with the world meteorological organization announced on monday the announcement is no surprise to climate scientists experts at nasa had already projected that would be a third year of record heat and the record will not be definitive until early next year but the latest estimate of record shattering heat comes as world leaders gather in marrakesh morocco for the annual united nations talks on limiting the impact of climate change the meeting is taking place in an atmosphere of alarm president elect donald j trump has called human caused climate change a hoax perpetrated by the chinese has vowed to dismantle the environmental protection agency in almost every form and has named myron ebell of the business backed competitive enterprise institute who has deep oil industry ties to head his e p a transition team preliminary data shows that global temperatures are approximately degrees celsius above pre industrial levels the landmark climate deal reached by nations near paris last december commits them to holding the increase in temperature to degrees celsius or degrees fahrenheit the point at which the world would be locked into irreversible and potentially devastating environmental changes mr trump has vowed to withdraw from the paris climate deal it has entered into legal force meaning that countries like the united states cannot legally withdraw for four years but there are many actions the trump administration could take to limit the execution of the agreement that prospect has already stirred alarm among the worlds largest countries and even a warning from china the meteorological organization found that global temperatures from january to september were about degrees celsius above the average for the years from to a period the organization uses as a baseline temperatures spiked early this year because of the weather phenomenon known as el nio which exacerbated coral reef bleaching which is caused by water that is too warm and a rise in sea levels preliminary data for october indicate that they are at a sufficiently high level for to remain on track for the title of hottest year on record the organization said that would mean that of the hottest years on record have been in the century the other one was the organization also found that concentrations of major greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continue to increase to record levels that arctic sea ice remained at very low levels and that there was significant earlier than usual melting of the greenland ice sheet petteri taalas the secretary general of the organization noted temperatures above the long term average of to degrees celsius and at least degrees celsius above the long term average in many parts of russia alaska and northwest canada we are used to measuring temperature records in fractions of a degree and so this is different he said because of climate change the occurrence and impact of extreme events has risen once in a generation heat waves and flooding are becoming more regular sea level rise has increased exposure to storm surges associated with tropical cyclones the organizations statement did not mention mr trump or the united states except to note that hurricane matthew in october was the deadliest weather event this year claiming at least lives and injuring people mostly in the caribbean
democrats here reince priebus said referring to wisconsin are not new york or california type democrats these labor democrats are conservative people to begin with so said the president elects newly minted chief of staff speaking about a state that like pennsylvania had long eluded the republican party so he said in that is mr priebus appointed by donald j trump on sunday to the highest ranking position in the white house first appeared in the new york times on sept union leaders confronted by resistance to obama the headline read the article discusses attempts by union members to court democratic votes during president obamas first presidential campaign and acknowledges certain hurdles they encountered issues of abortion gun rights and race the times sought out mr priebus then chairman of the wisconsin republican party to offer his opinion mr priebuss quote which appears toward the end of the article proves eerily prescient given mr trumps narrow victory over hillary clinton in wisconsin the article also offers some insight into wisconsins electorate who in like fellow midwestern voters this year in ohio lamented the states loss of jobs in the moment though mr priebus proved anything but prescient a bigger problem is that barack obama has a sort of show pony style mr priebus said denying that race would play a factor in the election the speeches and the classic double speak and being a great orator that kind of thing doesnt play well in wisconsin five weeks later mr obama carried wisconsin with a point margin
last week i posed a provocative question on a financial services discussion board if the expected overhaul of financial regulations proceeds do we still need to worry about planning for the failure of big financial institutions including derivatives clearinghouses that is one of many questions that have been raised by the recent election and the call to repeal the dodd frank act the financial regulations passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis part of those regulations concerned rules for running most if not all derivatives trades through a clearinghouse or central counterparty but a blueprint for what to do if the clearinghouse itself runs into financial trouble and needs saving has been a point of much discussion among those interested in financial regulation answers to these questions are hard to come by because although many members of the soon to be dominant political party have called for such a repeal the movement that elected the new president is at least in part based on hostility to the establishment which presumably includes the big wall street banks that are largely the focus of dodd frank at times during the campaign donald j trump suggested he would reinstate the old glass steagall rules as part of repealing dodd frank these were the new deal regulations in force until the late that kept depository banks separate from investment banks and insurance companies a change like that addresses only a part of the broader scope of the postcrisis overhaul for example what do we do about resolution or bankruptcy for banks some have suggested moving all of what is now covered by the orderly liquidation authority the federal deposit insurance corporations new insolvency system for too big to fail institutions into the broader bankruptcy system that might work but often it is also suggested that these big bank cases should be put in front of life tenured district court judges rather than bankruptcy court judges who serve year terms because the cases are apt to be so politically fraught that would seem to lose most of the benefits of the current bankruptcy system which operates as well as it does because of the practical common sense approach that most of the bankruptcy judges bring to cases moreover district court judges are generalists and spend little of their time thinking about insolvency and reinstating glass steagall will not address derivatives are we going to go back to the precrisis nonregulation of derivatives as my opening question asks does the repeal of dodd frank mean abandoning the move toward transparency in these markets including the use of central clearinghouses and the required posting of collateral to back up these trades there are a host of questions here for example are we also going back to the old system of consumer protection in the financial industry we will probably have to wait a good while for answers as the new administration is apt to focus on the more politically charged issues of repealing the prior administrations health care immigration and environmental regulations and there is also the matter of the supreme court and the many other judicial vacancies left by the senates decision to halt judicial confirmations in the end it means several more years of uncertainty for the financial industry somewhat ironically just as the industry was finally adapting to the new regulatory framework that frameworks permanence has been thrown into doubt

somehow donald trump manages to dumb down everything somehow he manages to lower the bar to the point where he can play by a different set of rules and somehow the media and elected officials just shrug their shoulders and walk away by his own admission the president elect is negotiating business deals at a time when his predecessors were you know filling cabinet positions and transitioning to power he met with his indian business partners and the trump organization signed a kolkata deal last week as trump tweeted earlier this week prior to the election it was well known that i have interests in properties all over the world only the crooked media makes this a big deal he explained this in more detail if not entirely coherently in his interview with the new york times ive built a very great company and its a big company and its all over the world people are starting to see when they look at all these different jobs like in india and other things number one a job like that builds great relationships with the people of india so its all good its all good is indeed trumps approach to mixing his business and political affairs the law is totally on my side he claimed meaning the president cant have a conflict of interest to be clear profiting from the presidency would not be a quaint conflict of interest this is not about whether trump favors one country or president over another gives a contract to one company or another or spends more time making money for himself than he does boning up about policy there are laws on the books about us businesses influencing foreign officials with payments or other inducements the law is called the foreign corrupt practices act and its goal is to stamp out bribery by any us citizen bribery is what the law calls favors and payments given to foreign officials in exchange for business deals not a conflict of interest payments and favors going the other way into the pockets of the president are so clearly corrupt that they were forbidden by the founding fathers in the constitution the so called emoluments clause prohibits gifts and titles from foreign powers as follows no person holding any office of profit or trust under them shall without the consent of the congress accept of any present emolument office or title of any kind whatever from any king prince or foreign state its this clause that leads to exceptional red tape around any and all gifts received by the white house and every other department from a homemade quilt to a rolex watch everything is detailed declared and surrendered officials can only keep the gifts up to a value of if they repay the us government this process will be hard within the world of international real estate where foreign powers can grant gifts ranging from planning permits to investments from sovereign wealth funds the list is almost endless now we dont know if donald trump discussed his buenos aires investment with president mauricio macri of argentina but we do know that his daughter ivanka now running the family business was on the call we dont know if there was any suggestion that president mauricio macri could expect any benefits for himself or his country spokespeople for president macri and president elect trump have denied reports about the mixing of trump business and politics on the call but we do know that the long stalled buenos aires project is now moving forward news that emerged just three days after the call between macri and trump for a president who has refused to release his tax returns the need for transparency is not exactly clear in any case the fact that were even having this discussion tells you something profound about the trump presidency before it officially begins trumps promise to his voters was that he was incorruptible because he was so independently wealthy that nobody could touch him he knew how to drain the swamp because he had lived in it for so long buying off begging politicians for so many years that it made him sick this argument was always a stretch but clearly many voters bought into his pitch just two weeks since the election its obvious that trump has no interest in separating his personal wealth from his political agenda the damage caused is not confined to public confidence in the united states government being leader of the free world is not a casual concept that cold war phrase encapsulates the long prized notion that the united states is a beacon of freedom and democracy for the world as his own transition came to an end president elect kennedy best summed up the notion in his final address in boston in january i have been guided by the standard john winthrop set before his shipmates on the flagship arbella years ago as they too faced the task of building a new government on a perilous frontier we must always consider he said that we shall be as a city upon a hill the eyes of all people are upon us the eyes of the world are on the trump transition right now they see a president elect who lost the popular vote by more than million votes and almost percentage points this is a difficult notion of democracy to explain to a world struggling against authoritarian regimes where votes are routinely ignored and discounted the work of democracy promotion by the national endowment for democracy established by reagan is immeasurably harder as a result of the election the work of spreading corruption free government has become just as hard as a result of trumps business dealings if a sitting president can enrich himself while in office then why cant a president of a developing country set up his own businesses to do the same why should they not do both after all as trump told
appearing on that most revered of presidential forums donald trump released a video this week describing his plans to make america great again for everyone and i mean everyone ive learned not to believe trumps magnanimous act but others really want to henry kissinger told fareed zakaria on cnn that we should give trump an opportunity to develop the positive objectives that he may have and barack obama told an audience in peru that he wants to be respectful of the office and give the president elect an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every instance well forgive me mr president because im about to pop off have you lost all sense of judgment you and kissinger talk as if we have no idea who donald trump is or what he has been saying for months on end but trump has made it abundantly clear momentary opportunistic words of inclusion notwithstanding that his administration will be loyal to the far right fringes of the united states leaving even the republican establishment running behind him trumps announced cabinet choices simply leave no room for imagining a kinder gentler donald at the helm of the usa those of us concerned about the fate of the undocumented or the environment or reproductive rights see much reason to worry with the selection of steve bannon jeff sessions mike pompeo and general michael t flynn to trumps inner circle among many other troubling things all these men also share a deep antipathy to islam general flynns anti muslim views are as scary and they are well known trumps pick for national security adviser has called islam a malignant cancer and stated that islam is a political ideology that hides behind this notion of it being a religion asked about flynns views current republican national committee chair and trumps designated chief of staff reince priebus told abc news that there are some aspects of the faith that are very problematic i didnt realize that preibus was a scholar of islam or perhaps even a a renewer of the faith who according to popular muslim tradition comes to revive the practice of islam for following generations or maybe he just said an ignorant thing that would sound bigoted if it were about another religion but today sounds like policy preibuss comments are troubling rather than enabling establishment republicans as a moderating influence on the team the trump administration is pulling the traditional gop down its own far rightwing foxhole giving less extreme republicans about as much voice in this new administration as clint eastwoods chair actually its worse at least the chair had the good sense to stay quiet my worry extends beyond the realm of what this administration says and reaches into what it will do building a wall on the us mexico border is a near physical impossibility the immediate deportation of millions of people is much harder to execute than it sounds but the muslim stuff that can and most likely will happen kansas secretary of state kris kobach another anti muslim hardliner who is in the running for homeland security chief recently met with trump and was photographed holding his kobach strategic plan for first days openly in his hands plain for the world to see was the re establishment of an old useless program of the bush administration officially called nseers and more commonly known as special registration i remember vividly the panic and confusion among the muslims of new york city when special registration was first enacted in this program which required non immigrant visa holding men from muslim majority countries and north korea to register with the government was a massive failure even the governments own auditor found the program to be ineffective and a huge waste of resources the cost to american taxpayers was more than a year and the program alienated muslims around the world from the united states families were torn apart because of special registration and the brilliant program netted a grand total of zero terrorism prosecutions special registration was useful only as a tool to disrupt average muslim lives and to spend a lot of money needlessly it served no security function and yet trump is considering reviving it why we can assume because it will make this government like its doing something on the backs of ordinary muslims and then theres this justifying a muslim registry on fox news trump surrogate carl higbie positively invoked japanese internment as a legal precedent for the program that heinous comparison led the new york times to publish an op ed by a harvard law professor reassuring us that even if the legal decision authorizing internment has never been overturned we shouldnt be worried because the judiciary now sees the legal justification for internment as bad constitutional law but that whole exercise is nuts the question is not about the constitutionality of japanese internment the question is why the hell are we talking about japanese internment anyway are we seriously working through the legal likelihood or unlikelihood of holding large numbers of completely innocent people in detention camps if racial hysteria led us down that road once before whos to say that todays panic wont lead us down a similarly treacherous path with or without a legal precedent its beginning to feel like were one major terrorist attack from martial law in this country and the new administration hasnt even taken office yet theres a rightwing fiction in the us that is frequently promoted by the likes of fox news and that had a major impact on this election the notion is that in our contemporary multicultural age salt of the earth white americans dont get theirs while every minority and special interest group gets extra privileges the idea cultivates a mood of bitterness and suspicion even if its fundamentally untrue many americans honestly believe that muslims are getting special privileges that some accept will lead to the imposition of
traditionally a british ambassador needs royal documents of accreditation from the court of st jamess in order to represent her majesty abroad theres none of that fuss for nigel farage he has appointed himself ambassador to the united states as a stepping stone to some higher office such as foreign secretary farage prime minister farage or perhaps if the donald should suggest it in a tweet king nigel not on the basis of such fussy old paraphernalia as a great seal a royal charter or elected office of any kind but simply by flashing a photograph at us in the age of the selfie and the celebrity presidency farage has invented a new source of political authority it dazzles and blinds more than days after it was taken as it shines its power drunk bully light into every corner of the news it is the picture that defines drooled one befuddled commentator at this rate it will define too for the photograph that stirred the confusions of a stupefied britain on the weekend after americas psychotic meltdown of an election shows no sign of slipping away into memory usually photographs record history this one is making it for farage is successfully using it as a badge and instrument of power like a barbarian chief returning to his thanet village with a tablet from the roman emperor that appoints him ruler of the britons the sheer freakishness of the image enhances its grip on us for we cant stop staring at this monstrously matey exchange of bonhomie in a lift lined with gold trumps almost beatific post electoral grin is matched by the nigels starstruck guffaw theyre high rollers headed for the penthouse where the casino has provided them with entertainment for the night or whatever other cinematic image comes to mind to me this is somewhere between a martin scorsese film and a scene from the heyday of the third reich hermann goring would have loved that gold elevator but if this year has taught us anything it is that you cant assume your revulsion is universally shared maybe to many this is a gleeful and even joyous picture of two buddies having a well earned celebration love it or loathe it britain cant stop looking at it news sites whipped it out again this week like farages personal ultra gold american express card after the president elect attempted to appoint him by tweet as our man in washington in dwelling on this potent picture this virile vision we are rushing after pied piper farage dancing gladly to his tune for mr brexit loves this picture and he understands it too the gold is hilarious it makes everyone look what really matters however is the intimacy it parades the proof that he and americas scarily unpredictable new president are not just allies but real and close friends this is what makes the picture so much more than just a nice souvenir of a visit to trump tower it has become farages trump card an actual instrument of political power that he has played with frightening brilliance when will we wake up to the fact that nigel farage is a political genius he has used this photograph like a machiavel of the digital age to ruthlessly undermine britains prime minister and cabinet just a few months after the entire government was turned upside down by the brexit vote he claims credit for whats his game where does it lead the truly sinister thing about this photograph that is empowering nigel farage so much is that he personally produced it he went to new york got into trumps elevator made sure they posed for a picture together and released it on his twitter account it first appeared in a tweet by farage at on november in which he smugly goaded britains elected politicians with his proximity to the most powerful man on earth farage is understandably delighted with the pictures progress writing a fuming attack this week on the may governments supposed folly in refusing to obey an order from trump tower in the far right website breitbart naturally he boasts about it i have said since the now famous photograph with donald trump ten days ago that i would do anything to help our national interest and to help cement ties farage was first to release the photograph and hes still harping on it as incontrovertible evidence that he is the president elects good friend while conventional politicians who have been shy of acclaiming a man who spewed out hatred and bigotry in his campaign look wrongfooted look the old parliamentary politics has failed its time for the winners in the great gold elevator to have a go for farage this picture is gold but what does it mean when the normal rules of power can be bypassed with a photograph of two guys in a lift is there anything inherently wrong with grounding a claim to political importance in a photograph of yourself next to donald trump the german social theorist max weber distinguished between rational legal authority which corresponds to theresa mays government in this extraordinary situation traditional authority which is embodied in britain both by the monarchy and the venerable traditions of our parliamentary democracy and the third kind the wild card the dangerous unpredictable force that is charismatic authority nigel farage has already done a lot to destabilise rational legal and traditional authority in britain with the revolution he sees in brexit but its not enough now he is calling politics a cesspit and catastophically undermining what is supposed to be the brexit government what will be good enough when will he stop charismatic authority revels in the glamour and irrationality of visual images just as it revels in emotion stridency fear and loathing in a world cut free from conventional rules the charismatic leader uses bizarre unprecedented symbols of power to undermine the dullards who cling to outworn expectations farage waves his picture about from his
thats it from the live blog for today heres what happened donald trump gave a wide ranging interview to the new york times after a bit of back and forth this morning about whether or not he was going to turn up for the interview he confirmed he did not favor prosecuting hillary clinton although he did not explain what such a hypothetical prosecution might be for he said he had an open mind about whether or not to withdraw from the paris climate change accords the president elect disavowed the alt right the collection of far right groups and individuals that have been emboldened by his victory but he denied his key aide steve bannon was part of that movement trump played down the prospect of conflicts of interest between his businesses and his presidency saying the laws totally on my side

first of all we dont know where all the evidence is going to lead but what president elect trump was saying was that he would rather look forward instead of backwards and that his eyes right now are looking through the windshield not the rearview mirror so that was the point he was making and that look hes not going to spend his time sitting around thinking about how hes going to prosecute hillary clinton hes gonna think about the future of america for all americans that are out there thats where his focus is and thats really what hes saying now im sure if something comes around that if

while prime minister justin trudeau flogged our public assets last week he had a soothing message rest assured well be well served by the private sector bankers and billionaires lined up to sound a note of confidence i think its unprecedented exclaimed canadas top business lobbyist john manley a once in a generation opportunity enthused trudeaus economic advisory council these corporate figures are rubbing their hands because trudeau is about to put one of our great crises in their hands the need for historic investment in the countrys infrastructure for so long the domain of the state no one will deny the urgency roads and bridges are crumbling and congested with traffic subways and buses overcrowded and underfunded we need a roll out of emissions reducing initiatives to avert catastrophic climate change and a build up of defences to protect ourselves from floods and fires already locked in but many will question the liberals plan to deal with it selling off existing public assets to raise money and having private investors fund build and operate new infrastructure if they get their way expect a wave of privatizationstargeting public services and goods like roads ports airports utilities the post office and more according to adam vaughan one of its liberal architects there simply isnt an alternative to be afraid of the private sector when youre trying to fix this countrys infrastructure is shortsightedstupid irresponsible by responsible and far sighted does vaughan mean the result of past canadian experiments in privatization unsafely constructed schools packed dangerous prisons water treatment systems flooded with sewage super hospitals built with faulty wiring in emergency rooms senior care homes over run with inedible food and filth the politicians prattle about the private sector covering the risk of projects the enabling lie that cannot for its life find evidence time and again the costs of these public private partnerships have instead been borne by the public in ontario over the last decade alone their cost overruns burdened citizens with an extra and racked up in public liabilitiesthe equivalent of per household but perhaps canadians are just too stupid to understand their merits stupid enough that percent of them surveyed now oppose such privatization schemes so stupid indeed that in many cases they have clamoured successfully for these services to be returned to public control trudeaus plan for a privatization bank would expand these local disasters to a national scale corporate and pension fund backers have already announced they expect returns of to percent on their investments how do you think that will happen the only way that skimping ever does higher bills user fees and hidden government subsidies diminishment in quality of service cuts in jobs and pay no wonder some of trudeaus corporate advisors are offering their helpful advice free of charge its regular people who will end up carrying the cost these costs are not an oversight of privatization but their objective the inevitable result of opening up the public sphere to private profit making for more than thirty years in canada such measures have been a tool of an elite agenda promoted by successive liberal and tory governments the transfer of wealth from the poorer to the wealthy from the public trust to the private clutch is it any wonder why most peoples incomes and standard of living have stagnated while those of millionaires has skyrocketed so its not surprise that trudeau doesnt dare call privatization by its name instead his ministers have invented hip ambiguous names like asset recycling and the flywheel of reinvestment to describe their proposed schemes and the public opposition might explain how the liberals proclivity for consultations hasnt extended to this matter because privatization serves the elite it always spawns contempt for democracy take this revelatory example from a decade ago a slide show used by a canadian legal firm as they promoted privatization projects in british columbia one slide describing the obstacles to privatization is entitled inherent diseases the obstacles stakeholders transparency and public justification for corporations chasing endless profits the basic value of democracy are not essential to a healthy thriving society they are a scourge to be avoided all this secrecy euphemism and dismissive rhetoric is meant to obscure a single glaring fact the arguments in favour of privatization are rubbish there is no need to privatize public assets with government borrowing rates at historic lows the liberals could simply take out loans and build infrastructure at a fraction of the cost and forget the notion that were broke this line is regularly peddled by the political and corporate class to distract from the cash much of it accumulated through tax cuts hoarded by canadian corporations at the end of a stunning youd think that trudeaus anti austerity pledge so crucial to his election would have meant putting our hands on some of these obscene corporate profits it has taken scarcely a year for the facade to fall away he has barely shifted canadas taxation structuremeaning government revenue which could be the engine of a bold economic transformation remains at the lowest since the post period and now none other than donald trump has introduced a privatization infrastructure bank proposal strikingly similar to trudeaus will even that not make the liberals blush those of us who anticipated and warned that justin trudeau would continue such policies were shouted down but privatization deregulation and downsizing in the scope and spending of the state this is the neoliberal consensus that continues to grip politics across the continent donald trump has become only its most racist and authoritarian expression trudeau its most glossy and beguiling the transition that canadians want will require enormous levels of spendingand need to be public and paid for by strengthening and reinventing the public sphere the government could unleash a program of mass transit building renovations storm barriers urban redesign and green jobs that reduces emissions racism and inequality all at once but pretending the private sector can lead this is a recipe for
the british government has been given a blunt warning to stay out of the eus post brexit business by a senior leader in the european parliament who lambasted boris johnson for his unbelievable arrogance and insisted britain would have no say any more in the long term future of europe nicola sturgeon the scottish first minister has accused the uk government of sending out a not welcome here message to eu nationals speaking to investors at the annual aberdeen asset management conference in london she said more than anything else our long term economic success will depend on nurturing the talent of those already in scotland and of those who believe ours is the kind of welcoming country that allows ambition to flourish the position of the uk government and some others is very different from the refusal to guarantee the status of fellow eu nationals living in scotland and the uk to the threat to draw up lists of foreign workers the uk government seems intent on sending out a not welcome here message i am determined that we send out a different message one that says to all those living working and studying in scotland that they are most definitely welcome thats all from me for today thanks for the comments my colleague patrick wintour the guardians diplomatic editor seems to agree with sir christopher meyer patrick wintour sir kim darroch uk man in us today briefed uk national security council on the implications of trump election imagine farage doing so november but sir christopher meyer who himself served as britains ambassador in washington has told the independent that that giving the job to nigel farage would be barking mad gideon rachman the financial times foreign affairs columnist thinks that appointing nigel farage as ambassador to the us might not be such a bad idea after all heres an extract from his ft instant insight column what is the first job of a uk ambassador to washington it is to get close to the white house mr farage would have an unprecedented closeness to the us president the kind of access that other british ambassadors could only dream of he campaigned alongside the president elect and after the election had a personal meeting with mr trump well before theresa may was given a perfunctory minutes on the phone ambassador farage could also play an important role in securing one of britains most important foreign policy goals a free trade deal with the us unlike mr farage i believe that britains decision to leave the eu is a disastrous mistake which will inflict long term economic damage on britain but we are where we are given britain has got itself into this absurd situation we need to look for escape routes mr farage is probably one of the few people with a chance of persuading the trump administration to make a us uk trade deal a top priority some of the reasons for rejecting a farage ambassadorship amount to little more than wounded pride yes mr trumps suggestion is a humiliating breach of protocol but frankly it is just a foretaste of the indignities that mr trump is likely to inflict on britain over the next four years the uk statistics authority has reprimanded the department for education for sending out a misleading tweet about grammar schools civil service world reports leading doctors have expressed concern over the impact brexit could have on the nhs workforce the press association reports if there is a dip in the number of european surgeons who work in the nhs there could be a significant problem ian eardley vice president of the royal college of surgeons said he told the house of lords committee on the long term sustainability of the nhs that recent years had seen an increase in the number of european surgeons who were coming to work in the nhs around one in five surgeons in the nhs in england come from the eu mr eardley said he said forty percent of surgeons on specialist registers in this country trained overseas of these half trained in europe and the other half trained outside europe and what has happened in recent years is the number of people coming from outside europe has been diminishing while the numbers coming from within europe has been increasing so if that tap was to be turned off there could be potentially a significant problem certainly for surgery prof jane dacre president of the royal college of physicians told peers up to of our workforce is from the european union we havent done the numbers yet because it is still up in the air i think suffice to say it is not good on monday the department of healths most senior civil servant chris wormald told the public accounts committee that issues surrounding workforce from the eu was one of the main priorities for the departments team working on brexit on the bbcs daily politics mike penning the armed forces minister said that the government was now backing a private members bill that would making posing as a veteran and wearing medals that you have not earned a criminal offence the whole government is going to back this now on friday penning said the bill has been tabled by the conservative mp gareth johnson who says people who pretend they have won medals for courage when that is not the case should be punished accordingly but james glancy a former captain in the royal marines who received the conspicuous gallantry cross for his service in afghanistan told the programme that the bill was unnecessary he said i think its just going too far to suggest someone could go to prison i think its very important to look at whats going on with someone that is actually pretending that they served in the armed forces there may well be a serious mental health problem and actually that person just has low self esteem theyre not a threat
in late march donald trump sat down for a town hall style interview with chris matthews the candidate at the time was still crisscrossing himself on abortion rights should planned parenthood be defunded was roe v wade settled law and matthews made several attempts to pin him down if you say abortion is a crime or abortion is murder you have to deal with it under law matthews said should abortion be punished do you believe in punishment for abortion yes or no as a principle after several dodges trump replied the answer is that there has to be some form of punishment the denunciations came almost as fast as trumps retraction later in the day trump issued a statement saying that a woman should never be punished for an abortion only her doctor but before he could reverse himself a cry went up almost in unison from reproductive rights activists some women are already being punished for having abortions nearly years after the supreme court ruled that women in the united states have a right to a legal abortion self induced abortions are still a significant phenomenon as the guardian reported on monday every year there are potentially thousands of women in the us who attempt to end their pregnancies by themselves some even succeed unwittingly or not these women are operating in murky legal territory only seven states have some law that makes it explicitly illegal for a woman to attempt her own abortion and in most states and at the federal level the law says nothing at all but that hasnt stopped individual prosecutors from going after women who self induce abortions or try all told in the united states a woman who attempts to induce her own abortion may potentially be running afoul of any one of different laws including those against child abuse or drug possession or practicing medicine without a license according to the self induced abortion legal team a project associated with berkeley law and this is not settled law several times after a woman has been jailed and prosecuted a court has ruled that the law under which she was charged didnt apply to women who attempt their own abortions we have gone and created a unique gender based crime where the action actually requires a pregnancy to be a crime lynn paltrow head of the national advocates for pregnant womenlast year georgia prosecutors attempted to charge kenlissa jones with attempted murder after authorities claimed that jones used abortion drugs to self induce a miscarriage arkansas prosecutors charged a year old named anne bynum for allegedly using the same pills the best known of these cases even unfolded in vice president elect mike pences backyard purvi patel an indiana woman apparently used abortion drugs she had obtained over the internet to try to end her pregnancy in its second trimester patel was sentenced to years in prison until an appeals court reduced her sentence a push for pence who later became governor of indiana to clarify whether a state law allowed patels prosecution fell on deaf ears in several instances law enforcement agencies have charged women under laws ostensibly enacted to protect women in december jennifer whalen a pennsylvania woman was charged with offering medical advice about abortion without being medically licensed after she ordered an abortion drug online for her pregnant daughter thirty seven states have similar laws requiring abortion drugs to be administered by a licensed physician its very much on individual prosecutors to make these decisions said lynn paltrow the head of the national advocates for pregnant women which has intervened in some of these cases on behalf of the women charged it does not seem like the national right to life or some other group was encouraging these prosecutions in many of these cases hospital staff or local police are outraged and want to find a way to respond hospital workers or social workers may be horrified and feel personally obligatedjeanne flavin researcher with napwlaurie bertram roberts the head of the mississippi reproductive freedom fund recently encountered a woman whose friend had sent herself to the hospital four times by drinking a home abortion cocktail of turpentine and sugar during her most recent hospitalization doctors threatened to call the police if she tried this again roberts said when we zoom out on this trend i do think that there are a number of things going on hospital workers or social workers may be horrified and feel personally obligated said jeanne flavin a researcher with napw because these decisions are made on such a local level a trump presidency will not necessarily result in an explosion of prosecutions but some predicted it could represent an expansion of the restrictions that cause women to take matters into their own hands in the first place that is something that one could reasonably predict in an environment where abortion becomes even illegal or even more inaccessible than it has been said yamani hernandez the executive director of the national network of abortion funds trump has promised to appoint pro life judges to the supreme court with a potential view toward overturning roe v wade the supreme court decision that established a right to abortion in an interview shortly after he won the presidency trump acknowledged that if roe v wade were struck down some states would ban abortion if the history of abortion before roe is any guide thousands of women would travel across state lines to obtain an abortion every year but many more women would seek out illegal providers or take matters into their own hands on november a tennessee grand jury indicted anna yocca on three felony charges that included aggravated assault and attempted abortion the charges traced back to one day in when yocca climbed into a bathtub and inserted an unravelled wire hanger into her womb she began to bleed excessively her boyfriend rushed her to a hospital where she gave birth to a premature infant the
this bloodbath of an election a friend emailed me like watching someone get murdered another said over the phone and this in an email from a veteran of the vietnam war the third vietnam draft dodger is now commander in chief welcome to the full flowering of the era of trump which began with that now mytho epic glide down the escalator at trump tower where trump commenced his candidacy with these historic words when mexico sends its people theyre not sending their best theyre sending people that have lots of problems and theyre bringing those problems with us theyre bringing drugs theyre bringing crime theyre rapists and some i assume are good people if ever a monument is erected to the trump presidency then surely these words shades of gettysburg will be carved into the marble walls along with blood coming out of her wherever fifty bucks a steak and i would bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding in true demagogic fashion trump bypassed the head and spoke directly to the gut to the biles and bubbling acids of raw emotion he said things that many civil temperate americans hardly dared to admit we carried in ourselves were hardly aware of just how deeply we resented our own niceness how angry our interior lives with all this stuff bottled up years and years of internalized micro aggression from a culture that kept insisting on diversity inclusiveness tolerance many discovered just what a drag political correctness was all these years and to be free of it freed from this code that was jamming us up that was relief akin to a lung puncturing primal scream from the start trumps rallies had the air of the tent revival that same hot thrum of militant exorcism and ecstasy lets not fool ourselves a friend wrote i cant stand anything but cold honesty right now this is not a repub winning the election which would be bad enough this is white supremacy winning calm down were tempted to say its really not that bad stances are taken things get said in the heat of a campaign and we could take heart in the newly gracious conciliatory trump on display for several days after the election then came the news that steve bannon the erstwhile chairman of the trump campaign who bears a striking resemblance to otis the town drunk on the old andy griffith show was named senior counselor and chief strategist for the incoming trump administration the mainstream press still feels compelled to explain the term alt right but we know already we know we know we know white nationalism aka honky purity along with thick glistening lardings of apocalyptic racism and a style sense that falls somewhere between springtime for hitler and queer eye for the straight guy prior to his gig on the trump campaign bannon spent four years as chairman of breitbart news which he proudly declared to be the platform for the alt right as breitbart chairman bannon presided over such headlines as gabby giffords the gun control movements human shield birth control makes women unattractive and crazy and two weeks after a white nationalist murdered nine members of a bible study group at a black church in charleston south carolina hoist it high and proud the confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage find myself not sleeping at night a friend wrote the first president endorsed by the ku klux klan noted another then there was obama being obama on the day after the election we have to remember that were actually all on one team a mans character is his fate as heraclitus said and what a strange twisted fate indeed that barack obama cerebral disciplined cool ever seeking to reconcile and accommodate has had to deal with an opposition that very much regarded him as not on the team there was the birther movement for starters the closet muslim conspiracy theories the terrorist fist bump founder of isis teenage crack dealer hanging out on the corner all this damage hes done to america is deliberate said marco rubio during one of the republican debates which is a laugh if obama wanted to trash the us all he had to do on taking office in was sit on his hands and let the hot mess of the bush economy continue its meltdown to oblivion but the issue is bigger than any particular president after his post election all on one team remark obama continued the point though is that we all go forward with a presumption of good faith in our fellow citizens because that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant and functioning democracy this goes to the heart of the matter the american system of constitutional government is founded on deliberate fragmentation of power the separation of powers and checks and balances that we all learned in high school civics for government to be effective for government to meet the needs of the people the us constitutional order requires a healthy measure of good faith cooperation among the players this good faith began to fray in the early as gop leaders in congress newt gingrich and tom delay chief among them declared war on all efforts even from those in their own party to govern from a stance of bipartisan cooperation democrats in gingrichs world of moral absolutes were the enemy of normal americans gingrich and his allies were fighting no less than a civil war with liberals and as he declared in a speech to the heritage foundation this war has to be fought with a scale and a duration and a savagery that is only true of civil wars and so began the constitutional hardball and scorched earth tactics that have characterized the past quarter century of american politics you may recall the gingrich orchestrated government shutdowns of and over budget disputes and the impeachment of bill clinton for lying about a blowjob in more recent times
canadas role in europenatalie nougayrdes piece describes the canadian virtues of solid democracy tolerance openness and decency and goes on to quote the canadian trade ministers statement that canada is a country that shares european values why wouldnt europeans want to trade with us still many europeans and canadians are leery of the new trade deal so perhaps a different arrangement might work better than the comprehensive economic and trade agreement full membership in the eu it seems there will soon be a vacancy when the uk finally moves towards the exit and canada might make a suitable replacement canadian society is multicultural and proud of it while english is the lingua franca throughout most of canada french is widely spoken increasing numbers of spanish speakers have expanded our linguistic diversity canada fought in europe in both world wars it has paid its dues and the seven years of negotiation that went into ceta have surely paved the way for a canadian application to join the continent with which it has so much in common canadas full membership might make it easier for both parties to accept a mutually advantageous trading relationship canadian republicans might happily exchange the english monarchy and the british commonwealth for a seat in brussels and i think we might feel right at home there george bruce levineottawa canada i do not see any reason why natalie nougayrde calls the anti ceta demonstrators radical left a broad coalition of church union and environmental groups in addition to millions who signed an online petition to stop the trade deal express valid concerns without leaks we the citizens would still not know what was written in the treaty only after the continued protest did the negotiators adopt minute changes where is the democracy even our mps couldnt read it beforehand and everything was in english who in the french or spanish parliaments understood what was written inside nougayrdes democracy argument does not hold only the wallonia parliament dared to speak out against the deal if everyone in the eu were asked chances are a majority would reject the deal eu officialdom must think how it needs to convince citizens of the benefits of free trade what are the benefits for sub saharan africa or the common people in the eu trade deals impoverish the great majority of people which is one of the major reason

have neoliberal free traders who do not want a free market in labour even though labour makes up a significant part of most markets these are just the latest examples of a trend it has been my impression that since the late the western world has been slipping back into a new dark age where decisions are made more and more on the basis of belief mysticism and wish fulfilment than on evidence

evacuation warnings japan earthquake tsunami waves surge up river todays quake was an aftershock of the magnitude earthquake the japan meteorological agency has said but what is the difference heres a handy explainer from the southern california earthquake center seismologists label an earthquake as an aftershock using two guidelines first the earthquake must occur within an aftershock zone which is usually defined as the region within one fault rupture length of the mainshock rupture surface or the area defined by seismologists based on previous aftershock activity second it must happen within this zone before the seismicity rate in the area returns to its pre mainshock level an earthquake that meets these two specific criteria is considered an aftershock pointing out that tuesdays quake was an aftershock of the earthquake the japan meteorological agency also warned that another large quake could be expected within the next few days people in japan have been warned to remain cautious for the next week the magnitude quake was the largest earthquake in the region since the magnitude quake in and some of its immediate aftershocks the japan meteorological agency has said that

hello i just found out that i am four weeks pregnant i cannot carry on with this pregnancy for numerous reasons and i want to have an abortion though it is an option for me in the united states in reality it is not really an option because the to have it done is simply out of the question im hoping you can advise me and are able to help i am absolutely desperate martina read through her email once again and hovered her finger over the send button the message was addressed half a world away to women on web a dutch not for profit group that mails abortion drugs to pregnant women who live in countries where abortion is outlawed martina lives in texas where abortion is restricted but legal making it one of the places where women on web refuses to mail the drugs still martina thought she would try her luck she had lost her job to downsizing and in its place she had found only part time work her rent had gone up lately she was borrowing money for gas there was no question that she couldnt afford to have a child the question was whether she could even afford an abortion martina had an inkling that what she was asking for help performing her own abortion might not be fully legal but she was out of answers she hit send then she began to case the internet for other ways she could cause her own abortion if this scene feels out of place in that may be because there was a time in this countrys history when thousands of back alley and coat hanger abortions prompted calls for the procedure to be legal after the us supreme court established a right to a legal abortion in the decision roe v wade self induced abortions were supposed to become a thing of the past but almost as soon as the court legalized abortion opponents of abortion rights began to whittle them away congress began prohibiting poor women from using medicaid to cover abortions in september obamacare the largest healthcare expansion in decades allowed insurers to continue to pick and choose the circumstances under which they would cover abortion and allowed states to ban the coverage altogether the two decisions have ensured that millions of women who have sought an abortion have had to pay for it out of pocket and a sweeping wave of anti abortion laws has closed clinics in many states cresting with an awesome force over the last five years in such a hostile climate it is no wonder that self induced abortions are still a significant if largely hidden phenomenon one that even pro abortion rights groups are only just beginning to grasp one study of abortion patients found that had tried to at some point in their lives induce their own abortions without professional medical assistance another estimated that potentially of texas women have tried to self induce or at least women its kind of kept under the radar hushed so it needs to be talked about martinathere is no concrete data on how many women in the us have tried to self induce but there is some evidence although it is inconclusive to suggest that self abortion attempts are on the rise from to as the economy worsened and a wave of new restrictions choked abortion access around the country online queries about self induced abortion almost doubled according to seth stephens davidowitz an economist who analyzes google searches into this crisis of reproductive rights now walks donald trump as president trump has promised to restrict abortion even further he has vowed to nominate justices to the supreme court who might overturn roe v wade roe because the court is loath to reverse itself has survived such threats before but trump has explicitly promised to nominate justices who might put roe in their crosshairs in his first major interview after winning office trump described truthfully what might happen to some women if roe v wade were overturned theyll perhaps have to go theyll have to go to another state he said and thats ok he was asked trump replied well well see what happens but we dont have to wait and see what happens history has already shown us what happens when women in the us cant access abortion so has the present day in alone women on web the dutch not for profit received more than emails from us women looking for a way to end their own pregnancies women on web agreed to share scores of these emails with the guardian providing an unprecedented window into the lives of women who feel they have no other option but to end their pregnancies themselves among the hundreds who wrote to women on web was martina she contacted the guardian shortly after she found out about her unwanted pregnancy and shared every step of her journey which eventually took her across an international border she wasnt sure if she faced a potential legal risk and in fact self induction is in a legal gray area and many enterprising prosecutors have charged women who carried out their own abortions with crimes nevertheless martina felt compelled to speak i feel like theres such a negative stigma to this she said its kind of kept under the radar hushed so it needs to be talked about people needed to know she added that abortion restrictions had real victims youre not really helping anyone youre not really protecting anyone youre just causing women who are in these situations who feel desperate to take desperate measures the letters to women on web form a uniform chorus of desperation please and afford and help and fear appear in dozens of places signaling the nature of how these women became stranded now he is threatening me saying i can never leave i am afraid of what he is capable of for a variety of reasons an
because america is entirely governed by two political parties passage of legislation usually requires bipartisan support in us congress however the republican party is the only major political party in the world that denies the need to tackle climate change therefore for several years any hope of passing climate legislation hinged upon breaking through the near universal opposition among republican legislators a number of groups have focused on doing just that in the wake of the us election results i contacted these groups to assess their feelings about the prospects of us government action on climate change in the near future the general sentiment was understandably one of discouraged pessimism but each group identified glimmers of hope citizens climate lobbys success and growthcitizens climate lobby is one of the leading grassroots climate organizations in america and has also expanded rapidly internationally the group has seen explosive growth in recent years now hosting chapters in of americas congressional districts with a membership approaching strong under the ccl proposal carbon pollution is taxed at the source and of the revenue is returned to taxpayers via a regular rebate check its a bipartisan solution liberals get their desired carbon pollution tax while conservatives get a free market policy that doesnt grow the size of government moreover modeling projects that the policy will have a net overall positive effect on the economy citizens climate lobby has also achieved several significant successes the group was involved in spearheading the gibson resolution in which republican members of congress called for action to tackle the risks posed by climate change ccl was also the driving force behind the creation of the house climate solutions caucus a group currently comprised of republican and democratic members of congress exploring bipartisan climate policy solutions and ccl initiated the california state governments resolution urging the federal government to pass a revenue neutral carbon tax according to ccl executive director mark reynolds the election didnt change groups strategy as reynolds told me because democrats are already on board with climate policy as an organization with a long history of working with republicans on climate policy now that the republican party controls us government ccl is now more relevant and important than ever reynolds told me that since the election results traffic to ccls website has increased eightfold and attendance of its weekly introductory calls has spiked from an average of about to last week the majority of americas who are unhappy with the election results have become galvanized which bodes well for grassroots support of climate solutions reynolds also sees an opportunity for republicans to take control of the climate issue after many liberals rallied against a revenue neutral carbon tax proposal in the state of washington this opens up a window for the republican party to take ownership of one of the best policies to tackle climate change as donald trump might put it a revenue neutral carbon tax is a great deal because it efficiently addresses the problem while boosting the economy and the rebate protects american wallets from rising energy prices niskanen center gop could replace regulations with carbon taxthe republican party has thus far opposed all climate policies in congress but the supreme court ruled that the epa must regulate carbon pollution and it began doing so under president obama some have proposed that the easiest way for the gop to eliminate those government climate regulations which party leaders abhor but most republican voters support would be to replace them with free market legislation for example the niskanen center is a free market think tank that supports this type of policy and has proposed swapping epa regulations for a revenue neutral carbon tax the groups president jerry taylor wrote a detailed post about the prospects of a carbon tax under the incoming republican leadership which is well worth reading taylor thinks that republican leaders are now less likely to propose a climate tax than prior to the election for several reasons first they will likely devote the next several years to delaying weakening and or eliminating the epa regulations rather than replacing them because of the supreme court decision eliminating the regulations will be difficult but since trump will appoint at least one justice to the court it may not fully survive legal challenges however if it does survive the next president could fully restore the epa regulations if congress declines to replace them with legislation while this offers a glimmer of hope that the gop could pass a climate bill its doubtful that party leaders will be so forward thinking second the election results made it clear that climate denial will not hurt most republican politicians in elections third while many republican members of congress privately accept the reality of climate change and the need to address it and niskanen has identified several who would be willing to introduce climate legislation if the opportunity were to present itself taylor believes the election results make such a political opportunity less likely r street institute sees other opportunitiesthe r street institute is a free market think tank that has likewise made the conservative case for a revenue neutral carbon tax the groups president eli lehrer believes the chances of carbon tax legislation would have been low regardless of the election outcome as he told me r street energy policy director catrina rorke elaborated where she sees opportunities in cutting carbon pollution under the incoming government climate future looks dim but there are glimmers of hopethese groups were generally pessimistic about the prospects of a climate bill coming from the next congress but they did spot glimmers of hope and the future isnt set in stone in its congressional lobbying effort ccl reported that republican members of congress were times more likely to be receptive to the groups message than to be hostile up from a to ratio just two years ago many gop policymakers recognize the threats posed by climate change at least in private as jerry taylor noted
former french president nicolas sarkozys political career has been effectively ended after he was dealt a humiliating defeat on sunday by his former prime minister franois fillon in the first round of the race to choose the rightwing republican partys candidate for the presidency next spring fillon a socially conservative free market reformer who admires margaret thatcher and voted against same sex marriage came close to winning the nomination straight out with around of the poll he now faces a second round runoff against more moderate alain jupp the mayor of bordeaux who was prime minister under jacques chirac the divisive former president sarkozy suffered a humiliating defeat knocked out of the race after he ran a hard right campaign on french national identity targeting muslims and minorities his poor score after a campaign in which he suggested banning muslim headscarves from universities and was forced to protest his innocence faced with several legal investigations into corrupt campaign financing showed he had become just as much a hate figure on the right as on the left who is franois fillon the man who ended sarkozy dream read morefillon and jupp now have one week to do battle over who could better unite french voters against the far right in a country struggling with mass unemployment economic sluggishness and the threat of terrorism donald trumps us win has thrown the spotlight on france as the next place for a possible shake up of the political system polls have consistently shown that the front national leader marine le pen will make it to the french presidential final round runoff next may but that it would be difficult for her to win fillon a year old paris mp is the the epitome of the traditional provincial right he is a catholic from a village in north west france where he lived in a century chateau with his welsh wife and their five children during a long career in local politics a tea drinking anglophile he has broken ranks with the long running statist tradition of the french right to propose the most radical pro business reform programme vowing to cut a staggering public sector jobs over five years attacked for going too far with proposed state cuts by jupp fillon said in his final rally im tagged with an economically liberal label in the same way one would paint crosses on the doors of lepers in the middle ages but im just a pragmatist when he became prime minister in fillon caused friction with sarkozy by declaring that france was almost bankrupt fillon voted against same sex marriage when it was introduced by the socialist president franois hollande and had the support of the traditional catholic right claiming to stand for christian family values he has campaigned against medically assisted procreation for

he referred to french colonialism as france sharing our culture fillon has called for a rapprochement with the russian president vladimir putin on syria after the us election he welcomed a new

round of voting on november whoever wins that vote will instantly become the favourite to take the presidency next spring jupp has led a centrist campaign promising economic reform and rejecting what he called the suicidal identity politics of sarkozy which he warned would deepen rifts in french society over the past few months he had consistently topped polls as frances favourite politician after undergoing a staggering image transformation from the when he was the most loathed french prime minister in modern times after million people took to the streets in protest against his pension changes in jupp received a month suspended sentence and was barred from holding elected office for a year over a scheme that illegally put workers for chiracs party on the payroll of the paris town hall although it is accepted that he did not profit personally and was seen as having taken the flak for chirac some critics warn the case could come back to haunt him during a fierce presidential campaign since trumps election critics have warned he would seem too old school establishment against le pen with echoes of the us campaign i am not hillary clinton and france is not america he said this week insisting he could be trusted to take swift action on major reform the candidates economic programmes are similar they agree on lowering public spending ending the hour week scrapping frances wealth tax cutting varying levels of state jobs and overhauling welfare the deeply unpopular socialist president franois hollande will make an announcement next month on whether he intends to run for re election hollande is said to have been boosted by fillons strong showing feeling it would be easier for the left to unite against fillon and dismiss him as a french thatcher it was the first time the french right had held an open us style primary race to choose its candidate and turnout was high any voter who signed a charter saying they agreed with
for someone who made his career writing about and founding media organisations rafat ali is surprisingly downbeat about what they can achieve if anything the trump election has shown that we are ascribing too much value to what media can do he says a week after donald trumps victory it has its role it has to continue to do its role its even more important today but the view that it will somehow change the world and change peoples minds or give people the right path its just too much to ask hes not alone in doubting the extent of the established medias influence following an election result which almost no outlet predicted and very few supported but in the post election autopsy many commentators have said at least some of the blame should be laid at the door of facebook and its fake news filled filter bubbles ali shares their concerns particularly about the parallel world where people have no connection to reality in which many millions of us citizens appear to live just the fact of what they believe about muslims that hillary is doing this or obama is doing this its just crazy but he says many of the complaints from those working in tv or newspapers stem from an unrealistic belief in their own impact i think that while obviously this is a huge problem we are trying to get out of media way more than its capable of giving he says its not like if the majority of the media goes away or a big proportion of the media goes away that suddenly people are going to miss it ali has first hand experience of the impermanence of media from paidcontent his first company which lasted not much more than a decade he launched the site in taking what was then a relatively novel approach by applying lessons from one part of the media such as the recording industry to other areas such as newspapers which were grappling with the disruptive powers of the internet it was acquired in by guardian media group for an undisclosed sum in the millions of pounds it was run as a standalone business and ali stayed until before leaving to travel the world for two years in early gmg sold paidcontent to another digital media site gigaom which later that year shuttered the brand and itself closed in meanwhile ali had returned from his trip with a plan to apply paidcontents connecting the dots approach to the world of travel and in the summer of he launched a business called skift with travel journalist jason clampet while most of those writing about the travel industry were focused on one sector such as airlines or hotels ali based his plan on the realisation that travellers simply see an end to end process of getting around the world that seemed to leave a gap for a media organisation taking a more holistic approach while writing in a less stuffy more accessible way than the established trade press in the early days ali who operated as skifts chief executive planned to use the sites reporting as a foundation from which to sell data about travel starting with the way it was marketed online however things did not go to plan and while trying to drum up investment in he hit a brick wall i wasnt able to raise the round he says it was the most humbling six months of my professional career we were three months away from running out of money we were or people at that point we had a famous as in famous in our company moment when we went to iceland for our first off site it was a very seminal moment for us as it was supposed to be a celebration of us closing the round ali and the team tried to work out how to continue growing without any outside investment the answer was to drop plans to sell data and focus on more established ways of making money in skifts case research events and advertising two and a bit years later ali says the business is now profitable with double digit revenue growth heading for upwards of a year within the next months traffic is not huge around million visitors a month but skifts priority is its list of email subscribers which stands at more than the company now employs close to people mostly at its new york headquarters and is expanding into europe with hires such as a uk editor based in london though he chose to build his second company around travel ali did not stop wading into arguments about the travails of established media companies including the guardian he says most mainstream outlets are operating more like drive by media where you hope and pray you show up in a feed but he doesnt pretend to have all the answers i dont have a prescription for any of those people he says its hard always even in our business which is doing very well people say oh my god you guys are doing so well and i say yes then i look back thinking holy shit if they knew how hard it is to build a media company its always going to be hard and trumps victory is going to make things harder not just for the media but also the travel industry which ali says is facing a huge challenges from the insular ideologies that are taking over western politics i think trump has already said a lot of things that will enervate people coming to the us even if he does half the things he said it will have a bad effect on the travel industry his rhetoric stands directly opposite to what the promise of travel stands for the most progressive expression of human curiosity fringe is the new mainstream it is worrying for everyone especially for europe which sits at the centre of immigration issues is there
in january the republican party will take control of the us government for the first time since the switch from being the party of opposition to being the governing party is never easy and the deep divisions in todays republican party make todays transition unusually chaotic the election added to the chaos as president elect trumps evident dismay and lack of preparation for taking office suggested that he had little interest in doing the job for which he had campaigned so viciously whats more trump lost the popular vote by a significant margin and democrats also got more votes for both houses of congress this lack of popular support puts even more pressure on republicans to craft policies that a majority of americans can accept therein lies the republicans problem todays party is led not by practical politicians but by ideologues this was not always the case traditionally republicans embraced the idea that americans naturally enjoyed social and economic harmony it was the job of congressmen and women to develop that harmony by figuring out how to use the government to promote equality of opportunity for those just starting their climb up the economic ladder those individuals were the engine room of production they would produce more than they could consume so they would in turn support a thriving middle class when he was elected president in the first republican to be elected to the job since dwight eisenhower accepted the reality that unregulated capitalism and the lack of a social safety net in a newly industrialised country precipitated economic and social crisis although it sprang from traditional republicanism rather than the tenets of the democrats eisenhowers middle way looked much like the democrats new deal this new liberal consensus between democrats and republicans maintained that the government had a role in promoting economic fairness and social stability but it sparked a backlash one we can still see playing itself out today a few wealthy businessmen insisted that government regulation infringed their liberty by affecting the way they did business taxes to fund social welfare also hampered their freedom they stood firm on the concept of individual liberty which was they argued as firm as a principle as those of the ten commandments these movement conservatives saw an epic battle between themselves and liberals whose embrace of government activism was permitting communism to snake its way into america but movement conservatives had a practical problem most americans government regulation of business and social welfare to advance their cause movement conservatives turned to racism when the us supreme court handed down the brown v board of education decision requiring desegregation in schools leading movement publication pushed the idea that an active government used white tax dollars to benefit black americans suddenly the arguments of movement conservatives began to get traction in they got their chance to restore america to purity republican candidate barry goldwaters supporters called for an end to civil rights legislation a new voice in the movement added conspiracy theory and populism to what had been an elite conversation phyllis schlafly president of the illinois federation of republican women accused the eastern financiers and banking interests who made up the eastern establishment of backing the liberal consensus because they made money from a murky world of international co operation she backed goldwater as he offered a clear vision of a nation that stood against communism enough with eggheads who called for nuanced responses to complicated problems in the world what should americans do about communism stop it goldwaters presidential run turned into a rout but the electoral map offered a blueprint for future republican candidates goldwater carried his home state of arizona and five other states all of them in the deep south race became a staple in movement conservatives lexicon later richard nixon added sexism and a distrust of organised labour to the racism that had clinched his election he told supporters that some people wanted to live by government handouts rather than by working and that these lowlifes were sucking hardworking americans dry through tax dollars in ronald reagan implanted this bifurcated world view into the white house the election of democrat bill clinton horrified them he was a popular statist who threatened to undo all the work they had done to destroy government programmes they set out to destroy his administration in when movement conservatives under newt gingrich captured the house for the first time since the eisenhower administration they set out to begin an emergency dismantling of the welfare system which is shredding the social fabric bankrupting the country and gutting the work ethic educational performance and moral discipline of the poor they set out to defund the government entirely in the hope that debt would end expenditures newt gingrich muslims who believe in sharia law should be expelled from us read moreby movement conservatives laid siege to remaining traditional republicans in the party purging it of those they called rinos republicans in name only they turned to texas governor george w bush as their presidential nominee and when he squeaked into office after losing the popular vote declared he had a mandate bush slashed taxes and regulations and brought evangelicals directly into white house deliberations barack obamas election represented everything republicans opposed he was a black man who promised to use the government to help women and people of colour taxed enough already screamed protesters who called themselves tea partiers when obamas foreign policy signalled a return to a multilateralism that recognised the end of americas post second world war dominance movement conservatives howled in republicans built on the tea party anger with the money of wealthy businessmen to take control of swing state legislatures in however the winking of republican leaders at the racism and sexism of obama bashers backfired they found themselves trailing in the wake of a reality show tv star who stripped the veneer off their dog whistle rhetoric and openly called mexicans rapists and criminals and talked about women
say what you like about past presidents and their international legacies but its hard to dispute the caliber of their national security advisers from henry kissinger to colin powell from zbig brzezinski to sandy berger from condi rice to susan rice the list is a long line in smart seasoned and strategic thinkers until now donald trumps decision to pick lt gen michael flynn as his most senior national security aide is a rupture with the past and with sane foreign policy flynn is a conspiracy theorist and islamophobe who hangs around the darker corners of the white nationalist internet he also lost his last job in the intelligence services i suspect because he cant manage his way out of a paper bag all of which would be mildly amusing if flynn wasnt about to take on a job that will determine the immediate fate of large parts of the globe the presidents national security adviser plays a unique role inside the west wing unlike almost every other corner of the presidency national security is unquestionably controlled exclusively by the commander in chief trump and flynn make bush and cheney look like tenured professors of military historyshort of declaring war and obtaining a defense budget the president needs nobody elses say so to unleash the worlds most powerful military intelligence services and diplomatic corps which is why the national security adviser is normally a stable wise character who can sift through mountains of intelligence maintain a clear sense of strategic priorities in the national interest and wrangle the sprawling bureaucracy these are all qualities that are hardly obvious in michael flynn flynn has falsely claimed that shariah law is spreading across the united states and that the nation is in the midst of a world war with radical islamists fear of muslims is rational he tweeted earlier this year flynn previously ran the defense intelligence agency but lost his job after two years because of clashes with officials for his part flynn claims he was fired because he opposed the obama administrations view that islamist terrorists were a fading threat like his new boss flynn appears very comfortable with the current russian regime working with russia today the kremlins propaganda tv network he apparently received classified intelligence briefings while running a lobbying firm for foreign clients he seems to favor working with russia to combat islamist terrorists while turning a blind eye to russias designs on ukraine and its support for the assad regime in syria as trumps trusted adviser sitting in on his daily intelligence briefings flynns early record on advising the president elect is shockingly undiplomatic haphazard at best and unethical at worst in the brief time since he won the election trumps first call with a world leader was not with a trusted us ally but with the egyptian dictator president al sisi he sat with prime minister abe of japan this week but his aides told the japanese not to believe every word trump said he met with the populist right wing british politician nigel farage before meeting the british prime minister theresa may but he somehow found time to meet with several indian real estate developers to discuss his property interests with them and the trump organization signed a kolkata deal on friday amid his many interactions with foreign powers trump is speaking without briefing papers from the state department because his transition team is in such chaos that they have yet to establish meaningful contact with the nations foreign policy professionals heck of a job flynnie we are condemned to repeat history if we choose to forget it and donald trumps voters have chosen to forget the lessons of the last republican president after eight years of recovery from the catastrophe of george w bushs national security decisions we are now staring at the prospect of an even more impetuous set of decision makers trump and flynn make bush and cheney look like tenured professors of military history never mind that trump spent most of the presidential campaign pretending he opposed bushs war in iraq when in fact he supported it so far as anyone can fathom his position it was to pick the winning position after the outcome was clear when a leader is both boastful and indecisive the leadership vacuum is filled by aides who feed into the posturing but compensate for the indecision flynn fills that trump shaped hole perfectly but we know where this leads cheney cherry picked manipulated intelligence reports to build a case for the war in iraq that was the single worst us national security decision in a generation we are still living with its consequences today with isis and a global refugee crisis that is unthinkable without the iraq war condoleezza rice bushs national security adviser was unable to control the hawks inside the cabinet even as she leaned towards the doves flynn doesnt need to control any hawks because he is leading the pack the opportunity for flynn to cherry pick intelligence is almost limitless with his public hatred of islam and his desire to wage a war of religion the case for military action will be simple inside the trump west wing it may be time to concede that one of the biggest winners of this election is the twisted and murderous worldview distilled by osama bin laden unlike bush and obama trump and flynn believe we are engaged in a war with islam just as al qaida and isis believe they are engaged in a war with christianity and judaism the jihadists have infected their enemies with their own sickness to be fair this infection had been growing for many years before trump started running for office it broke out when congress democrats and republicans voted against the closure of guantnamo bay it is obvious in much of the worlds refusal to deal with the syrian refugee crisis but now the sickness has given us trump and flynn to escalate a religious fueled
robert john burck better known as the naked cowboy sings and plays guitar outside trump tower photograph mike segar reuterspresident elect donald trump has settled the multi state class action fraud lawsuit over the now defunct trump university for million according to new york attorney general eric schneiderman in my office sued donald trump for swindling thousands of innocent americans out of millions of dollars through a scheme known at trump university donald trump fought us every step of the way filing baseless charges and fruitless appeals and refusing to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university today that all changes todays million settlement agreement is a stunning reversal by donald trump and a major victory for the over victims of his fraudulent university i am pleased that under the terms of this settlement every victim will receive restitution and that donald trump will pay up to million in penalties to the state of new york for violating state education laws the victims of trump university have waited years for todays result and i am pleased that their patience and persistence will be rewarded by this million settlement donald trump announced the nomination of alabama senator jeff sessions as attorney general and kansas congressman mike pompeo as director of the central intelligence agency as well as the selection of retired lt gen michael flynn to serve as his national security advisor sessions one of trumps earliest backers during the republican primary campaign has served in the senate since and served as

nomination of sessions to serve as the next attorney general thirty years ago a different republican senate rejected senator sessions nomination to a federal judgeship in doing so that senate affirmed that there can be no compromise with racism no negotiation with hate today a new republican senate must decide whether self interest and political cowardice will prevent them from once again doing

the imprisonment of hillary clinton and before he came to view an entire religion as responsible for terrorism he issued a public plea for nuance in intelligence ret lt gen mike flynn photograph alex wong getty imagesin flynn followed his longtime friend from the elite joint special operations command stanley mcchrystal to afghanistan their partnership had transformed jsoc into an apparatus that collected and disseminated intelligence as rapidly as it killed people and then fed that intelligence back into its internal systems to accelerate the lethal process as with jsoc mcchrystal would command the war and flynn would run its intelligence shop but flynn soon considered the entire us intelligence apparatus in afghanistan to be focusing on the wrong targets the trouble in flynns estimation was that us intelligence focused too much on the taliban insurgency it gave comparatively little emphasis on granular data about trends among afghans themselves which at the time the coterie of counterinsurgents around mcchrystal considered decisive win the people the thinking went and the insurgency would lose the base of support necessary to survive in a rare move for a serving intelligence officer flynn took his critique public the most salient problems in afghanistan are attitudinal cultural and human he wrote in a january paper for the center for a new american security at that point the ascendant defense thinktank and a job pipeline into the obama pentagon m erely killing insurgents usually serves to multiply enemies rather than subtract them commanders flynn and his co authors wrote needed information including census data and patrol debriefs minutes from shuras with local farmers and tribal leaders polling data and atmospherics reports from psychological operations and female engagement teams refocusing on population centric information the authors wrote was crucial to victory it would admittedly offer few clues about where to find insurgents but it would provide elements of even greater strategic importance a map for leveraging popular support and marginalizing the insurgency itself the paper which took many in intelligence circles by surprise was the first time most outside the military had encountered flynn it made his career in washington michael

polled crowds about his running mate and floated improbable names to the press who are trump attorney general national security adviser and cia chief read moretrump has weeks to decide nominations to

posts said that disgraced general david petraeus the former director of the cia is being considered for the position of secretary of state petraeuss nomination would prove ironic however in light of

france votes this weekend to choose the rightwing candidate likely to face the far right marine le pen in next springs presidential election just as donald trumps us win has thrown the spotlight on france as the scene of the next possible shakeup of the political system polls have consistently shown that le pen head of the far right front national will make it to the french presidential final round run off next may but that it would be difficult for her to win the three leading contenders in the open primary race to choose the rights candidate on sunday are all establishment figures two former prime ministers alain jupp and franois fillon and the former president nicolas sarkozy for weeks they have been fighting over who could better unite french voters against the far right in a country still struggling with mass unemployment and a major terrorism threat jupp the mayor of bordeaux who served as prime minister under jacques chirac in is frances most popular politician and has for months been the favourite he has led a centrist campaign pledging pro business reform but also promoting social harmony against hard right identity politics vowing i wont turn people in france against each other jupp has undergone a staggering image transformation since the when he was the most loathed french prime minister in modern times and million people took to the streets in protest against his pension changes in he received a month suspended sentence and was barred from holding elected office for a year over a corrupt scheme that illegally put workers for jacques chiracs party on the payroll of the paris town hall although it is accepted that he did not profit personally and was seen as having taken the flak for chirac the case could come back to haunt him during a fierce presidential campaign since trumps election critics have warned he would seem too old school establishment against le pen with echoes of the us campaign i am not hillary clinton and france is not america he said this week insisting he could be trusted to take swift action on major reform sarkozys bid for a political comeback is seen as his last chance in french politics he has led a hardline campaign on identity politics targeting muslims and minorities denying climate change and unashamedly veering into le pens far right territory sarkozy remains a divisive figure in france but he has loyal core support in his les rpublicains party which is expected to turn out massively to vote he wants to ban the muslim headscarf from universities and public companies limit the french nationality rights of children born of foreign parents and has insisted that children who dont eat pork should lose their special school dinner options and instead eat chips although he supported clinton in the us election since trumps win he has styled himself as anti elite and has promised to go against all that is politically correct his campaign has been hampered by legal woes including when the french state prosecutor recommended he should face a criminal trial over alleged illegal campaign funding in the final campaign debate on thursday night sarkozy was quizzed about fresh claims that he received millions in funding from the late libyan leader muammar gaddafi towards his campaign sarkozy had no answer and losing his cool said the question was disgraceful franois fillon sarkozys former

children he voted against same sex marriage when it was introduced by the current socialist government and surged in the polls after publishing a book on the fight against radical islam saying no there isnt a religious problem in france yes there is a problem linked to islam he said the solution was not to target law abiding muslims but to target fundamentalism the candidates economic programmes are however similar lowering public spending curbing the hour week scrapping frances wealth tax cutting state jobs and overhauling welfare the younger political generation has so far failed to take the lead in the primary race the two youngest candidates former ministers nathalie kosciusko morizet and bruno le maire arent expected to reach the final run off the deep unpopularity of

ron wyden is taking donald trump at his word much of official washington is wondering whether trump will implement the agenda that won him the presidency some of trumps defenders like tech investor peter thiel contend that trump should not be taken literally but the democratic senator from oregon shows no signs of interest in that discussion as perhaps the democratic partys premier civil libertarian on capitol hill his anticipation of the trump administration starts from the perspective that the president elect will govern as he campaigned against muslims against immigrants for torture for surveillance wyden from his perch on the intelligence committee is preparing for a four year battle were going to have to make sure now that a political agenda doesnt replace a set of constitutional priorities thats the heart of it wyden said in an interview with the guardian this week wyden is one of the few national politicians who can plausibly claim to have fought national security abuses and championed civil liberties with equal vigor in the george w bush and barack obama administrations he is far more comfortable discussing policies or proposals than he is discussing personalities opting to refer to trump simply as the president elect you look at some of what the president elect has to say and it certainly ought to be a wake up call from the standpoint of potential abuse of power wyden said a quote sticking in wydens mind these days is one trump issued in july after the democratic national committee hack which us intelligence has blamed on russia trump discussing his political opponents mused honestly i wish i had that power id love to have that power by january it will no longer be hypothetical barely a week after the election wyden conceded that its probably early for strategy but he said he has early priorities for racking up wins in order to provide privacy cybersecurity and civil liberties advocates with the momentum needed to take on the trump administration one is to block a measure wyden said is still alive in the intelligence authorization bill that would provide the fbi with powers to scour americans browser history without court oversight there his approach is straightforward running the clock out on the current congress and scour all these bills to see it doesnt get added to any other piece of legislation but congressional inertia can cut against him as well on december an impending change to the federal rules of criminal procedure will vastly expand law enforcements ability to remotely hack suspect electronic devices unbound by jurisdiction opponents have few options as the change known as rule will take effect if congress does what it does best which is nothing wyden said we understand our backs are against the wall he and his allies including democratic senator chris coons and gop senator mike lee are attempting to delay the change when trump officially takes over the stakes will escalate perhaps most urgent is trumps proposal to create a database of muslims which is just light years away from what you can debate is constitutional wyden said i will use my opportunities on the intelligence committee as a member of the democratic caucus the bully pulpit that i have to drive that message from one end of the country to another that would be unconstitutional wyden said by the end of will come an epic fight against the intelligence agencies over surveillance they will seek the renewal of an expiring legal provision known as section of the foreign intelligence surveillance act that permits a vast dragnet of data collection to include americans international communications our fight to reform also got a lot more important as the result of the election wyden said similarly he considers trumps call this year to boycott apple over its encryption battle with the fbi indicative of antipathy to privacy protective cybersecurity wyden said he will fight the trump administration and again democrats and republicans in the congress who propose weakening encryption telling vice he would filibuster any such effort unprompted wyden anticipates relitigating the years old fight against torture an issue prospectively settled under obama though anything but when it comes to addressing the cias history with trump were going to have to deal with that again a first step he is planning will be attempting to ensure the committees landmark torture report isnt destroyed a very real possibility if it escapes legal limbo to return to a panel now controlled by report opponent richard burr of north carolina trumps allies are signaling that a legal prohibition on cia torture enacted in is not an immovable obstacle on cnn this week pete hoekstra a former house intelligence committee chairman said thatd be a process youd have to work through with congress and youd probably do it in secret and you probably wouldnt do it through the public process it remains to be seen if wyden would have access to such secret decisions even from his perch on the intelligence committee the trump administration could revert to a process of keeping the full committee from learning most intelligence practices wydens very good relationship with incoming ranking panel democrat mark warner of virginia will become critical to those efforts yet wyden might have had warners perch he was next in line to take the ranking membership with dianne feinsteins departure a move that would have strengthened wydens opportunities for oversight over the intelligence agencies in the age of trump enormously doing so would have meant he would have had to give up his position on the finance committee and wyden considered his potential loss of influence over healthcare trade enforcement and technology policies too high a price to the consternation of some of his allies outside government in this horror show context congressional oversight is more important than it has ever been before we would have preferred senator wyden leave his chair on the finance committee and take the ranking chair on the intelligence committee
in his first televised interview as president elect donald trump gave a glimpse into his plans for large scale deportations he suggested his administration would initially target million undocumented immigrants for removal people who he branded criminals gang members drugs dealers but even a cursory analysis of trumps target number of deportations shows that he will have to deport far more than undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes the incoming trump administration will try to implement the harshest immigration regime in presidential history with his closest advisers making clear they will seek to expedite these deportations and those deported are likely to include a far greater number of those who have lived in the us for years perhaps experts warn even those who are in the us on temporary visas or green cards the us already deports vast numbers of undocumented immigrants during the first six years of his tenure barack obama deported two and a half million people under the guise of ridding the us of criminals gang bangers and people who are hurting the community obamas rhetoric was somewhat misleading a new york times investigation found that two thirds of those deported by the administration by had only minor criminal convictions or none at all this underlies the impossibility of trumps pledge there simply are not enough people who match his description as serious criminals to deport and many speculate the targets he wants to reach will mean not only dramatically broadening the scope of deportations to meet targets but also seriously curtail any oversight within the system its important to point out that obama was actively trying to deport a record number of people and even he hit two and a half million over two terms said grace meng a senior immigration researcher at human rights watchs us program so the idea of to million whether its immediately or even within a couple of years would require a system that really defies our imagination of what a fair system might be in the absence of official data the migration policy institute estimates about of the roughly million undocumented migrants living in america are likely to have a criminal conviction with only projected to hold a felony conviction since november the obama administration has actively targeted this cohort of individuals they have drastically reduced the number of interior deportations those involving apprehensions that occur away from the border and usually involve individuals who have lived in the us for years by activating a priority enforcement program this program sees immigration and customs enforcement ice agents prioritise undocumented arrestees picked up by state or local law enforcement who are found to have serious felonies gang affiliations or terror suspicions but even under this new policy ice data obtained under the freedom of information act by researchers at the university of iowa and reported here for the first time highlights that a tiny fraction of total deportations in involved individuals convicted of a violent crime while were deported with no recorded criminal history at all to get to to million will mean a dramatic rewriting of who or what is a criminalprofessor karthick ramakrishnan uc riversideto get to to million deportations will mean a dramatic rewriting of who or what is a criminal and rewriting that definition in a way that involves acts most americans would not consider to be a crime said professor karthick ramakrishnan an immigration researcher at the university of california riverside and author of framing immigrants it would also mean considering not just undocumented immigrants but people here who are on temporary visas or green cards that have committed minor crimes like shoplifting or dui trumps advisers have now acknowledged their net will need to widen and have started explaining that the administration will seek to deport not just convicted criminals but also those accused of a crime or gang affiliation as well as those charged with minor immigration violations such as illegal re entry some have argued that trumps new immigration regime could simply use the tools left over from the so called deportation machines created by both the bush and obama administrations but the sheer scale of trumps project and the perceived desire to act quickly will probably require legislative action through congress to enhance and expand the effectiveness of these devices in august trump pledged to restore the secure communities program the precursor to the priority enforcement program which was utilised by both the bush and obama administration until the program allowed federal authorities to conduct broader less targeted sweeps of undocumented arrestees held by local authorities and allowed ice agents to request that local jails detain suspects past their release date in order to allow more time to transfer them to federal detention facilities in the same speech trump also pledged to expand agreements between ice and local law enforcement which allow local police officers to carry out certain functions of immigration law enforcement directly ice reportedly credited these partnerships with identifying more than potentially removable aliens between and according to politifact but local law enforcement officials most notably the maricopa county sheriffs office in arizona were routinely criticized for discriminatory policing and as a result the obama administration substantially rolled back their use in trumps promise to expand or reinstate both these programs is a strong indication the new administration will significantly intensify interior deportations but these removals have markedly declined since obama entered office from in to last year as the outgoing administration particularly in its second term focused on deportations at the border many of which occur through an expedited removal process that requires no hearing in court this sharpening of the interior deportation machine will leave a number of institutions in the crosshairs for reform said conservative analysts close to trumps transition team first the trump administration will probably focus on streamlining civil immigration proceedings in court said dan stein president of the federation for american immigration reform the different kinds of changes that would be made in
are we turning our backs on the age of enlightenment reading the rightwing press in britain would suggest we have its editors and commentators have sought to turn liberalism the enlightenments political gift into a dirty word newspapers have derided liberalism and all its works ridiculing those who espouse it and praising the people for rejecting it as evidence they point to the peoples revolt in britain against the european union and the peoples revolt in the united states against the political elite the brexit vote has unleashed a storm of anti liberal tirades the liberal left are political orphans their entire world view is in tatters wrote allister heath in the daily telegraph us voters who plumped for donald trump were protesting at a complacent liberal elite that had ignored them for too long wrote dominic sandbrook in the daily mail and they were also rejecting multiculturalism militant feminism internationalism and social liberalism trump recognised that it was the liberal elite in washington who were guilty of denying citizens the opportunity to succeed wrote jacob rees mogg in the times on both sides of the atlantic there has been a backlash against a prevailing liberalism wrote rod liddle in the spectator in addition plenty of newspaper leading articles since the eu referendum have scorned liberalism for its supposed failures and at this point you may well think i am about to scorn the scorners i am not i do not share their distaste for liberalism but like all good liberals i seek to understand and not to decry and i think heath sandbrook rees mogg liddle and assorted anonymous leader writers do raise concerns that we have tended to ignore it would appear that the fracturing of the british population as exemplified by brexit and the erosion of the two main political parties notably labour is a failure to sell liberalism now there is common cause between the ideologues of the right and the majority of the working class in two previous postings one in december last year and another in june this year i attempted to get to grips with the disconnect between the labour party at westminster and its traditional working class voters across the country i have been provoked to go further down that road after reading a controversial essay by joan c williams for the harvard business review what so many people dont get about the us working class i dont go with her all the way but her polemic contains insights that are applicable to the development of the british working class anyone who spent hours trudging from door to door on council estates in the early trying and failing to persuade residents to join a marxist party and make revolution as i did will recognise the sad truth of williamss analysis it was apparent that large swathes of the british working class did not have a socialist bone in their bodies nor it transpired were they turned on by social democracy on the doorsteps there was a clear lack of empathy for liberal political ideals with overt racism and sexism by that time more than a generation on from the post war labour landslide many people were voting labour out of habit rather than conviction and many were of course voting tory the much derided cloth cap conservatives a large number embracing the meritocratic spirit unleashed in the mid were eager to climb the social ladder if unable to accomplish it themselves then they were happy to help their children up the rungs but not all of them and arguably the majority were necessarily interested in adopting the ethos of the middle class their cultural values remained intact money counted more than refinement although keen to earn more they were unconvinced that trade unions were much help organised labour was giving way to individualism a change grasped by the sun from the mid onwards and totally misread by the daily mirror however there was also a significant section of the working class that was not interested at all in advancement famously described by marx as the lumpenproletariat they were rare and reluctant voters although i suspect many did vote in the eu referendum meanwhile the labour party at national level was gradually becoming for want of a better phrase professionalised a growing number of its university educated mps were no longer as recognisably working class as the people who voted for them tony blairs electoral success stemmed from his engagement with the middle class despite introducing reforms that benefited the working class new labour was not as appreciated as it should have been partially because of the liberalism that accompanied the policies as for the tory party its westminster intake was also changing the grouse moor was past many conservative members had been educated in state schools and or were drawn from business backgrounds plenty were identifiable as having working class backgrounds over time working class voters would come to perceive little difference between labour and tory mps westminster was growing ever more remote from the majority of the population they represented an elite was under construction in the us according to williams a social class movement was also occurring in somewhat similar fashion starting in she writes many blue collar whites were voting republican her essay refers only to americas white working class but in many respects the political attitudes she traces echo the british experience referring to a class culture gap she argues that class migrants adopted a new outlook towards politics and as importantly the people inhabiting senior positions whether at their own workplace or in the professions the white working class she writes did not dream of becoming upper middle class with its different food family and friendship patterns the dream is to live in your own class milieu where you feel comfortable just with more money im unsure whether it holds for the british working class but i suspect there is something to it more pertinently there is
a man who uses misogynistic language and has been accused of sexual assault is soon to become the president of the united states of america for feminists desperate to see the countrys first female president the result was devastating how could someone with such disregard for womens rights become leader donald trump boasted about being able to freely grope women because he is famous and by the end of the race different women had come forward to accuse him of sexual assault he also suggested during his campaign that women should face some form of punishment for having abortions before backtracking and saying states and congress should take the lead with lawmaking on this matter after the publication of a video in which he describes grabbing women by the pussy experts and many non experts predicted that hed lost the female vote but this turned out to be incorrect it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their actionslauraaccording to cnn exit polls of white women voted for trump those without a college degree supported trump over democrat candidate hillary clinton by nearly two to one white women with a college degree only narrowly voted in favour of clinton by six percentage points by contrast of black women and of latinas voted for clinton some feminists are finding it difficult to comprehend why women werent so offended by trumps misogyny that they voted for clinton en mass we interviewed women across america to find out why they voted for trump and why they describe themselves as feminists heres what they said laura a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or expected she thinks and makes her own choicesgovernment worker laura who lives in the much fought over state of florida voted for trump she describes herself as socially moderate financially independent and educated every female i know either friends or co workers except for one voted for trump i want to show it was not only men or non college educated citizens that voted trump i am an economic conservative who is registered as a non party affiliate i feel that trump has the best economic polices to create jobs and therefore rebuild the economy i truly thought the video of trump was as its been dubbed locker room talk having two brothers boyfriends and a fiance i can make an educated guess that all heterosexual men have bragged about their exploits with women to another man at some point i believe in equality between the sexes i have the right and capability to make my own decisions and live the life i choose for myself because i am a feminist i know and exercised my right not to be put in a box or voting group and to freely think and make my own judgment as to who i thought would be the best candidate for president it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their actions a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or expected she thinks and makes her own choices i thought the sexual allegations were unsubstantiated and therefore equivalent to rumours and campaign mudslinging if these women had truly been assaulted why wait until one month before the election to come forward to the press not the authorities i thought it incredibly hypocritical to characterise him as a sexual predator when we know for a fact that bill clinton is one and hillary helped him cover it up through libel and slander of the women who did come forward this didnt change my opinion about him except for maybe a more sympathetic attitude and feeling that the media was treating him unfairly a persons gender has no bearing whatsoever in their qualifications for a job including the presidency hillary was not clear as to what her policies as president would be except to maybe continue with the same failed practices her policies would not have helped our depressed and stagnant economy i believe trumps plans for job creation benefits everyone including minority groups i also ascribe and have for a long time to a more isolationist foreign policy alyssa im not going to vote for somebody because of their gender or race trump voter alyssa a mother of two boys who is currently not employed calls herself a feminist on most things but she is fiercely opposed to voting for someone based on gender alone instead she backed trump who shares her own beliefs including not raising taxes her home state of ohio a mix of rust belt big city appalachia farmland and suburbs more white and less educated than the national mean voted for trump at some things i would be a feminist but it doesnt mean i vote for someone because she has a vagina ive always voted republican and always support the party they pushed a female candidate through to break the glass ceiling of a perceived gender equality biasheatherat the end of the day the video of trump did not affect my support for him what he says and what he does dont matter in those senses because im looking for somebody that has the same beliefs as i do in running a country at the end of the day were all sinners and we all say things like this it isnt uncommon we act like the president of united states should be some holy person we can go through all the us presidents and you will see sexual dysfunctions in all of their personal lives even hillarys husband had an affair at the end of the day my husbands sex life does not involve his work life and my sex life does not involve my day to day life these women that came out about trump could have been hoping for media attention or maybe just simply paid by hillary to make her criminal issues look

in robert and helen lynd a husband and wife team of researchers travelled from new york city into the heart of the midwest to undertake a study of daily life in an ordinary american town muncie indiana the lynds approached their mission in much the same spirit that joseph conrad entered the heart of darkness to look upon denizens of middle america as an anthropologist might chronicle the strange customs of another race interactive timelinewhile many sociologists were quite willing to discuss dispassionately the quaintly patterned ways of behaving that make up the customs of uncivilised people helen lynd wrote for many others it was distinctly distasteful to turn with equal candour to the life of their fellow americans yet nothing can be more enlightening than to gain precisely that degree of objectivity and perspective with which we view savage peoples the lynds didnt happen upon muncie by chance indeed they scoured the country in search of a city as representative as possible of contemporary american life something that could stand in for the whole of american culture in the bestselling book they published five years later which would become a classic work of american sociology they did not name muncie or any of its citizens they simply called it middletown for the past six months the idea of the real people out there has been the preoccupation of most journalists first during britains eu referendum campaign and then as donald trump ran away with the republican primaries commentators opined from the metropolis while reporters ventured to the parishes to anthropologise the white working class editors charged their employees with finding out why they are so angry what has made them so disaffected what is driving their erratic electoral behaviour but the real problem is baked into the premise they are not us we dont know them their views are not often heard in newsrooms and they know it and so the journalist swoops in for a day or two armed with polls reports and expectations and finds the angry and disaffected people they are looking for the reporters question their subjects on the holy trinity of identities race sex and class but only one at a time and then they find some local colour and hurry back to the office pundits speculated whether hillary clinton could win texas when it turned out she couldnt even win michiganthe protagonists of any given story are easily slotted into already existing archetypes soccer moms white van men and placed within a narrative arc that makes sense of their views a revolt against the elites or why the right must embrace diversity or how the left needs to learn values and then election night arrives and the whole thing collapses under the weight of its own hubris before starting all over again the next day with the hasty construction of a new narrative to explain what happened i came to muncie in the path of the lynds although not necessarily in their tradition in the hope that i might do something a bit different like them i did not happen on muncie by chance it sits in a swing county both barack obama and george w bush won it twice and voted for both donald trump and bernie sanders in their respective primaries rejecting the pleas of both party establishments it seemed like an ideal place to avoid the made for tv spectacle of a presidential election which had pundits at one stage speculating about whether hillary clinton could win texas when it turned out she couldnt even win michigan i arrived on the night of the second debate to find people more embarrassed than angry looking for a debate watching party i went to the fickle peach a bar in town where the three screens were set to either sunday night football or baseball dylan the barman put the debate on for me with the sound down and two of us watched it with subtitles it was two days after news broke of donald trump bragging about grabbing women by the pussy when his election prospects were understood to be over when i left town a month later trump was putting together his transition team and meeting obama in the white house on election night a small crowd had gathered in the fickle peach the results were on every screen with the sound turned up as the liberal audience some crying watched the certainties of just a few hours earlier evaporate their hopes crushed in real time state by state we woke to a new normal the object of our derision would soon have the nuclear codes gingerly but deliberately respect for the process the office and its trappings superseded the moral issue of what the victor had said and done en route to victory many of the very same people who just the day before said he was unfit for office now told america to unite around him meanwhile those who had not seen any of this coming confidently told us what we had seen and what would be coming next middletown had spoken for reasons to do with class gender race masculinity disaffection populism elitism or all of the above it had made common cause with a garish new york city multimillionaire to send a message to the establishment reporters were dispatched not to test this thesis but illustrate it when the lynds arrived in muncie years ago to begin their fieldwork they had more resources and more time than are generally available to a newspaper reporter they had two research assistants and they stayed for the best part of two years they published their findings in with a detailed portrayal of a town becoming less devout and less deferent more educated and more automated where women were less likely to bake their own bread and more likely to work outside the home young people led more independent lives public speeches were getting shorter and

trump morality and realitythere has been a huge emotional outpouring of doom and woe about the election of donald trump it is probably much ado about nothing very different in reality us presidents have very limited powers just ask barack obama he never could close guantnamo and it took him until his second term to get some modest health care reforms and an inadequate minimum wage trump will have many of the same disadvantages as a democratic president because he is not really a member of the republican establishment and they have few common values he will most likely be in the position of an independent president and cannot rely on the support of congress for good or bad initiatives the main independent presidential power appears to be to commit aggression george w bush and tony blair killed a lot of innocent people obama and clinton between them launched lots of bombs and drones and clinton probably deserved the warmonger jibe that trump threw at her so why do we think he will be worse calm down it will soon be business as usual ray ferris victoria british columbia canada there is any amount of analysis of the disastrous outcome of the us presidential election attempting to explain economic political sociological and psychological factors in the electorate but there is something missing the factor of individual moral responsibility we should not confuse understanding with excusing consider each voter standing privately in the voting booth pencil hovering over the box next to the name trump at that moment every single voter knows full well that this candidate is a predatory misogynist racist narcissistic demagogic bully so if they choose to mark a vote for him they are demonstrating their collusion with him effectively sharing some or all of those characteristics there is absolutely no excuse for that individual act felix anselldreia portugal ive come round to thinking that trump is far cleverer than we all thought his philosophy is to appeal to our worst angels our basest instincts and then to rule us probably to everyones relief by calling forth our better angels hillary and the elites operated the other way round c lendoncanberra

so i was deeply disappointed when brussels browbeat the walloons into agreeing to the comprehensive economic and trade agreement between the eu and canada indeed i was so affected by this that i ended up taking the train to brussels to be there at the historic moment when our leaders signed away our democracy it was a sad affair outside the building with barbed wire and riot police present to keep just a handful of harmless demonstrators at bay when politicians show this level of arrogance and just carry on regardless of strong public opinion then it is any wonder that voters drift away to radical parties i can see us arriving at a highly dangerous situation where even engaged moderate voters either dont bother voting or decide to vote for anything but the establishment alan mitchamcologne germanyempathy is universalas i always read the guardian back to front owen joness article on empathy hit me in the face maybe it was the most important article in the issue because its about every single one of us personally my parents whose ancestors came from all over europe brought me up in england with the open door ethic our house was often buzzing with foreigners be they students au pairs distant relatives friends of friends seeking temporary board and lodging just recently i welcomed feras a syrian asylum seeker into my home here in france while he was getting his papers sorted out he is now settled with his wife and children not too far from where i live so i can keep up the new friendship so my advice to anyone who really has empathy and a spare bed is to try sharing your living space with people fleeing war and strife you then find out how enriching this simple gesture actually is lea yaunerpessac france owen jones argues admirably that we all possess a natural empathy for other human beings but once we lose that it is easy for injustice to flourish he is only repeating a founding principle of the three abrahamic religions judaism islam and christianity in this age of closing borders and hostility to refugees let us remember that god tested abraham by sending angels disguised as travelling strangers without asking any questions abraham

website formed in that one former editor has described as trump pravda americas president elect has now appointed the sites executive chairman steve bannon a former goldman sachs banker known for screaming matches with staff as his white house strategy chief the fast growing opinion and news website has become a rallying point for trumps nationalist sometimes racist and often angry alt right support base it campaigned hard for trump throughout the primaries waging war against the candidacy of the florida senator marco rubio before becoming trumps voicebox during the general election

london los angeles and texas and expansion is planned into germany and france where it is expected to support marine le pens front national so much of the media mocked us laughed at us called us all sorts of names said the sites editor in chief alexander marlow on sunday following bannons appointment and then for us to be seen as integral to the election of a president despite all of that hatred is something that we certainly enjoy and savour during the election campaign hillary clinton warned her supporters of the alt rights emerging racist ideology and the de facto merger between breitbart and the trump campaign which represents a landmark achievement for this group a fringe element that has effectively taken over the republican party reading breitbart for hours will convince you the

but the tone is angrier than that it regularly features shock jock articles including would you rather your child had feminism or cancer and birth control makes women unattractive and crazy its wear the war merchandise section sells t shirts emblazoned with the slogan under attack all the time and featuring crossed guns it is an ethos carried forward from its founder andrew breitbart who died

lets suppose for a minute that the trump transition has some organizing principle beyond the chaotic conflicting impulses of a megalomaniac what do the first two appointments of president elect trump as well as the first week of his transition to power tell us about his forthcoming reign at first blush trump seems to have squared two competing desires with reince priebus as his chief of staff trump is placating and controlling his own party now ruling both sides of capitol hill the rnc chairman is perfectly plugged into the messy politics of the republican leadership with steve bannon as his chief strategist trump is placating the pitchfork mob that helped sweep him to power bannons role inside any organization is traditionally the keeper of the ideological flame in case anyone was still confused about trumps ideology bannon is chairman of breitbart a sewer of racist and sexist excrement but nothing in trumpistan is that neat in the brief time the great orange leader has presided over the semi public enterprise of his presidential campaign we know he has a track record of tolerating the kind of internal rivalry that ends up in ritual slaughter his first campaign manager corey lewandowski warred openly with his second campaign manager paul manafort and the same goes for the third and fourth people to fill those roles kellyanne conway and steve bannon himself chaos is trumps coin of the realm the only complex situation he seems to manage with some consistency are his tax avoidance schemes the bannon priebus announcement was carefully constructed with bannons appointment ahead of priebus such formalities do not go unnoticed in the corridors of power of the nations capital where the pecking order is the only game in town of the two bannon is by far the superior operator having turned breitbart from a cult into a powerhouse of white nationalism needless to say this is not a positive development for an immensely diverse nation with a long history of racial violence priebus for his part has shown his house of cards talent by staging the coup that ousted his former boss michael steele priebus seized the job of rnc chair just after steeles rnc swept the board in the mid term elections but with no experience in the executive or legislative branches of government priebus is hopelessly out of his depth at best hes a party hack who will follow the orders of his friends on capitol hill at worst hell drown as he attempts to manage the west wing the federal bureaucracy national security crises washington politics the venal media and a president who has returned to twitter all of which makes him easy pickings for bannon who is offensive in every sense of the word according to sworn testimony by his ex wife bannon is so virulently antisemitic that he insisted he didnt want his girls going to school with jews not for nothing as the anti defamation league gone public with its opposition to his appointment the coming bannon priebus cage fight is only one side of the struggle for power inside the administration for the real influence lies in the hands of trumps children and son in law already jared kushner husband to ivanka has reportedly ousted the head of the transition the hapless and gormless new jersey governor chris christie ostensibly christies downfall was because he is embroiled in the scandal known as bridgegate but the proceedings about the closure of the george washington bridge have been rumbling for three years a more likely scenario is that christie could not be trusted with such a powerful transition job because he presided as us attorney in new jersey over the prosecution of kushners father blood is so much thicker than water especially inside trump tower with so many competing fiefdoms the trump presidency has already sown the seeds of its own chaos can these people successfully navigate their way out of a paper bag never mind the confirmation process that could doom their own administration in case people have forgotten with full control of congress and at the height of his popularity the newly elected president obama stumbled repeatedly with nominees whose tax returns were questionable and who seemed too cozy with corporate power perhaps president trump can help his nominees dodge their tax questions by ordering the irs to audit them all as quickly as possible as for his desire to drain the swamp of corporate influence those promises are now being managed by a small army of lobbyists who control his transition how clueless is team trump according to the wall street journal they had no idea the entire west wing would evacuate on inauguration day next year that they would have to appoint every single member of staff except for the permanent help tending to the building and grounds as a result president obama intends to spend more time helping his successor understand the scale of what hes about to take on the first black president is going to help train the white president whose campaign was built on questioning his own citizenship obama started his presidency winning the nobel peace prize but he ends it deserving some kind of sainthood like all good shakespearean tragedies the trump presidency is presaging its own collapse at the height of its glory the priebus bannon family disputes will corrode the west wing from within they are the manifestation of a leader who projects certainty but cannot decide if he wants to repeal all of obamacare or keep parts of it if he wants to end abortion rights or force women to travel to get abortions if he wants to bring the country together or end the wave of racist intimidation that is being spray painted across our schools and churches the republican establishment may think they can manage trump through priebus but they are about to discover that this dumpster fire of a campaign just turned into a brushfire of a transition
the uk governments stance on brexit is like that of a husband who wants to get a divorce but keep all assets including the marital home an irish minister has told colleagues the irish times says mary mitchell oconnor the irish jobs minister came up with the analogy after meeting liam fox the international trade secretary the papers report also included details of a leaked irish government memo saying some eu states will not be unduly concerned if britain ends up with a hard brexit labour has demanded the government formally apologise for inflicting pain and suffering on disabled people and their families in the wake of a landmark court judgment in a commons urgent question debbie abrahams the shadow work and pensions secretary said some applications of the so called bedroom tax were manifestly without reason after the supreme court overturned two government decisions on the benefit last week but damian green the work and pensions secretary said labour was wrong to suggest the policy was unlawful given the government had won five of the seven cases that were appealed edward timpson an education minister has condemned the policy of no platforming controversial speakers at universities he was speaking in the commons after a fellow tory fiona bruce said no platforming policies were coming increasingly close to bullying he replied i think we can all agree that students should be able to challenge those they disagree with by means of open and robust debate and academic freedom and freedom of speech are essential to our higher education system and there is no place for intimidation to attempt to shut down open debate universities do have a clear legal duty to secure freedom of speech for students staff and visiting speakers and must have clear policies for how they will ensure that this can happen a european plan under which britons will face a charge to travel to the eu after brexit is to be discussed by interior ministers this week bureaucratic delays left hundreds of thousands of benefit claimants struggling without income for weeks after being made jobless forcing many to turn to food banks according to the chair of an all party mps group on hunger as patrick butler reports over the past months more than people waited more than three weeks for their unemployment benefit applications to be processed while waited more than two weeks according to department of work and pensions figures obtained by the mp frank field field who also chairs the commons work and pensions select committee called on ministers to set a new five day target for processing benefit claims in order to dramatically cut the numbers of people reliant on food banks thats all from me for today thanks for the comments the government has notified parliament that it intends to opt in to a new legal framework for europol this is the first major opt in out decision taken by the government since the brexit vote in june the new europol framework updates the existing model but doesnt extend its powers any further over member states the decision secures british participation in europol particularly in europe wide efforts to tackle terrorism and cybercrime up to the date of brexit future involvement will form part of the main brexit negotiations the uk has been a member of the agency since its creation in and chose to opt in in when the uk negotiated the right to choose which justice and home affairs matters to be part of a new opt in decision is now required following changes to the legal framework to the agency the policing minister brandon lewis said the uk is leaving the eu but the reality of cross border crime remains europol provides a valuable service to the uk and opting in would enable us to maintain our current access to the agency until we leave the eu helping keep the people of britain safe we now await the outcome of the scrutiny process the labour party is often accused of having nothing very detailed to say about new policy there is some truth in that although given the extent to which brexit is sucking oxygen out of every other part of the political ecosystem the last four months havent been a great time for domestic policy announcements but this morning we have had an interesting speech from debbie abrahams the shadow work and pensions secretary it was about welfare and the self employed and although it did not contain specific proposals it did contain some important clues as to the approach that labour under jeremy corbyn will take to social security here are the key points abrahams said labour would ensure that self employed workers got the same welfare protection as workers with conventional jobs the self employed currently have very poor income protection to smooth the ups and downs of their small business likewise the self employed have no recourse to sick pay should they fall ill in a recent study by the then department for business innovation and skills of self employed workers cited not getting paid when ill as a key concern similarly those who face longer term injury through accident have little in the way of additional provision while employees can access industrial injury and disablement benefits this is not currently extended to those working for themselves finally the state has always played an important role in nurturing family life while the self employed can access the maternity allowance provision for new fathers or for those wishing to adopt lags remains out of reach there is a clear precedent here for state support one which needs to be realised there is clear and inherent injustice in the current system and in our transformation of our social security system labour will ensure parity for workers of differing status at a time when some employers are being exposed for imposing false self employment on workers who should really be employed any new policy needs to ensure

other things accused obama of importing more hating muslims compared conservative commentator bill kristol to a renegade jew likened planned parenthoods work to the holocaust said young muslims in the west were a ticking time bomb and advised female victims of online harassment to just log off and stop screwing up the internet for men bannon stands on the far right of the republican party following

telephone when she tried to summon police the charges were dropped after his estranged wife did not show up at the trial according to court records in august this year the guardian found that bannon was registered to vote in florida a key swing state at an empty house where he did not live in an apparent breach of election laws the revelation followed years of aggressive claims by breitbart news that voter fraud was rife among minorities and in democratic leaning areas an allegation that was repeated forcefully on the campaign trail by trump who predicted that the election would be rigged bannon subsequently changed his registration he co owns a condominium in los angeles and is known to stay at the so called breitbart embassy a luxurious townhouse beside the supreme court in

when it looked like the news couldnt get any worse it did worse in a way that dwarfed our petty elections and clueless pendulum analyses worse in a way that dusted the present with the irrelevance of history in the journal science advances five of the worlds most eminent climatologists warned of the possibility that warming may be significantly worse than we thought previous consensus was that the earths average temperature would go up by between life altering but manageable and cataclysmic now the range suggested by one projection goes up to which is game over by the century it relates to the us because their incoming president has promised actively determinedly to bring about the worst case scenario acting on the now familiar pre enlightenment logic that because its beyond the limits of his intellect to comprehend it climate change doesnt exist but it relates to or rather clarifies things on a deeper level rational american citizens are post trump going through the same grief trajectory as many of us did after brexit the debate is all fierce conjecture about how they lost whom they failed to listen to whose anger had been ignored and by which people for how many decades but underneath that is a profound crisis of civic engagement a deep agonising question what is the point if reason doesnt matter if truth doesnt if solidarity is for wimps if experts are charlatans whats the point of getting involved in this circus paul krugman identifies it as a creed of quietism conceding its definitely tempting to conclude that the world is going to hell but that theres nothing you can do about it so why not just make your own garden grow ultimately he chooses engagement to save the soul i dont see how you can hang on to your own self respect unless youre willing to stand up for the truth the american journalist nancy letourneau took it one step further and tried to find a positive in the powerlessness via gandhi whatever you do in life will be insignificant but its very important that you do it patriotism self respect for the sake of your neighbours for the good of your children these are all credible and decent reasons to carry on fighting the hard right even when it knocks over your strongest arguments with a casual breath but the urgency of the climate crisis is a better one authoritarians strongmen fascists whatever you call the figureheads of the new right you know one thing they are never good stewards of the earth to accept this political order as a desperately sad but immovable new normal means accepting that the earth will burn and theres nothing we can do this cannot be borne in practical terms this means picking winnable fights showing solidarity and being visible i cant do very much about a country not my own and its adherence to the paris treaty but i can join a action on the uk governments stance on wind energy you cant do very much about oil exploration in alaska but you possibly can do something about keeping the gas in

first solar powered transport network when a country runs for four days entirely on renewables celebrate if theres a synchronised global march for the climate go to it there has always been a tendency to write mass environmental protests off as self indulgence pointless by definition because their participants will go back the very next day to their fossil fuelled lives intolerance of imperfection is fatally corrosive to any movement but to environmentalism most of all it is not possible to be perfectly green yet you can be a vivid green by turning up this has been the year the liberals lost every argument explanations range from they lost because they were wrong all along to the right always prospers from economic hardship but there is a growing consensus around one thing we remain quite good at interpreting data pointing out incoherence making sarcastic remarks but we lost the ability to make a bold ambitious sincere and plausible case for a better future settling instead for a future that wasnt worse this has been the case across europe and the us it cannot be blamed on british politicians singly or en masse its global scope has led many to look for the cause in global trends financialisation corporate greed things that for brevity we class as neoliberalism optimism accrues around each hopeful action each small victory until it becomes obvious that it is the driving forcei wonder whether the answer is something much simpler we stopped making the case for hope when we stopped feeling hopeful the spectre of climate change much more influential on the left than on even the sensible right loomed so large that we reasonably enough began to fear the future at the same time losing confidence in our collective ability to do anything but mess stuff up the pessimism infected our political language left it pale and limp but it didnt actually halt progress discoveries were made and solutions found we have in likelihood the technical expertise to halt emissions forever between electric cars and solar glass between wind power and cross continental supergrids we have amassed enough sheer ingenuity to fix the unfixable the only obstacle granted its a significant one is a post truth politics that would prefer to pretend theres nothing to fix optimism is not something you can decide to rediscover nor can you fake it with rhetoric its not something one really good leader can bestow it accrues around each hopeful action each small victory until it becomes obvious that it is the driving force many of us frame our interest in the environment as a care for
i have spent years pushing against apatriarchy that tries to tell me what to look like what to feel who to demur to and that there are many things that icant do because im female the weaker sex i gave birth i wouldnt be balled up on the ground if kicked in the groin its tiring and it takes a toll and ill keep pushing in my own steady way for thomas frank to leave sexism out of his response piece wholesale and to choose to use the word shrill toward the end of his article a word which conjures up images of women leaves me frustrated and tired frank whom im sure is a wonderful person in many respects is as sexist as the next and hasnt faced his own inner demons whether or not you think hillary clinton had the best interest of the lower class and working middle class in mind for frank to say that she isnt really competent that her email server was a real issue and that biden would have been a better choice is just a cloak for his inability to face himself in the mirror to his credit or to the detriment of at least of half of us frank is not alone in his unacknowledged sexism even when we pit a woman against the least competent candidate we could imagine for arguably the most important job there is our society as a whole cant stomach voting for her voters literally stayed home from the polls rather than elect a woman lets throw this frank article in the virtual trash where it belongs and instead read response articles penned by feminists we have work to do india viola amid the negativity and strong words about the result of the presidential election it is important that we stay positive and true to our morals and standards unlike donald trump as ayoung woman feminist and member of the younger generation i can certainly say that i will not tolerate trumps revolting words against women and those who dont fit his mould of a perfect citizen from this i am reminded of the standards of how men should behave towards women with respect and compassion the doom and gloom events of this year have taught and emphasised to me the importance of staying positive and not letting morals and standards slip because of the behaviour of a leader such as trump furthermore hillary clinton has shown particularly to women and girls that anything is possible if you truly believe and that women can be and are champions for this as she said in her speech there is still much work to be done and the only way we will aid the work ahead is if we stand together with positive energy and hope against people like trumps fear and discrimination eleanor sutcliffe in an otherwise searching article sarah churchwell falls prey to the same negativism in attitudes toward women politicians that shes writing about while it is true that a staggering of white women voted against clinton it is not true that once again a female candidate did not carry even the female vote some of women voted for clinton not all white but all women marcia saunders is it possible that we have underestimated donald trump is it possible that the rage racism boasts unpleasant vilification of hillary clinton and ludicrous promises were his carefully calculated pose to woo those voters he recognised as disillusioned with the washington establishment and longing for change that the wall was never going to be built that the secretary of state was never going to be sent to jail that the clampdown on muslim communities could be quietly overlooked that nato would survive and trade treaties would remain untorn he is where he wants to be he will have real power he will use it to get what he really wants he is a wheeler dealer a negotiator he knows how to choose and use talented people who can deliver his goals let us by all means be fearful of what those goals might be but let us also look beyond the smokescreen of his performance in the campaign listen to the change of tone of his carefully emollient victory speech remember how he outmanoeuvred the other contenders and shrugged off the disdain of the republican hierarchy let us hope that american liberals will not write him off as a fool who cannot possibly survive chris harris it is interesting to reflect that while all recent us presidents have made very public professions of attachment to the christian faith donald trump does not appear to share this none of his frequent utterances over the last year have alluded to faith and his actions and words during the election campaign were hardly those of a christian adherent quite the opposite so we may reasonably assume that the tea party religious right a key influence in his election is now headed up by an amoral infidel that would be one of the weirder outcomes of november robin wendt how come liberals encourage violence while exercising their freedom of speech this is something ill never understand you always speak of love and understanding when making conservatives knuckle under to your beliefs yet when you dont get your way after a fair election you unhinge like a crazed three year old filth property damage foul language and disrespect for the individual and country this is a liberal who loses your hypocrisy is staggering kimberly brockway the protesters in american cities all appear to be in the twenties this is the generation particularly if they are college educated who have been brought up on the shibboleths of political correctness safe spaces and cultural appropriation while being protected from viewpoints and literature running counter to their sensibilities all of these are bound to trump democracy they must be shell shocked edward thomas at a time of great uncertainty and anxiety following the election of
wednesday november its another big week for me and my cancer but its wednesday so its day and things are really hotting up before the us election weve got a good show ive managed to persuade piers morgan as one of the few british journalists who actually knows donald trump to speak to us from his car while hes filming in florida for itv and hes really interesting about what the media have and critically havent understood about the donald piers is also one of the people from the worlds of journalism and broadcasting many of whom if im honest i really cant claim to know especially well whove come forward to make my life easier by offering good wishes and positive thoughts and if my experience is anything to go by if you know anyone with a cancer diagnosis dont hesitate just drop them a line to let them know youre thinking of them genuinely appreciated all the show went well i think but im still suffering from occasionally quite acute fatigue i blame the radiotherapy as i didnt get anything like this in the course of seven cycles of heavy duty chemo also since the radiotherapy im really only able to sleep on my back the doctors reckon this might be because of the impact of the radiotherapy on my diaphragm which mightve been clipped by the high energy x ray beams anyhow alls well with the back sleeping malarkey except that at around five on thursday morning i get the first signs of an unmistakable and potentially very painful condition kidney stones i was first diagnosed with them more than years ago and every now and again since a new one would get stuck in my kidney and kick off a bout of renal colic the name given to the excruciating pain that can come with them this time a couple of painkillers see it off but stand by if you can face it for what happened a few days laterthursday novembermy first day on the new treatment paclitaxel and ramucirumab and my first visit to what one of the nurses laughingly described as business class otherwise known as the ppmdu so at there i am being shown into the unit discreetly hidden from the regular nhs day unit ill be visiting later for my paclitaxel infusion and guess what it looked very similar to its nhs equivalent and while were on the subject of business class the seats were actually identical staff were great of course and i got my first dose of the very expensive ramucirumab which the nhs currently wont finance the treatment was first class and as ive previously indicated ive no problem with the principle that i should pay for it as the nhs should be protected from additional unfunded treatment costs i choose to avail myself of but i still struggle with the royal marsden taking a markup simply to supply an already very expensive drug which by the way is already standard treatment as part of second line chemotherapy for my cancer in the us and charging a private patients day rate as a whole day for a treatment that takes just over an hour ive taken to calling it my very own cash for treatment scandal i hope theyre putting the money to good use which is perhaps something worth looking into anyhow having received my ramucirumab i was escorted back downstairs to rejoin the rest of the human race in the nhs mdu and do you know aside from having identical seats to upstairs i think there might actually be more space down here but time to get reacquainted with the cold cap this as its name suggests is a rubber cap attached to a refrigeration system that rapidly cools the wearers head thus reducing the risk of hair loss that some chemotherapy drugs otherwise more or less guarantee it doesnt work for everyone but it really worked for me over seven cycles of chemo and to be honest a few quizzical looks from other patients more used to seeing women using it and the endurance test that is the first minutes of wearing it as it literally freezes your scalp was a very small price to pay of course id forgotten how hard it would be and very nearly took it off but in the end the name of the new machines they now have at the marsden paxmans true and a well timed traquiliser from the staff got me though it and so far i still have hair on my head saturday novembertoday would turn out to be one of the most difficult since i was diagnosed back in march and none of it to do with my cancer or its metastases directly for a start i have been suffering with constipation which once it gets to or days as it has for me can become almost painfully uncomfortable then there was the discomfort under my right ribs put down to my liver playing up or more likely another hangover from the radiotherapy and to cap it all was the recurring renal colic from my age old kidney stones and their appalling sense of timing and heres the twist the painkillers co codamol a mixture of paracetamol and codeine tend to work less effectively over time but critically make you more constipated to cut a long story short saturday was a bit of a perfect storm in increasing discomfort and waiting until enough time had elapsed to allow me to take more painkillers which a no longer quite do the job and b make the you know what worse as a result i cant leave the house and have no desire to eat or drink and its the latter thats set to provide the biggest twist of all tuesday novemberdue at marsden for pre chemo blood tests preparatory to the next dose of new chemo due thursday by now after such a dreadful weekend i can
saturday night live began its first post election episode on a sombre note kate mckinnon dressed as hillary clinton singing several verses of leonard cohens hallelujah and playing piano im not giving up and neither should you she said at the end but then it was time for dave chappelles return to television with a standing ovation from the crowd for those people who remember chappelle mostly from first or reruns of comedy centrals the chappelle show and not his transcendent ahead of its time standup comedy you missed out go watch killing them softly and then come back to this recap chappelle couldve just stood up on that stage and bullshat his way through a staff written monologue and you wouldve laughed but he didnt it was vintage and it was real and here are the words that he said i didnt know that donald trump was going to win the election i did suspect it seemed like hillary was doing well at the polls and yet i know the whites you guys arent as full of surprises as you used to be and i think i speak for all of black america when i say that we are all praying for omarosa i dont even know what shes doing in the news i havent see white people this mad since the oj verdict im not saying im enjoying it im just saying ive never seen this before chappelle explained i watched a white riot in portland oregon on television the other night people said they did worth of damages every black person was watching that like amateurs im staying out of it he vowed im going to take a knee like the san franciso quarterback kaepernick let the whites figure this out amongst themselves weve been here before i dont think its even the most important thing were dealing with dont forget all the things that are going on shootings he said then riffing on how the pulse nightclub shooter was rumoured to have a grindr account you cant even go to the goddamn zoo without seeing a shooting out there he added they shot a gorilla in my local zoo and the cincinnati police said that shooting that gorilla was the toughest decision this department ever had to make i said you about to see a lot of n s in gorilla costumes in cincinnati why do we have to say that black lives matter he asked rhetorically now i admit thats not the best slogan but mcdonalds already took you deserve a break today i get its kind of catching because everyone else is biting it he said even the police bite it blue lives matter what was he born a police that is not a blue life thats a blue suit you dont like it take that suit off find a new job cause im gonna tell you right now if i could quit being black today id be out of the game returning to trump chappelle had a confession to make i feel bad saying it im staying in a trump hotel right now he revealed i dont know if hell make a good president but he makes a swell hotel suite im telling you that housekeeper comes in the morning cleans my room and im like hey housekeeper grab a big handful of pussy say you know boss said it was ok he also admitted that unlike some of his other wealthy black contemporaries hes not leaving but is going to stay to take advantage of the tax breaks first time i got some money it didnt work out like that he said most unlikely thing happened ever the first black president came out of nowhere like come on everybody lets start thinking about everyone else aw no n i just got this money i didnt think you was possible as a topic though trump remained irresistible trump went to go see obama last week you see that did you see trumps face when he came out of that meeting he asked the audience trump got sonned he looked shook he looked like he got shook but even chappelle couldnt resist an appeal to the emotion of the week at the end of his monologue did you need a skit fine the first skit was a too real look at a brooklyn results watching party at which chappelle played the only black guy in the room the white guests started off quite optimistic as the polls closed while chappelles character was increasingly cynical for the white guests who continue drinking and popping xanax to get through the results play against their beliefs in america while affirming chappelles cynicism at when in real life it was clear that clintons path to a win was incredibly narrow chris rock appeared i dont get you ladies he said the country is women if the country was black wed have a tonne of black presidents flava flav would be president cecily strongs character said oh my god america is racist chapelles reaction oh my god i think my great grandfather told me something like that but he was like a slave or something i dont know aidy bryants character echoed strongs saying i cant believe it why arent people turning out for hillary the way they did for barack obama chris rock had a response maybe because youre replacing a charismatic year old black guy with a year old white woman thats like the knicks replacing patrick ewing with neil patrick harris at the end as one of the actors declared the election the most shameful thing americas ever done rock and chappelle laughed and laughed for the second skit chappelle in a call back to the trope of his comedy central show in which he stood on stage and introduced his sketches stood on stage and introduced a sketch featuring many of the characters from his show as part of a homage to the walking dead
donald trump mined deep discontent running through america and struck gold the political outsider drew derision when he announced his bid for the us presidency but trumps protectionist anti immigration rhetoric and a pledge to be the greatest jobs president that god ever created struck a chord momentum built and nothing could stop the trump juggernaut not his open xenophobia nor claims about his tax payments or lack thereof and not even a sexual harassment scandal so the electoral upset of the century has happened and for the next four years at least the reality tv star will be swapping manhattans trump tower for the white house in the year that the uk voted to leave the eu trumps triumph over hillary clinton was yet another outcome that pundits and pollsters had failed to predict on financial markets initial shock gave way to guesswork in the post truth world trump has helped to build investors are left to puzzle over what he will do once in power which of his most outlandish policies will become reality will there be a wall along the border to mexico will he really target millions of immigrants for deportation to get a flavour of the uncertainty look no further than the stock markets which have struggled to find a clear direction since trumps victory was declared economic forecasters are being coy about whether his effect on growth will be positive or negative a big spending tax cutting president could well lift gdp but things could go the other way if trump follows through on his anti trade stance and new tariffs raise costs for businesses and consumers on the campaign trail trump made trade a central theme he played into rising anger among voters who felt the spoils of globalisation were unevenly shared for those who saw their wages depressed or their jobs move overseas the era of free trade did more harm than good it seems pretty certain that a trump presidency will stall the process of trade liberalisation he wants to renegotiate or possibly scrap the north american free trade agreement or nafta which lowers trade barriers between the us canada and mexico other deals in doubt are the trans pacific partnership between countries around the pacific rim excluding china and a proposed agreement between the us and europe known as the transatlantic trade and investment partnership on nafta trump holds all the cards mexico needs the us more than the us needs mexico but when it comes to trumps pledge to curb chinas trading might it is not so obvious he will have the upper hand not only is china one of the biggest economies in the world it is a big holder of us debt any attempt to browbeat china could well backfire on trump time will tell whether the tycoon wants to risk a trade war with china just as hard to predict is what this all means for the uk as it undergoes its own upheaval and potentially breaks away from a market of million people with trump the uk is no longer at the back of the queue for trade deals as barack obama threatened it would be during the eu referendum campaign the incoming president has talked of his affection for britain so perhaps he could go for a bespoke trade deal between the us and uk but theresa may and her brexiter trade minister liam fox will have to accept that the vastly bigger us will have the upper hand in any such talks however its just as likely that trade deals of any kind will not be a priority for a president who campaigned on a pledge to put up walls the uk might not be at the back of the queue but it wont feature near the top of trumps to do list either as we enter a new era of looking inwards those who sought power on a protectionist platform should hope that their policies do not end up doing yet more harm m s must change approach to clotheseverything that happens at marks spencer the year old high street retailer causes more drama than its peers predictably the news last week that m s plans to close uk stores and convert others into food only locations created quite a stir the retailers shops are the bedrock of high streets in towns and cities across the country and have been for years so any change is noticed by the locals the closures are an admission of defeat that m s cannot make its clothing popular enough to justify the amount of space dedicated to selling it across the country it is a costly admission too it will cost m s to rework its uk shops over the next three years and another to shut struggling shops abroad however it was the right move by steve rowe the m s chief executive if anything he should have been more radical in an online world where marksandspencer com is the companys biggest shop it would be foolish for the retailer to stick with a business model from a previous generation m s has significantly more stores than rivals john lewis and debenhams and significantly larger ones than rivals that like m s only sell own brand clothing such as zara and h m one of the reasons that m ss clothing range can look so dowdy is that there is so much retail space to fill it cant possibly get everything right in contrast to m ss clothing its food business has a clear upmarket position this christmas families will flock to m s for their festive fare with tesco asda sainsburys morrisons and waitrose dramatically cutting back investment m s has a glorious opportunity to expand having said all this m s should not start treating its clothing arm as a secondary consideration within the group cutting the amount of the space dedicated to clothing gives the company an opportunity to rethink

picture the scene a us air force f falcon has come down over syria the pilot is being held by islamic state which threatens to behead him video shows the pilot being tortured in a cage while the terrorists taunt new us president donald trump the pilots family plead for the white house to save him the drama is dominating the hour tv news networks its a media storm what will trump do answer nobody has a clue trump lacks military experience he has never served in the armed forces nor does he have any background in diplomacy what trump does have by all accounts is a short fuse a tendency to shoot first and ask questions later his predecessors would have played for time appealed to local allies or pursued deniable back door talks while examining options for a rescue but president trump is different unused to the awesome responsibility of the oval office under fierce pressure to act enraged by isiss personal jibes infuriated by accusations of dithering and determined not to show weakness it is easy to imagine trump making a wrong hasty and disastrous call with a few hot headed words translated into situation room orders trump could not only lose the pilot he could plunge the us inextricably into the quagmire of another middle east war there are grave doubts about trump inexperience volatile temperament and macho instinctsgrave doubts about trumps inexperience volatile temperament and macho instincts also apply in other global hotspots where a us presidents actions or inaction are always critical and sometimes lethal here are five dangerous flashpoint issues that could suddenly and unpredictably test the novice presidents judgment cool and common sense in the first days of his tenure syria and iraqthe isis hostage scenario is not wholly imaginary in january last year a royal jordanian air force pilot muath al kasasbeh was captured and burned to death in a cage by the jihadis after negotiations for his release failed similar repeat incidents involving us european and arab members of the anti isis coalition and local forces are becoming more likely as the endgame in the fight against the isis caliphate approaches the battle is being fought out on two main fronts one is the siege of mosul northern iraqs principal city trump has criticised the conduct of the campaign which involves the mainly shia iraqi army kurdish and sunni arab militias backed by us special forces commandos but he has not offered an alternative strategy much the same holds true of the attempt to seize the isis headquarters in raqqa in northern syria trump says that defeating terrorism is a top priority and he will bomb the shit out of isis but nobody including him appears to know what this means in practice if the battle goes badly will he escalate will he carpet bomb cities where millions of civilians live is he prepared to deploy us ground forces what will he do if as seems possible both sieges become bogged down or isis begins mass daily executions of civilians trump is also silent about turkeys significant military intervention in syria and iraq and its parallel fight with the kurds president recep tayyip erdoan wants two things from trump an end to us support for the kurdish peshmerga and the extradition of fethullah glen a cleric exiled in the us who he blames for last summers failed coup with isis on the back foot and the iraqi and syrian governments weakened the turkey kurd feud could explode at any time as the protagonists try to redraw national boundaries and compete for territory and resources russia and eastern europetrump has raised expectations that he can repair the us rupture with russia but a reset will come with a price in the first instance vladimir putin russias authoritarian president will want a relaxation or scrapping of punitive sanctions imposed after russia annexed crimea in to dismay in europe trump has suggested he may agree putin also seems likely to get his way in syria where russian forces have pushed his client bashar al assad to the brink of victory in aleppo and elsewhere trump has made no serious objection to russian actions in syria even though the un says they may constitute war crimes he seems content to have assad remain in power or even to treat him as an anti isis ally however the regimes renewed use of chemical weapons for example new russian atrocities or a suddenly escalating humanitarian and refugee catastrophe could all trigger a new crisis that blows up in trumps face forcing him to move against putin the idea of no fly zones and civilian safe havens still has backers if trump goes down this route he could end up directly confronting russias military the european allies cannot do much about trumps syria insouciance but they will strongly oppose him if he tries to run down the nato alliance as he has suggested russian pressure on natos easternmost members in the baltic republics poland and bulgaria in terms of political meddling disinformation cyber attacks missile deployments and military exercises is reaching new heights influence peddling and destabilisation operations are increasingly reported in moldova montenegro and elsewhere in the balkans eastern ukraine remains a ticking timebomb any of these flashpoints could ignite at any time in trumps first days european governments want to present a strong united front but trump seems more interested in buying russia off by acquiescing in putins reclamation of former cold war spheres of influence trumps disdain for the eu he loudly applauded britains vote to leave and critical european reaction to his election notably in germany and france point to a possible us europe schism down the road if it happens trump will have helped putin achieve a long cherished russian strategic objective shattering years of euro atlanticism chinabeijing shows no sign of backing away from its expansionist policies in the south china and east china seas it is busily transforming reefs and
for years the us and britain have underwritten the open global trading system partly because of a stubborn and correct belief in the merits of free trade partly out of self interest as beneficiaries of globalisation and partly because strategically it spreads democracy peace and capitalism they have spearheaded successive rounds of tariff cuts and multilateral trade deals and stood by first the general agreement on tariffs and trade and its successor the world trade organisation to keep the system honest they have cut regional trade bargains promoted the european single market and above all kept their markets open despite other countries notably china gaming the system for their own narrow advantage the consensus in both countries was that the wider gains transcended any localised pain no longer the americans voting for the anti trade america first trump have consigned all that to history and the unintended consequence of brexit will mean the same for britain the system that underpinned our collective prosperity is about to be trashed it brought national and international benefits including an avalanche of inward direct investment into both countries powerful international financial and business service sectors rising global living standards and the economic and democratic transformation of asia but both countries manufacturing sectors have taken disproportionately heavy hits drive round the ailing industrial towns of south yorkshire or ohio and compare the economic and social landscape with that of dsseldorf munich shanghai or shenzhen decade of consistent manufacturing trade deficits have exacted a cruel toll this year working class voters across america and britains rotting industrial heartlands delivered their verdict no more plants moving abroad no more closures because of cheap imports no more sales of great companies to foreigners no more stagnating blue collar wages no more immigration it may be that there are jobs and great prospects aplenty in the burgeoning tech and service sectors in the big cities driven by global trade but they dont care they are hurting and nobody has taken decisive action to help them the votes for trump and brexit mark the end of an era and a new dark age of closure protectionism and nationalism leading tory brexiters will insist that this is a travesty of their position they want britain to access more global trade and not be imprisoned they crazily claim by the confines of the slow growing european union and its bureaucratic inability to cut aggressive trade deals with the rest of the world they live in a dreamland if they feel that the rest of the world is more committed to free trade than europe while eu membership did not hold back germany from being among the worlds major exporters in any case apart from the promised closure of borders to immigrants that is not what their voters want as nigel farage always better understood than any of his tory allies he cordially despises working class voters in south yorkshire and the west midlands want the same as their counterparts in pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin after all it was those three states with their tiny vote margin which gave trump the electoral college votes for victory he might be a billionaire but he is or at least styles himself a blue collar billionaire blue collar industrial workers dont benefit from free trade and immigration as he has consistently said for months in the teeth of opposition from the republican mainstream who remain free traders his movement as he called it wants to stop both trade exchange and intermingling are the lifeblood of humanitybuild that wall along the us mexican border was one of the most insistent chants at his rallies along with the forced deportation of million illegal immigrants but more importantly for the international trading system trump wants to withdraw from the north american free trade agreement between the us canada and mexico which he casually dismisses as the worst trade deal in history he also wants an immediate halt in negotiations for both the transatlantic and trans pacific trade agreements and unilaterally he wants to impose swingeing tariffs against the rules of the world trade organisation from which he is prepared to walk away on chinese imports which account for half of the uss trade deficit thirty five per cent tariffs are promised on mexican imports the remaining free trade agreements the us has signed are to be reviewed or abrogated cumulatively the impact would be devastating killing multilateralism by exposing the already enfeebled wto as helpless inciting chinese and mexican trade retaliation and destabilising the entire global system of trade and finance optimists say that trump the president will be much more cautious and realist than trump the campaigner his talk on trade should be seen as threats to produce more fairly balanced agreements not a tearing up of the world system maybe but there cannot be a complete divorce between campaign rhetoric and policy he believes what he says and nobody in his close coterie is going to urge caution not dan dimicco his senior trade adviser who has promised a potential withdrawal in the first six months of the trump presidency from every major us trade deal if it cannot be shown actively to benefit the us the era of trade deficits is over he says it will be lets talk but otherwise we put tariffs on another intimate walid phares has said trump will go back to ground zero on every trade deal such as the one with south korea that the president elect described as job destroying and wants to revoke trump has already given a commitment that on day one he will declare china a currency manipulator as a precursor to introducing up to tariffs on chinese imports these positions are not posturing they represent a deeply held view that the us does not need trade except on terms that put america first the idea that successive american administrations have negotiated deals loaded in the us interest is impossible to concede because how else would
did hillary clinton lose the election because she is a woman the answer is no but the reasons behind that no are complicated its certainly impossible to dismiss the presence of extreme sexism in the campaign the media narrative of a battle between a hard working highly qualified woman and a pussy grabbing man donald trump demonstrated over and over again that he loathes powerful women who do not bend to his will and so did many of his supporters much of his criticism of clinton often through taunting and bullying had strong sexist undertones and yet misogyny was not the reason that clinton was defeated she lost because lower and middle class white people wanted dramatic change and these voters felt that in spite of her gender she offered them more of the same during the election much was made of the extra pressure that clinton was under to conform to expectations of appearance and behaviour she received extreme attention to the way that she was dressed and groomed especially in contrast with the dishevelled and orange presentation of her opponent suspicion was cast on the meaning of her controlled delivery suggestions were made that she lacked passion as if passion could only be demonstrated through red faced screaming at baying crowds though her passion was evident as was her intellect it is true that clinton sometimes seemed a bit anodyne not because she is anodyne but because the nature of the campaign limited her means and forms of expression a woman politician whose appearance and delivery matched those of donald trump would be unlikely to be elected to city council a woman who made the error of referring to people supporting her opponent as deplorables people who screamed for walls to be built on borders and for people to be lynched was excoriated while her male opponent suggested that they come after her with guns none of this was fair in a country that holds fast to values of freedom everyone should have an equal opportunity to speak their mind and indeed wear bright orange foundation if that is a look they want to go for but this is not the reason that clinton lost like many leftwing women i went to my polling place on tuesday wearing a trouser suit and a nasty woman t shirt the hours long queue was packed out with mothers who had brought their small daughters to watch them vote for the first woman president the scene was almost enough to make it seem that the election was about seeking a long delayed victory for feminism but this was a side effect it was a media friendly narrative harnessed by clintons campaign strategists to enhance her brand rather than what the election was really about if the head of state can treat women like objects why should any other american man feel he should behave differently clinton won the popular vote probably by more than a million she was we need to remember the candidate of choice for most voters that is why it is essential to look more deeply into the numbers the reason that clinton lost the electoral college and in turn the election was that she failed to appeal to enough white women especially in decisive states my moderate excitement in clintons candidacy was not shared by a majority of women who look like me or clinton herself trump won the votes of of white women they were voters whom clintons campaign team likely believed were an easy win because of her calls for pay equality leave for new mothers and investment in young children and for her oft stated belief that womens rights are human rights but clintons campaign missed the mark with them those women who voted against clinton did not do so because they are sexist or because they dont believe in womens ability to lead and achieve they are themselves leaders and achievers instead they voted against her because they believe that her party has given them their families and their communities short shrift in trump however they have a future president who threatens to withdraw their rights who claims to aim to roll back roe v wade to take a womans right to choose out of the constitution and to institute some kind of punishment for women who terminate pregnancies trumps promise to repeal the affordable care act on his first day in office means that unwanted pregnancies will become harder to prevent with coverage withdrawn for women to get contraception provided free or at low cost in addition to policy it is impossible to overlook the impact that this most misogynist president will have on american social norms donald trump has boasted about committing sexual assault and has a dozen women with evidence that his boasts were more than just locker room talk he has called women pigs and dogs said that putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing and agreed that his daughter ivanka was a piece of ass he has described a woman who was breastfeeding as disgusting even if many women voters didnt care that trump disparaged clintons appearance her stamina her presidential look her ability to satisfy her husband they might be affected by their country being led by a man who behaves as trump does if the head of state can treat women like objects why should any other american man feel he should behave differently i know that we still have not shattered that highest glass ceiling clinton said in her painful concession speech on wednesday morning but some day someone will hopefully sooner than we might think right now how soon will that be progressives must be diligent to ensure that the enduring narrative of clintons failure does not centre on her gender only then will the democratic party be able to accomplish the drastic reform it needs to build a legitimate strategy to take back the white house in blaming sexism is
it is no use pretending donald trumps presidential election victory is a disaster for the united states and the world it is at least in part a victory for prejudice and fear for ignorance and spite it represents the triumph of economic nationalism and introspection over internationalism and the global good it is a victory built on fabrications because of this trumpism will ultimately fail confounded by its contradictions and its immorality it will be defeated but correcting this deformation will not be easy it will take time and the damage will be considerable many explanations have been offered for hillary clintons defeat last week all have an element of truth for some she was an uncharismatic figure the democratic base was uninspired and many stayed at home doubts surrounded her past conduct not least in respect of the clinton foundation in many minds she represented a discredited political establishment there was about her candidacy an off putting sense of entitlement there was her husbands inescapable ambiguous legacy and clinton was a woman reaching up to a place of power no woman has ever gone a mostly unspoken misogyny undoubtedly played a part in her downfall more broadly the complacency of the democratic party and americas liberal left too comfortable after eight safe years of barack obama did clinton a great disservice the party and its elected representatives badly misread the mood of the nation so too for the most part did independent pollsters and the us media they initially dismissed trump as a clown and then proceeded with honourable exceptions to give him too easy a ride all these factors contributed to clintons demise but they are not the whole story trump won because he successfully tapped the alienation and disillusionment of white voters men and women who comprise of the electorate and turned out for him in large numbers as polling breakdowns show the determining factors were not education or gender not age religion or geography not trumps sexual predations or clintons fbi entanglements they were race and colour linked to economic distress trump exploited a feeling among whites from all backgrounds urban suburban and rural that obamas multicultural multiracial tolerant inclusive and open outward looking america was not working for them there were significant numbers of people who felt their grievances were no longer being listened to by a centrist party that had loosed itself from its blue collar moorings as thomas frank said in these pages last week the democrats went from being the party of decatur to the party of marthas vineyard and they did so at roughly the same time that the republicans were sharpening their deadly image of the liberal elite part of the constituency that switched to trump was railing against a sense of being overlooked during eight years of president obama race unquestionably played a part when trump shrieked his slogan make america great again what he was really saying was make america white again when he spoke about curbing immigration and building a mexican wall when he demonised muslims minorities and people from foreign countries he does not know or trust when he vowed to scrap international trade deals that he claims are destroying jobs in the midwest when he railed against selfish allies who do not pay their way the subliminal message was always the same fear of the foreigner in americas midst trump conjured the illusion of a return to a simpler homogenous monocultural society of secure employment safe neighbourhoods and agreed values no wonder african americans latinos and other dark skinned minorities are frightened no wonder us relations around the globe are in turmoil and rightwing european populists and hard brexiters are celebrating no wonder observers speak of the end of the west and the demise of liberal democracy trumpism has stormed the shining city on a hill betrayed the founding fathers who stood tall for human dignity and universal rights and now presages an isolationist america made in trumps image a beacon of discrimination and malice there are the peculiarities of the american electoral system to consider too hillary clinton won a majority of the popular vote but was handsomely beaten in the race for electoral college votes and too little attention was paid to the effect of a decision by the supreme court in when it struck down a key part of the voting rights act of by a five to four vote what this did was allow nine states with long records of voting discrimination such as georgia louisiana mississippi south carolina to no longer seek federal approval to change their laws the effect was seen last week as the explained consider what has been happening in north carolina a battleground state with a history of racial discrimination in voting republican lawmakers and officials have gone to remarkable lengths to drive down turnout among black voters who disproportionately favour democrats there were numerous other examples across the country including stringent voter id rules that the federal government had stated earlier this year had a disproportionate effect on minorities for the so called leader of the free world to allow legalised voter suppression is beyond irony what supporters and opponents alike are about to discover is that trumps appeal like the blue collar billionaire himself is two faced much of what he promised on the campaign trail will not be delivered or will be so watered down as to make no difference trump says he will cut taxes raise public spending and slash the federal deficit thats impossible all at once trump says he will renegotiate or scrap nafta and other free trade treaties but his conceit that this will help uncompetitive carmakers in detroit or steel makers in ohio is implausible he says he will slap swingeing tariffs on chinese imports but he knows the geopolitical and commercial realities mean he will not he says he will make america strong and honour its friends then kowtows to vladimir putin the wests most formidable strategic
since trump won as is to be expected after a shock election result the blame stick has been hurled far and wide hitting everyone from white women to black women to poor people to white men to hispanics to the musical hamilton and the polling guys like nate silver silver especially is targeted because his model predicted clinton had a chance of victory other models in the new york times and huffington post had clintons chance much stronger it has led to fights and debates over who was right or more precisely least wrong oddly this argument over the models had begun before the election day with silver and huffington posts ryan griff having it out over the relative worth of their models there was a lot of back and forth and a lot of people tweeting about it seriously who gives a damn im not blaming silver or any poll aggregators for the result that would be silly but as they now occupy a major part of the media we should be honest poll aggregation has become everything it hated and is actually worse for coverage of elections and politics that what it replaced do blame the media trumpland is a place where truth does matter katharine murphy read morepoll aggregators in the us and in australia sprung up on blogs in the mid as a response to the then stupid reporting of polls chief political writers would report on two percentage point shifts in newspoll as massive news one week and a fortnight later a shift back of two percentage points as separate massive news all the shifts were explained due to things the journalists to be true because they more than we did about what really was going on the poll aggregators instead realised that individual polls were erratic and that most of the commentary was about statistical noise rather than actual shifts in voters preferences they instead bundled all the polls to come out with a less noisy number and at the time i thought their analysis a welcome addition that changed the coverage for the better journalists became more statistically aware and now always mention margins of error and talk of the trend but the overarching problem of the poll reportage was not that it was inaccurate but that it occurred at all reporting of polls automatically converts the coverage into a horse race that coverage is a massive media failure and poll aggregators greatly increase the failure now i love data and i dont pretend that what i do is somehow beyond criticism as katharine murphy has written the election result should have all in the media realising their work is making little or no difference but polls are not economic or social data they dont record how many sales or prices or even estimate employment they record the feelings of people about what they might do in a week month years time but they do convey a sense of fact they are quantitative and thus they tempt you into thinking they are more true than a qualitative report numbers dont lie and so you get seduced i was guilty of it even throughout this year while i was writing against them and arguing with friends about how pointless the polls coverage was i would check the website to see what the percentages were its tough to resist and the problem is this love of data has made the horse race coverage seem legitimate hard news and as a result the performance of polling has come to define the performance of election coverage this is not merely a us phenomenon we saw it here in australia after the election when media outlets tried to explain why they got it wrong but polling coverage is not hard news it is entertainment disguised as hard news many polling aggregators like silver originally used their statistical knowledge to analyse sport and such data crunching is perfect for sport sport statistics involve things that have actually occurred runs scored tackles or turnovers conceded rather than opinions it allows sports supporters to play the role of coach because in effect such data analysis gives a reader greater understanding of the coachs policies but political polls dont do that rather than coaches they transform us into campaign managers but managers insidiously removed from reality we look at polling maps and data and think oh the poll numbers are weak in pennsylvania and wisconsin but looking good for hispanics aged under but what the hell does that mean what does a weak poll in wisconsin tell us does it mean a better health policy needed immigration reform a different candidate its great for conversations over a beer but awful for covering an election political polling coverage is actually a step removed in a way that analysis of sporting statistics is not we see this in the analysis suggesting clinton ignored wisconsin she didnt hold one rally there and those loudly decrying that she only started going to michigan in the last couple weeks immediately we go into a campaign manager mindset it traps us into thinking about the ground game the advertising buys the rally numbers and locations of the candidate on various days as though that actually matters to the voters and as if reading about such things actually helps voters make a decision we think like a campaign manager but one with no interest in policies or voters other than as numbers on a map it was bad enough when you had the chief political writer interpreting the polling data like moses come down from the mount but it is even worse when you have whole teams devoted to the polls for the numbers and hype about the models are all geared towards convincing us that their numbers are more factual and the analysis behind it more trustworthy than that done by the old rube churning out copy about the latest point movement in newspoll look at the graphs
when president elect donald trump enters the white house next year he will bring with him potential conflicts of interest across all areas of government that are unprecedented in american history trump who manages a sprawling international network of businesses has thus far refused to put his businesses into a blind trust the way his predecessors in the nations highest office have traditionally done instead he has said his businesses will be run by his own adult children donald trump jr trumps eldest child has insisted that trumps holdings would go into a trust managed by him and his siblings eric and ivanka trump were not going to be involved in government trump jr told abcs george stephanopoulos in september on good morning america he wants nothing to do with the company he wants to fix this country candace smith realdonaldtrump eldest children son in law are on his presidential transition team executive committee pic twitter com jr eric and ivanka trump are all on the president elects transition team executive committee per abcs candace smith as is trumps son in law jared kushner but according to regulators who have overseen potential conflicts of interests under two former presidents trumps arrangements were unprecedented and present a host of issues this is in no way a blind trust said karl sandstrom former chairman of the federal election commission the regulatory body that oversees campaign finance under bill clinton and george w bush a blind trust is not anywhere near the same you dont still have access to the decision being made thats why you put assets in and dont just have someone else manage the company he said trumps assets will instead apparently remain united under his company and operated under his name even if he is not directly in charge reagan spent some time in the private sector but he certainly wasnt a ceo said robert lenhard also a former fec chair appointed by george w bush he wasnt operating a set of companies like trump is most of our presidents have come out of political careers eisenhowers time out of office was mostly a hiatus between the military and the presidency trump owns hotels in chicago new york city las vegas waikiki and most recently in washington dc just down pennsylvania avenue from the white house as with any hotel chain the trump organization will oversee power water maintenance security billing and any number of other logistical details that will now essentially be negotiated between the provider and the family of the president abroad trump holds properties in istanbul where his election was met with satisfaction by that countrys president recep tayyip erdoan as well as mumbai vancouver and seoul among many others with trumps children running his businesses there is also the matter of their bearing his name and thus the name of the president anywhere in the world when they arrive to negotiate leases and construction deals from his financial filings the future us leader also appears to be a shareholder or beneficiary of several entities headquartered abroad among them excel venture llc in the french west indies and caribusiness investments srl based in the dominican republic how trumps holdings in those countries will affect us relations with them remains to be seen both are notable for their use in finance to avoid taxes trump has promised to cut the rate for repatriating cash into the us as an incentive for others who like him keep taxable funds overseas in azerbaijan trump has a real estate project he said was on hold during the presidential campaign his partner in the endeavor was anar mammadov son of the iranian transportation minister ziya mammadov who was accused in diplomatic cables released by wikileaks in of laundering money in russia where trumps election has been met with congratulations by president vladimir putin trump worked closely with the russian born american financier felix h sater managing director of the new york based firm bayrock llc sater and bayrock founder tevfik arif worked closely with trump and others in his organization in a deposition trump said that he had discussed numerous deals all over the world with arif and that arif had brought potential russian investors to meet trump at his office according to a report in the new york times bayrock was examined closely during a lawsuit filed by its former finance director jody kriss the times said the firm had occasionally received unexplained infusions of cash from accounts in kazakhstan and russia also in russia there are trumps ties to paul manafort who ran his campaign from march to august manafort who helped to install putin ally viktor yanukovych as president in ukraine was named in a corruption investigation by a ukrainian authority working with the fbi then there is the matter of the president elects stock portfolio trump has holdings in dakota access pipeline company energy transfer partners in his first days trump has pledged to remove every impediment to the pipeline which has been the subject of protests violently suppressed by police in north dakota he also owns stock in facebook whose ceo mark zuckerberg posted that he was feeling hopeful on wednesday and in bank of america he has promised to deregulate the banking industry michael cohen trumps attorney defended trumps post election business plans on thursday speaking of trumps family he said theyre really intelligent theyre really qualified thats why he really didnt run in because they were younger by four years he told cnn while conflicts of interest may cause scandals for the president they are unlikely to add to his long list of legal woes in the supreme court gave richard nixon absolute immunity to prosecution for most kinds of crimes committed while in office setting a precedent for administrations to come the presidents absolute immunity is a functionally mandated incident of his unique office rooted in the constitutional tradition of the separation of powers and supported by the nations history wrote justice lewis

observers cite voter anger at an entitled political establishment and an ever wealthier and privileged elite gridlock and dysfunction in washington international tensions and economic dislocation and distress to explain his victories in the primaries and now in the general election theyre not wrong over the course of the campaign trump threw fuel on all these hotspots still more critical to his success he nailed the white male support that would put him over the top in electoral votes on by his continual attacks on the legitimacy of the nations first african american president his targeting and denunciation of undocumented immigrants and muslims and his overtly sexist remarks about women but after writing a book about donald trump his father and his grandfather i think other factors played a pivotal role for starters theres a trump family culture of ruthlessly pressing any advantage stretching the truth and pushing the legal and ethical envelope to the max trumps german immigrant grandfather who operated restaurants in gold rush era seattle and the yukon amassed a nest egg by offering miners alcohol food and proximity to women his father greatly increased the family fortune by exploiting loopholes in new deal government subsidies he tapped to construct middle income housing in brooklyn and queens and trump used a billion dollar loss of borrowed money and four corporate bankruptcies to build a global brand and avoid paying personal income taxes for nearly two decades that family culture also includes an adherence to the success oriented theology of dr norman vincent peale author of the bestseller peale was the pastor of marble collegiate church where trumps parents attended services where trump and his sisters married and where funeral services for their parents took place in his book peale emphasises the supreme importance of self confidence a notion that trump has not merely embraced but weaponised with a winning at all costs scorched earth approach that has more than fulfilled his own fathers fierce injunction to be a killer in every pursuit among many results are a remarkable litigation history according to as of mid trump had been involved in more than lawsuits including dozens that are still active and a political campaign characterised by an unprecedented level of venom and vitriol but trump has also contributed his own special flourishes linguists found trump was second only to hillary clinton in terms of how feminine he soundedfor example his much ridiculed hair for years it has been a highly effective trademark a humanising bit of vanity that made him the peoples billionaire rather than a remote tycoon and on the campaign trail his coiffure made him the perpetual centre of attention as with the traditional circus clowns big red nose trumps bouffant blond combover cued audiences that at any moment he might do something entertaining and that it was permissible to laugh even cheer if some sort of antisocial activity occurred for a clown this includes antics like hitting people with a baseball bat or dumping water on their heads for trump it was likely to be a vicious taunt a preposterous exaggeration even a suggestion to rough up protesters behaviour that would ordinarily be considered unacceptable but was now tolerated even celebrated because it could be explained away as only a performance a joke or one of trumps favourite phrases truthful hyperbole ultimately however trumps success may have hinged on his voice i am your voice he declared in his acceptance speech at the republican national convention in july and there is more to that claim than might have been apparent at that moment let me lay it out curiously despite his obsession with showing that he is the most powerful person on earth his speech doesnt have the archetypal tough guy edge in part this is because as the reported during the primaries linguists found he was the second only to hillary clinton in terms of how feminine he sounded moreover when measured by non verbal cues like gestures facial expressiveness and statements posed as questions he came in as the most feminine of the entire field but perhaps even more importantly it is also because of the way he sounds although hes shown hes more than capable of shouting in classic rabble rousing style more often than not what comes out when he opens his mouth is not traditional alpha male talk in contrast to both the hyper belligerence of jean claude van damme and the chilling rasp of clint eastwood trumps speech tends to be in the middle range even slightly high pitched not effeminate but despite his guarantee in one debate as to the adequacy of his genital endowment not testosterone laden either this low key verbal tone might seem unimportant at most a meaningless distinction overshadowed by his relentless aggression and braggadocio in other words not a big deal but its effect is a big deal instead of insistently bellowing or pounding his chest like an arnold schwarzenegger hes tapping into a different stereotype the counter intuitive strongman who tosses off some of his most devastating comments with a malevolent sneer think marlon brando or robert de niro who make their point not by shouting theyre going to blow your head off but by hissing that youd better cooperate if you want to see another sunrise moreover trumps speech is hardly bristling with complexity rather his vocabulary is extremely simple almost to the point of being childish and his use of incomplete thoughts and sentence fragments has an unmediated stream of consciousness feel it is this combination the hint of menace beneath the surface added to what appears to be an unpolished immediacy that millions of listeners take as evidence of trumps authenticity and spontaneity indeed the way he talks reminds them of the voice inside their own heads a rich and sometimes dark stew of conversational snippets and memory scraps random phrases and half thoughts and by extension it somehow seems as if theyre hearing the voice inside his head

donald trump has won science and scientists played almost no part in the campaign now scientists must consider how they fit into a trump future this wont be easy many scientists are scared in the tribal world of us politics many now find themselves on the outside looking in most university scientists are democrats and the president house and senate will all be republican for this group nothing portends disaster more than the elevation of a long time opponent to national and international policies myron ebell of the competitive enterprise institute to oversee the transformation of the environmental protection agency even those academics who lean republican would despise trumps rejection of what a george w bush adviser once dismissed as the reality based community while speculating on details like who trump will ask to replace john holdren as his science advisor scientists should not just be asking what trump will do for them they should face up to the difficult question of what they should be doing for trump some scientists will have to join the white house itself when george w bush was elected his administration had a hard time finding a scientist willing to serve as his science advisor when jack marburger a highly respected administrator and physicist who was also a democrat took the job he was excoriated by his peers and excommunicated from some scientific circles we see hints of similar responses to trumps election already earlier this week the american physical society issued a press release congratulating trump on his victory and encouraging him to make sustained and robust funding of scientific research a top priority the aps received so many complaints that it felt compelled to retract it and issue an apology some have already written off trumps yet to be named science advisor for instance robert cook deegan of arizona state university says for trump im not sure his science advisor would matter because there wont be any policy apparatus science wont get much attention except when it gets in the way or bolsters support for a political priority marburger was called a prostitute upon taking the position under bush there are thousands of political appointees including many science positions that will need to be nominated expert advisory bodies constituted and reconstituted and experts put into staff positions under the white house any scientist who agrees to hold their nose and work with the trump administration should expect much of the same criticism received by marburger some such as government scientists will not have much choice but to engage that is their job the rest of the scientific community must still ask itself some difficult questions we suggest three is money all that matters during the late stages of the presidential campaign nobel prize winners endorsed hillary clinton and pushed for more funding for research and policies that support the scientific workforce they suggested that there were other reasons for their support but focused on what the next president might do for the interests of the scientific community the incoming president of the american geophysical union expressed a similar concern theres a fear that the scientific infrastructure in the u s is going to be on its knees everything from funding to being able to attract the global leaders we need to do basic science research if trump imagines that the scientific community could cause him trouble one option would be to do what nye bevan did to reactionary doctors in setting up the nhs and stuff their mouths with gold trump could echo obamas rhetoric promising to restore science to its rightful place by increasing funding it would be the art of the deal and it would put critical scientists in a difficult position no one knows what trump will do on science or much else however the history of us science funding shows that republican presidents appear more eager to spend money on r d than their democratic counterparts priorities have varied with democrats spending more through the environmental protection agency and commerce while republicans spend more on defense the national science foundation and national institutes of health overall spending on r d is not well correlated with party politics mainly because science funding has long been a bipartisan priority other than the massive injections of cash through the apollo programme and obamas smaller stimulus package more recently non defence science funding has remained pretty stable as a proportion of government discretionary spending since the end of world war two without much discussion of the fiscal consequences trump has announced grand plans for increases in us infrastructure investment for science this could mean high profile funding for nasa perhaps newt gingrich will revive his vision of a moon base and a mission to mars the military industrial scientific complex demoted since the end of the cold war could receive a boost organisations that advocate for more science funding have already sought to tie in r d funding with trumps calls for greater investment scientists need to consider how to react to possible increases in funding as well as express fears of decreases in doing so they might position themselves as representatives of the public good rather than just another special interest group should pragmatism trump purity how should scientists engage on policy issues such as vaccination and climate change where republicans are often accused of being anti science or worse at war with science despite trumps rhetorical nods to the social conservative wing of his party during the campaign and his enthusiasm for convenient conspiracy theories he is clearly a pragmatist with little worry about changing his policy preferences scientists should therefore ask themselves whether they would support policies that did what they regard as the right thing but for the wrong reasons policies focused on deploying electric vehicles and nuclear or wind power may be justified in purely economic rather than environmental terms alternatively environmental regulations may provide convenient cover for the taxing of imports as the usa struggles to
world leaders have begun congratulating donald trump on his election win as people around the world anxiously wait to see how their country will engage with the new us president the order in which trump spoke to leaders around the world has sparked speculation as to how he will shape his foreign policy in the hours after his victory speech trump spoke to egypt ireland mexico israel turkey india

election campaign but although the german chancellor angela merkel and the french president franois hollande offered support they labelled his leadership a period of uncertainty we asked people around the world to tell us what the situation looks like from where they live how their governments are responding to trumps victory and how they think his leadership will affect their lives egyptegypt and the us will probably grow closer but as citizens we will suffer from trumps endorsement of our president sara engineerwe live in a police state where students activists and journalists disappear or are jailed the obama administration had been putting pressure on our government to improve human rights and freedom of speech but i doubt donald trumps administration will do the same this is evident from our current presidents eagerness to connect with trump i hope he hires a team that understands the complexities of the middle east it is evident he does have a cluesara egyptboth hillary clinton and trump are heavily disliked in the middle east by muslims and arabs while trump is openly hostile to muslims and clueless about the region hillarys policy as secretary of state has been very deliberate and damaging to the region despite her partys more tolerant and inclusive tone having gone through a very similar election scenario in egypt in where both candidates were hated i was not very surprised by the outcome the democratic party underestimated trumps popularity and the dislike for hillary i feel a lot of votes went to trump out of spite for hillary perhaps if a different candidate had gone against trump the outcome would have been different just like what happened in egypt it looks like the american population is now sharply split in half with each side demonising the other i think thats the most dangerous thing that can happen to a country having racist intolerant people in power might make it easier to challenge them as they are now out in the open but healing the rifts in society is much harder i simply hope trump will become a president for all us citizens as is his duty and reign in the hateful extremist tendencies displayed by white americans i hope he hires a competent team that understands the complexities of the situation in the middle east and worldwide as it is evident that he does not have a clue chinapotential trade conflicts but he will use his business wisdom to deal with it boyang beijingi feel great about the result its a tremendous win for the masses for those who were constantly ignored by political elites in washington i like trump a lot because he knew the real problems of the country rather than just chanting politically correct slogans the us is divided now probably more divided than when i worked there for three years that happens when you are obsessed with gay rights and minority rights but forget to promote the most basic right of living a better life for the majority he will be a great president if he improve some of his rhetoricboyang chinathe pivot to asia plot and the tpp are now dead trump is likely to be a more pragmatic figure than obama so sino us relations will improve theres going to be some trade conflicts if trump lives up to his word about china but i believe he will use his business wisdom to deal with it china will have an easier situation and a stronger influence in the region a win win cooperation between these two countries could benefit humankind i wish that trump could be more presidential he will be a great president if he improves some of his rhetoric i hope that he can get along with china indiawe have a lot of supporters for trump mostly from far right parties mithun keralato say the result was shocking would be an understatement victory of an alt right fanatic like trump in a country known around the world for its liberal virtues and principles is something that adds to the swerve of the world to the right he adds on to the list of rightwing politicians such as recep tayyip erdoan in turkey vladimir putin in russia and of course narendra modi in india maybe we are witnessing the gradual transition of the world into a global conflict in india we have a lot of supporters for trump mostly from far right parties its another moment of jubilation for them maybe the consequences for foreign policy will be beneficial as trump has publicly shown his admiration for modi and his way of governance but his temperamental nature makes trump truly unpredictable so we will have to wait and see as long as he doesnt turn rhetoric into reform i think the world will be safemithun indiain southern india where im from most of the people have a similar opinion to me but in the northern areas of india the stomping ground of the ruling rightwing opinions may differ the philosophy of gandhi of a mutual peaceful coexistence which was even enshrined in our foreign policy until an ideological regime change is something i firmly believe

an estimated of americas million armed forces personnel are stationed abroad there are an estimated us service personnel dotted about the middle east but the us does not release precise information on all their locations global mapafghanistanafghanistan barely featured in the election campaign but when donald trump takes office he will not be able to ignore what is now americas longest war thousands of us troops are still stationed there the security situation is deteriorating as the taliban threaten cities and consolidate control of rural areas and isis has joined the war although american forces are not officially in a combat role have died there this year making it a deadlier theatre of operations for the us military than iraq or syria the taliban responded to the us election result by calling on trump to withdraw americas troops but advisers will warn him that without the backing of foreign airpower and other military expertise the country is likely to fall to the taliban his strong stance on fighting isis and islamic terrorism means he is unlikely to hand control of a country where thousands of american troops died to a scarcely less hardline group he has also expressed concerns about nuclear weapons in neighbouring pakistan trump has repeatedly called for us allies to pay more towards their own security but there is almost no cash to be had in afghanistan which is already largely dependent on foreign aid for its budget and is one of the poorest nations in the world he is likely to be stuck then with the multibillion dollar bill for the us presence and support of afghan troops emma graham harrisonbaltic statesthe baltic states are nervous about whether a trump administration would defend them in the event of a russian attack in july trump told the new york times he would not necessarily come to the aid of lithuania latvia and estonia unless they had first stumped up enough cash into nato coffers nato has recently been ramping up its military exercises in the baltics in response to what it sees as a growing kremlin threat in december the us airborne unit is due to train with latvian troops at a former soviet military base but it is unclear if such us led exercises will continue there is also uncertainty as to what will be trumps russia policy the fear is that trump will effectively concede eastern europe to moscow as a sphere of influence this would give vladimir putin russias president a free hand to create havoc in the baltics raising the spectre of cyber attacks subversion of democratic elections and even covert russian invasion similar to the events of in east ukraine and crimea luke hardingcanadathe possible impact of a trump presidency on trade is the main worry of canadas goods and services exports go to the us representing of the countrys gdp and jobs trumps promise to renegotiate nafta which he called the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere has alarmed ottawa but analysts point out that much of the two countries trade is also governed by world trade organisation rules and the us ambassador to canada has said canada would be willing to look again at the agreement in a gesture of goodwill towards the new administration canadians are also worried by trumps views on climate change and the consequences not just for the un paris agreement but bilateral pacts such as the deal struck by barack obama and the canadian prime minister justin trudeau to limit methane emissions from the oil and gas industry trump could prove positive for the canadian oil industry suffering like many from low prices transcanadas planned keystone xl pipeline carrying oil from alberta to a us terminal in nebraska was rejected by the obama administration after six years of review trump has said he would approve the project which would give canadian oil companies easier and so more profitable access to international markets if it were resubmitted as long as the us benefited from its construction and got a share of the profits jon henleyfrancetheir world collapses ours is being built tweeted florian philippot a front national vice president and marine le pens righthand man as trump headed for victory trumps win certainly makes a president le pen more plausible more than polls in the last two years have consistently shown her finishing second or winning the first round of frances presidential elections on april after that conventional wisdom says le pen will be heavily defeated in the run off stage by her rival at present likely to be the veteran centre right former prime minister alain jupp who is seen as a safe pair of hands after two hugely unpopular presidents some le pen policies particularly that of taking france out of the euro simply scare too many voters and current polling says le pen would lose to jupp backed by an anti fn front rpublicain after brexit and trump we know polls can be wrong for them to be wrong by percentage points would be extraordinary but the same factors that drove trumps victory are clearly in play in france le pen as the countrys president cannot be completely ruled out especially if jupp does not make it to the second round jon henleyiranall eyes are on how trumps presidency will play out vis vis last years landmark nuclear deal which was widely praised as a triumph of diplomacy that averted the risk of another war in the middle east despite his speech in march to the pro israel lobby aipac during which he said his first priority was to dismantle the disastrous deal with iran it is still unclear what path trump will follow in office he has contradicted himself on the deal previously conceding that it would be hard to rip it up without european support trumps lack of credibility among traditional european allies of the us led some to think that his victory would be unlikely to cause much trouble
donald trump has invited theresa may to washington and affirmed his belief in the special relationship between the uk and the us the invitation came in mays first conversation with the president elect trump reportedly spoke to nine other world leaders before he spoke to may but number sources have said there was no urgent need for a conversation philip hammond the chancellor has announced plans to strengthen links between the london and shanghai stock exchanges he was speaking at a press conference with the chinese vice premier ma kai laura hughes philip hammond says china and the uk are enjoying a golden era and are taking their relationship to a new level pic twitter com miliband the former labour leader has denounced trump as a a racist misogynistic self confessed groper but also set out three lessons progressive parties can learn from his election victory thats all from me for today i have to get to a school parents evening which is late afternoon thanks for the comments this is from the suns harry cole harry cole source trump affirmed special relationship wants to strengthen bilateral trade and investment be honoured to invite her to dc november this is from the evening standards joe murphy joe murphy i gather president elect invited mrs may to visit as soon as possible and sd it would be a great honour to welcome her to washingtonnovember theresa may has spoken to donald trump this is from itvs chris ship chris ship prime minister had her conversation with president elect realdonaldtrump at uk time this afternoonnovember it is worth noting that of the three lessons that ed miliband thinks progressives need to learn from donald trump two are ones that jeremy corbyn has already embraced corbyns policy agenda is ambitious not incremental and he can credibly pose as an outsider but he is not particularly comfortable championing nationalism or patriotism ed miliband the former labour leader was on the world at one talking about donald trump he expressed horror at trumps politics but like jeremy corbyn yesterday and emily thornberry this morning he accepted that trump won support because people were rightly fed up with the economic status quo miliband said that he thought he had a good analysis of this problem when he was leader of the labour party but that his solutions were obviously not sufficiently convincing however since then miliband appears to have given the subject more thought because in his interview he offered some fresh thinking on how political parties could respond to these challenges it was one of the most interesting interventions ive heard from any british politician since trumps election here are the key points miliband identified three lessons that progressive politicians could learn from the success of donald trump parties like labour needed to offer big solutions stop defending the system like insiders and embrace patriotism he said i think there are deep lessons from brexit and trump what are the lessons first of all the economic lessons because whatever you say about trump and brexit they offer big solutions i think they are false solutions and we should not invent false gods of our own but our solutions are too incremental and not big enough for the diagnosis of inequality and the problems that we see secondly being political insiders is a massive problem trump was the consumate outsider and i do think in a sense that got him permission to be heard and i think we have to think very hard about how we dont defend the existing broken politics that people perceive but actually want to change it then thirdly this issue of nationhood and patriotism and the truth is that trump has invented a xenophobic anti immigrant nasty view of nationhood but we dont yet have a convincing one of our own simply defending globalisation openness on its own without fairness has been proved to be deeply insufficient he said neoliberalism had failed we should certainly be saying neoliberalism has failed the current economic system does not work it has accrued the gains to the top and people have got squeezed and left out he said that following the brexit vote he accepted that there would have to be some controls on the free movement of eu citizens into the uk politicians had to understand peoples concerns he said having seen the referendum we have got if at all possible to see some change in relation to free movement he said that he still believed in openness and the advantages of the single market but that this needed to be combined with fairness too he described trump as a racist misogynistic self confessed groper and said people should be deeply worried about his election the idea that we have shared values with a racist misogynistic self confessed groper beggars belief i think we should be deeply worried about the implications for many of the things that we care about tackling climate change he says its invented by the chinese and its a hoax dealing with problems in the middle east he says hes going to recognise jerusalem almost immediately as the capital of israel with all kinds of implications that has for the middle east peace process his attitude to russia and then this fantasy about trade this guy is anti trade hes an odd combination of protectionism plus the old trickle down tax cut formula that has got us into a lot of this mess in the first place he said trumps election was symptomatic of a sickness in america ed miliband photograph will oliver epa philip hammond the chancellor has suggested that donald trumps protectionsim could damage global prosperity nicola sturgeon the scottish first minister has said some of trumps views are deeply abhorrent the uks hopes for a continuation of the much vaunted special relationship with the us under trump have suffered an early setback after the new president elect spoke to nine world leaders in the hours after
in january donald trump will become president of the united states of america and the most technologically advanced surveillance infrastructure in the world will start reporting directly to him when edward snowden revealed the extent of the national security agencys domestic surveillance regime in he warned that a new american president could rapidly expand its scope overnight with just a simple change of government policy a new leader will be elected snowden said theyll flip the switch say that because of the crisis because of the dangers that we face in the world some new and unpredicted threat we need more authority we need more power and there will be nothing the people can do at that point to oppose it and it will be turnkey tyranny as in many other policy areas we dont yet know trumps plans for surveillance but better safe than sorry protecting yourself from surveillance by the nsa isnt easy but with information security technologies it is possible in fact its possible to fit the basic guidelines in a tweet like this from the pseudonymous security researcher the grugq the grugq snowden opsec guide use signal use tor use full disk encryption use a password manager use two factor authsolid basics november signalencrypted messaging has got a lot easier over the past few years particularly with the rise of encrypted texting apps such as signal developed by open whisper systems the gold standard of encrypted communications is still pgp an encryption standard first released years ago by phil zimmermann while pgp has the honour of being one of the few encryption systems that the nsa appears to have not developed a workable attack against it is also tricky to use with few good mobile options and a number of potential usability hiccups which can result in accidental exposure of information signal by contrast is very easy to use the app lets users add each other using their phone numbers before providing a scannable qr code for double checking that no third party has intercepted the initial communication scan each others qr codes and if they both flash green youre good to go you can use signal from then on like a conventional messaging app even installing a desktop extension so you can chat on the go if switching to another app is too much hassle or if switching friends family and colleagues to it is there are good alternatives in the commercial sphere both apples imessage and facebooks whatsapp offer end to end encryption with the latter even using the same open standard developed by signal avoid unencrypted apps such as wechat and google hangouts as well as apps with an optional encrypted mode like google allo and facebook messenger its too easy to accidentally forget to turn on the encrypted mode or get lazy and stop using it altogether and definitely avoid email and sms both of which are sent unencrypted and are easy to intercept use tortor once called the onion router is a technology most associated with the dark web the shady part of the internet that hits headlines for being full of illegal material but the technology was created ironically by the us state department to help activists in repressive nations communicate freely online and its effective for keeping all of your browsing out of the reach of prying eyes it works by parcelling up data into bundles which are then encrypted multiple times to dictate a path through a network of volunteer computers before reaching the final destination like a game of pass the parcel each relay node in the network receives the bundle and decrypts one layer which reveals the instructions for where to pass it on to this means that the destination server doesnt know where the request came from and the relays in the middle know neither the user nor the destination ideally the system is secure from eavesdropping tor hidden services which make up the core of the dark web are even more secure as the destination server is itself a fully configured tor node ensuring the request need never return to the surface web that means that an observer cant tell that a tor user has even visited the site at all let alone which particular tor user among the companies running tor hidden services are the guardian and facebook in practice there are more difficulties to using tor than there are signal for one the nature of the network will make browsing more difficult the limited capacity imposes bandwidth constraints slowing internet speeds while many sites uneasy about having users who they cant identify through ip addresses will block tor entirely additionally there is more scope for error with tor its possible to mess up and send some information over an unencrypted connection if you arent careful which can provide a fingerprint that an eavesdropping agency can use to deanonymise you in addition there have been successful attacks on tor which work by flooding the network with fake relay points in an attempt to control all of the middle nodes on a given connection if you are in a country which hasnt just elected a populist demagogue president you can help counter these efforts by setting up your own tor relays use full disk encryptionthis is easier than ever these days on a mac you will likely have full disk encryption on by default if you are running a recent version of macos check by going to the security and privacy tab of system preferences and clicking on filevault if its turned on youre good to go on windows its only slightly harder bitlocker microsofts full disk encryption feature isnt on by default but can be turned on by searching for encryption from the start menu clicking change device encryption settings then manage bitlocker and turning it on similar settings are available in older versions of windows going back to vista if youre running a version of windows older than vista you need to
britains national newspapers registered their profound shock at donald trumps victory over hillary clinton with pages and pages of coverage the daily telegraphs front page called it the election that shook the world while the daily mirror showed the statue of liberty clasping her face and a headline asking what have they done in lengthy editorials leader writers sought to make sense of what the times referred to as the most dramatic insurgency in american political history politics will never be the same said the times it was a political earthquake that the american political class could not bring itself to imagine the guardian also called it a global political earthquake contending that president trump is the shock heard round the world the financial times believes it marks a thunderous repudiation of the status quo while the daily telegraph sees the vote as the shattering of the liberal consensus by antipolitics every paper has views on why it happened of course and there is a considerable and somewhat surprising measure of agreement across the political spectrum the times points out that trumps base white working class men was bolstered by white women with college degrees plus nearly one third of asian and hispanic voters for all of them trump was the change candidate and that change is scary with the threat to impose stiff tariffs on chinese and mexican imports even so the times thinks britain may do well because trump has far more affinity with and affection for these islands than mr obama trumps victory was said the daily telegraph americas brexit moment his campaign was based on being the outsider who would give the political establishment a bloody nose trump is not a rightwinger in economic terms and on social policy he has mostly adopted liberal positions nor is he a leftwinger because he believes in low taxes and has been strident in his comments about immigration but his protectionism is problematic it would help no one said the telegraph least of all those americans who want mr trump to improve their lives it continued from britains point of view upholding the special relationship is more important than ever in the wake of the brexit vote none the less if president elect trump is to be true to the spirit of brexit that he has invoked then he must lead an america that reaches out to the rest of the world and does not retreat into an isolationist shell the daily mail reads trumps win as a revolt against a complacent liberal elite that includes but is not confined to media pundits the bbc bienpensant politicians and the massed ranks of luvvies it was an unmistakable warning to the wests we know best political class who have nothing but contempt for the ordinary people whose interests they profess to hold dear the paper continued they simply fail to understand voters rejection of all the isms beloved of the left or trumps appeal to the most enduring ism of them all old fashioned patriotism and that left had displayed the same stunned reaction to brexit why because voters were fed up with having their concerns about mass immigration ignored and were sick to death of a political class bailing out super rich bankers while family budgets were relentlessly squeezed for the mail the result is a warning to all liberal elites including the french germans and those who seek to frustrate brexit of the penalty for ignoring the electorate the sun urges people to calm down arguing that trumps crazier ideas should be reined in by experienced republican party advisers anyway it thinks he has some solid economic policies and could forge a new era of dialogue with vladimir putin whom he admires ah yes and he is also a fan of brexit like the mail it sees an equivalency between the vote for trump and the vote to leave the eu contending that smug lefties should condemn less and seek to understand more do they not grasp that for years voters with falling wages were ignored by politicians in washington or westminster the daily express which views every current event through its obsessive loathing for the eu is relieved that trump backs brexit the express registers its delight that nigel farage has cosied up to trump and believes it is a great relief to have a friend in the white house who respects the special relationship and is ready to put britain at the front of the queue the daily mirror as its brilliant front page indicates is downcast at trumps victory a tragedy not just for america but the rest of the world it says the keys to the globes most powerful democracy have been handed to a man who is a serial liar sexual predator and overt racist anyone who cares about the wellbeing of the united states where inequality is rife and racial tensions run high should be alarmed those who care about global security the international economy climate change and human rights should despair the mirror finds trumps domestic agenda such as his plans to dismantle obamacare expel muslims and build a wall on the mexican border distasteful it also believes he poses a risk to world security the global economy and nato but the mirror believes it necessary to understand why he won he spoke to those left behind by globalisation stuck in low paid and insecure jobs and fearful for their families future the independent believes trumps election is part of a revolution sweeping through the developed world but argues that although the brexit trump phenomenon is powerful and new it does not mean that centrist liberal politics is dead however if centrist liberalism is to survive it must learn some deep lessons and renew itself the wrong response to defeat is to blame the american voters for their stupidity or prejudice just as the wrong response to the brexit vote was to deride leavers a successful and confident liberalism has to
donald trump triumphed but so did bashar al assad like other leaders around the world syrias isolated president most likely spent the day after assessing the impact on him of the republicans unexpected victory the dreadful assad soaked in blood after five years of civil war is probably one of the big winners but there are plenty of big losers too putin applauds trump win and hails new era of positive ties with us read morevladimir putin heads up the first category trump has shown unusual partiality towards the russian president even though the two men have never met as a candidate trump suggested that unlike barack obama he could do business with putin and might for example accept russias illegal annexation of crimea trump failed to condemn alleged russian online hacking of the democratic party and covert meddling in the election process he has rattled nato allies in eastern europe by stating that as commander in chief he would not necessarily rush to their military assistance if threatened by russia in syria and iraq trump says his top priority is defeating isis not toppling the regime in damascus hence assads big sigh of relief he has declined to condemn russias leading role in the merciless bombardment of eastern aleppo and its actions on other syrian battlefronts which the un says may constitute war crimes it is widely believed russia is gearing up for a final battle to take aleppo for its ally assad while the american transition is under way perversely despite his focus on isis little or nothing has been heard from trump about moscows targeting of syrian opposition factions rather than the jihadis like the people of syria the citizens of afghanistan are losers too for them trump represents a new twist in an old nightmare he sees continued us military involvement there as contrary to american interests and could simply pull out leaving the country to the taliban and al qaida china tantalized by us election mayhem and prospect of trump as president read morexi jinping chinas president is probably feeling quite good xi is a strong authoritarian quasi dictatorial figure the sort of leader like putin that trump appears to admire one can imagine the two men hitting it off on a personal level although xi is the more subtle of the two he will worry about trumps unpredictable temperament and his talk of trade tariffs on china xi will relish trumps criticism of obamas so called pivot to asia which he sees as a bid to contain china if trump pivots away from the region that will suit beijing just fine especially if it means it can accelerate its illegal expansionism in the south china sea and ratchet up the pressure on taiwan a big asian loser on the face of it is shinzo abe japans prime minister who has bet the farm on closer military ties with the us trump says japan and south korea must do more to defend themselves including possibly acquiring nuclear weapons to deter north korea his threats to nuke north korea if provoked could if realised make losers of us all in contrast a big undeserving winner is rodrigo duterte the new philippines president who famously called obama a son of a whore and declared he was cutting military cooperation duterte notorious for the drug busting death squads he has unleashed welcomed trumps victory on wednesday a reaction that will likely be shared by human rights abusers from belarus to burma in iran hassan rouhani is in an even bigger bind now that trump is heading for the white house his nuclear deal last year with obama is under constant fire from conservatives including the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei in this respect trump has much in common with the mullahs he called the pact the worst ever deal in history and vowed to scrap it trumps evident ignorance of and lack of interest in large parts of the world mean for example the pressure may be off leaders like omar al bashir sudans president who stands accused of genocide and war crimes in darfur and the repressive regime in saudi arabia responsible for documented atrocities in yemen trump does not support the international criminal court or the un system in general antonio guterres the incoming un secretary general may struggle to keep a trump administration engaged are entering a reign of mexico reels from trump election win read moremexico as yet not walled off looked like another big loser as the peso went through the floor president enrique pea nieto is widely loathed by his electorate for failing to challenge trump during his surprise visit to the country in september but in private he may be congratulating himself for getting on the right side of his new neighbour the lukewarm reaction to trumps success in many european capitals reflects a deep ideological as well as a political antipathy german ministers normally extremely cautious in public statements went so far as to imply it was a thoroughly bad outcome franois hollande the french president was even surlier saying the result showed the need for europe looking after itself for the eu already battered by brexit trump is bad news his hostility to free trade means the proposed ttip agreement is dead if not yet buried his belief that europe must do more to maintain its own security challenges the eu to put its money where it mouth is in developing a euro army and other independent capabilities this could hardly come at a worse time for the stripped eurozone countries the positive reaction of rightwing populist and nationalist parties across europe including frances national front indicates that they feel his anti establishment insurgency may facilitate theirs as close elections loom in france germany and the netherlands for britains government however trump could provide a much needed boost trump applauded the narrow british vote to leave the eu and hosted its best known advocate nigel farage on the campaign
wall street reacted positively to the election of donald trump as the us president despite his victory sparking panic on global markets earlier in the day but experts warned that the us and global economy faces a very uncertain future heres how the markets looked at the close the dow jones up to points the s p up to the nasdaq up to the biggest corporate winners were private prison operators oil companies and pharmaceutical companies all of these sectors faced punishing regulations under a clinton presidency and will benefit from trumps mission to loosen controls of businesses on the

treasury yield rose above the highest level since january economists cut their forecasts for us gdp growth by percentage points and warned of despair in the financial markets trumps economist adviser

wednesday before recovering to end the day more than points up the japanese nikkei closed down and hong kongs hang seng fell were wrapping up for the day but well be back tomorrow the former chairman and ceo of general electric said the opportunities are unlimited under a trump presidency you look at lower taxes you look at job creation we are stuck we have been stuck in a terrible overregulated economy for eight years i mean stuck business stinks welch a longtime republican told cnbc that he liked trumps message from the first day but he is still concerned about the messenger every time i lurched forward in support id lose the messenger hed do some wacky thing he said he said he hoped trump would build a broad coalition of republican talent in the white house you cant have grudges in this game you need talent we will win with the best people he said welch withdrew his support for trump following the revelations that the president elect thought he could grope women with impunity because he was famous jack welch like republican message on economy security and supreme court unfortunately wrong messenger party must change nominee now october the guardians economics editor larry elliott says americans have gambled on trumps promise that he can shift the the us out of its post financial crisis torpor by cutting taxes and increasing spending even though they run the risk of higher inflation and a bigger budget deficit although trump campaigned as an outsider his policies have been tried before ronald reagan said his tax cuts and extra spending for the pentagon would generate higher revenues and balance the budget it didnt tax breaks for the rich and military keynesianism sent the deficit rocketing for the time being all wall street can see is higher growth and bigger corporate profits thats why share prices have been going up you can read larrys whole piece here trump will have to temper his global antagonism economists saydont panic too much says berenberg banks chief americas economist mickey levy in a note to clients trump will learn quickly that international affairs are very complex and he will quickly come to rely on the various government agencies and experts that understand and influence the us approaches on international affairs this will serve to soften some of his brash statements during the campaign levy said trumps often outrageous campaign pledges to build a wall with mexico and tear up global trade agreements will fade with no material follow through or implementation and no wall will be built between mexico and the us china and mexico are two of the uss largest trading partners neither wants to enter a trade war with the us and neither can afford to do so the us relies heavily on imports from those partners current concerns about major trade barriers being erected are over stated and not realistic luca paolini chief strategist pictet asset management declared trump no friend of trade and warned that his protectionist streak poses perhaps the biggest threat to both world growth and financial markets his proposals to raise trade tariffs pledging among other things to levy a per cent tax on chinese imports are a worry his denouncement of china as a currency manipulator could also invite retaliation from the worlds second biggest economy at a time when global trade appears to be experiencing a structural decline trumps stance casts a shadow over the worlds economic prospects bofa merrill lynch downgrades us growththe bank has cut its forecasts for us gdp growth by percentage points in both the first and second quarter of and warned of despair in the financial markets it said near term drag shaved from first and second quarter gdp growth thereby lowering the annual number from to a more cautious fed we expect rather than fed rate hikes between now and the end of next year with the probability of a december hike falling to in given the high level of uncertainty about the exact policy changes at this stage we are assuming that trade tensions and fiscal stimulus have offsetting impacts on growth in the medium term while a wide range of outcomes is possible the risks to the economy seem to be skewed more to the downside trumps economic advisers have accused janet yellen the chair of the federal reserve of creating a false economy by keeping interest rates artificially low to help president obama and his democratic opponent hillary clinton trump has attacked yellen throughout his campaign in september he said yellen should be ashamed of herself i used to hope that the fed was independent he said in an interview with cnbc and the fed is obviously not independent its obviously not even close to being independent just hours

us stock markets reacted calmly to donald trumps shock presidential election victory on wednesday morning following a worldwide stock market panic overnight wall street stocks opened slightly higher despite futures markets earlier predicting a markets rout in reaction to the former reality tv star being elected to the worlds most powerful political position the dow jones industrial average was higher at points at the s p was down just and the nasdaq at the closing bell all three indexes posted gains the dow stood at just shy of a record high close and up for the day the s p was up as was the nasdaq traders said trumps conciliatory victory speech which eschewed the crude divisive and misogynist language used throughout the campaign gave investors hope that the president elect would not immediately embark on some of the most drastic policies he has pledged during the bitter election race david kelly chief global strategist at jpmorgan asset management said he expected trump to be less aggressive and more pragmatic than he had pledged during the campaign the hallmark of a donald trump presidency will be a certain amount of pragmatism he said during a conference call with

in the long run i have hopedavid colorado a lifelong republican who voted for hillary clintoni am very disappointed about the result but i cant be despondent i am by nature an optimistic person so as the evening wore on and it became clear that trump was going to win i started thinking about what is actually going to happen after this in the beginning there will be dark moments and things will happen that are not good for our country or for the world im sure that the affordable care act wont survive for example but then i believe that the republicans will start to realize that they didnt really get what they wanted trump after all isnt a republican he has made that clear he just agrees with them on some things or claims to i think the first half of trumps term will go very badly for the republicans voters will become disillusioned and the midterm elections in will be disastrous for them democrats will probably end up with control of both houses of congress well get a new supreme court justice but im not worried about whether theyll be too conservative i would be more worried that they wont be qualified in the long run though i have hope i believe in checks and balancesdan california voted for donald trumpits done voted shortly after polls open on tuesday and i voted for trump reluctantly no disrespect intended to the third party candidates but a vote for an alternate candidate is in reality a vote either trump or clinton so i was faced with a vote for an incompetent or a crook i chose to vote for the incompetent in the end it wasnt the emails that sealed the deal it was the remaining hope that checks and balances would modify the impending chaos the system of checks and balances appears to be in position to better counter trump than hillary trump has already lost substantial support among the gop so he cant count on either the existing supreme court or congress to ignore him then there is the press what we see is a press overwhelmingly anti trump a vote for hillary means we can not count on the press to honestly and diligently keep the public informed of hillarys potential malfeasance nor at this point can we count on the institutions of government to counter hillary in any meaningful way so i voted for the candidate likely to lead us into the weeds without opposition the establishment underestimated the publics ragegeno pennsylvania voted for jill steinwell i think were all astounded instead of bushs predictable fifth term were facing nobody quite knows what i never thought this was a serious possibility until today but the establishment apparently made a misjudgment in underestimating the publics rage after decades of being impoverished to benefit the since the primary was rigged against the only semi progressive major candidate this was the next prominent way to give the democrats a well deserved heave im not exactly shocked at that but dismayed that so many of my fellow citizens still refused to look outside the two party duopoly or help the greens reach federal funding levels the impetus is understandable this is a rejection of the two party status quo more than an actual endorsement of trumps racism or anti intellectualism but the forces hes unleashing are volatile and damn scary as always the bigger struggle starts after voting positive change only comes from public action so theres arguably a better chance for it now than under a democratic president if theres no actual policy coming from the oval office theres space for saner voices to shape it itll be tough but at least the citizenry seems ready to seriously push back the campaign got younger voters surprisingly engaged and proved that candidates dont have to be owned by corporate money if enough ers remember the power lies with us we may have a fighting chance after all i am ashamed of how this plays with the rest of the worldsarah florida voted for hillary clintonhillary clinton lost this election because sexism enabled voters to perceive the most qualified candidate in the world as someone more reprehensible than bar none the most despicable person who has ever sought the presidency because the contingent of mostly older white americans overlooked empathy for minority groups due to their own positions of privilege because of voter apathy because we watched brexit happen and refused to heed its warning i am ashamed of how this plays with the rest of the world ashamed of my state in particular and dread what consequences it will bring the fallout of supreme court turnover alone will last long after his term is done it should go without saying that a president should not threaten the wellbeing of certain citizens as a main selling point in his campaign and my heart goes out to any individual who feels unsafe i know the cold fear you are experiencing the only way we can think to proceed is to brace for a prolonged fight ahead of us the man slated to be president has built his platform on harming the vulnerable and shouting over the voices of the oppressed if you find this rhetoric deplorable if you are kind then seize any opportunity to defy it do not wait to speak out until they come for you to clinton your loss is the nations loss i am sorry they were too blind to see the america im waking up to today scares memonica vermont voted for hillary clintonin my wildest dreams i never would have thought the public would swing so wildly away from reason as to elect someone like trump i grew up in a working class latino family im a liberal but my father was conservative ive been a single mom working multiple jobs to keep a roof over my daughters head and struggled to make ends meet

sturgeon has urged donald trump to prove that he can act for all us citizens regardless of their heritage after his surprise victory in the us presidential elections david davis has pledged to share the westminster governments latest thinking on brexit with the leaderships of scotland northern ireland and wales before the first meeting of a forum intended to allow the devolved administrations to

migrant workers building venues for the event thats all from me for today thanks for the comments what will or should donald trumps presidency mean for the uk here are three good articles that address this jeremy cliffe at the economist says a trump presidency will make brexit harder a single theme unifies these risks brexit is a giant shock to britains place in the world it will sever old links and require new ones to be forged as some of its keenest proponents concede this transition will bring painful costs most of all it demands lots of good will and flexibility on all sides in so far as mr trumps win means a meaner more fractious more volatile global order it raises those costs and shrinks that space for compromise and consensus essential for a smooth brexit limiting the damage of a trump presidency on a brexiting britain demands ambition and perspective from mrs may her approach should be two sided first build a new closer alliance with angela merkel not just on brexit but on wider issues the world economy security russia and china in berlin and other european capitals officials complain that junes referendum result has taken britains mind off all other matters the prime minister must not allow that to happen and instead work with mrs merkel as a bloc capable of countering mr trumps worst traits second mrs may should use britains influence in america to attempt to moderate the new president staying his hand when he does wrong and indulging his vanity when he does right mrs may already had her hands full with brexit now for britains sake and that of the world she must also deal with mr brexit himself will straw executive director of britain stronger in europe at the new statesman looks at what the left can learn from the trump and brexit victories a new politics is necessary one with the seeds of dignity we must find our way to a prosperity which gives people a greater sense of belonging where communities have more autonomy to judge their own affairs and where international cooperation is used to tackle the worst excesses of globalisation including tax avoidance human trafficking and illegal immigration so too do we need a new language of politics one that refuses to pander to prejudice but recognises that what the social psychologist jonathan haidt calls the moral octaves which those on the left cannot hear for example imagine that there are concentric circles of loyalty family community country which are not just a comfort blanket in times of crises but are hardwired into us as human beings from this perspective overt displays of patriotism which may make liberals uncomfortable can in fact be harnessed and used to reinforce positive values larry summers an academic and former adviser to barack obama has called it responsible nationalism which starts from the idea that the basic responsibility of government is to maximise the welfare of citizens not to pursue some abstract concept of the global good bill emmott at capx asks if the special relationship can survive we cannot know in advance how protectionist the us is going to become but we can know that britain as a trading nation wanting to buy and sell freely with the whole world is likely to be a loser if protectionism really does become the flavour of the era at least the traditionally close relationship between our intelligence services and those of america can still be depended upon but it is not going to be a comfortable or predictable ride theresa may and boris johnson had better mean it when they say that post brexit britain will have a great new

whether the eu leaders will wake up to the roar of anger at globalisation machine politics and out of touch elites freeman who was a fierce critic of the tone of trumps campaign and at one point

future for liberal values need to fight for them to win the arguments to inspire new generations to the great and historic cause of liberalism farron said never in my lifetime have those liberal values been so under threat and never have they been more relevant and necessary there is nothing inevitable about the rise of nationalism protectionism and division the election of canadas prime

heres an overview of where we are this morning donald trump has won the presidency in a stunning upset that surprised pollsters and media alike hillary clinton called trump to concede the election shortly after wisconsin was called for the republican candidate sealing his victory the former secretary of state did not make a concession speech instead she allowed advisor john podesta to tell the crowd at her party in new yorks javits center to go home shes expected to make a concession speech this morning in his victory speech trump called for unity praising clinton for a hard fought campaign and saying now it is time for america to heal the wounds of division oakland new york los angeles and washington dc have seen anti trump protests overnight burning trump effigies and smashing a window at the oakland tribune the republicans won big all round maintaining and strengthening its control of the senate after wins in florida pennsylvania and indiana congress also remains republican

us over at our new campaign live blog where well be covering the fallout from the election all day donald trump wins us election the world reacts live read more irans president hassan rouhani reacted to trumps win by saying that it would not change the trajectory of his countrys foreign policy and that the uss credibility among the international community had already diminished reports saeed kamali dehghan the us election results will have no impact on the policies of the islamic republic the iranian cleric said during a wednesday meeting with his cabinet according to the semi official isna news agency because of wrong policies the position of america in the international community and worlds public opinion has diminished and the uss growing rift with europe and the world will exacerbate that position the countrys foreign minister mohammad javad zarif meanwhile said that the us had to continue respecting last years landmark nuclear agreement whose fate rests much in the hands of the new american president america has to implement the international obligation it accepted under the nuclear deal he was quoted as saying by the semi official tasnim news agency while on an official visit to romania earlier on wednesday a spokesman for irans atomic energy agency said that tehran would continue abiding by the nuclear accord despite trumps win tasnim cited behrouz kamalvandi as saying that iran is prepared for all kind of change and that the country would continue implementing the barjam iranian acronym of the joint comprehensive plan of action or the final nuclear accord tasnim which is affiliated to the elite iranian revolutionary guards saw donald trumps win as a vindication for the iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who said last week that the american businessman appeared to be the one saying the truth about the state of affairs in the us referring to trump khamenei said last week what is interesting is that the person who spoke more candidly attracted more attention from the people of america because that man spoke more candidly and more openly the people of america paid more attention to him the other party clintons camp said that he is adopting a populist method why populist it is because the people were watching him and they saw that what he was saying was correct they saw it in the realities of their life human values have been annihilated and trampled upon in that country there is racial discrimination in that country fouad izadi a political analyst sympathetic to the conservative camp in iran said trumps presidency would be better for iran than that of clintons the only advantage of having trump over clinton in regards to iran is that he would have much more difficulties in bringing together the international community in order to make obstacles for iran he told tasnim analysts such as izadi think that pressure on iran in the past was because obama had managed to persuade the uss european allies to rally behind washington in imposing sanctions on iran they think trump lacks the credibility to do so in case the nuclear deal falls apart donald trump has updated his twitter bio to reflect his new position trumps twitter bio photograph twitter jeremy corbyn mp leader of the labour party in the uk gave the following statement many in britain and elsewhere will be understandably shocked by donald trumps victory in the us presidential election the rhetoric around it and what the election result means for the rest of the world as well as america trumps election is an unmistakable

to accommodate those who were forced to wait in line for hours to cast early voting ballots according to cnn the trump campaigns legal team filed for relief in case the election of presidential electors from the state of nevada is contested this action is to preserve the status quo so that if the election of presidential electors from the state of nevada is contested the candidates and courts may redress egregious violations of nevada election law perpetrated by the registrar on november the lawsuit reads the registrars violations were not random and neutral in their effect but very much appear to have been intentionally coordinated with democratic activists in order to skew the vote unlawfully in favor of democratic candidates hillary clinton cast her historic vote for president

the dakota access pipeline operator chose the day of the us presidential election to announce that the final phase of its controversial construction project will begin in two weeks marking a bold escalation in its response to the native american protests dakota access pipeline the who what and why of the standing rock protests read moreenergy transfer partners the company overseeing the north dakota oil pipeline has already completed construction up to the river that provides water to the standing rock sioux tribe and announced on tuesday it would soon begin drilling at the site the company said it would not halt construction despite requests by federal agencies to delay the project as the us government reassesses permits and considers possible reroutes in a statement energy transfer partners said it was mobilizing horizontal drilling equipment in preparation for tunneling under lake oahe a reservoir on the missouri river by the protest camps and native american reservation the corporation said it would be ready to start crossing the water in two weeks the announcement came on a quiet election day at the encampments built by members of the standing rock sioux nation and other indigenous people in opposition to the pipeline after a string of clashes and mass arrests rumors spread among activists that the pipeline government and tribal leaders had negotiated a day moratorium on both construction and protest or religious ceremonies on the front lines of the conflict im in shock im speechless said cheryl angel a sicangu lakota tribe member who has been at the standing rock camps since the spring its unconscionable and devastating its almost as though they have no soul the announcement presents the final phase of construction as a done deal and will be seen as a clear illustration that the oil company is aggressively moving forward with the pipeline in defiance of barack obama and the thousands of demonstrators who are camped out at standing rock to fight the project last week obama made his first remarks on the huge demonstrations since police arrested hundreds of unarmed protesters who call themselves water protectors and say the pipeline is destroying sacred indigenous lands the president said the us army corps of engineers was exploring ways to reroute around native american lands and said the government was going to let it play out for several more weeks and determine whether or not this can be resolved in a way that i think is properly attentive to the traditions of the first americans in september the government said it would temporarily halt permits to dig on federal land near or under the missouri river and requested that the company voluntarily pause all construction activity within miles east or west of lake oahe energy transfer partners ignored that request and continued construction recently approaching within a few miles of the river causing widespread anger and sadness at the standing rock camps which have been opposing the pipeline since april tuesdays statement does not address the requests from the government for a delay on the contrary it suggests that the company is not giving consideration to alternative routes or obamas recent remarks dakota access previously received a permit from the army corps with respect the tunneling activities under lake oahe and dakota access has all other regulatory approvals and land rights to complete the crossing of the missouri river at lake oahe the statement said adding that the company expects to receive final permissions in a time frame that will not result in any significant delay the army corps did not respond to requests for comment asked about obamas comments pipeline spokeswoman vicki granado told the guardian we are not aware that any consideration is being given to a reroute and we remain confident we will receive our easement in a timely fashion the companys announcement comes as north dakota regulators are moving ahead with a formal complaint against the corporation for failing to properly disclose findings of native american artifacts along the construction route angel said the pipeline construction plan was environmentally irresponsible and illegal considering the army corps has yet to approve final permits noting that the missouri river provided drinking water to millions she added im in tears because i cant believe the company would do this to a whole group of people who dont have any say this past sunday more than a hundred water protectors used boats to ferry across the cannonball river and attempted to climb turtle island a portion of army corps land where tribal members say there are burial sites several tribal elders including darrel killsinsight implored everyone to return to the main camp referencing the alleged day agreement but representatives of the tribe never officially confirmed that any such agreement was in place and tuesdays statement flies in the face of any hope for a moratorium jan hasselman the attorney representing the standing rock sioux in its permit litigation said that the statement from dakota access was probably a response to an army corps spokesman telling bloomberg that the company had agreed to slow construction but she added dakota access does not have all the permits it needs to begin drilling including the easement starting construction without permits would be beyond the pale even for dakota access hasselman told the guardian it is deeply irresponsible to keep putting investors money into this route when both the president and senator tim kaine are openly discussing rerouting away from lake oahe the timing of the announcement on election day instantly raised suspicion and anger among the activists gathered at standing rock activists have expressed frustration with the us presidential race noting that democratic candidate hillary clinton has refused to take a position on the conflict and gop candidate donald trump has close financial ties to the pipeline with the election being so big and north dakota being so small they think they can just sweep this under the rug said danny grassrope a member of the lower brule sioux tribe im

thats it for this blog and the campaign our new york team is up early for a polling day blog us election voters head to polls as trump and clinton aim to make history live read more hillary clinton has a chance of winning the election according to a polling day email from the respected pollster nate silver thats up from a chance on sunday night so clinton has had a good run in the polls in the final days of the campaign clintons projected margin of victory in the popular vote has increased to from as a lot of you noticed nevada north carolina and florida flipped from red to blue over the course of monday we dont think thats a particularly meaningful metric because the forecasts are probabilistic clintons chances of winning florida increased to from for instance which is nontrivial but not an especially large change still we know its something a lot of readers follow its unlikely that any further states will flip to clinton in our final forecast as shes too far behind in ohio the next closest state its possible that florida and north carolina could flip to trump by tomorrow morning though probably not nevada where clintons lead is a bit larger who is to blame for not stopping trump sooner few suspects spared a mention in jonathan freedlands hall of shame they include the other republican presidential candidates such as jeb bush marco and ted cruz who allowed themselves to be streamrollered by a reality tv host and serially bankrupted businessman but also trumps trio of enablers rudy giuliani chris christie and newt gingrich those three horsemen of the republican apocalypse conspired in the lie that a snake oil salesman was fit to be president and destroyed what remained of their reputations in the process plus trumps running mate mike pence the defender of family values who has served as the running mate of a thrice married serially adulterous self confessed grabber of women freedland also rounds on the indulgence on a epic scale of the media and there are cameos for julian assange and vladimir putin and finally theres a dig at the us electorate some blame surely attaches to the americans who let trump keep up the bullying and the bigotry and voted for him anyway there is no escaping the fact that north of of the us electorate have been prepared to vote for trump despite everything that he has said and done one poll found of trumps own supporters believed he would start a nuclear war they thought that but were prepared to vote for him anyway none of them will be able to say we didnt know who is to blame for this awful us election

there has arguably not been a us presidential election with so much at stake for the rest of the world since the second world war one candidate stands largely for continuity signalling she would do slightly more than her predecessor to shore up the existing liberal world order her opponent is vowing to turn that order on its head jettisoning alliances and free trade agreements while seeking to cut deals with the worlds authoritarian powers if donald trump is elected on tuesday it is likely to trigger a foreign policy crisis inside washington as the diplomatic and security establishments scramble to discover whether he meant what he said on the campaign trail those who believe that the election talk was all bluster and that trump will tack back to a more traditional republican foreign policy once elected are likely to be disappointed according to thomas wright an analyst at the brookings institution in washington us election trump and clinton in tight race on campaign final day live read more my view is he is a more ideological candidate than we often appreciate and while there is a lot of bluster and a lot of ignorance on a wide number of issues there are certain things that he has been pretty consistent on wright said i think he is opposed to us alliances and i think he would try to withdraw the us from security commitments around the world he is anti trade and he would veer towards a more mercantilist system and he is pro russian he is pro authoritarian some believe that trump would be confronted with a series of resignations by diplomats and generals if he tried to turn these campaign platforms into administration policy if on the other hand hillary clinton wins the electoral college vote she will face the opposite dilemma how to distinguish her foreign policy from barack obamas she has expressed an inclination toward a tougher stance in syria and in europe for example but the wiggle room for a change of policy has shrunk with every passing week as vladimir putin has sought to create new facts on the ground in the last stages of the obama era more weeks would go by while a new clinton administration dives into an inevitable policy review however

much sooner than he or she would want us faces host of global threats during transition until next president read morenorth koreaus power and influence is being challenged around the world at an accelerating rate and nowhere more so than on the korean peninsula the north korean leader kim jong un has sped up tests of nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them expert opinion varies on whether his technicians have succeeded in making a nuclear warhead small enough to put atop a missile and there is a general consensus that if they have not done so yet they will soon it is also widely anticipated that in the next few years north korea will perfect an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the us west coast former and current us administrations have taken the strategic decision that pyongyang should be prevented from reaching that point by force if necessary but the ultimate decision will most likely be taken by the next president clintons foreign policy advisers have signalled that she would focus on the looming korean crisis early in her term in office reassuring japan and south korea that the us will not abandon them and seeking to put pressure on china to enforce un mandated trade sanctions more effectively that may well not succeed leaving a clinton administration with the choice of agreeing to a resumption of dialogue with pyongyang and accepting its nuclear weapons status as long as it restricts missile development if that were possible it would alarm us allies who are already within north korean missile range american allies are likely to reach that point of alarm far more quickly if trump reaches the oval office he has questioned the value of us alliances in the region and he has floated the possibility that countries like japan or south korea should develop their own nuclear weapons rather than rely on the us strategic umbrella if he sticks to that policy in office there could be a sudden nuclear arms race in north east asia and possibly beyond ultimately a trump administration would have to face the direct threat of a north korean long range missile he has said he would put more pressure on china to get tough with its neighbour and he has said he is willing to meet kim in the us on the grounds theres a or a chance that i can talk him out of those damn nukes failing that he has signalled he is quite willing to contemplate using the us nuclear arsenal if the weapons cannot be used he asked then why are we making them why do we make them china china tantalized by us election mayhem and prospect of trump as

president donald j trump imagine if you can beginning the trading day on wednesday with those words ringing in your ears its a scenario that has a lot of investors worried i think wed have to brace for tremendous volatility and an initial drop in the market says timothy fisher a new york based tax attorney and an investor with retirement savings invested in stocks and bonds and in whose eyes this election involves both high political principles and economic arguments like his peers fisher has been watching the last minute shifts in the polls anxiously trump he argues simply wouldnt be a good president for financial markets or for investors or for the economy as a whole given that his adversarial approach to dealing with trading partners could dampen export earnings for us businesses and hurt the countrys gdp asian shares slide again after market spikes for eighth day read morefisher and other investment strategists and economists have been burning the midnight oil of late analyzing what a trump victory would mean for the united states their response think brexit and multiply hundreds of us economists working in academic institutions have warned against electing trump precisely because of what they referred to in a public letter as his propensity to misinform the electorate and promote willful delusion over engagement with reality it would be the us version of brexit says mark zandi chief economist of moodys analytics the election of the republican candidate for president would be like the british vote to leave the european union an event that is not expected but that is very consequential while also being very uncertain in terms of precisely what it means for us all now and into the future given that stock markets loathe uncertainty above all else the initial reaction to a trump victory as with the brexit vote would be a stock market selloff this kind of wave of emotionally fuelled selling could lead to the market losing between to in a couple of weeks or a couple of months says jack ablin the chief investment officer at bmo private bank following that poll we saw a kind of brexit bounce when investors realized that britains departure from the united kingdom wouldnt happen overnight and that it would take years to negotiate a new relationship with its trading partners in europe but the united states is a different kind of animal its a much larger market for one thing about a quarter of global gdp and some half of the value of all the stocks traded in the world are us companies changing hands on us stock exchanges add to that the fact that a lot of investors have already placed big bets that trumps democratic rival hillary clinton will prevail in tuesdays presidential election and youve got all the makings of a nasty market shock the starting point for a selloff in the stock market could be and it could get worse from there some suggest and that shock would almost certainly be a global one rippling outward from the peso and the canadian dollar to the yen and european markets simon johnson an economist at the mit sloan school of management has argued that the kind of big adverse surprise that trumps election would pose to the system causing the stock market to crash could prove cataclysmic trump whose promises to boost economic growth immediately to between and are pure fantasy in johnsons opinion has advocated anti trade policies that would lead to anything but growth the economist argues and a trump victory well that might just be enough to cause a worldwide recession johnson says nonetheless some investors are preparing for the heightened risk of a trump presidency stocking up on cash gold and such hedges against the us market as german bonds in their portfolios they have done so as the political situation has become more fraught and trump has succeeded in narrowing the polling gap between clinton and himself and making a trump presidency more likely should trump actually triumph the immediate market shock isnt the only factor that these investors will have to consider however in the near term i think a trump administration would affect business investment and hiring decisions says zandi a former adviser to republican presidential candidate john mccain no one is sure what kind of specific policy decisions president trump would make and businesses would pause until they got more clarity that would slow economic growth longer term zandi adds the outlook depends on what choices a president trump would make what form would his anti immigration stance take if trump chooses to follow through on all his policies deporting undocumented immigrants building a wall along the mexican border it could shrink the size of the us economy or trigger a trade war this is what markets will worry about most says stuart hoffman chief economist of pnc financial services if we were to impose tariffs or quotas on imported goods our trading partners would likely retaliate and our exports to those countries like china and mexico would suffer there would be no winners global growth would slow trump has promised that he would cut taxes if elected which sounds appealing to voters that has the potential to give the consumer sector at least a brief jolt to the extent that those tax cuts are significant enough to register for individual taxpayers and if those people choose to spend their windfall but hoffman notes that trumps tax plan is set up to benefit wealthy americans most many economists believe that changes in tax policy have less effect on spending by affluent households theres also the pesky question of how trump would pay for those tax cuts he is not at all clear how he would do that says hoffman do you just run higher deficits that would be a longer term negative why a surging stock market is making ordinary investors happy read more still investors who confront a

immigrants accusing mexico of bringing their worst people to america including criminals and rapists the new york times reported on the launch as improbable quest for the republican via a series of

once upon a time a long long long time ago small children might get told off for being loud or unruly or as we called it then disruptive now not so much in its cool to be disruptive its what every startup in silicon valley is straining to do its what airbnb has done disrupting the hotel industry as uber has disrupted taxis and amazon has disrupted bookshops and almost everything else two years ago i went to a conference in san francisco techcrunch disrupt and met many people claiming to disrupt many things including in one case socks but what no one anticipated was that though it may be convenient to summon a motor vehicle to ones home with a tap of a button or to buy things online while wearing pyjamas and possibly drunk it might also lead to where we are now november two days potentially before the world changes forever because donald trump is not just an over tanned reality tv star gone rogue he is not a weaponised version of lord sugar he is what happens when technology changes everything disruption wrote clayton christensen the professor at harvard business school who coined the idea is the technology mudslide hypothesis its how some scrappy little upstart like microsoft overthrew the colossus that once was ibm its how some small new technological breakthrough can have huge unexpected world changing consequences its donald trump the living breathing version of the scrappy little upstart that overturns an entire industry only this time its not an industry its democracy we have fetishised disruption governments have stood by and watched it take down all industries in its path the market must do what the market must do only now the wave is breaking on its shore because what the last week of this presidential campaign has shown us is that technology has disrupted is disrupting is threatening to upturn the democratic process itself the best most stable most equitable form of governance the world has yet come up with in many crucial ways it doesnt even matter who wins on tuesday because perhaps the best thing you can say about trump is that if it hadnt been him it would have been someone else its the opposite of the great man theory of history a misogynistic ex reality tv star is not the game changer here its technology two days ago the same hackers who took down twitter and netflix and the and reddit and cnn last week in the biggest attack of its kind that the world has ever seen started practising on a country computer malware had been used to infect inanimate objects in our homes the connected devices that comprise the so called internet of things and that its been discovered a bit late are hopelessly insecure it has harnessed these to create a gigantic internet destroying machine the so called mirai botnet and its honing its power last week it took aim at an entire country liberia a huge attack was launched against the two companies that own the only fibre going into the west african country bringing its entire internet infrastructure to a halt the worst case scenario that the hackers behind it are practising for tuesday when theyll aim their massed computing power against america this is everyday objects in our own homes smart objects intenet enabled toasters and refrigerators because this is where we are our toasters and refrigerators may be about to be used to subvert the democratic process of the greatest democracy on earth and if that reads like the most lunatic sentence youve ever read you maybe havent been paying close enough attention to because this is possibly finally the year when it hits home that technology is not just some cool titanium coloured gadget in our pockets its the facilitator of the degraded news space that treats facts and lies the same that has enabled thousands of twitterbots algorithms to scrape the internet for stories about trump and then retweet them it was robot accounts that caused trumpwon to trend after each tv debate and allowed trump to claim victory its how a man who hasnt set foot on the street for four years can with just his laptop create havoc in the critical last week of the campaign by leaking emails that potentially implicate hillary clinton julian assange has inserted himself like computer malware into the heart of the american democratic process hes infected it he is like donald trump the law of unintended consequences writ large in human form in we didnt mind the fact that the data he leaked was stolen here in the liberal press we championed it because it was stolen data that served to underscore our liberal sensibilities or at least mine and now not so much but then technology is neutral there is no left or right there is only hackers and twitterbots and year olds in macedonia who buzzfeed reported last week earn money via google adsense for writing made up stories about trump and making them go viral on facebook in a single macedonian town veles there are at least websites about american politics run by macedonian kids who make money from fabricated stories teenagers can earn up to a month by making up things about trump they dont care about trump or clinton or anyone else theyve just worked out what the us public wants to read and have found a way of serving it up to them whether its true or not the best way of making money via google is to write clickbait and the best clickbait theyve discovered the stories that are spread widest and furthest in facebook and twitter are stories about trump more specifically false stories about trump because in we read the news we want to read the so called filter bubble the means by which google and facebook give us more of what we want or what we already know our searches and
latin americagovernments have often preferred republican presidential candidates because they historically put an emphasis on free trade but this time politicians and commentators are lining up to express doubts about donald trump who has alarmed many with his dismissive comments about latinos plans to build a wall on the mexican border and his unpredictable behaviour demtrio magnoli a sociologist and prominent voice of brazils new right said a trump victory would be a geopolitical earthquake trump is the closest the us has gotten to fascism you would have an american president that is nationalist and nativist and we would see mass deportations and a wall being built which is likely since he will most likely not deport million people he predicted this would force mexico to turn more towards latin america and could upset free trade agreements and hurt economic growth trump is so unpredictable and politically inexperienced we have no idea what he will do but he seems authoritarian sexist and contemptuous about latinos said violeta granera of the opposition alliance in nicaragua by comparison hillary clinton is seen as a safe pair of hands who is likely to continue the relatively benign policies of the obama administration carlos lins da silva a senior consultant for the so paulo research foundation said us regional policies were unlikely to see a major change but added the election of trump would at least in the short term cause dramatic impacts on the international system if he puts into practice some of the programmes he is advocating brazil wont come away unscathed for example if he makes the entrance of muslim people more difficult builds a wall between mexico and the us has nato members pay for us defence encourages japan to have a nuclear bomb gets tougher on nafta and other free trade deals all of these ideas would have negative consequences for many countries diplomats said they did not expect a major shift in washingtons latin american policy regardless of the outcome hillary clinton knows brazil better than trump as she has been here before and knows people here but there will not be any substantial change in relations either way because external relations with south america are a low priority for the us said rubens barbosa former brazilian ambassador to washington the country with most at stake may be cuba which has enjoyed a reconciliation with the us under barack obama former cuban president fidel castro weighed in with an article last month in the newspaper in which he awarded trump the medal of mud but the old revolutionary also had nothing good to say about the democrats middle easttrump outraged the arab world with his comments on muslim immigration and regional public opinion certainly reflects this a survey of people in the middle east and north africa found that if they had a vote half would snub both trump and clinton on the fight against islamic state clinton has pledged to never send troops back to iraq and ruled out boots on the ground in syria trump has been less specific about his plan to fight isis but said in march that the us has no choice but to send to combat troops to the region in the survey from the jeddah based daily and pollsters yougov said the us should send troops to fight isis and collaborate closely with russia on syria the rest did not want a us presence on the ground but did feel that washington should be more involved in the humanitarian efforts for syrian refugees arm moderate groups and increase air strikes on isis clinton was most popular with saying she would be the best for the arab world on the candidates policies arab opinion is much more balanced clintons stance on climate change and us israel policy found strong support in the poll but arabs overwhelmingly back trumps stance on abortion and ironically perhaps border controls russiavladimir putin was thrust into an unexpected starring role in this election and whatever the result it will please the kremlin that it has been able to cause so much mischief how much of this was down to direct kremlin meddling we will perhaps never know although the state medias bias towards trump has been fairly clear most russian analysts believe the us is systemically set up to oppose russia and while there is an understanding that trump is an unusual candidate many believe a trump presidency would not change things much other more sober heads are well aware that for all trumps friendly rhetoric as president he would be a much more unpredictable quantity than clinton the devil they know to go on the public rhetoric alone the casual observer would think the russian establishment is banking on trump russian television has been giving airtime to many of trumps claims that the election could be rigged but this is as much to help discredit the us system in the eyes of viewers as it is sincere backing for trump he has been backed not because of his politics but because he is the chaos candidate in the same way russia was also keen on brexit even if clinton wins russia knows that after this divisive campaign us democracy is in for a period of soul searching which will leave less energy and focus for meeting external threats africaif africa has barely featured in the campaign then the continent has in part returned the compliment but though many experts believe the result may not imply any drastic change in us policies in africa there is still widespread anxiety and trump has already alienated many particularly with his apparently racist rhetoric few africans are putting any store on trump if he wins the election that is if he remembers we exist once hes done with mexicans and illegal immigrants wrote gitau warigi in kenyas trumps call for a ban on muslims entering the us received widespread coverage and provoked outrage the somalia based islamic militant group al
after the incredulity the despair and then the cautious return to optimism the presidential campaign has entered a phase of almost intolerable anxiety national polls that dont signify much are instantly interpreted as omens of the apocalypse tiny anecdotes about early voting figures induce heart stopping panic or get clung to like life rafts depending on the direction in which they point until tuesday no new information is likely to bring any sense of closure only more stress but that doesnt stop us from seeking it compulsively forget fear and loathing the us election inspires projectile vomiting barbara ehrenreich read morenever mind that a victory for donald trump at this point would still require him to have executed a turnaround unknown in living memory or that the nervous comparisons with brexit have been so overblown in the closing days of an election that has kept americans and non americans alike in a state of clenched stomach tension for months allowing yourself any confidence in a victory for hillary clinton feels like mocking the gods even assuming trump loses the relief will be superficial trumpism will remain and the world will have to contend with the fact that about of the us electorate saw little wrong with his racism and misogyny alleged sexual assaults business scandals lies misrepresentations of his wealth and charitable giving probable failure to pay taxes lack of impulse control profound ignorance and tiny attention span but the relief will still be real in a way that feels unprecedented in modern politics trump has burrowed deep into our psyches stimulating anxiety that isnt confined to the borders of the us or to those who are the direct targets of his bigotry a survey for the american psychological association published in october found that the election was a source of stress for of american adults during the summer of registered voters that is including trump supporters said the prospect of a trump presidency made them anxious according to a washington post poll there have been multiple reports of election related fears arising on therapists couches as never before along with anecdotes of relationships damaged by political disagreement i think whats been so uniquely distressing isnt just that theres one person out there who thinks like that but that there are clearly so many people who agree says joan cook an associate professor of psychiatry at yale university and an expert in traumatic stress this is a kind of psychological entanglement with national and international news that most of us most of the time are spared but the trump candidacy has removed the possibility of such distance the rape abuse and incest national network reported a increase in calls to its support hotline during the weekend following the release of trumps notorious access hollywood tape armchair diagnosis dos and dontsalongside its psychological impact on the rest of us the campaign has also felt distinctive and distinctively disturbing in the ways that trumps own psychology has come to dominate it while hillary clintons inner life remains largely mysterious information about trumps insecurities leaks from his every public statement even before the new york times obtained tapes of interviews with a biographer in which trumps morbid fear of public humiliation was made plain his former ghostwriter tony schwartz has pointed out how trumps attacks on others arent random but constitute a precise inventory of his own faults unstable reckless bigoted trigger happy exhausted and prone to lying as sheena monnin the former miss pennsylvania sued by trump after she criticized his miss usa pageant put it in an interview with cnn i have a degree in psychology and i understand that underneath the bullying tactics theres usually a lot of emptiness and a strong need to feed the ego trump told his biographer michael dantonio i dont like to analyse myself because i might not like what i see but the rest of us havent had much choice like a traffic pile up the candidates involuntary self exposure has been impossible not to gawp at yet throughout this intensely psychological election psychology professionals have been restrained by a widespread though fragmenting consensus that trumps mental health ought not to be discussed at all this stance is most clearly expressed in the american psychiatric associations so called goldwater rule the prohibition on diagnosis at a distance introduced following the incident in when psychiatrists told a news magazine they believed that barry goldwater the republican candidate for president was unfit for office in a finger wagging statement released in august the apas president maria oquendo reaffirmed the ban but while there are certainly strong arguments in favour of it it risks undermining public confidence in psychiatrists and stigmatising people with mental illness its been far from obvious in that these outweigh the ethical arguments for flouting it writing in vox the psychologist cedar riener compared psychiatrists disregarding the rule to a doctor diagnosing cancer just by looking at my behaviour or public statements but in the case of psychological disorders unlike physical illnesses behaviour and speech are always the primary sources of diagnostic data and it has often seemed as if we might have more direct access to the darkest recesses of trumps mind than to some of our closest friends like many americans i was more amused than alarmed by trump at the beginning says bill doherty a marriage and family therapist from minnesota but as the trump movement picked up steam doherty happened to be travelling in austria where he encountered a neo fascist political demonstration and visited a concentration camp so i did some reading about the responses of mental health professionals in germany and austria in the and they were largely silent and some were complicit upon his return he wrote a manifesto citizen therapists against trumpism which more than of his colleagues have now signed doherty insists this doesnt violate the goldwater rule hes condemning trumpism as a threat to public health not diagnosing trump as say a narcissist
david bowie young americansthe collective memory of america is short during the midterm elections it seemed like every other house in my north dallas neighborhood sported a had enough vote republican yard sign as if it had been two hundred years instead of two since the us economy was on the brink of collapse with panicked credit markets huge banks and insurance companies about to topple into the void a flatlining auto industry the dow jones plunging toward and job losses topping a month not to mention the wars that had turned the budget surpluses of the late bill clinton years into massive deficits all courtesy of a two term republican president whose party controlled congress for six of the last eight years yes please take us back to the good old days of american crossroads reagan trump and the devil down south read more two years the perpetual fog of american forgetting gas had done its work if two years are all it took to erase the memory of the worst economic meltdown since the great depression then we shouldnt hope for much awareness of that earlier crisis some years ago though there are a few old heads still around who lived it and the experience of those times can be found readily enough in the archives and histories of the era the country to put it mildly was different back then life was harder and in places like the texas hinterland which today forms the big beating heart of the states republican base it was a close approximation of century european peasant hell the vast majority of rural texans lived without electric power which meant no refrigeration no water pumps no indoor plumbing no furnaces no electric stoves no incandescent lights no motors to power machines for milking or shearing even for those of us only one or two generations removed from the farm its almost impossible to conceive just how different life was although the phrase nasty brutish and short comes to mind among the best guides to that time is the sad irons chapter of the path to power the first volume of robert caros biography of lyndon johnson which delivers a harrowing portrait of life as a medieval slog plunked down in the middle of century america to take just one aspect of the slog water packing water from the source a stream or a well to the house was a daily beatdown that often fell to the farm wife as caro writes a federal study of nearly half a million farm families would show that on the average a person living on a farm used gallons of water every day since the average farm family was five persons the family used gallons or four fifths of a ton of water each day gallons or almost tons in a year the study showed that on the average the well was located feet from the house and that to pump by hand and carry to the house gallons of water a year would require someone to put in during that year eight hour days and walk miles endless war trump and the fantasy of cost free conflict read morelaundry was done outside an all day muscle intensive process that began with a huge vat of boiling water suspended over a roaring fire imagine that on a july day in texas next to which someone almost always the farm wife would stand punching clothes with a paddle or broomstick the human equivalent of an automatic washing machine cooking was done with wood stoves which were kept burning most of the day summer and winter for meals and baking which in turn required constant tending firewood in ashes out because of the lack of refrigeration most meals had to be prepared from scratch in order not to starve in winter a family had to can fruit and vegetables in summer a hellishly hot process that went on for days and required the utmost precision the wood stoves were also used to heat irons for pressing clothes actual six or seven pound slabs of iron that had to be scrubbed sanded and scraped every few minutes to remove the soot farm wives dreaded the tedium of ironing day hence the sad irons caro goes on a hill country farm wife had to do her chores even if she was ill no matter how ill because hill country women were too poor to afford proper medical care they often suffered perineal tears in childbirth during the the federal government sent physicians to examine a sampling of hill country women the doctors found that out of women had perineal tears many of them the team of gynecologists reported were third degree tears tears so bad that it is difficult to see how they stand on their feet but they were standing on their feet and doing all the chores that hill country wives had always done hauling the water hauling the wood canning washing ironing helping with the shearing the plowing and the picking because there was no electricity this state of affairs wasnt limited to texas in the early more than six million of americas farms were without electricity from sundown to sunup these farmers and their families practically lived in the dark most kerosene lamps provided watts of light at best barely sufficient for reading and they were dirty difficult to use and dangerous many farmers preferred to do their pre dawn chores in the dark rather than risk having a kerosene lamp in the barn radio of course was out of the question the news and entertainment available to urban america were effectively blacked out in rural areas fear loathing and firearms sensory overload inside the nra mall of death read morethen the great depression transformed what was an extremely hard life into an impossible one with prices for crops in real terms falling below what theyd been in colonial times financial disaster

there were questions about whether then gov bill clinton had funneled state business into her law firm when asked about her career in a press gaggle clinton responded you know i suppose i could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas but what i decided to do was to fulfill my profession which i entered before my husband was in public life and i tried very very hard to be as careful as

european bureaucrats over riding the democratic wishes of the local power sharing executive and endangering jobs james knightley a senior economist at ing says a december rate hike is now more likely but it isnt a done deal it seems as though the tightness in the labour market is starting to generate higher pay the wage story is also good news for consumer spending with average hourly earnings not having risen this fast since mid so with the economy creating jobs and workers being paid more it backs the case for a rate hike from the federal reserve in december however it isnt a done deal any market turmoil relating to next weeks presidential election would quickly scupper thoughts of a policy change capital economics says the surge in us wages signals the fed will raise rates in december paul ashworth chief us economist writes the solid gain in employment and the acceleration in average hourly earnings growth in october will increase expectations that the fed will hike interest rates in december what will really catch the eye of fed officials is the m m increase in average hourly earnings last month which followed an upwardly revised m m gain in september as a result the annual growth rate climbed to a seven year high of from the us unemployment rate fell to in october from in september as expected the us labor department said average hourly earnings grew at an annual rate of the highest in seven years and better than the expected at employment growth in october was weaker than the monthly average of for the average monthly increase was in while the october payrolls figure slightly missed expectations there were no nasty surprises in the report us futures narrowed losses after the report justin wolfers it obviously the case that one month non farm payrolls will either prove or disprove an entire economic ideology november us non farm payrolls increased by in october disappointing expectations of a rise the number for september was revised up sharply to from

answer has never changed hes the best person i have ever met closing out her address in raleigh north carolina democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton said that the best way to repudiate the

middletown timelineweve been asking readers to help guide and shape gary younges reporting from muncie indiana where for the past month hes been taking the political pulse of middle america during this volatile election here residents tell us about the issues that matter most to them when it comes to voting and their experience of living in muncie as with middletowns everywhere the city faces difficulties but it seems these are matched by a strong and active community willing to take them on lauren bishop weidner who taught english at ball state university for years told us your first impression of muncie is probably going to be inaccurate most people come in on the east or west side on mcgalliard avenue and you just see box store after box store but if you go through the neighbourhoods you see diversity and spirit especially downtown you need to go all the way through muncie before you decide what you think jason donati family photo donati family photo donati has four children grew up in muncie and returned eight years ago he lives in downtown muncie and is an environmental educator for the muncie sanitary district he is also the co founder of race muncie which stands for reconciliation achieved through community engagement there are jobs in muncie i know people in economic development and there are a lot of jobs which dont have enough qualified people its easy to say we havent got jobs that weve been screwed over by nafta the north american free trade agreement we have all felt the effects of losing the automotive industry thats true but what working class white people have to deal with here is the issue of addiction ive been to a lot of funerals of my friends the drugs are so much stronger people in their mid with small children are now dying through recreational use its doubling and tripling and heroin is catching up with meth theres a lack of resources in the community for mental health counselling and healing the only thing im seeing elected officials do is bust the cases it needs to be addressed as a disease i lost my middle brother to drugs in its something you deal with your entire life thats my motivation i think about my brother and the impact its had on my life and its a rare privilege to live another day i learned through my two years with americorps that you have to get out and serve im running for the muncie community school board and if i get elected i can help address some of these issues pheobechris allen is the community development block grant coordinator for hamilton county indiana helping communities fund activities such as affordable housing public service programmes and infrastructure projects he was born and raised in anderson about minutes south west of muncie went to ball state university and has mostly lived in muncie ever since in muncie anderson and the surrounding communities up until the you could go to high school and graduating was optional you could drop out get a job at gm or borgwarner or delco remy working on the line my dad worked there three quarters of my elementary class parents worked there you got married had the family and the income health benefits retirement benefits you could achieve the american dream you had the ranch house ran two cars and more importantly could afford to take your family on vacation going to the lakes or down to florida now thats a luxury these kinds of dreams have been lost and i think thats a major driving force of this election fifty years ago muncie was a boom town what are we going to do to get that back if thats not realistic then how are we going to replace it how do we get economic gains theres no doubt in my mind that there are towns like this across the world but for a lot of people muncie is the place you cant give up on it theres so much work and effort thats striving to make this place better danielledanielle grew up in the south east of muncie she graduated from muncie central high in and went to university but returned to the town after two years because of family illness she supports herself with two jobs the future of muncie is very bleak a lot of older people have seen a city just out of its prime now they see their city is dead regeneration is happening downtown not everyone involved is from the north side but a lot of them are typically thats where the doctors lawyers and educators live on the south side where those who did the factory work live they dont see revitalisation happening for the kind of skills they have i do believe healthcare has got worse i see people all the time who cant afford treatment if they choose treatment they cant eat or fall into debt and lose their homes i think education in muncie is slipping too they have consolidated two high schools and it has become a mess its hard to talk about everyone here is very closeted about their opinions particularly about anything political but muncie does have a lot of good people band together over the slightest thing theres strong community when it matters i do feel proud weve lightened up a lot kids going to different states and coming back are influencing us were changing ourselves i feel part of the regeneration everyone is helping just a little bit jeannine lee lakejeannine lee lake with her husband aaron celebrating their wedding anniversary in lee lake is a stay at home mother

but it is not a given that the fed will hike in december says economist james knightley at ing bank there is little in the statement to suggest that a december hike is definitely going to happen the statement comments that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen while adding the word some to the line that it wants to wait for some further evidence of continued progress towards its objectives this all suggests that things are moving in the right direction but the presidential election is an obvious reason for waiting assuming clinton wins markets are likely to react with relief given expectations of policy continuity this coupled with the reasonably firm growth rising employment and a gradual pick up in inflation should reinforce market expectations for a december rate hike should trump win then this is likely to hurt market sentiment given uncertainty as to what he will actually do when in power it is hard to imagine the fed hiking in this environment we also have plenty more data to come ahead of the december fomc meeting including two more job reports so there are other reasons for caution the fed statement has failed to give much support to the dollar and us markets have struggled for direction after the news the dow jones industrial average is now down points compared to around ahead of the statement the us dollar index has lost to gregory daco fed fomc statement us economy chugging along inflation expectations rising only need a little more progress december ratehikenovember paul r la monica no alarms and no surprises fed leaves rates unchanged but hihts st hike in december uber hawks george and mester dissent wanted hike now november a lavorgna fomc judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen fed remains on track for dec rate hikenovember although there was no rate change today it looks increasingly likely there will be one in december paul sirani chief market analyst at xtrade said with just days to go before election fever sweeps america janet yellens federal interest rate statement held no shocks with rates remaining the same however its becoming ever more likely that yellen will implement a raise early next month following signs that the american economy is gradually picking up steam she made clear in september that a rise before the end of was more than likely and with employment and inflation continuing to strengthen the central bank may get its wish the fed has dropped a reference to inflation remaining low in the near term in september it said inflation is expected to remain low in the near term in part because of earlier declines in energy prices but to rise to percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further this now reads inflation is expected to rise to percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further the fed said in its statement the committee expects that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further inflation is expected to rise to percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further near term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced the committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments against this backdrop the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent the committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided for the time being to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to percent inflation this time there were only two fed dissenters who wanted to raise rates not three esther george and loretta mester eric rosengren who voted for a rise last time has now sided with the majority breaking newsto no ones great surprise the federal reserve has opted to leave us interest rates unchanged just days ahead of the presidential election it said it was waiting for further evidence of progress towards its objectives before hiking anthony cheung awaiting any subtle change in fomc language to hint towards dec hike look out for next meeting or further strengthened november the us federal reserves interest rate decision will be released in less than an hour while most commentators expect there to be no change not this close to the presidential election the prospect of a rate rise in december is thought to be reasonably likely given the recent reassuring us economic data there is likely to be a focus as usual on the exact wording of the fed statement and whether it shows any changes from the september comments at that meeting seven of the fed members voted for no change with three esther george loretta mester and eric rosengren backing an increase any variance here could also give a clue to the likely outcome in december investors have been unnerved by suggestions that donald trump is gaining ground in the us presidential race with one poll this week even showing him in the lead over hillary clinton combined with a slump in oil prices following a record weekly rise in us crude stocks this has pushed markets in europe sharply lower but on wall street the dow jones industrial average which lost points or so on tuesday has not been hit as badly and is currently down just points ahead of the latest us federal reserve interest rate decision meanwhile the vix index
walter hain stumbled into the anti apartheid struggle according to his son the politician peter hain who in wrote a memoir of his father and mother ad wal values duty sacrifice in apartheid south africa peter wrote of his parents at the time in it just seemed the right thing to do in keeping with their values of caring decency fairness and perhaps equally important their sense of duty that was when walter who has died aged and his wife adelaine joined the newly formed liberal party the only non race based political grouping in south africa then living in ladysmith the couple helped to organise the inaugural meeting of the partys local branch and ended up holding it at their home the author alan paton the partys national president attended that first meeting the following year the family moved to pretoria walter worked as an architect while adelaine became an unpaid political organiser she made illegal trips into black townships to visit party members and supported activists who had been arrested helping them to find legal representation and sending food to their families when they were imprisoned when i met the couple in to write an article marking adelaines birthday they gave me a nightmare description of the south africa of the prisoners taken to the jail in pretoria could be sold to farmers as cheap labour and a black servant not carrying his pass papers could be arrested merely for stepping outside his employers front garden as the repression worsened in the early the hains became even more active politically adelaine attended the trial of nelson mandela and his co defendants in pretoria and was at times their sole supporter in the whites only gallery that in turn made the hains the target of a paranoid regime in adelaine was banned a draconian measure forbidding all political activity and making her in effect a non person walter faced the same treatment a year later they were the first couple to be banned and an unprecedented codicil had to be added to their banning order allowing them to communicate with each other walters banning order followed the support he had given to the couples close friend john harris who in had planted a bomb at the railway station in johannesburg killing an elderly woman in his book peter hain alleges the authorities deliberately ignored harriss phoned warning in order to use the resulting carnage for political ends the hains were opposed to violent action because they believed it was counter productive but they remained supportive of harris a fellow liberal party member who had joined the african resistance movement and had come to believe that only violence could shake the apartheid system although he always denied he had intended to kill harris was hanged for murder in april the only white person to be executed in apartheid south africa for political activities the hains helped his wife ann and their baby son during the months of his imprisonment and took them into their home after his death harris had wanted walter to give the oration at his funeral but because walter was banned he was unable to do so peter who was at the time read it instead walters banning order meant he could no longer work as an architect in south africa so in he and his family left for the uk they settled in london where they became prominent opponents of the south african government they supported the anti apartheid movement helping peter with his stop the tour campaign which succeeded in blocking the all white south african cricket team from coming to britain in they also backed their son when he faced a trial for conspiracy in and trumped up bank robbery charges in the south african secret police continued to target activists in exile the hains phone was tapped and in they received a letter bomb addressed to peter but sent to their home it was opened by their daughter sally but did not explode walter was born in durban his father also called walter and his mother mary hailed from glasgow and in had emigrated to south africa where walter sr worked as an engineer in they moved to pretoria and walter attended pretoria boys high school where he developed a lifelong love of sport he also learned to sketch at school a skill he put to good use in the second world war when he joined the signal corps at the age of and took part in the allied assault on italy he kept a diary during the campaign illustrated with pencil sketches in he published them in a book called apennine war diary walter was wounded in the advance but recovered and was assigned to the natal mounted rifles he was still in italy when germany surrendered on may in his book about his parents peter says the war was a profoundly formative experience for his father both changing him and enlarging his perspective on life to one so much broader than that of a home grown young white south african after the war walter took up the place to study architecture at witwatersrand university that he had gained before joining up in though studying in johannesburg he still liked to pay regular visits to his parents in pretoria and on one of those visits while out riding with a group of friends he met adelaine stocks the couple married in initially living in nairobi kenay where walter had found a job in an architectural practice peter their eldest son was born there in it was in nairobi that the hains exhibited the first flickerings of their political rebelliousness india had just got independence walter recalled and a whole lot of british ex indian army people had come to kenya where black people were still kept in their place one of the partners in the firm that i was working for said to me oh we must learn from you south africans

the pound may indeed fall to as bank of america merrill lynch has suggested but at the moment it is holding fairly steady against the us currency sterling is currently down just at but this is mainly thanks to dollar weakness due to renewed uncertainty surrounding the us election not to mention wednesdays interest rate decision from the federal reserve neil wilson market analyst at etx capital said a poll from abc that gave trump a slender lead over clinton has been the catalyst for some fairly significant risk off moves given how far ahead in the polls clinton was very recently the fact that were talking about a close race again is clearly rattling investors suffice to say we can expect more volatility in the coming week against the euro the pound is not faring so well down at heres some gloom from pro brexit fund manager crispin odey who has told investors the uk could face recession and the stock market could slump by bloomberg reported crispin odey whose main hedge fund has lost about percent this year says u k stocks could slump percent as the economy is roiled by a recession and higher inflation following the vote to leave the european union shares will come under

of outperformance compared to london with us markets taking a hit this afternoon as well it doesnt take sherlock holmes to work out that the new polls giving donald trump an edge in the election are spooking investors the parallels with brexit are there for everyone to see but the key battleground states are still leaning towards the democrats in all probability the election will still turn out

us election bloomberg reports although they deem a donald trump victory more supportive for the price of the metal than a win by hillary clinton the banks chief precious metals analyst james steel says itll enjoy at least a percent jump whoever wins the race both candidates have espoused trade policies that could stimulate demand with gold offering a potential protection against protectionism he says even the relatively more internationalist democratic candidate has argued for the renegotiation of longstanding free trade agreements thats positive for gold even if not on the scale of mr trumps agenda if the real estate magnate triumphs gold could rise to an ounce according to hsbc up from around at a m in new york if clinton wins the price of the metal could improve to an ounce by

the news is hard to escape these days with many people hearing about world events not just from news websites but also on social media platforms but what impact is this having on children it could be making them more anxious according to the nspccs childline service it reported an increase in the number of children seeking help for anxiety with concern around world affairs such as the eu referendum and syria conflict its thought that the rise is down to a combination of personal and political issues while the charity said others felt it was also partly due to disturbing events seen in the media and on social media we asked parents and grandparents about their experience of this and how they try to calm children down about world affairs young and anxious do your children express fears over global events read moresalley vickers from london my granddaughter loses sleep over terrorist attacksi am a former psychoanalyst working with people who suffered serious trauma and am now a full time novelist my eldest grandchild aged is extremely anxious about political events particularly potential terrorist attacks she has become worried about travelling on the tube in london when she visits me she is also worried about going into big shopping centres because of the threat of bombs and was deeply concerned after the paris attacks she is not at all frightened by any supposed muslim threat indeed she is rather promuslim having many muslim peers which is a good and reassuring aspect of modern childrens education but she is insecure about being suddenly attacked in a place that she previously experienced as familiar and fun she loves coming to london but feels being there is nowadays more dangerous these concerns affect her sleep she has confided she has periods of lying awake worrying about terrorism and reassurances that it will not happen to her do not and in my view cannot dispel her concerns my experience of working with trauma convinces me that anxiety needs to be addressed and not given a superficial bandage of comfort my granddaughter doesnt have a computer or ipod or direct access to the web on her phone but inevitably she sees the news with her parents and hears about whats happening in school from other children who tend to big up scary events inevitably she absorbs often false or exaggerated information from her peers who have access to social media while she cannot check out the truth what they say in my view the current state of the world needs to be discussed in schools as well as at home and the spreading of rumour and gossip about scary events needs to be addressed more fully as a serious element in the school curriculum teachers need to rethink how children are introduced to political world events now there is so much greater access to them more consideration needs to be given to the way social media which can now feed into a bullying process affects children bullying is hardly a novel phenomenon in schools but i dont think we are really up to speed with the way political events can be deployed to terrify the less well informed or the more sensitive there needs to be greater education on civic responsibility for everyone and i believe for the sake of a responsible future society it should start at a younger age children need to be taught to look at the news and public reactions critically and not take them at face value in the way they were once taught to be critical of texts amet akolawin from london my daughter gets more anxious about issues such as global warmingmy daughter who turns eight next week watches the news when i do so in the morning and evening she also watches cbbcs newsround most days we do talk about the headlines a lot she takes an interest in what is going on around the world she does worry about some of the stuff she sees just yesterday at bedtime we spoke about the us election and the wall donald trump wishes to build between mexico and america it lead on to us chatting about the berlin wall and the great wall of china my daughter is very inquisitive so talking about news is an simple way to give her some insight and pass on some of my knowledge she doesnt like watching clips of war torn countries but she will still listen to what the report is saying she is quite sensitive so if there is a piece on syria for example and i think the images are disturbing her i will ask her if she would like to watch something else to be honest she gets more anxiety from topics touched on in school such as global warming and natural disasters we go to visit her gran in sardinia twice a year and much of the news recently has been about the earthquake there she has become very fixated about this and i havent been able to reassure her about her uncle lives in rome so its understandable that she would worry but its definitely made her afraid of something similar happening to her when shes there jessica eaton from staffordshire my sons worry they will end up as refugees and no one will take care of themmy sons who are five and eight had a shocking realisation about three months ago that the war in syria was real they had been in the room with me and my husband when we were discussing the decision to launch airstrikes in syria we were watching footage about the civilian casualties and condemning the decision they have lots and lots of questions about war politics and weapons the boys went away to play for a while and must have got talking because they came back into the living room shortly afterwards very upset saying real people are dying in syria with real guns and bombs they
whats the problem with hillary clintons emails clinton used a private email server situated in her new york home while she was secretary of state from to she has admitted that this was a mistake in july the fbi concluded that clinton and her aides had been extremely careless in their handling of classified information but should not face criminal charges the issue has dogged the democrats campaign for the presidency with supporters of republican rival donald trump regularly chanting lock her up clinton emails fbi gets warrant as comey told he may have broken law read morewhat just happened on friday fbi director james comey alerted members of congress to the existence of a new batch of emails he said could be pertinent to the investigation as many as messages were reportedly found on a laptop seized during an unrelated investigation of anthony weiner a former new york congressman who is the estranged husband of longtime clinton aide huma abedin abedin and weiner separated after weiner was caught in and again in sending women sexually explicit text messages and pictures of himself undressed federal authorities in new york and north carolina are investigating online communications between weiner and a year old girl senior officials at the department of justice expressed concern that comeys decision to inform congress would be inconsistent with protocols designed to avoid the appearance of interference in an election but the fbi director went ahead what is in the emails we dont know comey himself admitted the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant those mails with a connection to clintons server could merely be duplicates of emails already analysed or they could contain a smoking gun that compromises clinton even after the election on sunday the fbi obtained a warrant to begin reviewing the newly discovered emails the process will not be finished before election day what was the reaction to comeys announcement the timing less than two weeks before a presidential election drew harsh criticism from democrats and even some republicans at an organising event in daytona beach clinton called comeys actions unprecedented and deeply troubling her campaign launched an all out war on comey chairman john podesta said by providing selective information hes allowed partisans to distort and exaggerate in order to inflict maximum political damage and no one can separate what is true from what is not because comey has not been forthcoming with the facts the wider democratic establishment also weighed in four senators demanded a briefing from comey and nearly former department of justice officials and prosecutors both republican and democratic and led by the former obama attorney general eric holder signed a letter criticising comeys decision the trump campaign meanwhile was elated we never thought we were going to say thank you to anthony weiner the republican presidential nominee told a rally in nevada did comey abuse his power the nearly former officials criticised his actions in their open letter which was released by the clinton campaign director comeys letter is inconsistent with prevailing department policy and it breaks with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections they said in another scathing letter to comey the democratic senate minority leader harry reid of nevada accused him of clear intent to aid one party over another i am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the hatch act which bars fbi officials from using their official authority to influence an election reid wrote through your partisan actions you may have broken the law richard painter chief white house ethics lawyer from to said he had filed a complaint against the fbi for a possible violation of the hatch act what is the hatch act passed in it forbids anyone in the executive branch from using his or her official position to engage in political activity carolyn lerner head of the us office of special counsel wrote in the new york times five years ago at its best the act prevents people in political power from abusing their positions it prohibits coercion by a government supervisor such as pressuring employees to volunteer for or contribute to a campaign and shields the civil service and the federal workplace from politicking in july the housing secretary julian castro was found to have violated the hatch act when he expressed support for clinton comeys action however is less blatantly partisan and a case against him would be tough to prove in court the republican congressman trey gowdy told fox news on monday it is laughable that jim comey committed a violation of the hatch act i actually know what the hatch act is demonstrating a selective reading of the act he continued if the president of the united states actively campaigning on company time for another candidate to be president of the united states is not a violation of the hatch act then how is jim comey supplementing the record and telling the truth to congress a violation of the hatch act harry reid knows that this is not a violation so why did comey do it will hillary clinton lose the us election because of the fbi email investigation read morehe told fbi colleagues in a memo on friday he was aware his letter was at risk of being misunderstood but felt obliged to notify congress about the new emails after having told lawmakers that the matter was closed there have been reports that some members of the fbi were in revolt over comeys earlier decision not to recommend charges against clinton and that he feared word of the new email investigation would leak to the media leading to accusations of a cover up especially if it happened after november he therefore regarded going public now as the least worst option will these events affect the election result possible but not probable more than million people have already voted and there is little evidence of movement so
the clinton campaign has accused fbi director james comey of jaw dropping double standards for releasing news of a fresh investigation into hillary clintons private email server while apparently withholding evidence of russian support for donald trump in case it were to influence next weeks election clintons spokespeople pointed to reports by cnbc and the huffington post claiming that comey privately urged against naming russia for apparently interfering in the election and hacking democratic email accounts with campaign manager robby mook saying the decision to hold back defied all logic the white house also aired more tentatively worded concerns about comeys actions and motivations while the guardian reported that the fbi director could himself face investigation for violating the hatch act a law designed to prevent federal officeholders from abusing their power to influence an election hillary clinton there is no case in fbi email investigation videomeanwhile a slew of allegations about donald trump particularly concerning his alleged ties to russia have peppered the closing hours of october slate reported that analysis of communications between a trump organization server and a russian bank alfa bank could suggest a secretive relationship although the new york times said the messages could be marketing email s or spam the trump campaign has denied any relationship with alfa bank mother jones cited unnamed sources not verified by the guardian to claim that trump has been cultivated by russia as its preferred candidate the new york times had a look at what can be seen of trumps tax records hes chosen not to release them of course and concluded that measures he took in the early were so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the internal revenue service would likely declare it improper if he were audited and nbc reported that the fbi has opened an inquiry into paul manafort trumps former campaign manager in relation to his

welcome to this weeks blog and our roundup of your comments and photos from last week an intriguing and unexpected thread was started by frustratedartist we often read about lost books from the ancient world lost in the sense that every copy of them was destroyed and the text no longer exists or the sole manuscript was destroyed by its author for example has this ever happened to a printed book that is are there any books published after say every single copy including the manuscript of which has been lost here im thinking of printed and bound books as opposed to ephemeral publications like leaflets pamphlets magazines etc yosserian supplied an answer whose opening could almost have been the premise of a borges short story perhaps there are lost books but they are unknown because they lost i know when im rummaging in dusty corners of second hand bookshops i occasionally unearth books which are so idiosyncratic or personal i wonder if anyone at all knows of their existence they are often by elderly gentlemen reminiscing about their time at eton or in the army or something and must have had small print runs ive often had this notion of creating a museum of forgotten people and lives from stuff i find must be a sentimental resistance denial in my being to our essential ephemerality on this earth one book i did buy was a strange stream of consciousness novel by erica cotterill called it just seemed so wacky and odd that i wondered if it was a one off despite having a quote from gb shaw on the cover and while there are maybe a dozen for sale online ranging from quid to there is almost nothing in the way of discussion or reviews so it might as well be lost i suspect in this sense there are bound to be decent books that if not lost in the sense that they no longer physically exist are nevertheless thoroughly forgotten which perhaps amounts to the same thing we also got something close to a definitive answer from interwar when i was working in an antiquarian bookshop in cecil court years ago a man brought in a box of books hed been lugging up and down charing cross road i said id need time to look at them but he was so fed up he said hed take right there and then i gave it to him mostly because i felt sorry for him anyway when i finally did get round to inspecting what was in the box most of it was worthless but there was one eighteenth century novel by a woman writer unknown to me in original boards virtually in mint condition i looked it up but found nothing the british library did not have a copy so i sold it to them strangely i remember what they paid but not the name of the work or its author the price has stuck in my mind because i felt guilty about only giving the seller elsewhere daveportivo has been appreciating grayson perrys the descent of man i have to say i think its fabulous look hes not a cutting edge expert on gender studies or much of scientist but i found this book very profound in addressing the pressures and psychological stresses of the male gender role now that sounds very theoretical but what i loved about the book is how personable and how human it is it really struck me when he described behaviours that have either blighted my life in the past or that i continue to struggle with fannery oconnors wise blood also got the thumbs up from sydneyh ive finished by flannery oconnor which was just adorable the prose is perfect and the action is consistently amusing i wasnt as sure about the introduction by v s pritchett which claimed that there is not a trace of satire in her instead reading oconnor as a realist a fabulist and moralist i felt that she was definitely satirising a number of start up religions of which there are many im now interested in finding out if her short stories are similar to me she didnt seem stylistically so much like faulkner and mccarthy as like nathanael west and i really enjoyed it following on from webberexpats demolition job on valis in a previous tls bmaclean came to the authors defence saying his later novels have plenty to recommend them in fact id rate valis in particular as one of the very best novels ever written by an american dick was indeed striving to come to terms with experiences that he himself feared might have been borderline psychotic episodes and reinterpreted them obsessively in these last works i found that struggle as reflected through pkds very real literary talent intensely fascinating he dealt with it in books like and as standard science fiction novels in as what might perhaps be described as straight fiction and most compellingly in as experimental fictionalised autobiography not to mention his personal notes and journals some of which have now been published though i havent yet read any of this material maybe this is such a personal reaction that it cant be conveyed to other people but i would urge potential readers not to take webberexpats views as the final word on i dont deny that its a very strange piece of work and as such will not be to everyones taste but for those to whom it speaks it is an extremely powerful reading experience happily webberexpat was indeed the first to agree writing i couldnt agree more despite having absolutely hated valis anything by dick merits a close read i just found both archer and valis terribly sarcastic and tired of life and dismissive unpleasant you get the idea that the dick who wrote these books was exceptionally unpleasant completely different than the tone of anything else dick wrote such as the divine invasion or scanner darkly which
fbi obtains warrant to search clinton aides laptopthe fbi has obtained a warrant to investigate emails found on a laptop used by clinton aide huma abedin as part of its investigation into the democratic presidential candidates use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state the move came as the senate minority leader harry reid said the fbi director james comey may have broken the hatch act which bars federal officials from using their official authority to influence an election by his decision to send a letter to republican congressional committee chairs on friday announcing the new development that showed clear intent to aid one political party over another reid said adding a claim that comey was not releasing information linking the trump campaign to russia

the latest furore over hillary clintons alleged misuse of private emails when she was secretary of state in has thrown a tumultuous and unedifying us presidential election into even greater confusion with little more than a week to go before voting day the fbis unexpected and very public revelation that it is recommencing its investigation into clintons conduct may not be politically motivated but its timing certainly makes it appear that way the row represents yet another hammer blow to a democratic process whose credibility has been repeatedly challenged principally by the unscrupulous republican candidate donald trump despite this new firestorm stoked by republicans and rightwing media it remains likely that american voters will deliver a clear possibly resounding rejection of trump on november although opinion polls show the race tightening nationally and nothing is certain as a febrile campaign climaxes clinton is ahead almost everywhere that matters and she is the sane and reasonable if uninspiring choice a trump defeat will be richly deserved as we have noted previously he is not a fit and proper person to serve in the white house his behaviour during a long raucous and often embarrassingly vulgar campaign made that abundantly plain yet consigning the donald to the rubbish bin of electoral history is easier than getting rid of trumpism this is likely to take a lot longer trumps platform was based not on thought through policies and careful analysis but on prejudice grievance ignorance and fear spiced with opportunism his unexpected success in winning the nomination despite the republican establishments hostility reflected his close identification with mainly white working class and lower middle class voters who like him feel angry undervalued and alienated while public figures such as barack obama trumps failed republican rival jeb bush and clinton appear to this constituency to be remote out of touch and uncaring trumpism peddles the delusion that the candidate is on their side again and again in ohio florida and elsewhere disaffected voters claimed that only trump could be trusted to tell the truth only trump would keep his promises only trump could make america great again oblivious to paradox irony history or facts trumpism projects a distorted vision of american greatness the trump doctrine decrees that a nation built by immigrants that became the most powerful on earth is so scared of migrant and refugee hordes that it must build a mile wall with mexico trumpism holds that a great nation that incorporated religious tolerance into its groundbreaking constitution and bill of rights must now shatter its own principles and deliberately discriminate against muslims to keep itself safe as general concepts trumpism makes an enemy of the other equates nationality with homogeneity calls honest critics liars and seeks to threaten jail or harm opponents it says individualism outweighs state authority as in the unfettered right to bear firearms but not perversely in the case of a womans right to choose abortion trumpism distrusts and fears foreigners it believes free trade international treaties and economic globalisation in general are loaded dice intended to rip off americans paranoid trumpism holds that long term allies such as germany and japan get a free security ride at americas expense trumpism admires the domestic authoritarianism and international bullying of dictatorships in russia and china vladimir putin is a strong leader standing up for his people national beliefs and way of life any inconvenient truth that contradicts this or other trumpist narratives is inherently mendacious part of a web of lies and falsehoods spun by the treacherous mass media conspiring with the establishment to dupe honest citizens and dont forget trumpism cannot be fairly defeated if it loses it was cheated for sure trumpism appeals to the worst in people cynically exploiting and fanning the anger grievances and prejudices of the economically disadvantaged the embittered uneducated and plain ignorant it appeals to base instincts to lowest common denominators its is political dumbing down writ large it is underpinned by a pervasive and comprehensible insecurity engendered across the west by post economic injustice and social division the growing gulf between rich and poor and incompetent unfeeling or corrupt governance fear is the common enemy but fear is trumpisms friend this phenomenon is not confined to america european countries including britain experience variations on the theme in germany and france concern about rising immigration has boosted hardline nationalists whose appeal and disturbing ideology extend far beyond the cathartic issue of syria in greece poland austria and hungary rightwing extremists evil dehumanising ideas about refugees migrants and foreigners in general have become a commonplace of political discussion in britain ukip provides a noisy echo chamber for some of trumpisms most divisive chauvinistic and discriminatory refrains if trumpism is indeed a transnational pestilence it would be wise to look for a common remedy but first the symptoms must be accurately diagnosed and its long term effects should not be exaggerated much of the political turbulence and iconoclasm witnessed of late in america and europe is the direct result of continuing negative economic fallout from the financial crash hard times austerity cuts high unemployment and low wages are the manure in which political aberration takes root but as history shows they sometimes yet rarely lead to disaster when economies improve generally speaking so too does the quality of political discourse ensuring all people benefit equally from such an improvement is the one certain antidote to extreme politics while protest movements share characteristics and aims it is also evident that they are not all the same as each other trumpism is an infection others can catch yet it is also unique to america before panicking about the advance of the far right and far left in europe commentators in britain and elsewhere should remember that when all is said and done mainstream politicians such as angela merkel alain jupp mariano rajoy and yes hillary clinton do on the whole get elected or re elected notwithstanding greeces epic upheavals the centre does mostly

were going close our rolling coverage of the presidential campaign with a few hours and days before election day you can read a summary of the days events here about hillary clintons subsequent remarks on the new fbi review here and about a falsehood strewn speech by donald trump in iowa here hillary clinton reacts to new fbi investigation into her emailshillary clinton demands fbi explain review of new batch of emails read more were a divided nation but we are fighting to bring us all together like here tonight theres love here theres love trump says we will make america wealthy again we will make america strong again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again god bless you with that trump closes out his rally we have the highest murder in this country in years trump says very falsely trump is distorting an fbi statistic into a false claim in september the agency reported that murders and non negligent manslaughter rose in the us by in the largest single year increase since that is not the same as saying there are more murders in the us than at any point since murders were reported in down from and highs of and there were more murders in than in the murder rate declined from to even though the population increased by a quarter during this weeks debate trump almost cited the statistic accurately saying we have an increase in murder within our cities the biggest in years the fbi figure is a national one not restricted to cities you dont hear that from these people he adds gesturing toward the press they dont want to talk about it you can read our report on it from the day of the release and before trump remarked on it through the link below murders up in biggest percentage increase since fbi data shows read more when i am elected president i am going to keep radical islamic terrorists out of this country trump says without details and yes we will build the wall and yes mexico will pay for the wall the cost of the wall is peanuts compared to what were talking about trump says nonpartisan analysts estimate the wall would cost at least the us goods trade deficit with mexico is about which is offset by the us surplus in services of if not for the open border policies of this administration trump says countless americans would be alive today the us does not have open borders and barack obama has deported more than million people a record as trump himself noted at hte final presidential debate hillary has pledged open borders trump says and supports sanctuary cities clinton does not support open borders but does support sanctuary cities and reform to let people pass background checks and pay back taxes in order to stay in the us and she supports obamas executive actions to shield some migrants such as people who were brought to the us as children like obama she supports deportation for people with criminal records we are going to have the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan this is only true if youre in the wealthiest bracket of american earners half of trumps tax cuts would go to the top of earners according to the tax policy center and most families below the top of earners would have income gains of less than trump doesnt linger long on the affordable care act though he leads the crowd in a chant of drain the swamp his new catchphrase for taking on corruption in washington forty five percent of african american children under the age of six are in poverty trump says inaccurately citing outdated data per politifact the poverty rates in question were as high as trump says they were at the depths of the great recession but they have since eased to somewhere between percent and percent depending on which income threshold you use still the rates for african american children are disproportionately high so trump has a point even if his statistics are too old and exaggerate the scale of poverty in that age group on balance we rate the statement half true another two million hispanic americans have fallen into poverty under the obama administration he says also falsely per the guardians own fact check trumps use of two million is misleading on two points he starts counting from when george w bush was still in office and from right before the financial crisis peak and he ignores that the hispanic population has grown dramatically in the eight years since then almost million hispanic people fell below the poverty line between and census poverty numbers show but the number of hispanic people in poverty has decreased during the recovery in it fell to down

how is everyone doing ready for november yet tonight i was asked to speak about a vision for the next hundred years of reproductive choice and justice its such a wonderful frame to think about what a feminist future might look like but i bet like a lot of you its hard to imagine what the next hundred years will look like when so much of that for women especially will depend on what happens in just days there is no overstating how important this election is its not just about the next four or eight years this decision is about sending a message about who we are as a country and setting a very particular course for the women who live here well look back on this time as a watershed moment a moment that could in fact shape the next hundred years of womens rights but first i want to share a personal story a little over six years ago i was pregnant with my daughter layla and when i was weeks pregnant i got incredibly ill i developed pre eclampsia which some of you might know is dangerously high blood pressure during pregnancy i was admitted to the hospital and within just a few days i developed another complication called hellp syndrome the short version being my liver was in danger of failing and i was in danger of dying if my daughter was not born i had an emergency c section and layla was born weighing she stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first two months of her life undergoing medical interventions to save and protect her that to this day i try to avoid thinking about but i was lucky and she was lucky and today shes a wonderful healthy six year old and i feel grateful for that every day i share this story often because this was something in my life that changed me forever that shaped who i am today and when i think about this moment what i think about most often is how fortunate i was that i got sick far enough along in my pregnancy that i wasnt faced with the reality of needing an abortion to save my life and when i think about those days in the hospital the fear the urgency the confusion the stress the idea that the government could ever become involved in my lifes most pivotal moment it horrifies me so one thing i want for the next hundred years i want for no person ever to fear that their most personal life choices will be made by someone else i want for no woman ever to be afraid that her scariest life moment will be made even more difficult and traumatic by government interference in the next hundred years i want to see every woman be free from the fear that her body is not really her own and thats why i want to talk about this election tonight because thats whats at stake never before in american politics have womens bodies been so front and center in the national conversation and so at risk we are choosing between a candidate who has spent her political career fighting for reproductive rights and a candidate who says that women who have abortions need to be punished a candidate who said this week in the final debate unequivocally that she will defend planned parenthood and a candidate who promised to defund it a choice between a person who has spent her life in public service and a braggadocious businessman who rips off his workers and perhaps most tellingly were making a decision between a woman who has said that womens rights are human rights and a man who says if you want to you can just grab women by the pussy theres a feminist rallying cry online right now that i like a lot and it says november pussy grabs back now i know that so much has been made of that comment and the ensuing allegations against trump by multiple women that he did just what he bragged about doing on that tape and while some people may not see the link between sexual assault and reproductive rights those of us here in this room know better we know that there is a direct connection between those who think they can touch womens bodies without permission and those who think they can legislate our bodies reproductive rights and justice has always been about a fundamental respect or in this case disrespect of womens bodily integrity and autonomy either our bodies are our own or theyre not and make no mistake the conversation that were having right now about groping is not just salacious media fodder the way we come out of this moment the direction our culture shifts because of it will absolutely determine womens rights in the future we are witnessing a moment where our country could move backwards back to a place where boys will be boys and men will make decisions for women or towards a future where our culture and politics understand and respect women as autonomous full human beings those are the two paths right now im optimistic that were on the right one the one that brings us to the feminist future all of us in this room have been waiting for when trump said he wanted to punish women for having abortions there was outrage and he had to walk back those comments but more importantly pro choice activists and organizations like planned parenthood were there to point out that while other politicians may not say they want women to be punished thats exactly what would happen if abortion were made illegal and in fact what has already happened to women like purvi patel who was put in prison for inducing her own abortion in indiana our feminist future has no place for criminalizing women who decide if and when to parent when
ken wiwa who has died aged after a stroke was a journalist and author adviser to three nigerian presidents and a campaigner for social and environmental justice as the eldest son of the poet human rights activist and author ken saro wiwa he struggled as a young man to forge his own identity but following his fathers detention on a trumped up accusation of murder ken junior as he was widely known became a powerful advocate for peace and reconciliation keeping the territory of ogoniland on the world stage as a symbol of the injustice of oil exploitation in developing countries born in lagos ken was sent from nigeria to britain along with his mother maria and four siblings and studied at tonbridge school in kent he had a complicated relationship with his wealthy anglophile father a traditional ogoni leader who had worked for both the nigerian federal and state governments post independence in but who devoted his later life to a struggle for ogoni autonomy and to fighting shells presence in his homeland high quality crude oil had been discovered by shell in the small square mile area of the niger delta close to port harcourt in south nigeria in the elder saro wiwa saw clearly that rather than bringing wealth and prosperity it had led to war devastation social division and the degradation of farm and fishing grounds the flamboyant author who expected his expensively educated son to return to nigeria to continue his own political struggle for ogoni autonomy became increasingly a thorn in the side of shell and the military government led by general sani abacha matters came to a head in when saro wiwa led a peaceful revolt against the oil group shell was humiliated forced to withdraw from ogoniland and stop production in one of the worlds most oil rich regions the ogonis had won a great victory in their fight for self determination but the price of their rebellion was the wrath of the military dictatorship in saro wiwa and eight other ogoni leaders were accused of complicity in the murders of four ogoni chiefs the nine were detained in a military camp outside port harcourt to be tried by a special military tribunal their detention and subsequent torture posed a personal dilemma for the young ken father and son had been close but by his teens ken felt intimidated and unable to develop his own identity so great was his need for independence from his powerful and charismatic father that in at the age of he changed his name in london to be rid of what he later called the straitjacket of identity my father was trying to impose on me becoming ken wiwa however was not the liberating experience he had hoped for it seemed flat and rather unimpressive next to the more colourful ken saro wiwa he said tellingly it took wiwa two years to break the news to his father of the rejection of his name when he did so it was by letter to the military camp where he was being held the elder man was furious writing back there is no way in our culture that ken wiwa can be the son of ken saro wiwa the dilemma was particularly acute because his fathers detention took place just as his own career was taking off in the uk wiwa had become the guardians first online journalist working with the new media laboratory the groundbreaking forerunner of the papers full entry into the digital revolution that was soon to engulf the industry as the detention of the ogoni nine became an international issue with environmental and human rights activists writers and politicians all appealing to abacha for clemency wiwa found himself sucked ever deeper into his fathers world of politics in he gave up his job in journalism to dedicate himself to saving his fathers life travelling the world to lobby politicians and heads of state to intervene and to mobilise public opinion the result was that his fathers name which he had rejected became a symbol of the emerging worldwide struggle for environmental justice abacha however was unmoved and on november saro wiwa and the other ogoni leaders were executed after the military tribunal found them guilty of murder their executions took place when wiwa was in auckland new zealand to lobby the commonwealth heads of state and nelson mandela and triggered a worldwide outcry the british prime minister john major described it as judicial murder mandela declared it a heinous act and world figures joined the condemnation of abacha nigeria was suspended from the commonwealth when the outrage subsided many expected wiwa to return to nigeria to take up his fathers mantle and lead the ogoni struggle but although his father had effectively been canonised he again chose his own path he had married olivia burnett in london in and the couple and their two sons felix and suanu went to live in canada where wiwa became a writer in residence and a fellow at several universities and foundations as well as a successful feature writer and tv and radio producer in he published in the shadow of a saint a sons journey to understand his fathers legacy a moving memoir of a complex life lived between different cultures having at times felt isolated from africa wiwa returned to his nigerian roots in he became a world economic forum young global leader and a member of the africa advisory council of the prince of waless rainforests project the nigerian president olusegun obasanjo appointed him as his special assistant on peace conflict resolution and reconciliation in and wiwa later worked as an aide in abuja to presidents umaru yaradua and goodluck jonathan in he and the families of the other executed ogoni leaders sued shell in new york accusing its nigerian subsidiary the shell petroleum development company of having collaborated in their executions the case never went to full trial with shell offering at the last minute
donald trump photograph mark wallheiser getty imagesdonald trump said today that hillary clintons plan for syria would lead to world war three because of the potential for conflict with military forces from nuclear armed russia in an interview focused largely on foreign policy the republican presidential nominee said defeating islamic state was a higher priority than persuading than syrian president bashar al assad to step down playing down a long held goal of us policy trump questioned how his democratic opponent would negotiate with russias president vladimir putin after having demonized him blamed barack obama for a downturn in us relations with the philippines under its new president rodrigo duterte bemoaned a lack of republican unity behind his candidacy and said he would easily win the election if the party leaders supported him if we had party unity we couldnt lose this election to hillary clinton trump said as they go to the polls in a historic presidential election more than six in americans say neither major political party represents their views any longer a survey has found dissatisfaction with both democrats and republicans has risen sharply since when less than half held that neither reflected their opinions according to research by the public religion research institute a former aide to republican governor chris christie reiterated today that a now infamous email she sent saying time for some traffic problems near the george washington bridge in referred to a traffic study not a political retaliation plot trump implied today that he would be willing to fight the sitting vice president joe biden behind a barn speaking at a rally in tallahassee florida almost precisely two weeks to the minute to when polls close there on election day trump said of a fist fight between the two id love that the year old republican nominee for president also labeled the vice president mr tough guy and said of beating up the year old biden some things in life you could really love doing fox news host megyn kelly and former house speaker newt gingrich engaged in an aggressive argument tonight over lingering questions regarding donald trumps treatment of women and how it might affect him in the coming presidential election with gingrich accusing kelly of bias against trump and kelly urging gingrich to take your anger issues and spend some time working on them im sick and tired of people like you using language thats inflammatory thats not true gingrich shouted i think that is exactly the bias that people are upset by i think that your defensiveness on this may speak volumes sir kelly deadpanned what i said is if donald trump is a sexual predator then its a big story what we saw on that tape was trump himself saying that he likes to grab women by the genitals and kiss them against their will kelly continued referring to a tape that showed trump bragging about being able to sexually assault women with impunity because of his fame then we saw ten women come forward after he actually denied doing it at a debate to say that was untrue he did it to me he did it to me he did it to me we saw it with reporters people who had worked with him people from apprentice and so on and so forth he denies it it all which is his right we dont know what the truth is my point to you is as a media story we dont get to say the ten women are lying kelly continued we have to cover that story sir gingrich dismissed kellys assertion and decried the amount of focus paid on trumps sexual assault accusations you are fascinated with sex and you dont care about public policy gingrich responded and thats what i get out of watching you tonight im not fascinated by sex but i am fascinated by protection of women and understanding what were getting in the oval office kelly retorted its not about me its about the women and men of america and the poll numbers show us that the women of america in particular are very concerned about these allegations the former speaker of the house of representatives responded by daring kelly to call former president bill clinton a sexual predator which kelly ignored were gonna have to leave it at that and you can take your anger issues and spend some time working on them mister speaker kelly concluded and you too gingrich responded meekly the trump campaign swiftly responded deeming gingrichs appearance a success dan scavino jr newtgingrich just destroyed megynkelly shows she is totally biased against mr trump not very smart mr trump has long known october hillary clintons campaign has released yet another spanish language advertisement in ruby red arizona although theres no word yet whether clinton plans on visiting the grand canyon state herself families are complicated malik obama all i know is that my brother has done nothing for the kenyan side of his family i wonder if we are related sometimes october scott adams the author behind the once popular dilbert cartoons has published a blog post in which he offers his qualified support of donald trump but vows to assist in his assassination if trump does anything that looks even slightly hitler ish in office in a post titled the crook versus the monster adams argues that the public conception of trump as a monster are misguided but that if they prove accurate adams vows to join the resistance movement and help kill him calling it an easy promise to make adams continues i hope my fellow citizens would use their second amendment rights to rise up and help me kill any hitler type person who rose to the top job in this country no matter who it is what could be a more suitable ending to this awful campaign than a fistfight between donald trump and joe biden donald trump photograph jonathan ernst
