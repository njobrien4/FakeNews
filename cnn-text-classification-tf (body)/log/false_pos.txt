by francis carr begbie eric cantor republican politician and lissa muscatine hillary clintons former speech writer were two of the many jews given free rein to reflect on donald trump a few days ago before millions of bbc viewers in the end one could not help noticing one interesting if rather awkward fact about that edition of bbc newsnight the editor two out of three of the main presenters and all seven of the main interviewees in washington and london were jewish not bad for a group said to represent less than of the british population francis carr begbie you might think that after a disaster as humiliating as the election of donald trump that our anointed elites would take this opportunity for a bit of humility that this would be an opportunity for introspection and some soul searching self reflection well the good news is that you would be wrong for this would involve a level of self awareness far beyond our narcissistic elites all around they are demonstrating a complete inability to understand the forces behind their humiliation at the hands of a man they dismissed as a joke from day one and whose demise they predicted every inch of the way this self deception was wonderfully on display in an immediate post election edition of the bbcs flagship current affairs programme newsnight broadcast to the nation the day after and including a number of american interviewees in a specially extended version of the show programme editor ian katz dispatched emily maitlis mark urban and david grossman to find answers on the day after the result in both london and washington a stellar line up of the finest brains from the media and the academy were assembled to help them chew it over entertainingly the vanity narcissism and entitlement of the bbc presenter ocracy was fully on view proud and undented to the accompaniment of the beatles tune fool on the hill anchor emily maitlis could barely contain her rage and sputtered about how a game show host and someone who owned a beauty pageant could become president populism uprising nationalism versus globalism as with former president bushs puzzlement over the vision thing they seemed to be able to mouth the words but comprehension was lacking with every guest emily maitlis showed that old habits die hard or not at all she dripped condescension from the outset snapping at immigration traitor pro israel fanatic former us congressman eric cantor who was perhaps trying to redeem himself given the new winds in the republican party we talked about the vulgarity of this man this is a man who talked of grabbing women by the pussy is that a man you are proud of an angry school teacher furious with the behaviour of her immature irresponsible charges easily the funniest moment in the programme came during a virtuoso splenetic performance from historian simon schama who seemed to think it was germany in all over again race he said was more important factor in the election than the economic arguments simon schama ashkenazi jew wriggling in his seat as if it was subjected to regular electric shocks he said it is really weird to me how we pussyfoot around the toxic malodorous element of race which has played an important part of this anti semitism has long been part of populism beginning in the early twentieth century even today there were sinister references by the likes of senator jeff sessions to george soros who was singled out as a particularly odious figure in this international banking conspiracy schama almost lost it completely when co interviewee and neocon stalwart melanie phillips told him to calm down a bit it is not a moment for calm it is not a moment for calm he screeched melanie phillips ashkenzi jew and virulent zionist melanie knows very well what these anti semitic dog whistles are like this too is part of populism we are facing a cataclysmic moment melanie is right to say it is a populist revolt it is nothing to do with conservative republican politics it amuses me to hear that eric cantor imagines that things are going to go on as they always did in the republican party that they will restrain donald trump they wont george washington warned about despotism and that is what we are facing melanie phillips for her part agreed the most important problem was anti semitism but she saw it coming from a completely different quarter there are noxious elements around clearly some of the people supporting trump are anti semitic and racists but that is also true of people on the left there is no sign that he personally is anti semitic or racist people call people racist when they want to restrict as he does legal immigration anti semitism is now at record levels at liberal universities overseen by liberal professors and liberal vice chancellors studio presenter evan davies muttered about how they had to give up something to people worried about the loss of their traditional societies and really act on illegal immigration but schama wasnt listening he was worried about david duke donald trump re tweeted a neo nazi tweet it is not a coincidence that david duke kkk imperial wizard is exhilarated and rejoicing with the advent of trump who is his man we will see race crimes hate crimes explode now we will have a far right supreme court which will reverse roe v wade as a glimpse into the fevered imagination of at least one strongly identifying jew it could not have been more revealing before schama actually self detonated on air the programme moved on to more heavyweights neoconservative think tanker danielle pletka senior vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the american enterprise institute complained she had no idea what trumps policies were which was not very helpful mary kaldorby m jaggers ld we discussed yesterday the various reasons why trump won the election mr jaggers

projections of nearly all arizonas insurers the result a flood of red ink then withdrawals and premium increases when affordable care act insurance marketplaces launched in fall arizona seemed like a success eight insurers competed to sign up consumers offering a wide variety of plans and some of the lowest premiums in the country today with aca enrollment starting nov arizonans will find in most counties only one insurer selling exchange plans for premiums for some plans will be more than double this year some of the biggest increases in the nation only last minute maneuvering prevented one arizona county from becoming the first in the nation to have no exchange insurers at all a similar dynamic is playing out in other states exchanges which are a critical centerpiece of the health law about one third of u s counties will have just one exchange insurer next year up from this year estimates the nonprofit kaiser family foundation which studies health care issues in many cases

flood of red ink then withdrawals and premium increases the arizona market is the poster child for the problems the exchanges are experiencing nationally says tom snook a phoenix based actuary for

savings accounts and allowing insurers to sell plans across state lines trump my employees are having problems with obamacare obama administration officials say they are bolstering the exchanges and the consumer impact of premium increases will be limited by the laws subsidies for lower income people received by about of enrollees nationally were making really good progress in addressing a lot of the issues says kevin counihan head of the centers for medicare and medicaid services unit charged with implementing the health law he calls arizona an outlier saying that insurers elsewhere have succeeded with aca plans the aca transformed the individual insurance market where consumers buy their own plans before the law insurers could refuse to sell to people with pre existing health conditions starting in consumers couldnt be denied coverage or charged more if they were ill individuals could shop for plans via an online marketplace partly to ensure that healthy people signed up to balance out the sick the law contained penalties for most people if they didnt obtain coverage arizona expanded medicaid as the law envisioned insurers saw uncertainty in the new marketplace but also potential they had to guess what prices they needed to charge to cover the health costs of new enrollees a society of actuaries report suggested that the arizona individual insurance market could more than double growing to consumers with more than of them buying through the exchange the health care costs of the newer customer base would be around higher than the old one it suggested president

his pre aca plan with help from a federal subsidy unlike his old plan his new aca insurance covered any costs tied to his pre existing health conditionshe earlier had a hip replacement and suffered a broken neck it was perfect says mr walton who owns his own business krysti horwitz of phoenix steered clear of the exchange ms horwitz and her husband who own an online marketing business were healthy

authorized in late by spring of with the first year of the new aca plans barely under way insurers had to guess again at pricing rate requests for plans were due though insurers still had scant information about who signed up that was partly because federal officials extended the deadline for enrollment after technical problems with healthcare gov the federal exchange being used in arizona

by on fri oct at pm as megyn kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her share on twitter print this post earlier this week friday fox follies under the assumption the explosive and bizarre battle between megyn kelly and newt gingrich would be this weeks lede i had already tricked up an opening paragraph in case you missed it thats when he got personal accused her of being obsessed by sex and she told him that he should work on his anger issues this weeks column would have been about how the fox audience continues to splinter as they take sides in the presidential election the nyt calls em megyn moments i call them fissures in what had been assumed to be the bedrock foundation of the fox news channel its unthinking audience then came word that rupert murdoch was playing hardball as kellys contract negotiations break out into the open that paragraph lovingly crafted went out the window but lets see what this fight was about because heat is always better than light for ratings as trump congratulates newt gingrich for getting his butt kicked by megyn kelly watch as kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her her contract expires next year and rupie opened up to the wall street journal of which he is owner to partially cajole kelly and partially to threaten her into extending her contract million in contract talks with fox news if they are going to make a network that is going to be a post ailes post trump it will be around megyn kelly chris wallace and shep smith and they are going to have to throw hannity and oreilly overboard said andrew tyndall a television news consultant of other hosts at the network that isnt going to happen promised mr murdoch were not changing direction that would be business suicide he said mr oreillys contract is also up at the end of next year and mr murdoch said were going to want bill to stay with us mr hannitys contract isnt up until ms kelly has forged close ties to mr murdochs sons particularly lachlan murdoch who is co executive chairman of fox and has taken an active role in contract talks people close to the situation said fox would like to settle this before the election and before kellys book is released both of which could only strengthen her position in the negotiations if all goes well from the the power of megyn kellys feminismeven if she doesnt call it that by the daily beasts tim teeman imagine then her mix of satisfaction and maybe ennui as she scrolled across some of the praise ridden screeds out today how megyn kelly became an improbable feminist icon megyn kelly has become the biggest example of white feminism at work and aw crapheres proof that megyn kelly is kind of a feminist role model now note the grudging headlines because of kellys employer and because she has not fought the good feminist fight in a conventional left wing context throughout her career to date the f word mantle is being conferred upon her with something of a scowl this in itself reveals a kind of blinkeredness on the part of kellys critics it is perfectly possible to work for a right facing institution and not be percent right wing yourself or spout the prevailing dogma of the tv station you work for aside from the fact that when she tilts right she tends to tilt alt right the biggest knock on kelly is that shes too hard edged marshall mcluhan spoke of the medium cool of tee vee but kelly comes across as the opposite of warm and fuzzy this makes her less attractive to other networks shes hoping to change that impression when she co hosts live with kelly ripa the morning after the election think of her as a designated hitter trying to knock murdochs hardball right out of the park still watters still a few weeks back fff reported on a racist watters world in which the white privileged pencil necked geek made fun of asians this week asian american groups meet with fox news personnel over awful jesse watters segment paul cheung president of aaja told the erik wemple blog that the meeting was productive i think they heard what the communitys reactions are he said of the session at new yorks museum of chinese in america approximately asian american groups and allies have signed an open letter to fox news regarding the unfortunate episode said cheung ron kim a new york state assemblyman in attendance told this blog that a representative from the oreilly factor and a senior representative from the news side of the channel attended the meeting together they played a good cop bad cop routine said kim the gentleman from oreillys show was defending what they were doing and trying to explain that this is a part of the opinion section of fox news and sometimes edgy humor can go too far said kim once again the specter of fox newss vaunted news opinion divide presents itself as weve noted before this is a convention borrowed from the newspaper industry to justify fox news hosts such as sean hannity openly campaigning for donald trump steve doocy of the morning show fox friends spreading harmful innuendo into the public square and oreilly allowing his protege to spread racist stereotypes all about chinatown
