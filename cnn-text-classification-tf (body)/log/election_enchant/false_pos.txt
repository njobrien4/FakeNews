conclusive finding will be available or made by the in the few days left before the elections according to the it appears that federal agents are preparing to scour roughly emails as we reported moments ago were discovered weeks ago on the laptop of to see how many relate to a prior probe of email as on the device suggests there may be thousands sent to or from the private server that the democratic nominee used while she was secretary of according to people familiar with the matter as the the review will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are emails between a close aide and the estranged wife of and state department how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the federal bureau of and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the email which officials call as we further reported earlier today the has had to await a court order to begin reviewing the because they were uncovered in an unrelated

donate those of you that care about about the about the beauty of queer sexual about indigenous lands and their right to and about policing practices that have led to the deaths of many black men and how do we respond to this confusing what do we do how do we by let us acknowledge these difficult feelings of these terrifying thoughts that are suddenly very alive in the air today it is as if box has not only been emptied out into the but that it has been and spread out to the corners of all lands hope now seems in short supply we are undone i write you because things have indeed fallen apart while this unspeakable insurgency of despair might goad us into rushing into the next organizational moment the itch to hit them back or do something i want to invite us to slow down and pay attention to the stark grief that haunts us now she stares us in the this repulsive visitor if we must we must return her gaze and let her do her important work with us i am a living in but like most people on the planet that tuned in to the surrealism of the presidential i woke up to the shocking news that trump was not only beating on election but that there was a frightening possibility he could win and then that distant once laughably out of the became a blue wall fell to the man who promised to build the media people stuttered as their once pristine cast of glossy pundits groped for the peso fell and in one fell it felt like the home of the brave was exactly that a place dyed in where braveness would now be required to keep on living ever since trump became the th president of the united the has been flooded with articles attempting to make sense of this moment politico published a piece with a title that must have resonated with many people around the how did everyone get it so the independent insisted that trump would have lost us election if sanders had been the while frank opined on the pages of the guardian that trump is moving to the white and liberals put him there across the fractured landscape of also surprised by their fortune laughed at mocking the that thought an admittedly troubled candidate who seem to have a message beyond insisting on her entitlement would simply waltz into the white house i will not attempt to pry open the cadaver of this moment it is probably the case that no analysis is good enough to assuage our feelings of shock what happened is not reducible to a single causative factor or a decidable active ingredient the world that simple i will however in the spirit of full disclosure the kind of radical honesty we probably need at this time that i secretly wanted this to i was so invested in the idea of a sanders presidency so mortified by what was obvious to me as an attempt to stifle his that i became possessed by a i easily exorcise i understood the dangers of a potential trump but decided even that was better off to the inertia of the status quo as embodied by a regime that argument is not easily maintained in the face of the orange predicament we now find ourselves in in an case of be careful what you wish i find not relief but a painful sympathy with many who had hoped that the morning of th would somehow usher in a more tolerant a more beautiful country a country that cares about its many and contours now because of trump and the energies he has minorities are probably less safe at a time of unprecedented racial tensions and phallic exhibitions of some folks are already dreading their next brief visit to the shopping knowing that the streets are now being painted red with white with racial acrimony and blind and blue with the authoritarian aloofness of a candidate who promised law and order the new it is to these vulnerable ones i write those of you that care about about the about the beauty of queer sexual about indigenous lands and their right to and about policing practices that have led to the deaths of many black men and women without trump or falling into the trap of disillusioned punditry and yet with a keen awareness of the likely consequences of his presidency i how do we respond to what do we how do we what opportunities are presenting themselves to us to work for a caring at the time of writing this there is news of revolt on the streets of new and other cities people are protesting the rise of trump people are angry around this same famed has suggested concerned should fire the punditry and take over the democratic party it is impossible to answer the question of what a right response or to speak as if one is situated outside the swirl and flow of things i do however want to invite you to try doing something less spectacular something for it is my opinion that with the seeds of a new politics may yet be planted when i was growing up in i was taught to think of my life only in terms of its greatness quotient i was conditioned early to yearn for prominence fame fortune legacy success awakening the giant within getting to the top lasting forever those were resonant in my developmental years the figures of bill jack and were placed before me as aspirational objects if i did not do all i can to increase my greatness my life did not really matter i suspect this story is not uniquely mine to tell we live in a world that places priority in the top and discountenances the bottom the condition for living a life of meaning and purpose was moral
donate speaks in on march la n by on trump managed to pull the biggest upset in us politics by tapping successfully into the anger of white voters and appealing to the lowest inclinations of people in a manner that would have probably impressed propagandist himself but what exactly does trump victory and what can one expect from this megalomaniac when he takes over the reins of power on what is trump political if and is a will us foreign policy be any different under a trump some years public intellectual warned that the political climate in the us was ripe for the rise of an authoritarian figure he shares his thoughts on the aftermath of this the moribund state of the us political system and why trump is a real threat to the world and the planet in general for the unthinkable has in contrast to all trump scored a decisive victory over and the man that described as a dangerous clown and will be the next president of the united states in your what were the deciding factors that led voters to produce the biggest upset in the history of us before turning to this i think it is important to spend a few moments pondering just what happened on a date that might turn out to be one of the most important in human depending on how we react no exaggeration the most important news of was barely a fact of some significance in itself on the world meteorological organization delivered a report at the international conference on climate change in morocco which was called in order to carry forward the agreement of the reported that the past five years were the hottest on record it reported rising sea soon to increase as a result of the unexpectedly rapid melting of polar most ominously the huge antarctic glaciers arctic sea ice over the past five years is percent below the average of the previous not only raising sea but also reducing the cooling effect of polar ice reflection of solar thereby accelerating the grim effects of global warming the reported further that temperatures are approaching dangerously close to the goal established by along with other dire reports and forecasts another event took place on which also may turn out to be of unusual historical significance for reasons once were barely noted on the most powerful country in world which will set its stamp on what comes had an election the outcome placed total control of the government the supreme court in the hands of the republican which has become the most dangerous organization in world history apart from the last all of this is uncontroversial the last phrase may seem even outrageous but is the facts suggest otherwise the party is dedicated to racing as rapidly as possible to destruction of organized human life there is no historical precedent for such a stand is this an consider what we have just been witnessing during the republican every candidate denied that what is happening is happening with the exception of the sensible like who said it all but we do have to do anything because we producing more natural thanks to or john who agreed that global warming is taking but added that are going to burn in and we are not going to apologize for the winning now the calls for rapid increase in use of fossil including dismantling of rejection of help to developing countries that are seeking to move to sustainable and in racing to the cliff as fast as possible trump has already taken steps to dismantle the environmental protection agency by placing in charge of the transition a notorious climate change trump top adviser on billionaire oil executive announced his which were dismantling tax cuts for the industry the wealthy and corporate sector more fossil fuel lifting temporary block on the access pipeline the market reacted quickly shares in energy corporations including the world largest coal which had filed for but after trump registered a percent gain the effects of republican had already been felt there had been hopes that the agreement would lead to a verifiable but any such thoughts were abandoned because the republican congress would not accept any binding so what emerged was a voluntary evidently much weaker effects may soon become even more vividly apparent than they already are in tens of millions are expected to have to flee from plains in coming years because of sea level rise and more severe creating a migrant crisis that will make today pale in significance with considerable leading climate scientist says that migrants should have the right to move to the countries from which all these greenhouse gases are coming millions should be able to go to the united and to the other rich countries that have grown wealthy while bringing about a new geological the marked by radical human transformation of the environment these catastrophic consequences can only not just in but in all of south as already intolerable for the inexorably rise and the glaciers threatening the entire water supply already in some million people are reported to lack adequate drinking water and the effects will reach far beyond it is hard to find words to capture the fact that humans are facing the most important question in their history whether organized human life will survive in anything like the form we know and are answering it by accelerating the race to disaster similar observations hold for the other huge issue concerning human the threat of nuclear which has been looming over our heads for years and is now increasing it is no less difficult to find words to capture the utterly astonishing fact that in all of the massive coverage of the electoral none of this receives more than passing mention at least i am at a loss to find appropriate words turning finally to the question to be it appears that received a slight majority of the
yahoo news director wrote his bombshell letter to congress on about newly discovered emails that were potentially pertinent to the investigation into private email server before agents were able to review any of the material because the bureau had not yet gotten a search warrant to read three government officials who have been briefed on the probe told yahoo news when wrote the he had no idea what was in the content of the one of the officials referring to recently discovered emails that were found on the laptop of disgraced the estranged husband of top aide is under investigation for allegedly sending illicit text messages to a girl as of the had still not gotten approval from the justice department for a warrant that would allow them to read any of the newly discovered and therefore are still in the dark about whether they include any classified material that the bureau has not already seen we do not have a a senior law enforcement official said discussions are underway the and the justice as to the best way to move forward that and other senior officials were unaware of what was in the emails and whether they contained any material the had not already obtained is important because the campaign of trump and republicans in congress have suggested that the director would not have written his letter unless he had been made aware of significant new emails that might justify reopening the investigation into the server but a message that wrote to all agents seeking to explain his decision to write the controversial letter strongly hinted that investigators did not not yet have legal authority establishing probable cause to review the content of emails on electronic devices in that told agents that he had only been briefed on about the matter and that the recommendation of investigators was with respect to seeking access to emails that have recently been found in an unrelated case approved the recommendation to seek judicial access to the material that he wrote because those emails appear to be pertinent to our i agreed that we should take appropriate steps to obtain and review he told agents letter to congress has brought the director under withering criticism top justice department officials were described by a government source as apoplectic over the letter senior officials strongly discouraged from sending telling officials last week it would violate longstanding department policy against taking actions in the days before an election that might influence the a official familiar with the matter told yahoo news he was acting independently of the guidance given to said the official insisted in his message to agents that he felt he had an obligation to inform congress about the new material because he had previously testified that the bureaus investigation into the email server was completed he said it would be misleading to the people were we not to supplement the record he given that we know the significance of this newly discovered collection of i want to create a misleading impression the decision to send the letter said the senior law enforcement official and top officials debated what course to take once they learned about the discovery on laptop said to include thousands of emails in the the official feared that if he chose to move forward and seek access to the emails and immediately alert the efforts would leak to the media and the director would be accused of concealing information this was the least bad the senior official said but letter to congress suggesting that the might now revisit the email probe may have been even more some critics charged this letter is troubling because it is vaguely worded and leaves so many questions sen the ranking democrat on the senate judiciary and three other democrats on the panel wrote and attorney general lynch it is not clear whether the emails identified by the are even in the custody of the whether any of the emails have already been whether secretary sent or received or whether they even have any significance to the previous the senators wrote a yahoo news review of interview with agents last when the email probe was in full swing shows that the longtime aide hinted that there might be relevant material on her husbands personal devices but agents do not appear to have followed up on the clues who served as deputy chief of staff and held a security disclosed she had access to four email accounts while working at the state department these included an official state department email but also an account on private email server that used to communicate with and her top as well as a personal yahoo account she used both the email account and the yahoo account to routinely forward state department emails and documents so she could more easily print she said in she told the she had a separate email account that she had previously used to support her husbands political activities interview conducted by agents at the field office last was the first that the longtime aide might have circulated official state department material among her multiple accounts at one agents even confronted on one apparently sensitive email about policy towards that had been forwarded to her state department account from an aide to the late then a special state department envoy to and had forwarded the email to her yahoo account in order to print but told agents she was unaware of the classification of the document and stated that she did not make judgments on the classification of material she received she relied on the sender to make that assessment and to properly make and transmit the document there is no indication from the report on the that the agents ever pressed her on what has now turned into an explosive issue in the final days of the did have access to any classified government documents on his laptop and devices he apparently used to
mysterious universe do other realities brush up against our are there parallel dimensions lying just beyond through some untraceable veil separating the idea of parallel realities beyond our own is not yet what if this phenomenon were to come bursting forth from the realm of theory and speculation and come crashing down into the are there perhaps some people who have stepped over that barrier into domains we have not yet to see and which we may indeed not even be meant to i have covered such alleged excursions into the horizon beyond our known reality here at mysterious universe before and here i will revisit this topic with a selection of other cases that seem to imply the possibility that not only are parallel dimensions but that they are destinations to which we can be whisked whether intentional or not in the issue of fate magazine there was the curious story of a woman who apparently shifted into another parallel universe in according to the in the fall of that year a woman by the name of golding had a profoundly unusual experience while riding an elevator with her in the elevator was and when made a mistake and got off at the wrong floor she found that she could not push her way back in past the throng of people and resigned herself to waiting for the next one that was when she looked around and was startled to realize that she was no longer in the store at but rather an expansive train station the enormous railway station she found herself in was allegedly bustling with fevered with throngs of travelers rushing to their trains and booming announcements of arrivals and departures echoing through the air there seemed to be no way this busy place could have any connection whatsoever to the music store she had been in moments before the confused made her way to an information booth to ask where she but found that the woman working there completely ignored as if she there at all followed a series of signs pointing the way to the street and she emerged out into a sunny afternoon that seemed to be in the midst of summer rather than in a place that was most certainly not she wandered about in confusion and noticed that everyone around her seemed to completely ignore her and walk on by as if they did not even see her at some point she claims that she saw a confused looking boy standing in the sidewalk similarly being passed on by people who seemed to have no idea he was even and approached him wondering what was going on the boy was able to actually see and respond to and looked in her the first time anyone had acknowledged her presence in this surreal place as she the boy seemed equally relieved that he was visible to smiled slightly and purportedly i guess they let you off at the wrong too the two lost people walked together down the street in the whole time completely ignored by those around and the boy told of what had happened to him he claimed that he had been playing tennis in in the united and had gone to the locker room to change his shoes when he had gone back to the courts to play some more he had found that the tennis courts that had been there moments before were now gone and in their place was a huge train which had turned out to be the exact same station into which had enigmatically entered from the elevator the two allegedly kept on walking until they reached an open area that led to and over the waves they could apparently make out a sand bar with several women upon it chatting and seeming to act as if nothing was beyond the ordinary to one of the women was oddly her sister the women out on the sandbar seemed to notice them and began waving and shouting to and her companion this encouraged the boy to try and make a swim out to the which did not seem so far and which he was confident he could reach yet even though he was a good swimmer it seemed that no matter how much he tried and pushed against the he was unable to draw any closer to the mysterious sandbar and he returned to shore in frustration it was then that the sandbar supposedly suddenly vanished into thin air closed her eyes in and and then was overcome by the sensation of floating through space after some time of this odd feeling of hovering in darkness she claimed that she suddenly opened her eyes to find herself sitting atop a stool in the music store in which seemed to be in the process of closing for the suggesting that she had been there for at least several hours looked around for her but could not find him and decided to head back to his home when she her was noticeably relieved and explained that he had lost her in the store and had waited for her to come to the right floor for a few hours before deciding to go back home the whom had seen on the mysterious sandbar claimed that she had seen in town and had even called out to but that she had been too absorbed in talking to a young boy to notice her where did go during that why should she see her sister on a sandbar while the sister had seen her in all while they could not reach across to were they separated by strange barriers we do not and may not ever it is a mystery another strange article in the issue of fate magazine tells of the weird experience of a e of who in was traveling home with her husband and four children from a weekend trip to on the way they noticed what looked
by brushing away the extreme claims and rhetoric of much election there are some observations which deserve attention these unfortunately mostly provide hard lessons and not a lot of encouragement for people who hold to principles of and the election demonstrated perhaps better than and better than has been generally been that a plutocracy it took a genuine a a man with a lifetimes economic to defeat a family which could provide the very definition of being politically a family which had laboriously constructed and carefully maintained a kind of deep well with money for their ambitions it was the well of drilled by bill with help from some extremely shady such as that made the keystone establishment figures in the democratic party it was not personal charm or exceptional political in his displayed some of both of earned the their it was the the mothers milk of politics in what is euphemistically called fund many hundreds of millions of dollars were provided for the party over the last couple of decades by bill efforts fully appreciated the fact that money buys power and influence she lacked bills superficial but she certainly more than shared his ambition on the charm when she was ready to move into running for she perhaps under bills a kind of forced clown face with arched and a smile as big as her lips would and these expressions were accompanied by little gestures such as briefly pointing to various or waving whenever she campaigned her gestures reminded me of something you might see atop a float in a parade or of the late at his most exuberant these were not natural for her they were never in evidence years ago when she spent years as a kind of bizarre executive both in a governors mansion and later in the white bizarre because she indulged her husbands predatory sexual behavior in exchange for the immense power it conferred on her behind the scenes over her far more and successful knew that gestures and simulated charm do not get you far in politics she determined to build a political war chest long and there are many indications over the years of her working towards this end of making this or that change in expressed as when running for the when sources of big money suggested another view would more acceptable she was anything but constant in the views she embraced because when she ran for the senate she spent record amounts of embarrassingly large amounts in her years of speaking she aimed at special interests who could supply potentially far more money than just exorbitant speaking fees in the appointed post of secretary of as it into personal contact with every head of government or international unquestionably played an aggressive pay for play with them all covering up that embarrassing and illegal fact is what the private servers and unauthorized smart phones were all about a second big fact of the election is that both major political parties are rather sick and fading the republican party has been broken for a very long time it hobbled along for some decades with the help of various hoping to expand its constituency with rubbish like family public prayer and catering to the and burning constitutional and now it is truly out of gas that is precisely why a political outsider like oligarch trump could manage to hijack the party he was opposed by boring men like seeking to secure an almost inherited and a intensely phony fundamentalist like and it proved to be no contest it was a remarkable political but i think it was only possible given the sorry state of the party the republican party had been given a some new by in the he had an extremely mixed record as but he was held in some and did have a clear but his effect on the party was not lasting trump could be seen as another but i think the comparison is superficial trump literally hijacked the and he was not deliriously crowned by its establishment the press was too busy attacking him from the start to take notice or do any intelligent and he was attacked precisely for the potential damage to the establishment he represented his most promising quality is his potential for creating a new coalition of interests and one excluding the continuation of the wars vigorously embraced and would expand but the democratic party is in serious too it has a great deal of internal as the material from the clearly shows us lack of ignorance of the people it has always claimed to bad and the absolute prostrate worship of money are the major symptoms the material tells us about many internal including harsh judgments of resentment over the character of daughter who is said to resemble in her behavior and and the belief of some that just should not have run she had become for many a rather figure from whom absolutely nothing spectacular in politics or policy could possibly be expected but they not only blindly supported they broke all their own party rules by internally and secretly working to defeat a legitimate and viable sanders sanders might well have been able to win the election for the but their establishment was blind to the possibility and rejected his candidacy after there were bill and beckoning to their running well of money in it might be just as well that sanders was cheated out of the nomination he proved a weak individual in the giving in to just the forces he had claimed to oppose and leaving his enthusiastic followers completely let down he may well even have been secretly bribed by money from the since he bought a fairly expensive property not long afterward in any there he out on the supporting everything he ever opposed personified in men of that nature do not stand up well to generals and admirals and the heads of massive a quality
in the world so why did the us secretary of state john going to the south as us presidential elections were being held on and why was the news provided late in the game and as an unexpected one need to keep in mind that many us states allowed early so millions of had already cast their ballots they and perhaps too did not have to be in their home districts on polling or perhaps he did not want to wait in long lines like in places like where the number of polling stations were reduced to keep some categories from voting presumably john is not one of these and his vote would have been counted it will be remembered that stood for president against w and would have beaten him if he had won which he failed to do by only a few thousand votes so you would imagine a man of such experience and seniority would be out on the campaign trail for right until the polls close in the east of the which is when candidates traditionally claim victory or concede defeat but even in the country in he was considered so important that he had been sent to of all places the south pole while the rest of his party was hard campaigning for he was chilling it at the us facilities apparently looking into something to do with environmental policy which part of his job description last time anyone looked perhaps in he knew the election results that many are now claiming was a total all the poll results were wrong and the people had spoken in rejecting the status and all what and those who stand behind her stand for on a lighter no one knows the full extent of the us footprint in as it is all

cubs first baseman stepped up to the microphone during the world series rally in grant park and choked as he spoke about what it meant to be able to be on a team with the catcher who was a mentor to him and center fielder dexter fowler stood singing that silly the one that go cubs go cubs cubs are gonna win today it all really hit home for me as a cubs is full of things that bring us joy but carry unsavory aspects to them the cubs team is owned by tom a man who donated million to trump and bears a frightening resemblance to so much that one might think was his brother the cubs also signed a who served a suspension this year for domestic abuse cubs executives and city officials are responsible for some pretty rapid gentrification in the area of with that almost all of the cubs players had fun with each other and never let the pressures of folklore around curses defeat them that made the truly is where i my fathers name on the wall i had to squeeze it in near the brick live about seven blocks from field i went down there multiple times in the past week the day after they i went down to field to write my fathers name on the stadium wall and join thousands of other cubs fans in paying tribute to who died before they could see the cubs win a world series in the immediate hours after their sweet i took my life into my own hands and went down to the area around and to snap a photo of the stadium sign with world series champions emblazoned on right before game down in the i stood outside the friendly confines and said to to my even though i really believe in this kind of this was going to be the game where they turned it all around that they could still come back i bought a copy of the after each even the editions with the devastating headlines on game and game because it was important to have the full story i can now put those papers and forever see the journey the cubs took and relive the and euphoric moments that took seismic sports the longest championship drought in sports me like so many other it taught once the importance of slowing down life and reveling in these kind of experiences which i know is easy for me to say i did not have a who told me i had to work a night shift or else i would be fired i did not have to worry about what i was going to do to feed my children or prevent my home from being foreclosed i did not have to be concerned about an array of disadvantages people should not have to confront on a daily but all too often we just and lose sight of those little things that can make us feel a bit more content in life or we reject slowing down to appreciate something amazing that magnificently disrupts our during an election that has smothered and shaken many of the perfect antidote was watching this team play baseball players like let their guard down and made themselves vulnerable in front of us they were on a world where they perhaps may have thought they needed to maintain a level of toughness or masculinity on the other as he now famously told during game was an emotional and he did not seem to be ashamed of making that of us were emotional wrecks everyone watching this series felt like emotional wrecks at some point not everyone watched all moments of the unless you happened to be in the select group of people that possibly had tickets to all the never forget how told it was only going to get worse in the inning he was right the tied the game in the acrobatic second baseman had a mishap with a bunt that could have been costly in the and fans had to bow their heads and hope would not make a even though manager clearly overworked him the past few outside field of banks by weather went from great to pouring rain there was a delay that delay gave the team a kind of a bit of a halftime to find their composure to go out and win in the inning was suggested during the rally that this may have been a gift from legendary shortstop and first who was cub legendary third baseman who later became a radio broadcaster the emotional stepped up to the microphone during the rally and gave this very real and human tribute to a grandpa who played his last game on and i sat down a few years ago in an before his last season with he was a free and we just shared we had the same agent were and i say to my this is what the cubs need he is exactly what we need to bring everything together a lot of pieces came through with but he taught myself personally how to become a real winner hes like a brother to back hes taught me a lot in the off the how to be a better person forever grateful for him hes going out a champion forever for the rest of his he can say the last game that he played hes a world to me is what has made these past moments special the fact that it took so very long for the team to finally win a baseball championship means all generations were brought together sons and daughters know their parents longed for and many of them have who longed to see what happened if those parents are still their parents were ecstatic to have lived to see a cubs world shared stories about their first games they games they want to and games they saw with
more than a few feel that as long as they can provide and basic medical needs for themselves and their nothing more is required other may feel that self power and machine repair are skills that will be required in the post crisis world many and also tend to ignore or underestimate the need to have a computer that can be used to help make it easier to survive in all these are also the people most likely to have serious problems in the post crisis world because they do not have a computer available to help meet a range of goals computers and prepping can get along a computer cannot hunt a deer for boil or make a pair of obviously on the other any computer with a connection to the can help you find out how to do these things and much more when you find good it is also very easy to store those files on your computer so that you can read them and work with them whenever you want and if you are in a situation where access is still you can use your computer to contact friends and loved ones as well as people that might be able to help you get through a crisis then you can certainly relate to the quandary of many that are finding out it is becoming impossible to make or obtain raw materials that would be needed in a major crisis scenario on the other side of the many of the items you need for basic prepping can still be purchased all you really need is a prepaid debit card and an connection so that you can find websites where you can place your orders not only will you be able to get the supplies you you will also have a much wider selection of other goods to choose from regardless of whether you are interested in the best quality gun cleaning need a certain type of fishing or need good quality vintage hand you can find them all in even if you are you may be able to find customized materials and tools that have been modified to meet your needs most people realize just how important it is to network with from diverse geographic regions and make plans for bugging out that include those friends and connections consider what would happen if an earthquake or hurricane strikes your area if you only have friends and family in a or small chances are everyone will be affected if you have friends in other states that might be able to offer temporary shelter or help you make a new then you will be well ahead of the game in these times and both money and barter systems are vital for exchanging needed goods and services a computer is very important for expanding your trade and marketing options it is also very important for securing alternative currencies that may play a vital role in remaining solvent in the face of currency collapse most people would be truly amazed at how easy it is for the average consumer to secure foreign keep a good supply of and even use them as down and dirty form of currency trading or flipping the tough choice on the best obsolete devices may still be very useful because certain older technologies are easier to work with and may be safer than newer devices that are routinely or are based on unstable hardware platforms if you are interested in newer here are some and models that you can start off with for each category of desktops if you are primarily interested in a conventional desktop my own experience leads me to believe the best option is to build the computer yourself so that you know exactly what parts are being used and how best to optimize the is where you can determine how fast the computer will whether or not the system can boot from a and other aspects of basic settings since modern computer chips tend to run it is very important to provide plenty of ventilation and cooling options inside the case if your and motherboard kit come with heat conducting do not hesitate to find the best on the market it is also very useful to add extra fans and other cooling devices right inside the case always the cooler you can keep the chips during the lower your chances of erratic or even ruining the chips insofar as other vital parts such as hard and video it truly depends on your personal tastes you will need a dedicated video card to gain access to these specialized chips that will reduce wear on the and enhance computer performance at the same time be sure to study gamer forums and video editing forums to find out which video cards work best with specific and motherboard combinations a bad fit between these parts can truly be a disaster memory cards are yet another yet vital area of the computer that you will need to think about this is also one area where only the best will do it is better to go with the fastest cards that the motherboard will and also from the best rated vendor laptops unlike desktop you will have far less control over what parts are found inside the case before purchasing a be sure to find out the model number of the and motherboard from you will need to look up the to find out what the optimal clock speeds are i have seen more than one laptop burn up at around the year mark because a mother board with a slower timing chip was paired with a faster since most buyers do not ask about the motherboard there was no way for them to find out that they basically had an system that was going to fail very quickly i can safely say that i recommend spending times as much money on a laptop when i can choose

news outlets already report losing by landslide news outlets already report losing by landslide posted by on subscribe in an unlikely and surprisingly early turn of news outlets across the country have reported that enough early votes have already come in to determine a winner in this making it the earliest call in history for future president of the united states of trump thanks to the incredibly fast processing power of computers in this day and early votes were counted in record time giving the an entire extra day to get ready for his imminent presidency the irony of an election called so and what trump would have said had it been called in favor about it being rigged is not lost on many local pig farmer and regional pie eating champion bacon said of the now how about that i was gonna go vote for but i suppose if its a lost cause ill just farm some extra pigs i know when beat and i see no reason to pretend it how it many analysts are perplexed by the incredibly early voter turnout in favor of citing that poll numbers just seem to match up i guess trump supporters are just a bunch that keep their opinions to said an economist and predictor of both baseball and elections we just have seen this coming to be honest with lost a lot of money and am going to have quite a bit of egg on my face when i get into the office tomorrow even if every person that voted yet in the country rushed out and voted right this could still not possibly meaning those of us that voted can just sit back and relax especially trump supporters when reached for comment about the trump had few saying now that won not going to just sit back and rest on my laurels going to get out there and start doing my damnedest to make great just like i promised
by on future now rests in the hands of a man older than the supreme leader of celebrate in the streets of the coastal city of after election of former general as president the news come as much of a surprise in the end presidential posters with face were already being hung around east before the results had even been released but now its has finally elected a new a and former military was elected on making him the ending a political vacuum in the top post that had left now takes the reigns of a country heavily plagued by a massive refugee overload with refugees from various practically public constant threat of war from their southern and bomb attacks from terrorists interestingly this is the second time that has been announced the president to when he and the military government of east appointed itself in and anyone who dared disputed this was met with which did eventually occur even went on to fight a war of liberation against the army forces stationed in during which ended in failure and forced to flee his native land into exile in the man behind the poster is by his to be a strong leader with a military background who knows how to play the political field to achieve his goals on the other most i have spoken to about have offered plenty of negative feedback even from people who i assumed would throw their full support behind the old boy an overall slippery character who has been lucky enough to pick the right partners since his return to after his exile i have to the side of my personality that appreciates dark comedy chuckled at the picture of president sitting in the big chair of the presidential palace with just the slightest whisper of a cheeky smile on his face the last time held the the army under the authority of pictured at the presidential palace in being elected president of president of bombed him out in a attempt to illuminate a stubborn nationalist troublemaker yet years son of offered his personal congratulations to on his election victory just president also shares my dark which would explain his sly smirk while he sat in his prize seat despite all the he has returned to and claimed what he had always the presidency carries with him a considerable amount of political baggage from a long career full of civil war and side switching which has left many in questioning if this lord of war is the man worth appointing to end the political stalemate which some have suggested would be better off remaining politically frozen instead of appointing a man who has fought against the administration in during the late but now fully backs and in this is a totally understandable stance given the lack of honest candidates available in the fact remains that has been left completely disabled by the political deadlock which is pushing the country to the brink i personally agree with the progressive socialist party and leader who said on twitter prior to the vote that its time to elect any president to escape the presidential vacuum why elect i have a growing concern that behind closed doors some very egotistical and conniving millionaires are beginning to see the massive potential gas wealth just sitting off the coast but political class has been far too busy infighting among themselves to invest in steps towards harvesting and selling gas also have their eyes on this untapped wealth lying below the perhaps this could be why so many old adversaries of have decided to suddenly put an end to their refusal to back ally for who is smart enough to see this type of opportunity on the horizon and just about desperate enough to surrender his staunch opposition to candidacy in return for inclusion in any future plans given recent bad luck with his struggling business in i put it past him who is still eagerly perusing the trial and conviction of what he believes where who at news beside former prime minister after announced that he will back to become president assassinated his is now willing to throw his vote to candidate in order to secure the position for the second as prime minister certainly there are many more aspects to consider in what has been a leading up to yesterdays grand finale but i suspect that political godfathers are smart enough to realize they are sitting on a potential trillion dollar money maker is at risk of being high jacked if they continue pussyfooting around over never sectarian feuds what could during my last trip to i was shocked to see how even the average struggle with the lack of basic services the country is a mess and the only institution that is worth any praise is the army that has coped remarkably well under the strains of constant terror attacks from radical terrorists the rise of regional sectarianism and a huge lack of money equipment the proxy of dictator who fought a long bloody war against is now considered the candidate who confirms an political victory over its competitor for political influence in what has largely held the country back is the fact that has been stuck in a vicious game of between refusal to pick a side has left the country empty handed with no vision of a safe future has a desperately needed arms deal with a pathetic blaming the deal cancellation on a statement made by foreign minister happens to be who refused to accept a statement referring to as a terrorist group the produced statement patriarch president of also demanded all league members to condemn which both refused to do in previous attempts to remain has also refused to accept any or offers to provide free arms deliveries to the army in order not to upset the

to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on their empathetic feelings instead of the law judges are elected and wrote justice tom parker this week federal as recently noted by chief justice in his dissent in v hodges a case in which five lawyers on the united states supreme court announced a fundamental right to are unaccountable and unelected he pointed out that three of the four dissenting supreme court justices in noted on eight different occasions that the five lawyers who decided were unelected chief justice said on two occasions that those unelected five lawyers unaccountable parker previously commented that the five lawyers failed to base their decision on legal the courts own or the rule of but upon empathetic is the product of unelected and unaccountable he said he was arguing over a decision by the state court on its next move in a case brought by chief justice who was suspended for his actions regarding a case that the court was reviewing when the which created marriage was announced who is challenging the insisted that the state court justices who previously were involved in his case recuse themselves they with the exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear arguments parker said active judges should have been included in the because retired are unelected and unaccountable unelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their instead of faithfully applying the rule of parker warned is not the first case concerning marriage to prove this principle true before the united states supreme court decided the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the united states miss now available autographed at the who killed the before states passed laws affirming traditional marriage in of those the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional of the state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional each of the courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus he explained what happens when activist judges are held to citing the situation that developed in the supreme court of was one of the unelected courts that struck down traditional marriage law as unconstitutional the judges of the supreme court of are appointed by the governor of although the judges are initially they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires he explained that after the legislature adopted marriage as in in a decision largely viewed as judicial the supreme court of unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of and held unconstitutional the very next three of the judges who had concurred in had to stand for a retention all three were removed from office by vote of the people of this was the first time since adopted its system that any judge had ever failed to be retained the people of held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law chairman of of liberty which is representing said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial systems handling of case chief justice is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive equal justice under the law he wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of he said the people of have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable at every this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired we hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution the court of the judiciary violated the law when it suspended chief justice for life even though it lacked the vote never before under the unanimity requirement of rule has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term a judge gets six months and a judge who writes a order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life this is not right supporters of also have filed an ethics complaint against who has been acting as chief justice she is accused of violating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding chief justice the complaint comes from the sanctity of marriage organization if the judicial inquiry commission really cares about fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the they will no doubt take our complaint as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on chief justice said tom a spokesman for the group the the group outline how acting chief justice has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of failed to perform the duties of her office failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary parker was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary senior editor at conservative told that the nation is going through a social transformation without

the hard working vs the government parasite by on which lifestyle choice produces better results being a hard working or being a government when you look at the hard numbers they may just surprise you in we deeply penalize hard work and we greatly reward government dependence if you live in a very liberal area of the country and you know how to game the it is entirely possible to live a comfortable existence without ever working too much at all in there are some that have been living off of government benefits for decades many of these people actually plan their lives around doing exactly what they need to do to qualify for as many benefits as possible is rapidly turning into a socialist welfare state and it is destroying our nation socially and financially ever since the war on poverty began our debt has absolutely exploded and yet now there are more poor people in this country than ever before obviously something is not working now get me wrong i deeply believe in having compassion for those that are going through tough times and having a safety net for those that cannot take care of themselves we should not have a single person in this nation going without food or sleeping in the streets but in today it is absolutely ridiculous how many people are climbing aboard the safety net at this an astounding percent of all live in a home that receives some form of government benefits so who pays for all of the people that drag themselves out of bed and go to work each day pay for it all for a few lets examine how the lifestyle of a typical hard working compares to the lifestyle of a government parasite in the median yearly household income is somewhere around about half of all households make more than that and about half of all households make less than that when you break it it comes to about a month so how far does go in it go very far at all first of a hard working family will need some place to live the vast majority of the decent jobs are near the big and it is more expensive to live near the big cities lets assume that an average family of four will spend about a month on rent or on a mortgage payment the government on the other has a whole host of state and local housing programs to take advantage of during the recent economic more than ever have been turning to the government for help with housing costs for federal housing assistance outlays increased by a whopping percent between and once you have a place to you have to provide power and heat for it for the average hard working this is going to probably average about a although this can vary greatly depending on where you live for the government there are once again a whole host of government programs to help with this for income home energy assistance assists low income households in paying their home heating bills most average hard working are also going to need phone and service lets assume that the hard working family of four in our example is extremely thrifty and only spends a month for these services for the government cell phone service is not a problem as i have written about previously those that qualify can receive a free cell phone and free cell phone minutes every single month from the federal government in in some areas of the nation low income families can qualify for deeply subsidized home service in order to earn our hard working family is going to need to get to work in most both parents have decided to work these days so both of them will need cars lets assume that the family is very thrifty and that both cars were purchased used and that the car payments only total about a month the hard working family will also need auto insurance for the two vehicles lets assume that both parents have a great driving record and that they only pay a total of about a month for car insurance the cars will also need to be filled up with gasoline the average u s household spent on gasoline during but lets assume that our family is very careful and that they only spend about on gas each month so what about the government the government parasite does not need to go to so this expense can potentially be eliminated entirely but since most other things are paid for by the government or are deeply in many instances government parasites are actually able to afford very nice vehicles in a new bill gasoline assistance program has been introduced in congress that would give qualifying households money to help pay for gasoline assistance program act directs the secretary of health and human services to make grants to states to establish emergency assistance programs to pay eligible households for the purchase of gasoline a hard working family is also going to need health insurance we all know how expensive health insurance has become in health insurance costs have risen by percent since became president but lets assume that our hard working family has somehow been able to find an amazing deal where they only pay a month for health insurance for a family of four for the government health insurance is not needed if there is an the government parasite can just go get free medical care at any emergency room and of course there is always back in only one out of every was on one out of every is on and things are about to get a whole lot worse it is being projected that will add million more to the rolls so what about everyone has to the hard working family in our example is faced with an environment where food prices are constantly rising but paychecks
