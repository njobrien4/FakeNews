thousands of emails belonging to on raising questions how practical it is that any conclusive finding will be available or made by the in the few days left before the elections according to the it appears that federal agents are preparing to scour roughly 650 , 000 emails as we reported moments ago were discovered weeks ago on the laptop of to see how many relate to a prior probe of email as on the device suggests there may be thousands sent to or from the private server that the democratic nominee used while she was secretary of according to people familiar with the matter as the the review will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are emails between a close aide and the estranged wife of and state department how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the federal bureau of and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the email which officials call as we further reported earlier today the has had to await a court order to begin reviewing the because they were uncovered in an unrelated probe of and that order was delayed for reasons that remain unclear more stunning is just how many emails were found on computer and while one can only imagine the content of some of the more persona the writes that the latest development began in early when new officials notified the bureau 's that while investigating for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a they had recovered a laptop with 650 , 000 emails they were from the accounts of ms according to people familiar with the matter those emails stretched back years these people and were on a laptop that both and ms used and that had n't previously come up in the email probe ms said in late august that the couple were separating the had searched the computer while looking for child people familiar with the matter but the warrant they used did n't give them authority to search for matters related to email arrangement at the state department has denied sending explicit or indecent messages to the teenager as reported it appears that there are potentially tens of thousands of linked emails on in their initial review of the the showed many apparently in the that were either sent to or from the private email server at home that had been the focus of so much investigative effort for the senior officials decided to let the investigators proceed with a closer examination of the on the and report back to them the then connects the dots between how the emails were linked to the reopening of the despite and the vocal urges not to do so at a meeting early last week of senior justice department and a member of the departments senior staff asked for an update on the the people familiar with the matter said at that officials realized that no one had acted to obtain a these people said then instructed the email investigators to talk to the investigators and see whether the laptops contents could be relevant to the email these people said after the investigators the agents agreed it was potentially relevant was given an decided to go forward with the case and notified congress on with explosive results senior justice department officials had warned that telling congress would violate policies against overt actions that could affect an and some within the have been unhappy at repeated public statements on the going back to his first press conference on the subject in but wait it gets better recall that this is the same whose wife the wall street journal reported last week received in campaign funds in late 2015 from the political action committee of gov terry a longtime ally of the until he was elected governor in a foundation board member had supported in the hopes she and a handful of other democrats might help win a majority in the state giving more sway in the state capitol lost her race last and democrats failed to win their majority officials have said had no role in the email probe until he became deputy and there was no conflict of interest because by then his wife 's campaign was over which brings us to the second big the and how the made sure that particular probe never made the light of day at the same time as the server was being other investigations were under way within the and they have been the subject of internal debate for months early this four field and little collecting information about the foundation to see if there was evidence of financial crimes or according to people familiar with the matter the touches on something agents had picked up information about the foundation from an unrelated public corruption case and had issued some subpoenas for bank records related to the these people said so where did that trail apparently nowhere the field office was probing financial relationships involving before he became a foundation board these people said has denied any and his lawyer has said the probe is focused on whether he failed to register as an agent of a foreign entity the field office in new had done the most work on the foundation case and received help from the field office in little the people familiar with the matter said in officials made a presentation to the justice according to these people by all the meeting did n't go well some said that is because the present compelling evidence to justify more aggressive pursuit of the and that the career public integrity prosecutors in the room simply believed it was n't a very strong case others said that from the the justice department officials were icy and dismissive of the case was one of the weirdest meetings ever been one participant told others according to people familiar with the matter needless to the probe into the foundation faded but back to the according to a person familiar with the on a senior justice department official called to voice his displeasure at finding that new agents were still openly pursuing the foundation despite the department 's refusal to allow more aggressive investigative methods in the case said agents still had the authority to pursue the issue as long as they use those methods at this point a question did seek to defend or press on with a defenders in the agency said that following the he repeated the instruction that he had given earlier in the foundation agents were to keep pursuing the work within the authority they had others further down the chain of said agents were given a much starker instruction on the stand down when agents questioned why they allowed to take more aggressive they said they were told the order had come from the deputy others familiar with the matter deny or any other senior official gave such a instruction at this point the two into email and the foundation for agents who already felt uneasy about leaderships handling of the foundation the moment only deepened their these people said for those who felt the probe yet found significant evidence of criminal the leaderships approach was the right response to the facts on the ground things accelerated over the past two when in agents on the foundation case asked to see the emails contained on laptops that had been searched as part of the email but that request was rejected by prosecutors at the eastern district of new in those emails were given to the based on grants of partial immunity and meaning agents could only use them for the purpose of investigating possible mishandling of classified information some agents were dissatisfied with that and asked for permission to make a similar request to federal prosecutors in according to people familiar with the matter these people told them no and added that they could not go not long after that agents informed the bureaus leaders about the prompting disclosure to congress and setting of the furor that promises to consume the final days of a tumultuous campaign while much of the latest developments are or could have been inferred assuming more corruption within government the punchline is that the weeks if not months of upcoming work means that if wins the white she will likely do so amid at least one ongoing investigation into her inner circle being handled by officials who are deeply divided over how to manage such cases it also means that trump will be hounding for the remainder of the campaign as being the only

monarchy 's interests as reforming the prerogative or tax laws that might affect the duchy of for without the bill cannot be debated in parliament queen 's consent is exercised only on the advice of but its existence provides the government with a tool for blocking debate on certain subjects if bills are tabled by backbench rebels or the opposition it has been exercised at least 39 according to documents released under the freedom of information including instance the queen completely vetoed the military actions against bill in a private member 's bill that sought to transfer the power to military strikes against from the monarch to the guardian reported in 2013 she can create lords the queen has the power to appoint who can then sit in the upper house in legislative system like many other this is exercised only the advice elected government ministers she does n't have to pay tax she does the queen does not have to pay but she has been voluntarily paying income tax and capital gains tax since 1992 the queen has the power to form governments unlike the prime minister does n't literally sit on a throne rob the queen previously wielded the power to dissolve parliament and call a general but the parliaments act put an end to that in 2011 now a vote in the commons is required to dissolve parliament before a is up she does still play a part after an when she calls on the mp most able to form a government to do so this caused some worry ahead of this year 's general election it once looked as if the conservatives might not have a majority would be the largest and would try to form a government it was feasible that could form a despite having fewer by entering into a coalition with multiple other parties in this the queen would have been stuck between a rock and a hard place every she opens parliament with the queen 's which lays out the government 's plans but to give speech would arguably be to tacitly endorse his government while staying away would send the opposite message at one the times was told by sources that she planned to if failed to secure enough but the palace later had an sources confirmed she would lead even if there was a risk the speech would be overthrown the following week because the had failed to muster enough backing from smaller the times subsequently reported she has knights they no longer ride around on horseback wooing maidens with their tales of but still retains knights like they are appointed by the queen and she knights them personally knighthoods are typically given to figures who have made a particular

the present her with a list of nominees each year for her she is exempt from freedom of information requests all information about the royal family is exempt from freedom of information requests the exemption was made after a legal battle between the guardian and the government to have letters from prince sent to ministers made public the black spider memos were recently but the change means the same ca n't happen in the future she can ignore or overrule ministerial advice in constitutional while the overwhelming majority of the queen 's prerogative powers are devolved to her there is one exception that allows her to wield power herself only grave constitutional the sovereign can contrary to or without ministerial with no precedent in modern it 's not clear what would actually constitute but the possibility remains the queen holds the ability to fire the entire government as the head of state in the queen has certain powers over the government in for the queen 's representative in the country at the gov gen sir john fired the prime minister in response to a government shutdown appointed a who immediately passed the spending bill to fund the max fisher wrote in

new new saint and saint saint and the and all the above are commonwealth or former colonies the sovereign retains the position she holds in the united that of head of state as in this is largely a ceremonial role from day to day she 's the head of a religion queen ii is the head of the church of state religion first established after king henry viii split away from the catholic church in in the 16th century her formal title is defender of the faith and supreme governor of the church of and she also has the power to appoint bishops and archbishops as with many of her other this is exercised only on the advice of the prime who himself takes advice from a church commission an interesting side effect of this is that the sovereign must be a confirmed member of church of england catholics and those of other religions may not ascend to the throne if prince converted to for he would be unable to become king after queen ii dies she gets to give away special money to the elderly money is a special kind of silver coin the queen gives away to pensioners every year at a cathedral every easter in a special ceremony the number of recipients corresponds with the sovereign 's age this for she will be 89 when easter rolls so she will give money away to 89 pensioners the coins are technically legal despite coming in unconventional and denominations but given the rare they tend not to enter general circulation she 's also immune from prosecution all prosecutions are carried out in the name of the and she is both immune from prosecution and cannot be compelled to give evidence in court in

donate those of you that care about about the about the beauty of queer sexual about indigenous lands and their right to and about policing practices that have led to the deaths of many black men and how do we respond to this confusing what do we do how do we by let us acknowledge these difficult feelings of these terrifying thoughts that are suddenly very alive in the air today it is as if box has not only been emptied out into the but that it has been and spread out to the corners of all lands hope now seems in short supply we are undone i write you because things have indeed fallen apart while this unspeakable insurgency of despair might goad us into rushing into the next organizational moment the itch to hit them back or do something i want to invite us to slow down and pay attention to the stark grief that haunts us now she stares us in the this repulsive visitor if we must we must return her gaze and let her do her important work with us i am a living in but like most people on the planet that tuned in to the surrealism of the 2016 presidential i woke up to the shocking news that trump was not only beating on election but that there was a frightening possibility he could win and then that distant once laughably out of the became a blue wall fell to the man who promised to build the media people stuttered as their once pristine cast of glossy pundits groped for the peso fell and in one fell it felt like the home of the brave was exactly that a place dyed in where braveness would now be required to keep on living ever since trump became the 45 th president of the united the has been flooded with articles attempting to make sense of this moment politico published a piece with a title that must have resonated with many people around the how did everyone get it so the independent insisted that trump would have lost us election if sanders had been the while frank opined on the pages of the guardian that trump is moving to the white and liberals put him there across the fractured landscape of also surprised by their fortune laughed at mocking the that thought an admittedly troubled candidate who seem to have a message beyond insisting on her entitlement would simply waltz into the white house i will not attempt to pry open the cadaver of this moment it is probably the case that no analysis is good enough to assuage our feelings of shock what happened is not reducible to a single causative factor or a decidable active ingredient the world that simple i will however in the spirit of full disclosure the kind of radical honesty we probably need at this time that i secretly wanted this to i was so invested in the idea of a sanders presidency so mortified by what was obvious to me as an attempt to stifle his that i became possessed by a i easily exorcise i understood the dangers of a potential trump but decided even that was better off to the inertia of the status quo as embodied by a regime that argument is not easily maintained in the face of the orange predicament we now find ourselves in in an case of be careful what you wish i find not relief but a painful sympathy with many who had hoped that the morning of 9 th would somehow usher in a more tolerant a more beautiful country a country that cares about its many and contours now because of trump and the energies he has minorities are probably less safe at a time of unprecedented racial tensions and phallic exhibitions of some folks are already dreading their next brief visit to the shopping knowing that the streets are now being painted red with white with racial acrimony and blind and blue with the authoritarian aloofness of a candidate who promised law and order the new it is to these vulnerable ones i write those of you that care about about the about the beauty of queer sexual about indigenous lands and their right to and about policing practices that have led to the deaths of many black men and women without trump or falling into the trap of disillusioned punditry and yet with a keen awareness of the likely consequences of his presidency i how do we respond to what do we how do we what opportunities are presenting themselves to us to work for a caring at the time of writing this there is news of revolt on the streets of new and other cities people are protesting the rise of trump people are angry around this same famed has suggested concerned should fire the punditry and take over the democratic party it is impossible to answer the question of what a right response or to speak as if one is situated outside the swirl and flow of things i do however want to invite you to try doing something less spectacular something for it is my opinion that with the seeds of a new politics may yet be planted when i was growing up in i was taught to think of my life only in terms of its greatness quotient i was conditioned early to yearn for prominence fame fortune legacy success awakening the giant within getting to the top lasting forever those were resonant in my developmental years the figures of bill jack and were placed before me as aspirational objects if i did not do all i can to increase my greatness my life did not really matter i suspect this story is not uniquely mine to tell we live in a world that places priority in the top and discountenances the bottom the condition for living a life of meaning and purpose was moral the stunning city of bigness only admitted those who walked the straight and narrow i was told if all that held true 8 was a spectacular repudiation a humble and one who had said awful things about attained the highest office in his face beamed on to the empire state building in new amidst the pomp and pageantry that defined his life the joker won and nothing adds up anymore punditry is broken polls are broken the firepower of celebrity is broken virtue is broken trump strolled to the grand stage up in the front and wrecked but in so doing he inadvertently gave us permission to inhabit the aisles to rearrange the entire room by becoming trump disturbs the idea that the top is worth reaching not because he is so vile that his new position as president denigrates the but because his unprecedented campaign and quest for power shakes us loose to recognize that where we stand is a thick sewn through and through with voices and potential and power the stunning revelation of these times of upheaval is that winning is and new relational modes are desperately the red the raised the grand the green and the white house are not the glorified objects they once were the emperor has lost his clothes this whole idea that greatness is some end goal to be achieved by the morally the and the has itself been reworked and we are left with an awkward coming to terms with the fact that life a highway but an ecology of small things and ordinary becomings the way forward is thus awkward or there is no clear algorithm on what to do now except among other to pay close attention to these twists and these rabbit holes and tricky terrains to take a critical look at the material details of our lives outside of the lenses of identity politics an immaculate straight line was never there to begin with we are left with these small lives the media pretends really matter until you achieve celebrity we are left with the first stuttering words of a politics that invites us to the of our small and in place of our fascination with distant power and things urges an attention to our our our our hidden our own and our own knowings let me spell it out what i suggest we can do please understand that i do not offer these points with any confidence in their stability or with any sort of finality i offer them sensing that this moment could very well be that bright spot in the middle of a affording us an opportunity to a politics that does not terminate with concession speeches a politics that is not tied so stubbornly to single candidates and anorexic voting lines i sing the songs of other places of embrace the fact that the world is larger than our the plot of a story is both its gentle guiding hand and its suffocating helping it move along but also blinding it from realizing that life is and more promiscuous than its logic i could have sworn that with sanders the world was finally stepping into an age of deeper justice and beauty that evolutionary moment we all await his failure to clinch the nomination was a chastising moment for many keen followers of the primaries i slowly came to terms with the fact that the world is not beholden to my liberal fantasies simply the map is not the terrain the world stretches far and wide beyond our blind our and our convictions about what justice looks like let grief do her society hardly has any place left for grief when we get we are urged to pull ourselves together and get back on the wheel i reckon that todays grief has something to teach there is a genius to its workings that allow a shift in how we relate with the world i do not mean that we should all sit down and hold hands i do however feel we can acknowledge that we are in a and adjourn the quest for a palliative solution for the time being perhaps instead of counting down to or calling on to run for we can use these days to investigate the edges of our politics i believe grief disciplines us for this slow kind of work what is at stake here is more than a liberal it is how we see the world and therefore how we maintain power structures that no longer serve our fondest hopes at least for the nurture a suspicion for shiny objects we have become a photogenic people attracted to the repulsed by the unseemly we live in cosmetic pixels with televised news that seems more committed to graphics and bloated and the ongoing digitization of our lives have been reduced to images and we are forgetting the art of living in the spaces between those images we are thus habituated to a regime of that defines what is real to us and other voices from mattering perhaps the reason why most people were shocked by the news of trumps win was because they were contained by narratives and material conditions that forced a certain view about but then the terrain met the map we need a new set of eyes find the when things we are afforded an opportunity to make reconfigurations this perhaps is a good time to investigate the contours of our relationships with with those we with our with the strangers who breeze past us in a blur of politics is premised on fixed identity categories that democrats and republicans are essentially two aspects of an adversarial binary to a large each side sees the other as a noxious blight on the face of the country the first moments of healing this divide is the recognition that even evil has a that those persons who hate black or curse at the just spring out from the fully realized and fleshed out in a sense that often escapes we are hyphenated aspects of each other none of us is on the side of good trump and the people that support him are just as much a product of the same economically politics that have created us in a game of the greatest loss we suffer is the other side let us leave room for the for the and for the unexpected we are not as sorted out as we think we are notice the ground upon which you i like to say that falling could very well be without the tyranny of coordinates technically falling objects are actually the gravitational pull of attraction between objects i wont succumb or insist we are being ushered into a more glorious paradigm of politics i cannot make that claim there are however sympathies between place and between our stories and our that call on us to participate in the sacredness of where we are what attracts you what questions matter to what performances of place are pressing themselves upon what do you do every where do you come does that question make a put this sentiment this remember the earth remember your ancestors remember your crawling relatives remember life your your way of that is the only activism ever had use it make your existence a ritual that honors everything your body and words touch the times are troubled and you are needed wake the consequence of every action and you are needed you are needed you are needed the confusion about what to do next is redemptive if you are still confused about what this all how anyone could vote for what the future holds and how to respond to this of count yourself among the lucky ones confusion and uncertainty are how multiple agencies negotiate directionality and this ongoing process is important even inertia determinately still we must slowdown in these times of and allow other forces to reshape us it might be the case that within the specificity of your own you know what to do thats great march on the streets print learn how to plant your own food investigate your ancestry or open a gift shop and invite to get free hugs out of the logic of our new moments are distilled and new activisms become possible we must be humble enough to recognize that the right thing to do is almost always known in and that justice is always small lives beat yourself up for not saving the day even if some archaic policy were conjured by the white annulling trumps it still do much to address the politics that made him happen the fight is not so much with trump as it is for a new way of meeting our own selves a way of speaking with those we consider other than us in we must turn to each for it is in the smallness of our embrace that new worlds burst into life all would it have been great to have a woman yes that would have assured many of their place in the world and told them that they are valued and needed and worthy of love and that message finds a more interesting home now that we have lost our way now that hope seems faraway the politics that knocks on our doors right now have to wait for the next four years let your campaigns of sacred enlivenment continue
mysterious universe do other realities brush up against our are there parallel dimensions lying just beyond through some untraceable veil separating the idea of parallel realities beyond our own is not yet what if this phenomenon were to come bursting forth from the realm of theory and speculation and come crashing down into the are there perhaps some people who have stepped over that barrier into domains we have not yet to see and which we may indeed not even be meant to i have covered such alleged excursions into the horizon beyond our known reality here at mysterious universe before and here i will revisit this topic with a selection of other cases that seem to imply the possibility that not only are parallel dimensions but that they are destinations to which we can be whisked whether intentional or not in the 1956 issue of fate magazine there was the curious story of a woman who apparently shifted into another parallel universe in 1934 according to the in the fall of that year a woman by the name of golding had a profoundly unusual experience while riding an elevator with her in the elevator was and when made a mistake and got off at the wrong floor she found that she could not push her way back in past the throng of people and resigned herself to waiting for the next one that was when she looked around and was startled to realize that she was no longer in the store at but rather an expansive train station the enormous railway station she found herself in was allegedly bustling with fevered with throngs of travelers rushing to their trains and booming announcements of arrivals and departures echoing through the air there seemed to be no way this busy place could have any connection whatsoever to the music store she had been in moments before the confused made her way to an information booth to ask where she but found that the woman working there completely ignored as if she there at all followed a series of signs pointing the way to the street and she emerged out into a sunny afternoon that seemed to be in the midst of summer rather than in a place that was most certainly not she wandered about in confusion and noticed that everyone around her seemed to completely ignore her and walk on by as if they did not even see her at some point she claims that she saw a confused looking boy standing in the sidewalk similarly being passed on by people who seemed to have no idea he was even and approached him wondering what was going on the boy was able to actually see and respond to and looked in her the first time anyone had acknowledged her presence in this surreal place as she the boy seemed equally relieved that he was visible to smiled slightly and purportedly i guess they let you off at the wrong too the two lost people walked together down the street in the whole time completely ignored by those around and the boy told of what had happened to him he claimed that he had been playing tennis in in the united and had gone to the locker room to change his shoes when he had gone back to the courts to play some more he had found that the tennis courts that had been there moments before were now gone and in their place was a huge train which had turned out to be the exact same station into which had enigmatically entered from the elevator the two allegedly kept on walking until they reached an open area that led to and over the waves they could apparently make out a sand bar with several women upon it chatting and seeming to act as if nothing was beyond the ordinary to one of the women was oddly her sister the women out on the sandbar seemed to notice them and began waving and shouting to and her companion this encouraged the boy to try and make a swim out to the which did not seem so far and which he was confident he could reach yet even though he was a good swimmer it seemed that no matter how much he tried and pushed against the he was unable to draw any closer to the mysterious sandbar and he returned to shore in frustration it was then that the sandbar supposedly suddenly vanished into thin air closed her eyes in and and then was overcome by the sensation of floating through space after some time of this odd feeling of hovering in darkness she claimed that she suddenly opened her eyes to find herself sitting atop a stool in the music store in which seemed to be in the process of closing for the suggesting that she had been there for at least several hours looked around for her but could not find him and decided to head back to his home when she her was noticeably relieved and explained that he had lost her in the store and had waited for her to come to the right floor for a few hours before deciding to go back home the whom had seen on the mysterious sandbar claimed that she had seen in town and had even called out to but that she had been too absorbed in talking to a young boy to notice her where did go during that why should she see her sister on a sandbar while the sister had seen her in all while they could not reach across to were they separated by strange barriers we do not and may not ever it is a mystery another strange article in the 1959 issue of fate magazine tells of the weird experience of a e of who in 1935 was traveling home with her husband and four children from a weekend trip to on the way they noticed what looked like a scenic detour in the area of st and they whimsically took driving along the quiet scenery until they reached the rim of an expansive valley in addition to the picturesque scenery was the rather odd sight of several women in sun bonnets and long skirts and aprons busily pulling water from a well into simple wooden buckets and carrying them off on wooden poles balanced across their shoulders there were men here as who all had beards and wore similarly clothes such as smocks and large black and who were tending flocks of sheep and goats or collecting firewood enamored with the charming they later asked locals what the settlement yet were told that no such place had ever existed convinced that it did indeed and her husband returned to the area several times but could find no sign of the valley they had seen or its unusual suggesting that either the family or the place they had visited had been temporarily transported over some little understood thin spot between realities in another similarly strange road story from a r w and his wife were driving to lake from their home in live the couple stopped at a quaint restaurant nestled away off of highway 50 a few miles from they had never noticed the restaurant there before in all of their years of traveling along the same even though it seemed from its rustic look to have been there for and they decided to stop there for a bite to eat the food was described as being surprisingly good and the service was cordial and so they decided that they would visit again on their return trip from lake they attempted to seek out the charming little restaurant to eat there but when they arrived at the location it was reportedly gone as if it had never been there at all the couple supposedly spent three more weekends traveling through the area in an effort to find the restaurant that they were convinced was but never found it again did and his wife travel to a parallel universe for no one knows an intriguing case of a mysterious doorway to another dimension and perhaps even through time itself occurred in when a treasure hunter by the name of ventured with his brother chuck and some friends into the remote and rugged mountains of southeastern looking for mysterious lost treasures and gold mines the case begins with high strangeness and only gets more bizarre as it goes on three weeks into their the treasure hunters set up camp one and that evening they were surprised to see two large balls of bluish green light floating about in the starry sky the bewildered campers determined that these were not flares of any nor any sort of known aircraft the weird balls of light hovered about for several minutes before vanishing behind some mountain peaks the next the same phenomenon was witnessed again when they mentioned the strange lights to a local cowboy named he informed them that the unexplained lights were a recurring phenomenon in the and had been seen as far back as 1939 the group would spot the strange lights several more times over the course of their excursion and chuck at one point during their the group passed by what looked like a stone which stood out as something of an anomaly upon the looking decidedly out of yet they think much of it until when they spoke to a native local named who claimed that the archway had long been surrounded by strange stories and rumors that anyone who entered the doorway never came and that objects thrown in would not emerge from the other earning the structure the name doorway of the gods there were also stories of the archway and of strange figures lurking around it dressed in old fashioned clothing that did not seem to be as they disturbed the gravel where they stepped and cast yet they would suddenly vanish there were also tales of camps near the archway that had been mysteriously abandoned and of prospectors who had never returned from the area john relayed his own tale of strangeness concerning the claiming that one dark and stormy day he had visited it and peered through it to see although the scenery was the the sky was oddly clear and blue on the other side when he looked around the edge of the the clouds were once again dark and hanging menacingly over the and the bizarre sight with its contrasting views frightened him enthralled with these odd and his group went back through the perilous rocky terrain to find the mysterious archway and investigate it they managed to locate the strange looking structure once and upon closer inspection it proved to be surrounded with an unusually large deposit of some of which were broken open with their interiors glittering in the sun the archway itself was measured as being around 7 feet high and 5 feet with columns of 15 inches diameter and it stood beside a rocky slope after checking it the team went to work testing out the weird stories by throwing various rocks through the but the rocks all mundanely fell to the ground on the other side and there was no sign of anything remotely mysterious whatsoever increasingly some of the members of the team boldly put their arms through without although no one was willing to try stepping all the way through after around an hour of they departed no closer to understanding the supposed mystery of this location a weird series of events would unfold in the coming days that would make them think that something strange was going on chuck with some of the geodes from the site one day as they were checking out the portal yet again and collect some of the and another member of the noticed that the stone portal seemed to be shimmering as if simmering in intense even though it was a cold day the odd shimmering allegedly lasted a few during which time both men claimed that they could feel a building pressure within their before the shimmering and the weird physical sensation slowly ebbed away the inexplicable event spooked both of especially who vowed never to go anywhere near the archway again on another the group came across another group of three treasure hunters who claimed that they had also camped out near the mysterious stone portal the group claimed that that evening their camp had been hit by what sounded like rain hitting their even though it was a clear night looking out of their they were met with the sight of reddish brown pebbles around the size of a pea falling in great numbers from above the pebbles were found to be warm to the touch and there was no explanation for where they came from they had seemed to be made of some king of iron ore all of these escalating odd occurrences would point to something decidedly strange going on at the but the most bizarre incident would happen years after the expedition was over four years after that fateful treasure on chuck was compelled to make a personal trip to the site of the stone portal that had eluded their and arrived at the canyon that led up to the slopes that would lead up to the site chuck went about climbing up the rocky slopes towards the stopping for a breather about halfway up the harrowing climb it was here as he looked out west over the majestic scenery all around him that he noticed that there was a canyon that should not have been there he made his way back down the slope to enter from the and it was here that he realized that in fact he was in the same canyon he had been in only he had somehow been transported 250 yards down the canyon he had hiked and to another slope that was facing south rather than west the strange event convinced him that indeed there was something strange going on and hastily left the scene was this some sort of doorway to another dimension or merely tall one wonders if perhaps some of the more bizarre vanishings and reappearances of people also have some form of shift at their core at about on august of woods simply vanished from her room in her home her parents had checked on her when she was sleeping one and the next she was gone without a trace when authorities arrived the house was searched top to and no signs of forced entry or a struggle could be found bed seemed to be in a peaceful with no sign of being disturbed in any kind of confrontation the window to the room was also closed and showed no signs of anyone coming in or going out that way an intensive search was immediately composed of hundreds of people including airmen from nearby air force and as well as the coast guard scouring the nearby yet absolutely no evidence of the missing girl could be found anywhere she had simply vanished off the face of the earth then at on that same very worried parents went into to her room to be startled by the sight of their missing daughter sleeping peacefully in her bed as if she had never been gone when she was asked about where she had the girl gave the cryptic response of not telling what in the world happened to this little how could a disappear from her elude an intensive search by various and then reappear fast asleep exactly where she had is this also perhaps an example of someone crossing through the veil between realities to pass temporarily into some parallel world or the only person who knows the answer to that is and shes not telling so are any of these accounts somehow anchored in any way to reality as we know are these the realm of the lost mind spinning fantastical tales either out of or an irrational attempt to make sense of distorted can this all simply be explained away somehow or is there a genuine phenomenon hinting at forces of the universe we have yet to comprehend buried within these disparate are we perhaps just one of many alternate realities stacked upon one another and which between shifting and travel are the answers are and we may continue to pour over and debate them forever however as long as there is the probability and possibility of worlds beyond our own there will always be those who look out into our or perhaps to seek to try to grasp just what this all might mean in the cases like this will remain a tantalizing peek into what just may be out there beyond our grasp to conceive of it
by brushing away the extreme claims and rhetoric of much election there are some observations which deserve attention these unfortunately mostly provide hard lessons and not a lot of encouragement for people who hold to principles of and the election demonstrated perhaps better than and better than has been generally been that a plutocracy it took a genuine a a man with a lifetimes economic to defeat a family which could provide the very definition of being politically a family which had laboriously constructed and carefully maintained a kind of deep well with money for their ambitions it was the well of drilled by bill with help from some extremely shady such as that made the keystone establishment figures in the democratic party it was not personal charm or exceptional political in his displayed some of both of earned the their it was the the mothers milk of politics in what is euphemistically called fund many hundreds of millions of dollars were provided for the party over the last couple of decades by bill efforts fully appreciated the fact that money buys power and influence she lacked bills superficial but she certainly more than shared his ambition on the charm when she was ready to move into running for she perhaps under bills a kind of forced clown face with arched and a smile as big as her lips would and these expressions were accompanied by little gestures such as briefly pointing to various or waving whenever she campaigned her gestures reminded me of something you might see atop a float in a parade or of the late at his most exuberant these were not natural for her they were never in evidence years ago when she spent years as a kind of bizarre executive both in a governors mansion and later in the white bizarre because she indulged her husbands predatory sexual behavior in exchange for the immense power it conferred on her behind the scenes over her far more and successful knew that gestures and simulated charm do not get you far in politics she determined to build a political war chest long and there are many indications over the years of her working towards this end of making this or that change in expressed as when running for the when sources of big money suggested another view would more acceptable she was anything but constant in the views she embraced because when she ran for the senate she spent record amounts of embarrassingly large amounts in her years of speaking she aimed at special interests who could supply potentially far more money than just exorbitant speaking fees in the appointed post of secretary of as it into personal contact with every head of government or international unquestionably played an aggressive pay for play with them all covering up that embarrassing and illegal fact is what the private servers and unauthorized smart phones were all about a second big fact of the election is that both major political parties are rather sick and fading the republican party has been broken for a very long time it hobbled along for some decades with the help of various hoping to expand its constituency with rubbish like family public prayer and catering to the and burning constitutional and now it is truly out of gas that is precisely why a political outsider like oligarch trump could manage to hijack the party he was opposed by boring men like seeking to secure an almost inherited and a intensely phony fundamentalist like and it proved to be no contest it was a remarkable political but i think it was only possible given the sorry state of the party the republican party had been given a some new by in the he had an extremely mixed record as but he was held in some and did have a clear but his effect on the party was not lasting trump could be seen as another but i think the comparison is superficial trump literally hijacked the and he was not deliriously crowned by its establishment the press was too busy attacking him from the start to take notice or do any intelligent and he was attacked precisely for the potential damage to the establishment he represented his most promising quality is his potential for creating a new coalition of interests and one excluding the continuation of the wars vigorously embraced and would expand but the democratic party is in serious too it has a great deal of internal as the material from the clearly shows us lack of ignorance of the people it has always claimed to bad and the absolute prostrate worship of money are the major symptoms the material tells us about many internal including harsh judgments of resentment over the character of daughter who is said to resemble in her behavior and and the belief of some that just should not have run she had become for many a rather figure from whom absolutely nothing spectacular in politics or policy could possibly be expected but they not only blindly supported they broke all their own party rules by internally and secretly working to defeat a legitimate and viable sanders sanders might well have been able to win the election for the but their establishment was blind to the possibility and rejected his candidacy after there were bill and beckoning to their running well of money in it might be just as well that sanders was cheated out of the nomination he proved a weak individual in the giving in to just the forces he had claimed to oppose and leaving his enthusiastic followers completely let down he may well even have been secretly bribed by money from the since he bought a fairly expensive property not long afterward in any there he out on the supporting everything he ever opposed personified in men of that nature do not stand up well to generals and admirals and the heads of massive a quality which i do think we have some right to expect trump to display another important fact about the election is that it was less the triumph of trump than the avoidance of that caused the defeat the numbers are unmistakable trump did well for a political newcomer and a very controversial but simply did not approaching the support achieved in key again something reflecting the documented fact that she is not a figure and the party blundered badly in running her but money and the particularly are the biggest they have had in our lifetime no one was ready to say no to the source of all that money to many the election result must seem a bit like having experienced something of a although a revolution conducted through any other kind being literally impossible by design in this massive state in a it does represent something of a revolutionary owing to the fact that trump the oligarch is in his political views a bit of a revolutionary or at least a dissenter from the prevailing establishment views as in any even a small there are going to be some unpleasant outcomes the historical truth of politics is that you never know from just what surprising source change may come crooked politician and the main author of the horrifying and pointless did more for the rights of black than any other modern president franklin son of wealthy establishment provided remarkable leadership in the great restoring hopes and dreams for millions never comes from establishments or institutions like political parties it always comes from unusual people who seem to step out of their accustomed roles in life with some good or inspired ideas and have the drive and toughness to make them a reality i have some limited but important hopes for trump i am not blind or delirious expecting miracles from this unusual and after the experience of who seemed such a promising young figure but fairly quickly proved a bloody i can never build up substantial hopes for any politician and what was the choice was a ticket to hell trump offers two areas of some and these both represent real change the first is in reducing close to military aggressiveness abroad this reflecting momentum from what can only be called the continued and grew under the weak and ineffectual leadership of and was boosted and encouraged by as secretary of state the feminists who weep for her should be did a lot of killing during her tenure she along with are literally responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of women and their many of them literally torn apart by bombs the other area of some hope is for the welfare of ordinary people themselves who have been completely ignored by national leaders for decades lame reaction to hurricane he was internationally shamed into some has become the normal pattern for national government when it comes to ordinary the truth is that the legacy of has withered to nothing and no longer plays any role in the democratic and of course never did in the republican party by i do not mean the kind of state assistance that bill himself worked to end nothing can impress someone not familiar with dark corners more than a visit to places like or or south parts of new or or dozens of other places where live in conditions in every way comparable to third world hellholes i mean the peoples general trumps approach will be through jobs and creating incentives for jobs i know whether he can just as he asked people in some of his what do you have to just having someone in power who pays any attention to the is a small gain people should never think of the as liberal or and that was just as much true for bill as it is for his record as from his embarrassing behavior in the oval office with a young female intern and his recruitment of secret service guards as procurers for women he found attractive on his morning actually pretty appalling in his own ended welfare as we know it he signed legislation which would send large numbers of young black men to prison he also signed legislation which contributed to the later financial collapse under bush he often would appoint someone decent and then quickly back leaving them when it looked like approval for the appointment would not be coming his conducted the assault on killing about eighty people needlessly a pharmaceutical plant in was destroyed by cruise missiles for no good reason there were a number of including the suicide of foster and the which were never fully explained to the public it was his secretary of who a television interviewers question about tens of thousands of children who died owing to we think its worth it he

of honor to have left the united states as a poor young man from the south side of when the country embarked on the pointless murder of something like 3 million in their own land because they happened

cubs first baseman stepped up to the microphone during the world series rally in grant park and choked as he spoke about what it meant to be able to be on a team with the catcher who was a mentor to him and center fielder dexter fowler stood singing that silly the one that go cubs go cubs cubs are gonna win today it all really hit home for me as a cubs is full of things that bring us joy but carry unsavory aspects to them the cubs team is owned by tom a man who donated million to trump and bears a frightening resemblance to so much that one might think was his brother the cubs also signed a who served a suspension this year for domestic abuse cubs executives and city officials are responsible for some pretty rapid gentrification in the area of with that almost all of the cubs players had fun with each other and never let the pressures of folklore around curses defeat them that made the truly is where i my fathers name on the wall i had to squeeze it in near the brick live about seven blocks from field i went down there multiple times in the past week the day after they i went down to field to write my fathers name on the stadium wall and join thousands of other cubs fans in paying tribute to who died before they could see the cubs win a world series in the immediate hours after their sweet i took my life into my own hands and went down to the area around and to snap a photo of the stadium sign with world series champions emblazoned on right before game down 3 1 in the i stood outside the friendly confines and said to to my even though i really believe in this kind of this was going to be the game where they turned it all around that they could still come back i bought a copy of the after each even the editions with the devastating headlines on game 3 and game because it was important to have the full story i can now put those papers and forever see the journey the cubs took and relive the and euphoric moments that took seismic sports the longest championship drought in sports me like so many other it taught once the importance of slowing down life and reveling in these kind of experiences which i know is easy for me to say i did not have a who told me i had to work a night shift or else i would be fired i did not have to worry about what i was going to do to feed my children or prevent my home from being foreclosed i did not have to be concerned about an array of disadvantages people should not have to confront on a daily but all too often we just and lose sight of those little things that can make us feel a bit more content in life or we reject slowing down to appreciate something amazing that magnificently disrupts our during an election that has smothered and shaken many of the perfect antidote was watching this team play baseball players like let their guard down and made themselves vulnerable in front of us they were on a world where they perhaps may have thought they needed to maintain a level of toughness or masculinity on the other as he now famously told during game was an emotional and he did not seem to be ashamed of making that of us were emotional wrecks everyone watching this series felt like emotional wrecks at some point not everyone watched all moments of the unless you happened to be in the select group of people that possibly had tickets to all the never forget how told it was only going to get worse in the 9th inning he was right the tied the game in the acrobatic second baseman had a mishap with a bunt that could have been costly in the and fans had to bow their heads and hope would not make a even though manager clearly overworked him the past few outside field of banks by weather went from great to pouring rain there was a delay that delay gave the team a kind of a bit of a halftime to find their composure to go out and win in the 10th inning was suggested during the rally that this may have been a gift from legendary shortstop and first who was cub legendary third baseman who later became a radio broadcaster the emotional stepped up to the microphone during the rally and gave this very real and human tribute to a grandpa who played his last game on and i sat down a few years ago in an before his last season with he was a free and we just shared we had the same agent were and i say to my this is what the cubs need he is exactly what we need to bring everything together a lot of pieces came through with but he taught myself personally how to become a real winner hes like a brother to back hes taught me a lot in the off the how to be a better person forever grateful for him hes going out a champion forever for the rest of his he can say the last game that he played hes a world to me is what has made these past moments special the fact that it took so very long for the team to finally win a baseball championship means all generations were brought together sons and daughters know their parents longed for and many of them have who longed to see what happened if those parents are still their parents were ecstatic to have lived to see a cubs world shared stories about their first games they games they want to and games they saw with their fathers or mothers they shared stories of players they remembered or recalled when they first put on a cubs baseball hat or wore a jersey with their favorite players name on the back i dug out a photo of me when i was a toddler wearing my cubs am 28 i waited 13 years for this because 2003 was the first where i really got into watching the cubs play and experienced what it meant to fail to end the drought when they lost to the marlins in the national league championship series that is a rather short time span when compared to legions of its a players game but for the its unique cubs baseball was essentially a fans much more so than other ball last two years of decisions by business executives were made for the fans the who went out and found these did it for the fans they recognized there were so many aging cubs who kept asking them on the street if they were going to live to see the cubs win a world series one of the executives who enabled this did not want to have to tell any more fans to take their vitamins when asked if this would be the with 103 wins in the regular season and the status of number one team in all too many fans were aware of the record for who came in to the on top and did not make it to the world series we also took note of the statistics for comebacks in the world series when teams were down 3 1 so few ever win not only three games in a row but three games in a including two on the put tremendous pressure on the cubs players they clearly felt and we thank them for putting up with millions of emotional fans process and revel in the fact that it happened would how we did not i think about what this means for next year for the first it is possible to watch the cubs without bringing a legacy of doubt and negativity to games there are no more goats there is no more there are no more distractions that are not typically part of baseball everyones favorite punchlines really work anymore they all are part of the and the immediate future is baseball with a team that will have some of the who won this championship and who will undoubtedly find ways to dazzle us again as they attempt to repeat as champions in a cubs fan pledged a day after signed with the team in to donate to a domestic violence organization every time he got a save her campaign managed to raise over especially when it took off after she shared it on told she thought during game we all compromised what we believed in to root for this and hes gonna blow it it shifted to a celebration cubs pitcher mike got his first career save and it was in game 7 of the world series she was happy did not get the glory and said it have been scripted and at the some of us fans looked up to see a plane with a banner that for trump go cubs i stood next to a who had some heritage in their ancestry she thought it must be a joke someone told her it was real they read something about this group of she said she was not all trump fans because owns our team only a small segment and they are the same kind of white men and women disconnected from who you will find in the of just about every sports team they would probably support trump whether was a cubs executive or governor and mayor were at the but they are both hot garbage neither took the stage to and i view that as some kind of small political victory that sweetens the victory over a baseball team with a sports which should be replaced immediately in lets conjure the curse of the racist mascot and say the cubs passed it on to them and prolong their championship drought until they replace chief maybe then the will get rid of post appeared first on
