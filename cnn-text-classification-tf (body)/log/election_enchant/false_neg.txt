in the to the presidential new city was hardly trump territory and every time put another display of trump campaign signs up on the lawn of his sizable white house on road in last they were stolen or knocked actions that would later set off a series of events as unpredictable as the election itself infuriated by the as well as an obscenity about j trump that had been on the public mailbox in front of his installed a security camera it captured a grainy image of a 59 and a real estate then printed fliers bearing the image and a reward offer for information leading to the arrest of the sign thief he hired some local teenagers to post the signs around the neighborhood with tape when the tape ran he the teenagers used a stapler to post the fliers to trees on the streets the hubbub made the and the stapling method was mentioned in the weeks that a team of enforcement officers from the parks department arrived at he and issued him 22 summonses with fines totaling and citing unauthorized posting and tree to 11 trees to his real transgression was supporting a which he claims annoyed democratic city officials call it said who calls himself a a proud gun owner and a fan of and john a supporter of democratic would never have been cited in this he and said that official parks department signs are often affixed to trees with similar staples in new city like he said wanted to teach me a lesson about being and about who i believe in so they found something to hang their hat said he paid the summonses because want the of fighting nor the expense of hiring a lawyer instead of backing he splurged on a larger trump banner to hang in front of his and he called the prominent civil rights lawyer to see if he had any grounds to sue the city for damages claiming political bias in an said that he thought the summons was wild by the but that a suit by claiming enforcement based on his trump leanings would be difficult case to a parks department spokesman dismissed the claim that the summonses were political and called them a routine penalty for damage to the trees fine had nothing to do with the content of the signs posted and everything to do with the fact that staples can damage and even kill the said in a statement he added that the fine was determined by the administrative court and based on the amount of damage or the cost but rather on the rule the order to cite set off something of a parallel episode within the parks department an enforcement supervisor ordered a sergeant to write the 22 tickets but the arguing that it was improper to write summonses weeks after the signs had been with no witnesses to the violations were bogus said sergeant a veteran with 29 years on the job might as well hit every dog owner who puts up a he said he also consulted a superior he told out of it too a rookie officer wound up writing the said sergeant who has had previous with the agency as an outspoken member of his local 983 of 37 the characterized department officials as using the officers as for their political in this case sergeant said he was included in an email conversation about possibly forcing to pay in damage for the staple a proposition that an agency lawyer replied to in the email chain as for victory is a bit of revenge last he bought and hung a larger banner told you the banner reads trump trump

for his second john a journalist with extensive experience in has taken a microscope to an enormous the relationship between the united states and from 1776 to the present with growing stress points in that relationship and the emergence of strongman leaders in both the beautiful country and the middle arrives during a precarious inflection point it is peppered with characters that uses to trace a long historical from a to a prominent and henry m the former united states treasury secretary is scheduled to speak about his book on at the politics and prose bookstore in in an he discussed the history of interactions between the united states and president xi and what china policy might emerge from the trump administration what has been the overarching paradigm of united relations from the 18th century to and have been enchanting each other and disappointing each other since they first met in when the first ship landed in with a cargo of ginseng and silver to trade for tea if a pattern to the it has been rapturous enchantment followed by despair right are in the disenchantment phase of the as are the you tell many colorful anecdotes of and in contact with each other which one do you think best reflects the wider one of the main goals of the book was to bring to light stories of unchronicled influence on both sides the first minister to the court in was a young republican named was a radical abolitionist who was dispatched to by the administration believed that the west needed to give china time to develop and modernize and stop pressuring china to change he believed that the west had no right to for the way china treated and he argued that western officials should tolerate the habit of maintaining that their emperor actually ruled the entire world to encapsulates one side of the view of one that reappeared in the and lasted up through the beginning of the administration the or rather the bet that china would liberalize and become more like us as long as we facilitated its rise in opposition to other believed his views on china as one of his successors in put a that also has formed a key part of the perspective on china your book discusses the way governments in the two nations have interacted with each but you also go into detail on the roles that notable nonpolitical figures have played to what extent does the united relationship depend on the attitudes of each leaders versus those of other whether they are from the elite classes or the grass in many we and the and our elites and those from the grass are captives of our past in the beginning of the individual and created the relationship and imbued it with much of its meaning merchants and missionaries saw china as a vast market for stuff and for souls saw as a place that could save china from the depredations of other imperialist nations with its educational as a model for china to emulate at the same other groups of feared the starting in the late oppressed workers in starting a long history of fearing the industriousness of the had their own prejudices against and ideas as viewing them as sexually deviant and dangerous many of these dreams and fantasies and biases we have about each other have resurfaced in subsequent decades in claim that china has been the united states when it comes to one can hear the populists of the party in late railing on the streets of against heathen in your many years as a journalist in what were the most notable changes you saw in the united with is less willing to bend to will than before and more willing to aggressively pursue its whether they involve trade or the south china sea spent decades arguing that as china strengthened it would become more like a liberal western nation it turned out that and as such the has stopped doing china any favors much more than it is blocking the sales of western companies to firms and strengthening its alliances with nations around periphery the careful balance of containment and engagement that defined policy toward china is now heavily skewed toward containment what are your thoughts on president xi and how the united states fits into xi has said he wants to rule which i think can be translated into a desire to see china rule in this the is an interloper and would do best to retreat to and let china handle the western pacific china benefited greatly from the in the but now xi feels that china does not need the to protect it anymore it wants the out of not next not the year but one day soon with the election of trump as the next united states where do you see the relationship trump is not an when it comes to his views on china they are but so were and those of many of his predecessors during the trump seesawed between accusing china of the united states on threatening to walk away from alliances in east and thereby ceding the western pacific to and mulling the idea of some type of with china where the would accept rise if china did not endanger the status quo in trump will enter office against a backdrop of an facing a dictator in north and a china eager to capitalize on missteps how he juggles and his own competing mix of disappointment and realism about china will help determine the future of the relationship and the future of the globe if i had to i think he is going to be more pragmatic than many initially but prognostication is a tough especially when it comes to china and trump
if you are a close observer of the new as you might have noticed a headline about the fox news anchor it suggested that she had at age leaving us without favorite news this a news story written by a times reporter and it is alive and exceptionally so but it has with some on the times as an advertisement pretending to be a news story in other fake or at least a version of it a times reader from has been noticing the ad awhile and wrote me this week to complain or keeps popping up on various new times pages she said is unacceptable please stop these which frankly make me feel like the times is no better an outlet than the horrifying feeds with all of their fake news how could such fraudulent content wind up on the times through something called programmatic which essentially means that computers and algorithms conduct the transactions between advertisers and publishers rather than people machine to like a stock market matching buyers with sellers both the newsroom and its advertising department have rules that forbid misleading or otherwise worrisome ads from appearing on the site but it is difficult to apply those rules when computers are serving up the ads without a sales rep on the other end of the transaction screening out the misfits a senior vice president in says the times works aggressively to squash ads like the one that made the false claim but the nature of the mechanized system means that most of the policing is done after the fact once the ad has already appeared the ad has now been reported and taken down says another ad that fell into the same category was also removed recently says the times has one of the cleanest ad experiences in the publishing business i agree relative to the size of the site and the volume of the times have many ads that tout the premature demise of newscasters or make false claims about remedies when fraudulent ads do pop up and especially true now that the firing squads are out trying to punish those responsible for publishing during the election and are the prime because critics say they recklessly let their platforms be used by the who create fake news mark hoping to hose down the says his company is taking steps to curtail the flow of fabricated content onto its in an editorial this the times piled warning that its proposed changes go far enough and warning of the danger that awaits if to let liars and con artists hijack his as measured by sheer there is no comparison between a handful of ads on the times website and an endless gush of fake news stories that get shared by millions on one is a the other is an ocean but there are similarities too both organizations find themselves in the position of unwittingly publishing fake content that misleads and annoys and that can diminish a brand ads like the one may not be rampant at the but still worth taking a good look at whether the times is really doing everything it can to eliminate them particularly true at a moment when fake news is such a flash and when the times is dispensing advice to another publisher on how to solve its problems

if you think back to this presidential campaign and recall a lot of articles mentioning email troubles and j various you be wrong if it seems there were fewer articles about the economy and because there were the temptation to blame news organizations for this imbalance is but there is at least some reason to resist it critics have long assailed campaign coverage as focused too much on candidate campaign strategy and assessments of instead of on policies and ideas but this the candidates share the blame i compared the content of campaign ads with the content of news articles about two specific candidate traits or and the economy or jobs both the candidates and news organizations spent more time discussing the fitness for office lack of than they did the economy and the imbalance grew more lopsided as the election approached using analytic tools provided by crimson i categorized the campaign news coverage of 23 media outlets this consisted of four broadcast three cable news national public radio and on the two news and 12 newspapers i specifically searched for news about campaign and her email server or her campaign and and several controversies connected to campaign things like trump the khan family and the i also looked for news about the campaign appeals on the economy and jobs this list but it gives a sense of the between coverage of these controversies and the economy the controversies received more on than their views on the economy from until election 38 percent of the stories mentioned various and 35 percent mentioned email only 17 percent mentioned trump and jobs or the and only 10 percent cited campaign and the economy closer to the from 8 the numbers got even more lopsided this was an important date just after the release of the video and a few weeks before director b letter to congress from this 53 percent of the campaign articles mentioning either controversies or the economy discuss while only 6 percent mention her alongside jobs or the economy as for 31 percent mention his while 10 percent mention him related to jobs and the economy the imbalance in coverage of the character is as is the lack of coverage about the economy compared with the controversies moving one week past the video between 15 and election roughly half of the stories about scandals and the economy mentioned and only a quarter discussed trump and his imbroglios a mere 7 percent of the stories in these last three weeks mentioned and the economy percent mentioned trump and the these choices have consequences according to the reports of what they heard or read about between and were mainly references to her handling of emails during her time as secretary of state in mentions of trump changed week by tracking what was happening on the campaign trail but before anyone blames the news important to examine what the candidates themselves were talking about over the course of the campaign if media reports reflect candidate discourse then it is not merely the media choosing to report on scandals it might be at least as much the choosing to campaign on them that results in unending coverage of traits and characteristics to figure out if this was the i used data from on all the campaign ads aired between and election day i coded all of the appeals in each ad and weighted the appeals by how many times the ads ran on television made more ads than and she vastly running nearly three times as many ads as he did all over half a million ads were run in 2016 during this period the content of the ads is revealing both candidates spent most of their television advertising time attacking the other character in the losing ads did little else more than of the appeals in advertisements nearly half of were about characteristics or dispositions only 9 percent of appeals in her ads were about jobs or the economy by 34 percent of appeals focused on the taxes and trade since the start of presidential campaign television advertising in no campaign has made 76 percent of its television ad appeals about any single topic on traits typically garner about 22 percent of the appeals the economy typically generates about 28 percent of the appeals usually much more balance of this was an unusual election with two very unpopular so the flaws may have simply been too big a story for either them or the media to pass up whatever the the criterion of fitness for office dominated the messaging and made up a good share of the trump messaging as and the news media covered it
publisher of the new thank you very much for joining us and i want to reaffirm this is on the record j of the united all so clear we had a very nice meeting in the room a i i i am a photo of the great man behind you there was a big thing about the bust that was removed out of the oval office i heard thinking of putting it back i indeed i am wonderful so got a good collection here from our newsroom and editorial and our columnists i just want to say we had a but useful and conversation in there so i appreciate that very much i appreciate too i thought maybe start this off by asking if you have anything you would like to start this off with before we move to the easiest questions going to get this administration i just appreciate the meeting and i have great respect for the new times tremendous respect very special always has been very special i think been treated very rough well out there that been treated extremely unfairly in a in a true sense i only complain about the times i would say the times was about the roughest of all you could make the case the post was but every once in a while actually get a good article not but every once in awhile i have great respect for the and like to turn it around i think it would make the job i am doing much easier working very hard we have great people coming in i think be very impressed with the names be announcing some very shortly everybody wanted to do this people are giving up tremendous careers in order to be subject to you folks and subject to a lot of other folks but giving up a lot i mean some are giving up tremendous businesses in order to sit for four or maybe eight or whatever the period of time is but i think going to see some tremendous tremendous talent coming in we have many people for every job i mean no matter what the job we have many incredible people i you can sort of just confirm that the quality of the people is very good choice for chief of trying very hard to get the best people not necessarily people that will be the most politically correct because that been working so we have really experts in the field some are known and some are not but known within their field as being the best very important to me you been given a great honor been very tough been 18 months of brutality in a true but we won it we won it pretty big the final numbers are coming out or i guess coming out just being confirmed but the numbers are coming out far beyond what wildest expectation was i know if it was i we were seeing the kind of crowds and kind the kind of enthusiasm we were getting from the people as you probably i did many speeches that last period i was just telling that i went around and did speeches in the pretty much 11 different that the massive crowds we were getting if we had a stadium that held and most of many of you were there that held 20 , 000 have 15 , 000 people outside that get in so we came up with a good system we put up the big screens outside with a very good loudspeaker system and very few people left i would during the last two or three a day a lot because not easy when you have big crowds those not an easy way of doing three a day then i said the last two i want to do six and seven and not sure anybody has ever done that but we did six and we did seven and the last one ended at 1 in the morning in and we had 31 , 000 17 , 000 or 18 , 000 inside and the rest outside this massive place in grand i guess and it was an incredible thing and i left do we lose i think we can lose and the reason i did it was set up only a little while before because we heard that day that was hearing that going to lose which been lost in 38 years or something but 38 years and they want to lose so they went out along with president and bill and they went to late sort of late afternoon and i go to it on the schedule so i finished up in new and at 10 i went to we got there at 12 we started speaking around and we had 31 , 000 people and i i there are things happening but we saw it everywhere so we felt very good we had great numbers and we thought going to win we thought we were going to win we thought we were going to win north we did pretty easily we thought strongly we were going to win the problem is nobody had won it and it was as you the great state that always got away every republican thought they were going to win for 38 years and they just win it and i thought we were going to win it and we won we won you relatively we won it by a number of points we won by 180 , 000 was that the more than 180 , 000 and votes are still coming in from the which we are getting about 85 percent of so we won that by a lot of votes you we had a great victory we had a great victory i think it would have been easier because i see every once in awhile somebody the popular the popular vote would have been a lot but a whole different campaign i would have been in i would have been in and new and we have gone anywhere else which i mean rather do the popular vote from the standpoint think do actually as well or better a whole different campaign if a like match play versus stroke play a whole different game but i think the popular vote would have been easier in a true sense because go to a few places i think the genius of the electoral college i was never a fan of the electoral college until now until now until now i guess now i like it for two reasons what it does do is it gets you out to see states that never see otherwise very interesting like i went to four times i went to 2 for because everybody was saying you can get to 269 but there is no path to 270 we learned that was false because we ended up with got to got to get in but there is no path to you have to get the one in so we kept going back to and we did get the one in we kept going to and we went to a lot of states that you spend a lot of time in and it does get you we actually went to about 22 whereas if going for popular probably go to or it could be three you leave new stay in new and stay in so a certain genius about it and i like it either way but sort of interesting but we had an amazing period of time i got to know the we have a great a great and the enthusiasm was really incredible the times had a poll which was interesting because i was always up in that poll they had something that i a technique in it was called enthusiasm they added an enthusiasm factor and my people had great and people have enthusiasm and in the end she get the vote and we ended up close to 15 as you know we started off at we ended up with almost 15 and more a lot of people show because the community liked me they liked what i was saying so they necessarily vote for but they show which was a big problem that she had i ended up doing very well with which was which i never understood why i was doing because go to the rallies and have so many women holding up for but i kept reading polls saying that not doing well with women i think whoever is doing it here would say that we did very well with especially certain women dean executive editor of the new as you describe you did do something really remarkable you energized a lot of people in the country who really wanted change in but along with that and this is going to create a tricky thing for you you also energized presumably a smaller number of people who were evidenced at the convention in this weekend who have a very i just saw that today love to hear you talk about how going to manage that group of people who actually may not be the larger group but who have an expectation for you and are angry about the country and its along racial lines my first question do you feel like you said things that energized them in and how are you going to manage i think dean first of i want to energize the group not looking to energize them i want to energize the and i disavow the group i know if reporting or whatever i know where they were four years and where they were for and and all of the other people that so i just i had nothing to compare it to but not a group i want to and if they are energized i want to look into it and find out why what we do want to do is we want to bring the country because the country is very and one thing i did big league very and going to work very hard to bring the country together i somebody that really has gotten along with people over the years it was my i went to a big event about two years ago just after i started thinking about politics and walking in and some people were cheering and some people were and she you have never booed for never had a person boo and all of a sudden people are booing me she never happened before politics you all of a sudden they think going to be running for and a say so something that i had never experienced before and i people are and she never booed before but now they boo you it was a group and another group was going the opposite i want to bring the country together very important to me in a very divided country in many ways divided so going to do that thing that executive editors get to do which is to invite reporters to jump in and ask questions political thank dean like to thank you for being here this talked about not prosecuting we were hoping you could talk about exactly what that means does that mean just the or the emails and the and how you came to that decision there was a report that somebody said that not enthused about it i want to move i want to move back and i want to hurt the i really she went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways and i am not looking to hurt them at all the campaign was vicious they say it was the most vicious primary and the most vicious campaign i added it was definitely the most i assume you sold a lot of newspapers i would imagine i would imagine just telling not looking to hurt them i think been through a lot gone through a lot really looking i think we have to get the focus of the country into looking forward if i could we had a good conversation you and and it was off the but there was nothing just wanted to make sure the idea of looking forward was one of the themes that you were saying that we need to now get past the deputy managing so definitively taking that off the the but the question was asked about the emails and the but just not something that i feel very strongly about i feel very strongly about health care i feel very strongly about an immigration bill that i think even the people in this room can be happy you been talking about immigration bills for 50 years and ever happened i feel very strongly about an immigration bill fair and just and a lot of other things there are a lot of things i feel strongly about not looking to look back and go through this this was a very painful period this was a very painful election with all of the email things and all of the foundation things and all of the everything that they went through and the whole country went through this was a very painful period of time i read recently where it it they used to say it was against whoever and none of us were there to see it and there a lot of recordings of but the fact is that there were some pretty vicious they say this this was the most they say it was definitely the most vicious primary and i think very important to look forward senior editor for do you think it would disappoint your supporters who seemed very animated by the idea of accountability in the what would you say to i think they will be disappointed i think i will explain that we have in many ways save our country because our really in big trouble we have a lot of trouble a lot of problems and one of the big i talk divisiveness i think that a lot of people will appreciate not doing it for that reason doing it because time to go in a different direction there was a lot of and i think that the people that supported me with such where they will show up at 1 in the morning to hear a speech it was actually election they showed up so that was essentially election day i think understand very completely l opinion can i ask a one of the issues that you actually were very careful not to speak about during the and spoken about is one very near and dear to my the whole issue of climate the how approach it you own some of the most beautiful links golf courses in the world cross i read your article some will be even better because actually like is a little bit off so be perfect he say that he just says that the ones that are near the water will be but will be in great shape but really important to and i think to a lot of our to know where going to go with this i think anyone objects you doing forms of energy but are you going to take out of the lead of confronting climate looking at it very tom tell you what i have an open mind to it going to look very carefully one issue interesting because there are few things where more division than climate change you tend to hear but there are people on the other side of that issue who even we do hear it i was on with this so i got an earful of it is one of them but a lot of smart people disagree with you i have a very open mind and going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and going to look at it very carefully but i have an open mind since living on an i want to thank you for having an open mind we saw what these storms are now seen it personally straight up but you have an open mind on i do have an open mind and had storms not like this you know the hottest day ever was in 98 you you can make lots of cases for different views i have a totally open mind my uncle was for 35 years a professor at he was a great scientist he was a great guy and he was a long time he had feelings this was a long time ago he had feelings on this subject a very complex subject not sure anybody is ever going to really know i know we they say they have science on one side but then they also have those horrible emails that were sent between the scientists where was in or wherever five years terrible where they got you so you see that and you this all about i absolutely have an open mind i will tell you clean air is vitally important clean crystal clean water is vitally important safety is vitally important and you you mentioned a lot of the courses i have some very successful golf courses received so many environmental awards for the way you know done a tremendous amount of work where received tremendous numbers sometimes say actually an environmentalist and people will smile in some cases and other people that know me understand true open mind editorial page when you say an open you mean just not sure whether human activity causes climate do you think human activity is or i think right now i think there is some connectivity there is something it depends on how much it also depends on how much going to cost our companies you have to our companies are noncompetitive right now really largely noncompetitive about four weeks i started adding a certain little sentence into a lot of my that lost 70 , 000 factories since w bush 70 , 000 when i first looked at the i must be a typo it be you have you think you have 70 , 000 factories and it a right lost 70 , 000 factories not a competitive nation with other nations anymore we have to make ourselves competitive not competitive for a lot of reasons becoming more and more of the reason because a lot of these countries that we do business they make deals with our or and then they adhere to the you know that and much less expensive for their companies to produce products so going to be studying that very and i think i have a very big voice in it and i think my voice is listened especially by people that believe in it and let you know hate to see royal underwater the north that could a good bureau i just wanted to follow up on the question you were asked about not pursuing any investigations into did you mean both the email investigation and the foundation investigation you will not pursue either one of you know have people that do things but my inclination would for whatever power i have on the is to say go forward this has been looked at for so long ad go forward and you you could also make the case that some good work was done in the foundation and they could have made etc etc i think i think time for people to say go and solve some of the problems that we which are massive problems you i do think that gone through a lot i think losing is going through a lot it was a it was a very tough evening for her i think losing is going through a lot for whatever my attitude is strongly we have to go we have so many different problems to i think we have to delve back in the past i also think that would be a very well i think it would be very you know talking about bringing and then they go into all sorts of i think it would be very divisive for the country i i think speaking not as a journalist very healthy and then going to go d white house mike shear i cover the white covering your administration see ya there just one quick clarification on the climate do you intend as you pull out of the climate going to take a look at it shear and if the reaction from foreign leaders is to slap tariffs on goods to offset the carbon that the united states had pledged to is that with and then the second question is on your sort of mixing of your global business interests and the presidency even just in the two weeks been instances where met with your business partners sure talked about the impact of the wind farms on your golf course experts who are lawyers and ethics say that all of that is totally so i guess the question for you what do you see as the appropriate structure for keeping those two things and are there any lines that you think you want to cross once in the white first of on countries i think that countries will not do that to us i think if run by a person that understands leadership and negotiation in no position to do that to no matter what i do in no position to do that to and that but going to take a look at it a very serious look i want to also see how much this is you the cost to and be talking to you folks in the future about having to do with what just took place as far as you potential conflict of i mean i know that from the the law is totally on my the president have a conflict of interest been reported very widely despite i want there to be a conflict of interest anyway and the the president and i understand why the president have a conflict of interest now because everything a president does in some ways is like a conflict of but i built a very great company and a big company and all over the world people are starting to when they look at all these different like in and other number a job like that builds great relationships with the people of so all good but i have to the partners come very successful people they come they it be possible to have a my children are working on that job so i can say to want to have a i can take a picture i i think wonderful to take a picture fine with a picture but if it were up to some i would ever see my daughter again that would be like you never seeing your son again that be good that be good but ever see my daughter that means have to make deputy you know i i yeah i do that either i that work i do i would never see i guess the only son be allowed to at least for a little would be because 10 so there has to be a very interesting case you could sell your company with all due you could sell your company and then well and then you could see them all the time a very hard thing to you know because i have real estate i have real estate all over the which now people are understanding when i filed my forms with the federal people really a big a big it really is all over the world a great company with great assets i think you selling real estate like selling stock selling real estate is much in a much different world say and i mean this and i said it on the other my company is so unimportant to me relative to what i need i need and by the very i have a very small percentage of my money in very very small percentage of my money in in banks have said like to loan you like to give you any amount of been there had it both been been especially as you get is much better just a because an important question i care about my company i if a partner comes in from or if a partner comes in from where we did a beautiful big building that just and they want to take a picture and come into my and my kids come in i originally made the deal with these i mean what am i going to not going to talk to not going to take you have you on a human you take pictures but i just want to say that i am given the right to do something so important in terms of so many of the issues we in terms of health in terms of so many different things i care about my company it matter my kids run it say i have a conflict because we just opened a beautiful hotel on so every time somebody stays at that if they stay because i guess you could say a conflict of interest a conflict of but not going to have anything to do with the and they may very well i mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was the brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before i help but i care i said on i care because it matter the only thing that matters to me is running our country political can i press you a little further on what structures you would put in place to keep the presidency and the company separate and to avoid things for were reported in the times in the past 24 hours about meeting with leaders of about wind farms about meeting with leaders of about wind farms that might interfere with the views of your golf course and how to what can you talk about that by the was i involved with the wind farms not that i know of i i have a problem with wind but you brought it up in the which i know i might have with leaders of many with i see i might have brought it up but not having to do with just i the wind is a very deceiving thing first of we make the windmills in the united states made in and japan made out of massive amounts of which goes into the whether in our country or it goes into the atmosphere the windmills kill birds and the windmills need massive subsidies in other subsidizing wind mills all over this country i for the most part they work i think they work at all without and that bothers and they kill all the birds you go to a you know in they have what is the golden and if you shoot a golden they go to jail for five years and yet they kill them they actually have to get permits that only allowed to kill 30 or something in one year the windmills are devastating to the bird with that being a place for them but they do need subsidy if i talk negatively been saying the same thing for years about you the wind industry i want to subsidize it some environmentalists agree with me very much because of all of the things i just including the and some but hard to explain i care about anything having to do with anything having to do with anything other than the country but the just to be the question how do you formalize the separation of these things so that there is not a question of whether or not you as president are trying to influence like wind i want to influence because not not that important to me hard to explain but the according to the see i figured something where you put something in this massive trust and also nothing is written in other in i can be president of the united states and run my business 100 sign checks on my which i am phasing out of very you i sign the type i like to sign checks so i know what is going on as opposed to pressing a computer and thousands of checks are automatically sent it it tells me going on a little bit and it tells contractors that watching but i am phasing that out and handing that to trump and don trump and trump for the most and some of my so happening right now but in theory i could run my business and then run the country perfectly and never been a case like this where if you look at other people of they have this kind of asset and this kind of frankly just a different thing but there is no i assumed that have to set up some type of trust or whatever and you know and i was actually a little bit surprised to see it so in theory i have to do anything but i would like to do something i would like to try and formalize because i care about my business is going to run very nice we own this incredible place in we own many incredible including i guess you heard one guy that does when i say you know what that right do a little but going to run we have good going to run really well so i have to do but i want to do something if i can if there is something can you promise us when you decide exactly what that come tell the new times about i will started it already one of our great by the way i can see that started it already i greatly reduced the and the business greatly reduced meetings with meetings with different people you also started by said over the last two once i decided i wanted to i want to build anything like for we built the post be happy to ahead of schedule and under budget substantially ahead of schedule almost two years ago of schedule but ahead of under and a terrific place the hotel on just so you general electric has a big wind turbine factory in south just so you know well good but most of are made in most of are you and the are making most of them they may assemble if you i think find that delivered there and they do most of the assembly white house sorry i entered but i did want to ask you about you should introduce yourself one of the white house correspondents i apologize for my delayed flight i wanted to ask you about personnel they say personnel is policy i quite hear personnel personnel you hired to be the chief strategist for you in the white house he is a hero of the been described by some as racist and i wonder what message you think you have sent by elevating him to that position and what you would say to those who feel like that indicates something about the kind of country you prefer and the government run known a long time if i thought he was a or or any of the things that we you the terms we can i even think about hiring him first of the one that makes the not or anybody else and will tell you that 100 percent and if he said something to me in terms of his or that i thought were inappropriate or number one i do and number he would have to be gone but i know many people that know and in actually getting some very good press from a lot of the people that know and people that are on the left but went to he was you he was very he was a naval i think you i think very hard on him i think having a hard time with it because not him not him known him for a long time a very smart guy i think he was with on top of everything else what do you make of the website he the different cover i mean like the new times covers things i i could say that is because they covered an story i i am take whatever you say i am always but not cross the new times covers a lot of stories that you rough stories and you they have covered some of these but the new times covers a lot of these things also just a essentially a newspaper i know the a decent a very smart guy done a good job he been with me that long you know he really came in after the primaries i had already won the primaries and if i thought that his views were in that i would immediately let him go and tell you why in many respects i think his views are actually on the other side of what a lot of people might think but you are with all due that and and many folks who disagree with the coverage of and the slant that brings to the news view him that well first of is just a publication you they cover stories like you cover stories they are certainly a much more conservative to put it than the new times but really is a news organization become quite and got readers and it does cover subjects that are on the but it covers subjects on the left also i mean a pretty a pretty big thing and he helped build it into a pretty successful news organization tell you i know him very well i will say and i will say if i thought that if i thought that he was doing or had any ideas that were different than the ideas that you would i would ask him very politely to leave but in the i think been treated very unfairly very interesting a lot of people are coming to his defense right now we have never experienced a single episode of any of those accusations been the total opposite been a great and just not there and what the is saying is 100 percent true and by the if you see something or get something where you feel that and you have some info i would love to hear it you can call can call i would love to hear the only one who call me is opinion she treats me too rough i know what happened to she was so opinion for years she was so good as we all say about not your just your turn opinion i have a slightly but somewhat i guess about the future of the republican party you started out here talking about winning in so many states where no republican has won in especially rust belt states and i think many people think that one of the reasons you won was that you deliberately campaigned as a different kind of republican you had different things to say on foreign even your daughter child care plan was sort of distinctive and now in a situation where governing and staffing up an administration with a republican party whose and may differ with me a little on but always see on those views although right now loving me right now they are right now loves loves amazing how winning can change things liked chuck for a long time raised a lot of money for chuck and given him a lot of money over the years i think i was the first person that ever contributed to chuck i had a a little in a little apartment building in in bay where i worked with my father and chuck came in and i gave i i know if willing to admit but i believe it was his first campaign but chuck a good guy i think get along very well i guess my question how much do you expect to be able to both run an administration and negotiate with a congress as a different kind of republican and do you worry that wake up three years from now and go back to campaigning in the rust belt and people will he governed more like than like trump i worry about that i need to do this i was telling i need to do this doing this to do a good what i want to and i think that what happened in the rust they call it the rust belt for a reason if you go through you look back 20 they used to call it the rust belt you pass factory after factory after factory empty and rusting rust is the good worse than falling down i sacrifice that to me more important is taking care of the people that really have proven to to love as opposed to the political people and frankly if the political people take care of these not going to win and going to end up with maybe a total different kind of government than what looking at right now these people are really angry and angry i call them the forgotten men and women and i use that in i say the forgotten people they were totally forgotten and going to bring jobs back going to bring jobs big league spoken to so many companies i plan on moving your not going to be able to move your company and sell us your product you think going to just sell it across what will be a strong you know at least going to have a border but just plan on it and tell i and hear announcements over the next couple of but i believe talked numerous comp in conversations with top people numerous companies that or potentially leaving our country with thousands of jobs are you that those companies will keep their factories but the jobs will be replaced by they and make the robots too a big make the robots too right now we make the robots we make anything but going i robotics is becoming very big and going to do that going to have more factories we lose 70 , 000 factories just do it going to start making things i was honored i got a call from bill great we had a great i got a call from cook at and i you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when i get apple to build a big plant in the united or many big plants in the united where instead of going to and going to and going to the places that you go making your product right he understand i think create the incentives for and i think going to do it going for a very large tax cut for which be happy but going for big tax we have to get rid of regulations are making it impossible whether liberal or i mean i could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous gotten to be a and companies they even start they choking i tell one thing i would giving a big tax cut and giving big regulation and seen all of the small business owners over the united and all of the big business met so many people they are more excited about the regulation cut than about the tax cut and i never said because the tax going to be substantial you know we have companies leaving our country because the taxes are too high but leaving also because of the regulations and i would of the and i would not have thought regulation substantial regulation are more important and more enthusiastically than even the big tax cuts i wanted to ask there was a conference this past weekend in of people who pledged their allegiance to you are really into this i think we answered that one right off the bat are you going to condemn of course i of course i did he already did are you going to do it right i maybe you here sure would you like me to do it do it here of course i condemn i disavow and condemn go with that like to move to and then go back because a lot of the investment you are talking a lot of the jobs you are talking about is infrastructure going to be the core of your first few not the but an important factor going for a lot of between between between health care going to talk repeal and replace health care is you know people are paying a 100 percent increase and not even getting the deductibles are so you have deductibles so paying all of this money and they even get health care so very important so there are a lot of things but is going to be a part of it part of i even think a big part of it going to be a big number but i think i am doing things that are more important than but infrastructure is still a part of and talking about a very infrastructure bill and not a very republican thing i even know frankly it worked for franklin it work for because unfortunately they spend the money last time on infrastructure they spent it on a lot of other things you nobody can find out where that last you from a few years ago where that money went and going to make sure it is spent on infrastructure and roads and highways i have a a big one of the biggest and he orders these incredible the i mention the name but a certain truck company that makes they call them the of trucks you the most expensive trucks and he calls me up about two months ago and he going to buy the cheapest trucks i can and i and you and this is the biggest guy he trucks are coming going from new to and all busted up the highways are in such bad hitting hitting he not buying these trucks going to buy the cheapest stuff and the strongest tires i can the exact expression he cheapest trucks and the strongest hitting so many bad you i tell been doing this how 45 years he built it over 45 years i you ever seen it like he roads have never been like an interesting what what curious what and said when you going to launch a infrastructure are they reluctant to spend honestly right now trillion i was the figure because they would be in the wing of the republican party that would but not going to be able to do that and balance the see if i get it done right now in love with me four weeks ago they in love with me forget if i read the new and you have to put this on the record it can be if you you might not want you say but you do i do read it unfortunately i would have lived about 20 years longer if i quote right there if love to reread it i know but when you look at the all the i was going to lose the i was going to take the house with and the senate had no chance it was going to be the biggest humiliation in the history of politics in this country and instead i won the and i mean easily you look at those i had states where i won by 30 and 40 points i won the presidency i helped numerous senators in fact the only senators that get elected were two one up in new who refused to say that she was going to vote for who by the way would love a job in the administration and i thank on the record this is where different than a politician i know what to i just believe sort of interesting love to have a job in the i thank she refused to vote for me and a senator in who frankly he endorsed me then he and he went down like a lead balloon and then they called me before the race and said they wanted me to endorse him and do a big thing and i thank good you see what happens i off the i hope you lose off the record he he was up by 10 points you know who talking about others if you look at he was down five points a few days before the he called for i gave him and i think i was up like over 30 points in i was leading by a massive 28 points i gave him help and he ended up winning by four points or something i brought a number of them brought over the finish line we brought you that was a good one we brought him over the line in winning was big something that i came so right now in very good but i came here thinking be awed and overwhelmed by this but i feel like you are getting very comfortable with it i feel comfortable i feel comfortable i am awed by the as anybody would but i i feel so comfortable and you know it would to a great achievement if i could come back here in a year or two years and say and have a lot of the folks here done a great and i mean just a conservative not talking conservative i mean done a good job to follow up on after you met with president he described you to folks as that you seemed overwhelmed by what he told you so i wonder if you are overwhelmed by the magnitude of the job that about to inherit and if you can tell us anything more about that conversation with the president and the apparently subsequent conversations that had on the phone since then and then maybe talk a little bit about foreign something we touched on and whether or not you believe in the kind of world order a world order led by in terms of having this country underwrite the security and the free markets of the which have been in place for decades sure i had a great meeting with president i never met him before i really liked him a lot the meeting was supposed to be 10 15 minutes because there were a lot of people waiting for both of us and it ended up being you were there i guess an close and it was a great chemistry i think if he said i think he meant that in a bad way i think he meant that it is a very overwhelming job but not overwhelmed by it you can do things and fix i think he meant it that way he said very nice things after the meeting and i said very nice things about him i really enjoyed my meeting with him we have you we come from different sides of the but nevertheless something that i know if like him i probably thought that maybe i but i i did like him i really enjoyed him a lot spoken to him since the meeting what did you say to just a basic conversation i think looking to do absolutely the right thing for the country in terms of transition and i telling we had a that went for an hour and a half that could have gone for three or four hours it was a great it was just a very good meeting sort of like this meeting he told me what he thought what the biggest problems of the country which i think i should i mind if he reveals them but i was actually surprised a little bit but he told me the he told me things that he considered but he did tell me what he thought were the biggest in particular one problem that he thought was a big problem for the which rather have you ask him but i really found the meeting to be very good and i hope we can have a good i it mean going to agree on but i hope that we will have a great relationship i really liked him a lot and a little bit surprised telling you that i really liked him a lot go foreign sure sure what do you see as role in the do you believe that the role such a big question the role that we played for 50 years as kind of the global paying more for things because they were in our ultimate one hears from i is really shrinking that role i think we should be a nation builder i think tried that i happen to think that going into was perhaps i mean you could say maybe we could have settled the civil i think going into was one of the great mistakes in the history of our country i think getting out of it i think we got out of it then lots of bad things including the formation of we could have gotten out of it differently i think going in was a terrible mistake we have to solve that problem because we are going to just keep fighting forever i have a different view on than everybody else not everybody but then a lot of people i had to listen to give me a break i had to listen to graham talk you attacking and you and like now attacking attacking attacking and what are we getting and what are we and i have some very i have some very strong ideas on i think happened is a horrible thing to look at the and not just talking deaths on our which are but the deaths i mean you look at these where massive and they say two people were injured thousands of people have died and i think a shame and ideally we can get do something with i spoke to as you he called essentially how do you see that essentially everybody called all of the major and most of them spoken to will you have a reset with i use that term after what you previously i think i would love to be able to get along with and i think like to be able to get along with us in our mutual interest and i go in with any preconceived but i will tell i would say when they used to during the trump loves loves i it be say this in front of thousands of it be nice to actually report what they it be nice if we actually got along with it be nice if we went after which by the aside from being very and have been even allowed to and the people will stand up and give me a massive hand you know they thought it was bad that i was getting along with or that i believe strongly if we can get along with a positive thing it is a great thing that we can get along with not only but that we get along with other countries managing on would you you said you have a very strong idea about what to do with the can you describe that for i can only say we have to end that craziness going on in one of the things that was told to me can i say this off the or is everything on the if you want to i want to i want to violate a if you want to go off the we have agreed you can go off the record ladies and we are off the record for this moment speaks off the now we can go back on going to play the cop here got only two and a half minutes because they have a hard stop at 2 and by the i want to thank you on behalf of all of us thank you for this and really i mean that we are back on the record you get the last question is he a tough is he i have two very quickly one is your vice left open the idea of returning to you talked about that on the campaign trail hoping you can talk about how you view torture at this and also what are you hoping that will do in your administration and will you bring him in i hear the second question what will role be in your oh maybe nothing because i want to have people saying even though the president of the united states i hope whoever is writing this written fairly the president of the united states is allowed to have whatever conflicts he wants he or she wants but i want to go by that a very smart guy a very good guy the people that know a quality person and i think he can be very helpful i would love to be able to be the one that made peace with and the i would love that would be such a great achievement because been able to do it do you think he can be part of i think be very good at it i mean he knows it so well he knows the knows the knows the players i would love to be and you can put that down in a list of many things that like to be able to do now a lot of people tell really great people tell that you do it had a lot great businesspeople tell you do impossible i i think you can make peace i think people are tired now of being killed at some when do they i think we can do that i have reason to believe i can do that and on where are you and i met with general who is a very respected guy in i met with a number of other they say the finest there is he is being seriously considered for secretary of which is i think time time for a general look at going on we we beat we win anymore at anything we win on the we win with we certainly win with the military general is a highly dignified man i met with him at length and i asked him that question i what do you think of he said i was surprised he never found it to be he always give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and i do better with that than i do with and i was very impressed by that answer i was because known as being like the toughest guy and when he said not saying it changed my mind we have people that are chopping off heads and drowning people in steel cages and not allowed to but tell you i was impressed by that answer it certainly does not not going to make the kind of a difference that maybe a lot of people think if so important to the i would go for it i would be guided by that but general found it to be very less much less important than i thought he would say i thought he would say you know known as mad dog mad dog for a reason i thought say lose he actually give me some cigarettes and some and do with going to go to our mark for the last question very powerful man mark thank and a really short but after all the talk about libel and libel are you committed to the first amendment to the i was hoping he going to say that i think be happy i think be happy somebody said to me on they a great softening up those but you may get sued a lot i i never thought about i i have to start thinking about i think be i think going to be fine thank you very much for this really appreciate this thank you very a great honor i will the times a great jewel a world jewel and i hope we can all get along looking for the same and i hope we can all get along well
the election has resurrected the fiasco of how to fix and mac shares of the two mortgage agencies have rocketed over the last two weeks on hopes that the trump administration might end government oversight big political roadblocks though and which buy or guarantee home needed billion of taxpayer aid in the 2008 financial crisis and were placed under government debates about whether to reduce their role went nowhere because they play a large role in the mortgage market allowing them to shake off their government training wheels is a long way off even representative a republican and the house financial services committee reckons his plan to do so is a long shot worries about hurting the housing and in turn angering are strong enough that some republican lawmakers would probably join their democratic rivals in opposing any such attempt there is one relatively easy that could please most allowing and to keep their earnings since 2012 they have been forced to hand over all profit as dividends to the treasury so they have sent none of which counts toward repaying the bailout that would allow them to rebuild their capital they currently have just million each set aside against a total of trillion of loans on their and that is scheduled to fall to zero in 2018 that raises the embarrassing prospect of one or both of them having to go cap in hand to uncle for another bailout in even a mild housing downturn avoiding that ought to appeal to lawmakers a john and other hedge fund managers who bought and stock after the crash have been pushing for this for some too including in the courts j ascendancy to the white house has emboldened not least because a former partner who is a leading candidate to become treasury was a with in the mortgage lender it after its 2008 collapse and selling it last year to cit ending and status as an for the government would still leave their bailout unpaid and their future status unresolved but it would be a smart first step
j through decades in public has been consistent on one core policy that the united states has gotten a raw deal from its major trading partners in the agreements that bind their economies renegotiating those terms will surely be a top priority for his administration but what will that mean in while the broad thrust of thinking on trade is and he has mentioned a few specific policies he would he and his appointees will have wide latitude in how they pursue more favorable trade arrangements for the united states a video released on reiterated a campaign promise to withdraw from the partnership and more vaguely vowed to bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto since election trade experts have been gaming potential scenarios of what trump administration trade policy might look like in detail some of those possibilities would risk only modest disruptions to the world economy and could very well result in better arrangements for companies others would blow up the underpinnings of the modern global endanger trillions of worth of and stand a good chance of prompting a worldwide recession what those possibilities look from the most benign to the most disruptive there really are some elements of the united existing relationships with major trading partners that are dysfunctional and disadvantageous to the united states by taking more aggressive stands on some of a trump administration may be able to get better deals trump has said repeatedly that he wants to renegotiate the north free trade agreement a lot of things can fit under the rubric of and there is room to update the deal in ways that would prove beneficial to the united states the agreement is 23 years after all and there is plenty of room to adjust terms in ways that preserve the deeply intertwined north economy are too many parts of it that are not said an economist on the trump transition at an event in is supposed to be regular annual review between the parties of to see where not working well and to have kind of a constant process of renewal been dropped away and so something that needs to be looked the trump administration could also pick a variety of industries where it believes trade partners have treated the united states unfairly and bring cases before the world trade organization paired with targeted duties to punish what it sees as unfair the approach could win more favorable deals the bush administration did just that with steel tariffs in as did the administration with a 35 percent tax on tires in 2009 trade experts are generally skeptical that these efforts prove worthwhile and of the institute for international economics calculated that consumers paid an extra billion for tires in 2011 to safeguard a mere 1 , 200 jobs per job saved but administration could bring a series of such and as he his team members prove to be made up of smarter negotiators than their perhaps they could get better results even if they the trillion united states economy will most likely be trump has said he will instruct his treasury secretary to declare china a currency manipulator the w bush and administrations do although they also thought that china artificially depressed the value of its currency to the benefit of exporters they calculated that subtle diplomacy would be more likely than confrontation to get results but who maybe that calculation was and a more confrontational approach would have led china to allow its currency to respond to market forces the government has allowed its currency to rise relative to the dollar over the last few putting it roughly in line with economic fundamentals and reducing the urgency of the issue it could still be in the united interest to put in place agreements to make sure this remains the naming china a currency manipulator merely triggers negotiation over what to do about it such negotiation would most likely be and it might result in a better arrangement for the united states or not but either it need to disrupt trade relations that assumes that trump takes a more aggressive stance using existing channels and and wages the battle with the trading partner over specific cases and industries if it will keep lawyers and lobbyists for those industries busy would be but be working within the relevant legal frameworks and using existing institutions as they were intended by congress and the and our trading said a trade lawyer at white case who has been critical of trump will talk about but it change the global macroeconomic ambiguous language in the statutes grants the president broad authority over trade policy trump could be the kind of president willing to use that authority to its fullest rather than focus on targeted duties on individual products as part of a the government could invoke emergency authority to place tariffs on goods from a given country think of the 45 percent tariff on imports that trump at one point threatened during his or perhaps an escalating tariff set to rise until the trade deficit with a given country declines moves along those lines would get but they would also create enormous ripple effects there would surely be legal challenges by the targeted as well as swift and potentially painful retaliation from trade partners china or take these kinds of measures lying down these blunt there would be a lot of said a resident scholar at the enterprise institute would hit poor the hardest in the sense that a regressive tax that makes things like clothing and consumer electronics more and the retaliation would most likely be fierce if china is the it might cancel orders for airliners and buy from airbus instead united states exported billion worth of aircraft to china last or perhaps the would retaliate against endangering the billion in united states soybean exports to china and endangering farms across the prime trump as the in china will surely be aware and with the economic underpinnings of major industries under the financial markets would probably enter a period of remarkable volatility expect plummeting stock prices for major united states companies that do business around the world the trump administration would be risking significant damage to the united states economy if it took this without any guarantee of coming out with a more favorable deal on the other side trade wars that would be started by tariffs on major trading partners would be economically disruptive but would still leave the basic infrastructure of the global trade system in place the most extreme versions of a trump trade could wreak havoc on the entire system of global economic connections that the united states helped build since the end of world war ii if the trump administration get the concessions it seeks in renegotiating would he follow through on his threat to use the written into the trade to withdraw entirely with six or if the administration brings cases to the and will the united states abide by the or will it follow campaign threat to abandon an organization meant to bring order to the global trade if he seeks to do those things using executive will congress stand by or seek to stop the last 100 years or congress and the executive branch have had a kind of agreement where congress delegates its authority over international trade to the president as long as congress gets the ultimate said in a more extreme case of a trump trade he risk is you have not just an economic crisis but a constitutional this is pretty far down the road of speculation the various business interests who have the ear would surely try to persuade him not to risk everything by being so drastic financial markets since the election have appeared to reflect an expectation that the benign scenario for trump trade policy will emerge the 500 the industrial the composite index and the 2000 index all hit new highs the question of whether one of the more scenarios emerges instead boils down to does trump mean some of the things he has said on the campaign trail about reopening the very basics of united states economic or was it all just the economic consequences of the answer are huge
there was no avoiding fearful memories of the nuclear disaster of 2011 on morning after a powerful earthquake off the coast of caused a cooling system in a nuclear plant to leaving more than 2 , 500 spent uranium fuel rods at risk of overheating but this the electric power or the utility that operates three nuclear restored the cooling pump at the plant in about an hour and a half the plant is about seven miles south of the ruined plant where three reactors melted down five years ago after tsunami waves inundated the power station and knocked out backup generators reported that it never lost power at either the plant or its neighbor to the north after the which had a magnitude of according to the weather service took the regular actions that we should take when handling acting general manager of the nuclear power division at said at a news conference on the company was prepared for big having built sea walls rising to about 46 feet at the plants and enclosing backup generators in waterproof said critics of which struggled to keep on top of a crisis that unfolded over the weeks that followed the calamity in said they were relieved that there had been no immediate damage but they said they remained skeptical that the company had done enough to prepare for a disaster on the scale of the earthquake five years ago that which had a magnitude of set off tsunami waves as high as 130 feet in some places highest waves on reached about 55 looks like the right things have been said director of the future design institute at the institute of technology and a volunteer researcher with an independent group you never know until something happens as far as this morning they did a decent but mainly because it that big of an earthquake or that big of a building higher sea for all but that is like fighting the last brown said remains to be seen how well prepared they would be for some other unusual combination of compared with five years has improved its communication with the reporting information about the cooling pump at almost as it happened on morning the company also quickly said that it had suspended the treatment and transfer of contaminated water from the where an extensive cleanup and decommissioning process is underway by the those operations had been restored i can say is response was decent and they seemed to be said director of the research center for nuclear weapons abolition at university he it would be difficult to independently verify claims because the nuclear regulation authority depends on the company to release information he added that he was not convinced that was being fully transparent about its particularly about the cleanup at the plant should be informed fully whether this operation is reasonably done with cost effectiveness and safety and making sure that the best technology is being said a spokesman for the nuclear regulation said the agency had offices on the sites of the nuclear plants and worked with and other utility companies on to confirm that the power stations were safe after the earthquake regarding the nuclear experts expressed concern about the safety of the cleanup operation at the plant the melted cores of three reactors have yet to be removed as they are still too radioactive for workers to approach since the 2011 groundwater seeps into the reactors daily the contaminated by the melted fuel needs to be treated and stored on site so has built more than 880 tanks of about 1 , 000 tons each the tanks are inspected four times a day to confirm that they do not

fully and groundwater continues to flow into the reactors critics worry that the sea walls or storage tanks might not withstand a more powerful earthquake or tsunami and incident at the reactor showed that quakes can set off problems even at plants that are not operating most of the 54 plants remain closed since the 2011 but the administration of prime minister wants to restart most of them a majority of the public is opposed to such a move candidates for governor who ran campaigns opposed to the revival have won elections in recent months in two prefectures that host nuclear plants according to the a the chairman of and the were planning to meet on with one of those of to try to persuade him to support a restart of the plant there and returned to after the earthquake who oversaw an independent investigation on the nuclear accident for the said that building walls and storage tanks failed to solve the underlying problem of an country relying on nuclear power he both the government and utility companies should invest in developing alternative sources of power like solar or wind technology think we expect more of such readjusting plate movements and that has been reasonably and many volcanic activity and earthquakes have been rampant over the last five said an adjunct professor at the national graduate institute for policy studies why are we continuing to

who gains from a trade war with at the pacific economic cooperation summit meeting in over the one of the biggest questions was whether j as the next would stick to his threat to erect steep trade barriers against dragging the united states into a confrontation with the economy no such war has yet it seems clear that the united states has already lost china has been steadily gaining in the global economic system waging war against is making case a former head of the division at the international monetary argues that the long term china comes out a winner no matter economy would surely suffer if the united states were to impose a 45 percent tariff on nearly billion worth of imports the united states absorbs only 16 percent of but it is healthiest export market fears of protectionism are already stoking capital flight from china but china might be better placed than the united states to take the blow and it would certainly an editorial in global a communist party is probably not far off in its warning that action would batch of orders will be replaced by airbus auto and sales in china will suffer a and soybean and maize imports will be china has several ways to retaliate it could bar companies from doing business with businesses it could limit access to essential as it did in response to a fishing dispute with japan by stopping exports of rare earth minerals essential to the electronics industry it could efforts to combat the piracy of patents and copyrights some of the united most successful companies would be in for a rough ride most of for are assembled in china the assembly account for less than 4 percent of the value added of the device that means china could force a halt in production at little cost to while apple would face a deeply expensive effort to shift production elsewhere building it from scratch in the united states is nearly impossible how long could resolve an analysis by the institute for international economics concluded that a trade war with china and would push unemployment in the united states to nearly 9 percent in from 4 9 percent today that would not improve the economic outlook for millions of in whose name trump proposed this fight and that may not even be the worst part circling the wagons around the border plays directly into hands in other ways would be cast as the villain in the fight no matter how many tricks the government might deploy against it would remain the victim in the eyes of many a champion for the cause of open trade even if trump is just as many of his allies to gain leverage in some future much of the damage has been done his bluster has changed the perception of the role the united states will play in the world in the face of a turn toward populist nationalism in other rich countries like and china has emerged in the unlikely role of defender of capitalism is the one major power still talking about increased said a china specialist at the institute is the only major country in the world projecting the idea that brings and that is the united loss a great many countries in the developing world still believe prosperity depends on their successful integration into the supply chains that traverse the global economy by turning inward a move already reinforced by the rejection of the partnership the united states appears to have little to offer trade conveyed that point only a few days after the election by saying that his nation would work to conclude the regional comprehensive economic partnership a initiative among 16 and pacific countries that excludes the united states and would support proposed free trade area of the pacific ditto for and according to a senior official in are also now seeking to join the trade initiative certainly every economy in the region sees its future lying more closely linked with the former told me trump talking about withdrawing from trade deals and making allies pay for it will be tough for countries to resist and if actions against china start to disrupt supply the united states could quickly become the economic pariah the question to what it simply be about stopping currency manipulation an outdated fear instead of working to lower the value of its currency to improve its china has spent about trillion lately to prop up the value of the in the face of capital flight if it the currency would drop like a enhancing trade competitiveness slapping trade barriers against china would do little to narrow the trade deficit companies building things in china bring much manufacturing in most cases they would go to some other country with cheap labor and to the extent they did most of it would be highly employing few additional does not make economic sense for trump to want to balance trade with said a china specialist at the conservative enterprise institute trade bring back trump might look like a resolute in his defense of the working class but any increase in popularity would be unlikely to last as the consequences started to become apparent has already been playing a relatively weak hand trying to contain influence china has skillfully deployed investments to win over countries from to broadening its network of influence its proposed infrastructure bank despite opposition from the after and other allies jumped on board is becoming a leading member of the international wrote in his new book but the west by

i love telling people from maybe my defense mechanism for when people accuse me of being a coastal out of touch with real i like fulfilling all the stereotypes i love cheese and cheese of course i love our sports teams out of a vague sense of and my accent hard comes out in full force after ah beers mostly i love my who has called home for 88 years her parents immigrated to from and she started public school without knowing a word of she forgot most of the her parents taught her years but taught me the words to the that we would sometimes hear when my family would go to a night fish fry up until i still believed my moral baseline bent toward empathy the i thought i where i lived for 21 was filled with complex but fundamentally decent people who recognized that everyone is deserving of respect and could disagree without being disagreeable the state did elect walker as governor in and the legislature gutted setting off huge protests in the capitol but i think that state would vote for j turning its 10 electoral votes to a republican for the first time since 1984 come we even voted for as much as trump won the election in lost it her which prided itself on employing all the data wizards and ground game gurus money can did not do nearly enough to lock down the upper particularly and and instead treated those states as a given is the mayor of capital in cerulean county he supported senator sanders in the democratic and said he talked at least once a week with a field organizer from the sanders campaign during the primary but once locked up the it was radio silence from the campaign i first held elected office in the early virtually every presidential been either by the candidate or by a he told me not saying this to say important but the point not only she in the but i never got a a anything after the president by made two campaign stops in during the 2012 including a huge rally with on the before election day frustration with the campaign was apparent understand the strategy never seen an explanation for other than assuming that they wanted not just a but a smashing victory the kind that trump he said voter turnout in 2016 was the lowest been in 20 years roughly 40 , 000 fewer democrats voted in county this year than did in 2012 the drop in turnout in county might be partially attributed to a voter identification law in the state in a federal judge found that roughly 300 , 000 registered voters in lacked the necessary photo id card to vote under the new and a of those voters were low income election watchers have said the voter id law alone could not have flipped the state in favor did not visit once after the democratic national convention in neither did president or sanders made multiple trips to the state on behalf of but that was not enough to gin up enthusiasm like most of the my friends and family in were shocked that trump won the and the election my mom says still in my dad has progressed comfortably to anger my has been coping with the election result with characteristic wit listening to trump speeches about i was convinced to she emailed me i hate throughout the general the surrogates appeared reassured to the point of hubris that they would be able to convert moderate republican voters in suburbs every democrat we lose in western we will pick up two moderate republicans in the suburbs in and you can repeat that in and and new senator chuck said in this line of thinking was not just but disastrously so in won 59 of 72 counties this 59 counties voted for trump republicans successfully built on the map that helped to elect walker to the mansion while the campaign was looking to run up the score in states like and a triumvirate of republicans also helped elect both actively and passively there is who worked his way up from republican politics in to head the republican national and to serve as chief of staff then there is house speaker d who now has a historic opportunity to pass his agenda through congress recovered from his own failed presidential will now oversee the republican governors association is a longtime radio host in who became a voice on the right for the movement after 23 years on the he will retire from his radio show this year along with being a vocal opponent of the trump he has taken on a new role as chief apologizer for media he expressed frustration with his he had gradually grown immune to any inconvenient fact presented to them while he read news from the politico and national review throughout the his audience seemed to glean most of its news from fox talk radio and their feeds on his radio program last played a sound bite of s current head of the national security suggesting the government had made a to sway the election in favor asked his we all agree that this is a big deal and we ought to do something about he opened the phone and the first call was from who believe it i believe any of sighed break through he said is way harder to knock that stuff down than you would he says he is but not to see conservative media falling in line and supporting cabinet picks is the monster he said of the worst elements of the conservative media have now been empowered every one of them has got a strut now has a pipeline to the white house i think about spent half of 2016 arguing that conservatism was fundamentally incompatible with what trump was offering his party conservatism has been i in being aggressive but and very and also proving that you can do things and be rewarded by the he said trump has certainly been aggressive if not very and he has proved that you can run an campaign and still win even in the the i know like to argue about politics in and certainly not at the thanksgiving table we are creatures of we like to make ourselves or others we loathe confrontation but this year seems to bring with it a moral imperative to have uncomfortable conversations about the very real stakes of this election this year we may need to break the worry less about being nice and talk more about what it means to be decent
for the last four new democrats have had to contend with an in a state senate with slightly more democrats than there are how do the republicans manage to hold a the answer often lies with one rogue senator who votes with the republicans and whose heavily overwhelmingly orthodox district in voted just as overwhelmingly for j trump to the endless has never once caucused with members of his own defecting to the other side of the aisle within days of being elected in 2012 this the long electoral migraine did not lift with absentee ballots in two close races on long island still being counted to settle the final senate the democrats would need to win at least one of lure back the independent democratic conference which has teamed up with the republicans to govern the senate for several years and reclaim in order to form a working majority but declined to come revealing on night that he would remain a republican in senate allegiance if not in telling the political television program that he would to have a compelling reason to the republican caucus the mainstream he had fallen short who ran on the republican as well as the conservative and democratic ballot lines for the first time this said the republicans had not promised him anything as the voter rolls have the district which is dominated by and other orthodox residents in the borough and neighborhoods is heavily the better to register influence in city democratic which often determine the outcome of general elections but party affiliation often bows to parochial concerns many of whom send their children to want the state to provide tuition assistance for religious among other and senate republicans have been far more receptive to taking measures that would benefit religious education than the democrats the district went for a by large margins it was also an easy pickup for mitt four years ago allegiance is to their foundational religious practices and not necessarily party said a political consultant who has worked on several races involving orthodox communities democratic leaders have considered trying to oust in a primary battle but his popularity in the district makes him all but immune to challenges said they primary they could say goodbye to any possible rapprochement in the democrats responded on to decision with overt appeals to party unity a given how important going to be to hold the line at the state level against what we expect to be very draconian efforts out of that likely to have a majority of the senate be elected democratic and still not be able to said senator n of who serves as the chief political strategist a spokesman for the said of look forward to continuing to work with him to move this state without the mainstream democrats would need to win the contested long island races and strike a deal with senator d the leader of the independent democrats emerging from election day without much clarity on which party would end up with a numerical both as so often have hastened to pay court to and before ending the suspense about his met with senator the county democrat who leads the mainstream as well as john j the republican senate majority saying as recently as last week that he would join whichever side offered him the he also got a call from gov m a in his efforts to position new as a liberal foil to may have a greater interest than usual in installing a true democratic majority

rural and communities where he operates customers are very said the president of bank work in the oil fields and they hear they are and they just got tired of it being slammed in their he your editors

a panel of three federal judges said on that the 2011 redrawing of state assembly districts to favor republicans was an unconstitutional partisan the first such ruling in three decades of pitched legal battles over the issue federal courts have struck down gerrymanders on racial but not on grounds that they unfairly give advantage to a political party the more common form of gerrymandering the case could now go directly to the supreme where its fate may rest with a single m who has expressed a willingness to strike down partisan gerrymanders but has yet to accept a rationale for it should the court affirm the it could upend the next round of state in for congressional and state elections most of which is likely to be conducted by legislatures that have swept into power in recent years is a huge said heather a law school professor and an expert on election law everyone has waited for the supreme court to do something on this front now one of the lower courts has the debate this were to be a nationwide 2021 would look quite she for the several scholars said the ruling was especially significant because it for the first a clear mathematical formula for measuring partisanship in a something that had been missing in previous assaults on gerrymandering the ruling by the united states district court for the western district of said that the remapping violated both the first amendment and the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment because it aimed to deprive democratic voters of their right to be represented natural political geography plays some role in the apportionment the court simply does not explain adequately the sizable disparate of republican gains in the state assembly after the boundaries were redrawn the judges who ruled in favor of the ripple and were nominated to the bench by presidents and jimmy carter judge nominated by president w dissented the boundaries of both federal and state legislative districts are redrawn every 10 years after the census to ensure that each district contains roughly the same number of a standard the supreme court set with its ruling in 1962 but both republican and democratic majorities in statehouses often remap districts to favor either by cramming opposition voters into a single district or by dividing them so they are the majority in fewer tactics called and courts have generally agreed that some partisan advantage in redistricting is in part because voters themselves are not spread equally across a state or district by party but the plaintiffs in the 12 state democrats represented by the campaign legal had argued that the remapping was among the most sharply partisan in the nation their lawsuit said that in the 2012 elections for the republicans won 48 6 percent of the vote but took 61 percent of the 99 seats a key question in as in past challenges to was whether that division was unacceptably a question that previous courts have stumbled over has come up with a standard to measure constitutionality how to distinguish between evil partisanship versus the natural advantage one party might have as a result of where voters happened to said the director of the election law project at state college of law in the court was swayed by a new and simple mathematical formula to measure the extent of partisan called the efficiency gap the formula divides the difference between the two votes beyond those needed by a winning and votes cast by a losing side by the total number of votes cast when both parties waste the same number of the result is zero an ideal solution but as a winning party wastes fewer and fewer votes than its its score rises a truly efficient gerrymander spreads a winning votes so evenly over districts that very few votes are wasted a review of four decades of state redistricting plans concluded that any party with an efficiency gap of 7 percent or more was likely to keep its majority during the 10 years before new districts were drawn in experts republicans scored an efficiency gap rating of 11 69 percent to 13 percent in the first election after the maps were redrawn in 2011 some experts said the efficiency gap gives gerrymandering opponents

j with his campaign sees an that has for years been taken for granted by weaker nations and is too quick to intervene in intractable conflicts far away but in his final news conference on his last foreign trip as president argued on for a foreign policy in which continues to take on the biggest global problems of the lead where others stand on the sidelines and help the least fortunate pointed out that before the order imposed in large measure by the united states after world war war and famine ravaged the globe he said that while the united states could not maintain global order on its it was the linchpin in ensuring that it continued china is an important he told reporters in the final stop on his but the did not organize the climate help write the agreement to reduce global warming or undertake the negotiations ensuring that all parties agreed to it is a very significant military but not worrying right now about how to rebuild after a hurricane in we his voice rising said a burden that we should carry final overseas trip while in office was supposed to be a valedictory but it has instead been one long exercise in crisis as he seeks to reassure foreign leaders and audiences that trump will not upend alliances and trade relationships that presidents from both major parties have spent decades carefully constructing his toughest task was at a summit meeting of the economic cooperation which helped bring forth the a trade accord that trump has vowed to kill like the rest of has also been made uneasy by the prospect of a sudden shift in united states immigration policy under trump the atmosphere during this trip has been noticeably different from that of previous ones schedule has had surprising when he seemed to have little to and staff members out of their jobs in two months have been unusually somber some of the leaders has met with have grown wistful chancellor of not known for emotional seemed genuinely moved when she said that leave from my partner and it is and on president xi of china commended for his intensive focus on their noting that the two had met nine including three times in 2016 but president v of betrayed no obvious regret when he met with for a few minutes on the sidelines of the summit meeting here has blamed for deepening the humanitarian crisis in and accused it of meddling in the united states election by hacking into the emails of the democratic national committee has praised and has openly called for improving ties both and looked grim in their brief which said was and he said he had asked if they could end the slaughter in or complete an agreement in before left office at its before a brief and probably final handshake ranked the problems resulting from alleged hacking far below those generated by fake news being circulated on social media concern i had has less to do with any particular misinformation or propaganda put out by any particular but a greater concern about the general misinformation from all kinds of on social that make it very difficult for voters to figure out true and said if elections are of fake news and false information and then the issue is not going to be happening on the he added issue is going to be what are we going to be doing to ourselves from the the remarks followed similar comments at a news conference in on in which was sharply critical of the role and other social media companies play in spreading false news a remarkable change in tone for a man who has spent so much of his presidency praising the transformational and beneficial effects of social media mark chief published a detailed post early describing ways the company was considering dealing with the problem of fake news in his news conference on for the first that he would continue to be active politically when his presidency ends he said that at he would some spend time with my and do some do some but he added that he reserved the right to speak out there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislation issue but go to core questions about our values and our and if i think necessary or helpful for me to defend those then examine it when it he said then he to what i do know is that i have to take on

the election of j trump gives the republicans in congress a chance to act on their desire to get rid of a wish that trump mostly says he shares e and the health policy analysts for the then i think safe to say few in congress thought they would have this opportunity but like the proverbial dog who has finally caught the after untold futile republicans have finally come within reach of repealing the affordable care act now comes the essential will they actually do been promising it but i am still skeptical that it will happen i believe you disagree going to let you go first why do you think do i think do it because they so thoroughly own the idea of having passed bills to partly delay or the in the house something like 60 times just the other day senator endorsed repeal the house and senate also agreed to do in large in a budget reconciliation bill earlier this year the only thing that prevented it was that president vetoed it i doubt trump would do the same if given a similar opportunity i know that a budget reconciliation dismantling of the law is not a full because according to the rules it can only touch provisions this excludes things like requiring insurers to take all comers for premiums that vary only by age and smoking status or preventing them from imposing coverage caps and lifetime among other measures i also must add that much less confident of a repeal partial without agreement on a replacement but turn it back to do you think the has to offer a full replacement to get its members to sign on to or can it offer something that would cover fewer people and with fewer i think they can get away with slightly fewer people and somewhat skimpier but not too much a part of me that thinks many in congress were always so willing to vote for a because they knew it had no chance of being signed into law they got credit for the vote without ever having to face the downside actually repealing without replacing would mean effectively stripping more than 20 million people of their health without anything in return this would be an unmitigated political disaster the stories of people with diabetes and more who were suddenly stripped of their insurance and left out in the cold would very likely dominate our discussion for months that leaves more than enough time to lead to significant repercussions in the 2018 midterm elections with no democratic leaders in any branch of government to i think this would be akin to what happened in the 2010 but in reverse if they can coalesce around a plan that leave too many people then i think they could move forward but in all the years since the was republicans been able to do that do you think they what do you think that plan would look one way to get from repeal to replace that minimizes immediate political risk is to pass a plan that call for repeal for several at least after the 2018 though possibly after the 2020 election between now and there would need to be some kind of transition to whatever replaces that just dump people off coverage with no alternative but the alternatives could just be not as comprehensive or costly absolutely there will be bad stories but keep in there will be bad stories under too rocketing huge cost sharing and markets with few choices is not a recipe for political success republicans now own the task of fixing those things and doing so in a way that does not look as if making better actually in a tough policy spot get the blame if they fix or repeal the and get the blame if they replace it with something people like better health policy is a very difficult and thankless task i think opt for something they can call repeal and but they could also just let struggle and die neither looks good one other way to get out from under the issue is to kick it to the states do you think a trump working with a will offer greater flexibility to states to design their own coverage plans that could diverge from if what are some ideas states might i think very likely those in congress could punt to the states for been trying to change funding to a block grant that they can then constrain over time this will be enticing for them because it will allow them to reduce spending in the while forcing states to make the tough decisions and take the blame for cuts in either beneficiaries or services fixing the markets for those who are getting health insurance through the is a different story without some sort of market which generally been opposed the same problems that existed with respect to conditions and individual ratings will exist many people will become uninsured annual and lifetime limits could reappear lots of people will have problems getting insured i have yet to be convinced that a significant number of republicans in the house might coalesce around such a plan maybe for but not sure about the exchanges even if they likely the democrats in the senate would try to filibuster either of these plans you i think democrats would filibuster anything they could the filibuster is not set in stone a senate majority can change and some are already calling for the to do so but that appear to be what the senate will do retain the filibuster this could play to their since they can propose things they let the democrats filibuster them and take the blame when repeal kicks in with no replacement perhaps another way for republicans to get out of their political bind sure have more to discuss as president administration comes into power
four barbers and a firefighter were pondering their future under a trump presidency at the upper barbershop last week got to figure this said one of the barbers got a gangster in the chair he referring to j trump they admitted that they could not complain too only two of them had voted but there were no regrets feel trimming a mustache is tired both of them were terrible they never do anything for us as democrats pick through the wreckage of the one lesson is the election was notable as much for the people who did not show as for those who did about half of eligible voters did not cast ballots a state that had assumed she would historically boasts one of the highest rates of voter this 68 3 percent turnout was the fifth best among the 50 states but by local it was a the lowest turnout in 16 years and those were important trump won the state by just 27 , 000 voters neighborhoods offer one explanation for the turnout figures of the 15 council the decline in turnout from 2012 to 2016 in the five poorest was consistently much greater than the drop seen in more prosperous areas accounting for half of the overall decline in turnout citywide the biggest drop was here in district a stretch of fading wooden sandwich shops and restaurants that is 84 percent black in this voter turnout declined by 19 5 percent from 2012 according to executive director of the city of election commission it is home to some of poorest residents according to a 2016 has one of the highest incarceration rates at upper a bustling barbershop in a wooden talk of politics inevitably comes back to one elections infused many here with a feeling of connection to national politics they had never before experienced but their lives have not gotten appreciably and sourness has set in went to the said owner of the juice a brightly painted shop a few blocks down west north using a metaphor to describe the emotion after election then eight years all four barbers had voted for but only two could muster the enthusiasm to vote this time and even it was a sort of protest one wrote in democratic senator sanders of the other wrote in himself so said who had written in sanders he said no president in his lifetime had done anything to improve the lives of black including whom he voted for twice like i should have known this would happen worse off than but did do something did give black people something to aspire to a lot happy my son was able to see a black who has been trimming beards and mustaches for 30 had hoped his small business would get easier to run but it us or a he trimming the mustache of a firefighter from the neighborhood his biggest issue was health insurance lost his coverage after his divorce three years ago and has struggled to find a policy he could afford he finally found which starts but costs too much at a month none of this been he said he did not vote of the election said other factors contributed to the decline in turnout this was the first general election under new state laws that required voters to produce an approved photo id and that stiffened the requirements for new voters to prove their residence this was particularly onerous for the who move often said he believed this change had cost several thousand people in the city their vote me very he said takes away from the fairness and integrity of the although two federal district courts had ruled that the photo id law discriminated against who disproportionately lack the approved the law was applied on election day after an appeals court stayed one of the decisions gov a republican who backed the has said they have no impact on voter and allowed that their effect on turnout would not have erased victory in the state perhaps the biggest drags on voter turnout in as in the rest of the were the candidates themselves to it was like having to choose between broccoli and liver felt said who works the grill at delicatessen and says he did not vote were stuck between trump and they really left us with no an avid supporter of spent months trying to convince him to vote for her but he could not get over his revulsion at what he saw as trust issues related to the foundation grandfather pushed him toward but he found him even less he thought would be a good candidate would you vote for he said in a loud voice to a line of customers vote for said a financial services worker waiting for her sandwich has a level head and few of the men and women interviewed on west north street last week had voted for though many said they admired him spoke his mind he was i would have i would have voted for said a security guard working the evening shift at a business i loved as for countries probably have respected us because we had a woman running the he said one exception was who said he voted for trump as a protest against he blamed her policies for putting him in prison for 20 years as for the claims of racism that have dogged so worried better than smiling to my face but going behind closed doors and voting against our he said a program coordinator at a local agreed was unlike a lot of liberal democrats who are just as but keep it he his jaw slathered with shaving cream can reason with them all day but they think they know it all they want to have control that they know best for he voted for as did many others here upper gets busier as the day wears on children come in after school stopped by the barbershop for a visit everybody agreed they would miss ms rogers said had aged a lot like having a bunch of bad she said probably done take them back to their was trying to imagine trump as president white house is going to be the he adding that trump would be like in with parties in the mansion and exotic animals roaming around the grounds he comes home and finds his wife cheating on he could just go to they were laughing but they were also worried going to mess with us on some racist said a barber who did not vote already appointed a known he referring to k chief strategist and the former head of which has been denounced as a white nationalist hate site with so many people sitting in his chair over the has developed a keen sense of where society is headed but now he is stumped was a weird he holding a set of clippers and looking pensive tell on minds there are less cars out there no one wants to come out no one knows what comes he trump even
the mark went on his vast social network to convince an expanding chorus of critics including the departing president of the united states that he wants to combat the that is running wild across his site and and turning our politics into a paranoiac fantasy come to life been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility he wrote made significant but there is more work to be he listing various steps was like making it easier to report bad information and enlisting organizations it was heartening to especially after his earlier assertion that it was to believe that misinformation on had affected the presidential election in any real way despite copious evidence that it was disturbingly in the whether it directly swung the result or not but as went on to say that had to be careful not to mistakenly block he added do not want to be arbiters of truth which was why he said would continue to rely on community and trusted third his statement pointed up how much struggles to find the balance between its mission to be a utopia for its 1 8 billion users and its responsibility to protect them from all that is dangerous terrorist and untrue but more to the it appeared to buy into the notion that truth is relative at a time when that notion has to finally go away do you really need an outside arbiter to determine whether a video suggesting without basis that was involved in john f fatal plane crash in 1999 should be allowed to truth need arbiters it needs defenders and it needs them now more than ever as the democracy staggers into its next uncertain phase with a mainstream news media that works hard to separate fact from fiction under economic and political which has contributed to that economic threat by gobbling up so much of the advertising market is going to have a special responsibility to do its part just imagine what things will look like if the unsavory elements that tore through the 2016 election false fake news and aggressive efforts to traditional journalism come back into play as j trump presses to enact his agenda if the past week provided any indication of where politics are the next four years are going to require an effort to keep the national conversation honest the national security adviser trump named last t a retired army lieutenant has subscribed to the conspiracy theory that law is taking root in the united states contributing to his insistence that have every reason to view as he recently used twitter to circulate a fake news item that the federal bureau of investigation was sitting on evidence from laptop that would and her crew away for nominee for attorney senator sessions of has falsely claimed that hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants are successfully crossing the border annually then there was the announcement by the conspiracy theorist that trump had called to thank him and his radio and audience for their support in the campaign add to that the fact that trump was the most prominent promoter of the false notion that president born and hesitate to repeat the outrageous suggestion that the father of senator was linked to the assassination of president john f then consider what it may look like when trump pursues policies regarding immigrants and undocumented immigrants not so outlandish to envision attempts to sell his plans getting a lift from the likes of or a fake site out of perhaps claiming that democrats are working with to use undocumented immigrants to poison local water supplies or some such president seemed to have had something like that in mind when he told reporters in on we are not serious about facts and true and and we discriminate between serious arguments and then we have knows of what he speaks he had to muddle through the first wave of this you might remember how his health care plan was marred by a false accusation that the plan included death panels that would decide who lived and who died based on their of productivity to as former gov put it her the false allegation was partly based on proposals to reimburse doctors for optional consultations with families over care decisions the accusations took on such power that even newt signed on to the falsehood despite the fact that he had previously expressed bullish support for planning explained himself in a 2009 letter to the new news including this debunked the myth but the authors stripped out the provision just the same and by then the fiction had negated any shot at a ideological debate as who was the chief communications strategist at the so grimly put it to me last death panels were the canary in the coal mine about the coming death of things have advanced since then fake news is limited only by the imaginations of its inventors and the number of shares it can garner on or twitter the one million shares of the preposterous notion that secretly sold weapons to news which has excelled at illuminating the fake news problem highlighted that example in its alarming analysis showing that during the campaign cycle fake news was shared among users more often than real news why people who care about the truth journalists social media giants like too will have to come up with a solution to this informational fast easier said than done the combination of attacks seeking to serious news organizations and a drop in overall trust in the news media has made many people wary of legitimate as my colleague john noted last politicized voices can easily drown honest journalism all too easily on social media there is growing talk of an ambitious journalistic collaboration to beat back the tide industry thinkers and leaders are coming together to brainstorm as the city university of new journalism and the have done them out and say high time that television news with its audiences gets into the act with more than just token gestures at but this much seems the moment calls for some sort of counterinsurgency that treats every false as a baby to be killed in its crib with irrefutable facts so roll

at first the election of j trump would seem to be bad news for but there is a chance that on things could work out surprisingly well for the clerics leaders stress that they pay little heed to what happens in the united that they pride themselves on their independence makes no difference for who the next president the supreme ayatollah said in a speech last week yet he could hardly miss promises on the campaign trail to the landmark nuclear agreement reached last which he frequently described as the worst deal ever in ayatollah said recently that if trump tore it will set fire to but trump also presents new opportunities for many analysts say while he has criticized the nuclear he has also said that the united states should stop backing rebels in and focus on the state militant group effectively shifting its support to ally in president if that said an associate professor of north studies at the university of will be good for the region and the with its ally has supported throughout the which started in morally financially and militarily over 400 and afghan soldiers have died in the according to official statistics such a change would come from of all it would be professor said in the larger is waiting and hoping for the day the united states packs up and leaves the middle closing its military bases in the region and moving its aircraft carriers out of the gulf while that seems trump has demonstrated an isolationist streak in questioning the value of and the nuclear umbrella over south and japan should stop threatening professor said the united states under trump is more he will find that will respond in even with the nuclear things could ultimately break way last 76 national security experts signed a report urging trump to keep the deal and even some republicans in congress and groups that had opposed the deal urged trump to go slowly and consider other ways to pressure on the house of representatives did just voting overwhelmingly to extend some sanctions for an additional 10 years even if the agreement is eventually ripped might still stand to gain it has already received tens of billions of dollars in frozen is selling oil on the world market and is cutting deals with businesses if were to reimpose sanctions on it is doubtful that the other world powers that are signatories to the deal would go along the one area where both and the united states stand to lose ground is in personal something that was virtually nonexistent after the 1979 revolution during the two years of negotiations on the nuclear secretary of state john and the foreign developed a strong personal relationship in front of the cameras at they slapped each joked and seemed to get along very a breakthrough for two countries that do not even have embassies in each capitals trump has not yet decided on his secretary of but with people like w a former mayor of new and john r a former united nations being it seems unlikely that the same level of personal rapport will be matched face the honeymoon is said an economist close to president two guys and their teams have talked for hundreds of in a period of two years who can replace an analyst close to the reformist movement of and knew each other for years is of descent has hosted in his home in new when he was an ambassador to the united nations you can be sure such relations are now a thing of the past with the names that are being mentioned out of does stand to lose a lot if the nuclear deal is rescinded since the has returned to world oil providing income for who also have gotten access to some of their frozen funds abroad business delegations are pouring and is even planning to purchase 117 aircraft planes that will also bring business culture to at the same large international banks are still not providing any line of credit to nor are they allowing bank transfers out of fear of trespassing unilateral sanctions on although the administration is working to clear up ambiguities that are holding back a republican administration is likely to halt those efforts some analysts adhere to the traditional saying that enmity toward has never only the conditions surrounding the relationship difference is now that because of all the regional there are chances for both of us for in and for said a political analyst means that because of our any president has to keep dealing with be it normal have their own ideas about many seeing him as a harbinger of chaos the of countries that have suffered at the machinations of colonialism and western power plays is conducive to grand policies and conspiracy theories in power behind the scenes have brought this trump to solve the greatest said a wealthy farmer will see bloodshed and chaos with this man at the mark my
three days after the presidential an astute law professor tweeted a picture of three very slightly from our published in 1998 it was thousands of generating a run on the book its ranking soared on amazon and by end it was no longer available university press is reprinting the book for the first time since a spokeswoman for the publisher worth rereading those tweeted an pragmatist died in 2007 were he still likely be deluged with phone calls from begging him to pick their stocks when our came it received a mixed critical reception writing for this the critic called the book but took umbrage at warnings about the vulnerability to the charms of a calling this prophesy form of intellectual j trump enthusiasts might dispute the word strongman but the essence of argument holds up surprisingly well where others saw positive trends a dawn chorus praising the diversity saw dead canaries in a coal mine his basic contention is that the left once upon a time believed that our for all its was both perfectible and worth perfecting hope was part of its core philosophy but during the shame over over the serial humiliation of transformed a good portion of the at least the academic into a disaffected gang of rather than agitators for change a formalized despair became its philosophy the system was beyond reform the best one could do was focus on its victims the result was disastrous the alliance between the unions and so vital to passing legislation in the progressive broke down in cultural and identity politics replaced the politics of change and economic justice by when gave three lectures that make up the spine of our few of his academic he were talking about reducing poverty at all is setting up a program in unemployed homeless or he the the and the residents of trailer parks are not in the relevant does this overlooked category sound did not deny that identity politics reduced the suffering of minorities but it just so happened that at the very moment accepted good

its destiny and make itself a better sounds an awful lot like make great again at the was staring at a slightly different political landscape but it that ultimately just has more mature trees in our he wrote about the perils of the north free trade probably have cautioned against the partnership in our railed against the pat who in 1991 talked about building a fence at the today would have railed against trump and his proposed wall could not the he the mounting rage of the newly is his analysis a bit yes even within there have always been optimistic champions of those who believe in the moral arc bending toward justice and work on formulating actionable policies that would make the country more just by focusing only on his own arguments also seem strangely parochial during the the academic

did and she was in favor of the partnership until she was against it in a paid speech to a she spoke of a common for energy and though her slogan was her campaign was ultimately predicated on celebrating in the hope that disparate voting blocs would come out and vote for her most inflammatory words are most and also most cultural left has a vision of an in which the white patriarchs have stopped voting and have left all the voting to be done by members of previously victimized tried this strategy it win her the electoral college left wants to preserve otherness rather than ignore he also wrote that work either people are furiously arguing about what played a key role in this election whether it was white a racist backlash or terror about the pace of cultural change it seems reasonable to think that all three played a part so striking about our is that it blends these theories into a common the both cultural and eventually abandoned economic justice in favor of identity leaving too many people feeling freaked out or ignored is as if the left could not handle more than one initiative at a wrote if it either had to ignore stigma in order to concentrate on or vice you

in for the first the census bureau counted more people living in urbanized than in the countryside this been a rural nation ever since yet the idea of agrarian has receded slowly despite demographic change we still romanticize the family though relatively few of them exist anymore we view even suburbia in pastoral terms the as the historian t put it as the recent electoral college results make we still live with political institutions that have baked in a distinctly by design the democratic candidate for president has now won the popular vote in six of the last seven elections but in part because the system empowers rural for the second time in that the candidate who garnered the most votes will not be president rural even as it laments its economic retains vastly disproportionate electoral strength rural voters were able to nudge j trump to power despite large margins in cities like new in a house of representatives that structurally disadvantages democrats because of their tight urban rural voters helped republicans hold their cushion in the the least populous states are now more overrepresented than ever before and the growing unity of rural as a voting bloc has converted the rural bias in national politics into a potent republican advantage talking about a political system that skews not as important if there a major cleavage between rural and urban voting said a professor of government and politics at the university of urban and rural voting behavior is so starkly different now so that this has major political consequences for who has power not just in terms of policy she continued pervasively advantages republicans in maintaining control of the national the electoral college is just one example of how an increasingly urban country has inherited the political structures of a rural past states containing just 17 percent of the a historic can theoretically elect a senate lee said the bias also shapes the house of representatives it as a in the formulas that determine where highway funds are spent or who gets homeland security dollars it exists in state where bills preferred by urban delegations have been much more likely to be rejected the influence of rural voters also evokes deeply rooted ideals about who have power in and argued that the strength of the nation would always derive from its agrarian soil had this vision of what they called the this person who owed nothing to who receive any payments from the who live by a but who could support himself and his family on a farm growing everything they needed and that these were the people who were going to be the backbone of said a political scientist at the university of describing what could be the forefathers of the rural voters who tilted this election when the framers of the constitution were still debating the shape of institutions we have 95 percent of was as the 1790 census classified the population the compromise at the time created the one chamber granting equal voice to every state to counterbalance the where more populous states spoke louder and they made sure the compromise stuck equal state representation in the senate is the only provision in the constitution that remains singled out for protection from the amendment no state can lose its full complement of senators without its permission but even as a deliberately undemocratic the senate has slipped further out of alignment with the population over time the senate simply favored sparsely populated politicians in sparsely populated states to leverage the skewed power we talk about all of that was an intentional policy said a political scientist at the university of republicans in congress passed the 1862 homestead offering free land to settlers who would move to territories that would eventually become states creating more senate seats and electoral college votes for a republican party eager to keep government control away from southern democrats they even managed to divide the territory into two worth twice the political power as the plains later depopulated and then the senate became even more unrepresentative suspicion of big cities also appears in the sites of state and not new city and not st and not political scientists at the university of have found that most state capitals were located near what was then the population centroid of each state typically closer to the geographical center of the and not the place where the most people already breaking with how much of the world sited its capitals the state legislatures there also grew significantly less representative as urbanized in when lawyers in brought what would be a seminal case before the supreme court challenging the the state legislature had not reapportioned its districts to reflect population change in 60 years was still using districts drawn in 1867 even states that had constitutions requiring equal population districts were ignoring them and new gave small counties 100 times the voting power of the most populous ones decades ago in county had the same representation in the senate as county a population over six justified it because that was a cultural it was just the way things said a professor of government rural legislators had no incentive to change a system that favored them just let it keep getting worse in power why by the no state approximated majority rule at the and m wrote in their book end of had some of the most unequal representation in the world a series of supreme court cases beginning with that complaint upended this system and established the standard that equal representation means one not one one vote or one one senator only the united states protected by the remained unchanged the house retains a rural bias republican voters are more efficiently distributed across the country than who are concentrated in cities that means that even when democrats win 50 percent of voters they invariably hold fewer than 50 percent of house regardless of partisan gerrymandering the electoral college then allocates votes according to a congressional one house representative and two gets three representatives and two gets 55 those two senators effectively give three times more power in the electoral college than its population would suggest apply the same math to and it would have 159 electoral college votes and the entire state of already has fewer residents than the average congressional district in these imbalances directly influence who gets through minimums state can receive below a certain share of education and through formulas that privilege rural states road spending was doled out in part by land area and not road there are policy reasons that the country might want to disproportionately spend resources on places with few people repairing an interstate highway in rural keeps national commerce flowing and when the private market build essential public investments like the new rural electrification help fight poverty but even when you control for policy research has found that a significant rural bias in resources persists you can see it in homeland security funding that gave for seven times as much money per capita as new after the sept 11 terrorist attacks you can see it in proposed to that has so much disproportionate power in the negotiation over funds that in order for to get gets a lot to the point of not knowing what to spend the money these calculations also mean that populous states subsidize less populous which receive more resources than the tax dollars they send to the challenge for rural voters now is that their electoral and even these funding have not translated into policies that have fixed the deep economic problems they from high unemployment to declining wages and unclear how trump will do that for either even if his major infrastructure proposal comes to pass and helps rebuild their roads if he rural voters may stray from his party again in that the rural bias in politics would persist but democrats might yet have a chance to blunt its effects

the growing arsenal of for a top post in his including director of national intelligence overseeing all 16 intelligence agencies admiral rogers met with trump on apparently without the white knowledge the recommendation to remove admiral a career intelligence officer who was promoted to his posts by the administration two years came last month from defense secretary b carter and the current director of national r clapper administration and intelligence who insisted on anonymity to detail the private said the recommendation that admiral rogers be removed was not related to interest in hiring him they it was driven by breaches during admiral tenure at the and his leadership of the agency the white house and the pentagon declined to comment on admiral fate reached by phone on admiral rogers declined to comment the effort to force out admiral which was first reported by the puts trump in the position of considering whether to as the man who would brief him on intelligence matters each a admiral whom the white house is considering relieving of his posts it also raises the question of why would consider firing one of the top intelligence officers in the last days of his administration admiral replacement would not be confirmed until after trump takes over one senior intelligence official argued that letting word of the effort leak seemed more about politics or vengeance than about effecting any real change representative of the chairman of the house intelligence committee and a member of transition strongly defended admiral rogers in a letter to carter and asked them to testify before his committee to explain why they want to push rogers out not by accident that admiral rogers meets with the and two days later this which is completely built on said in a short interview carter and clapper had submitted a formal recommendation to the white house to split the which conducts foreign surveillance and secures military from the command but there are questions inside the giant complex at fort where the and command are about whether the military is ready to survive on its own it relies heavily on the talent of the which dates back to the early who has begun filling the top echelons of his national security team with met with admiral rogers on at trump tower in new senior defense department and intelligence officials were surprised that admiral while on personal had paid a visit to trump first major disagreement with admiral rogers dates to the fall of when he expressed mounting frustration that which is responsible for offensive action against was not acting aggressively enough to disrupt the networks in and in the carter said for the first time that the united states was using its against the state but the effort was moving too slowly for the pentagon and carter went to fort several weeks ago to give admiral rogers and his team kick in the one official said top national security officials had also come to see admiral rogers as lacking leadership at a moment of wrenching change for the he took command after the disclosures of widespread surveillance by j the former and the efforts he directed to seal up the agency proved they said that perception was underlined by the disclosure in that the had secretly arrested a former t martin and was investigating whether he had stolen and disclosed highly classified computer code developed by the agency to hack into the networks of foreign governments martin was charged with theft of government property and the unauthorized removal or retention of classified documents administration officials had planned to relieve admiral rogers of his duties after the election and announce a plan to create separate chains of command for the and command but the supported by carter and stalled in part because of opposition from senator john republican of who heads the armed services committee under the command would remain under the armed services but oversight of the would shift to the senate intelligence committee victory complicated the planning on one major trump and admiral rogers disagree quite publicly while trump has insisted that no one knows whether was responsible for the hacking of email accounts of the democratic national committee and a range of prominent formal admiral rogers has said he has no doubt he recently said that was not something that was done this was not something that was done by this was not a target that was selected purely he was a conscious effort by a to attempt to achieve a specific coming into the admiral rogers said one of his top goals was to make sure that on the united states had consequences for the attackers in he proposed a series of possible options to respond to the which intelligence in a public said the leadership had to have been aware of but the white house rejected the fearing that they could start an escalating that the united states might not be able to win decisively

here are the top 10 comments of the week on our digital as selected by our readers and the journalists who moderate nearly every comment 1 this is what unqualified looks like never expected to win and never planned to govern he just loved the adulation he got from spreading his brand of hate now we have a completely unprepared administration trying desperately to do in 7 weeks what it should have been preparing for over the last 18 months the disaster begins 2 it seems that billy bush has been one of the few to be held accountable for his words and participation in the onslaught of racism and misogyny in the campaign and now appointments all others are ascending to the highest offices in the land as a teacher i am already seeing the repercussions of having individuals in high office have no consequences for their bigoted remarks when a student in my diverse classroom does not understand why it is hurtful to yell the in the middle of class i can blame our leaders the misogyny will continue if we do not hold people accountable 3 someone who understands the threat that poses to the west avoid the mistakes of and other countries where the dominating instincts of the most dangerous religion have been allowed to flourish 4 i find it really ironic that all the groups that think they have a mandate to enforce are so intolerant of controversial views and people that run counter to their own maybe the moral and ethical standards of are not that repugnant in the like trump who has said some unfortunate as has that he if political correctness gets pushed to the business and progress grinds to a halt in fear of legal accusations that become paralyzing how many lives have to be ruined by such enforced and what about the controversial manipulators on the other side like who will hold them to 5 infrastructure child tax paid maternity leave and dismantling trade sounds a bit like some of platform slice and dice identity politics are all well and good in the it is all about the economy and too many of our fellow citizens are hurting wake and return to the or continue to lose 6 this sad news hurts like the loss of a family member clarity and moderate tone brought so much to the frantic scene this is the worst possible moment to lose her special gift for analyzing politics and bringing contending parties together in a civil conversation 7 i am considering many grad schools in the for my master course next fall before the i only looked at the the the requirements and the fee and campus life i really have to think about the safety as an i expect anyone to stop me in the street and tell me to get back to china i am not so although i was so sure about some schools in and i have to sit down once and closely look at the and hope that they are not too red this election changed my mind about 8 for a you are a white male somewhere in who just lost his job at a factory your mortgage is in your car is being and you wonder whether be able to find a much less one that pays a decent wage you have no particular animosity towards but you constantly hear the message that as a straight you are the paragon of privilege and that the hardships in your life are irrelevant or made up you feel so privileged are your struggles and fears really so different from those of the minority easy to see why that person voted for the candidate who acknowledged his fears and against the candidate who dismissed his concerns because he was not a minority 9 less patient with sexism and talking down and more likely to stand up for others the day after the all of the young women in my office dressed in head to toe black no one no one knew that the other women would be dressed but we all were sending a conscious message of and it was comforting to see and feel that kind of solidarity 10 this is a what locker room talk should be

if they squint hard they can see hope in the form of an ambitious piece of legislation like a big tax cut then there is the fact that will not be president and mike the faithfully conservative vice is there to keep watch those conservatives who insisted that electing j trump president would be a grievous mistake a group that included radio prominent columnists and some of the most savvy political operators in the country are now saying they see an upside to four years of a trump white house but even as they find small those who counted themselves part of the trump opposition are wondering what their place will be for the next four years in a republican party they can hardly recognize and they have begun to ponder what it all means for a conservative movement they thought they understood better said the radio host who became a vocal opponent of during the republican primaries he was describing how he had arrived at peace with the election he he realized that he had not done so at all kind of have to a lot of what you thought about the shape of he said not just that that you fundamentally misread what what is so disorienting for many conservatives is that the trump victory was the culmination of the unruly populist upwelling in first manifested in the tea party that traditional republicans thought they could eventually absorb those forces have overtaken them one by one first claiming their house majority then their john a and then an entire field of presidential candidates now it may claim their party some on team are already boasting how they plan to break with decades of conservative orthodoxy on government spending and pursue a huge infrastructure spending package that sounds more than conservatives are going to go k senior counselor and chief gleefully told the reporter in an interview published negative interest rates throughout the the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything get them all jacked said who has aimed almost as much fire at what he regards as establishment republicans as he has at democrats will be as exciting as the greater than the some conservatives say they could surely live with a few of the proposals of they find like a big spending especially if they come with sweeteners like tax breaks or spending cuts in other areas the easiest way to forge many are is to disassociate the man from the policy will do everything i can to help said senator republican of south who has refused on numerous other occasions to help including voting for him or attending the republican national convention graham told reporters on capitol hill this week that he believed he could work with trump on issues like the military which both men support expanding for the political advocacy group supported by and that decided not to spend any money on the presidential race this year despite spending tens of millions to help mitt in is also cracking the door to trump the declined to say whether it had met or spoken to anyone inside transition team encouraged on several fronts by the possibility of the republican congress working with the new said for citing the prospect of repealing some of president energy policies along with the affordable care act but as with any period of acceptance comes in different ways some find catharsis in writing others console themselves in data that show they really were not all that wrong then there are those who still talk as if they are in they have good days and bad days goes said bill the weekly standard editor and leading who has written columns about his coming to terms with trump any given said in an he feels a range of competing sentiments sort of somewhere between but and but he using modified versions of famous quote about how he approached negotiating with the soviets on the subject of it is hard not to talk to conservatives today about trump and not have them wistfully invoke their said he feared people were drawing parallels to trump that risk setting the wrong standards for success revolution that he beat jimmy carter in he said that i love that the revolution was that he governed successfully for eight years and won the cold others are concerned that the conservative movement missed an opportunity to appeal to a younger and more diverse group of voters and they wonder how it will do so with someone as divisive as trump atop the republican party a conservative radio host in and prominent pointed to the tens of thousands of voters in and states trump barely won who voted in other races but did not cast a vote for evidently because they could not bring themselves to vote for him not lightning in a he making the point that trump repelled so many voters that he almost lost like you showed up for work and they said this is your last paycheck and you and your wife go to las put it all on black and it pays the radio personality in said he at least felt liberated by not supporting trump he does not feel compelled to defend him like so many of his conservative friends do has been writing a new which he tentatively titled the right lost its but he is struggling to finish it i thought it was going to have a different he asking aloud what he still struggles with did this who are your what do they actually

something is deeply wrong when the reputation and influence can be borrowed by a source that describes itself as fantasy news to claim that he has endorsed a presidential and then be through a million individual shares the attention paid to fake news since the election has focused largely on fabrications and outright because they are easy to identify and extraordinarily viral fake news is created by the kinds of people when might call their work or admit that in it for the money or for the thrill of deception theirs is a behavior that can and should be and that is and maybe to deal with for many and especially opponents of j the attention paid to fake news and its role in the election has provided a small the discovery of the error that explains everything but as the attention has spread widely even president talked passionately about it on it may lead to an unwanted outcome for those who see it not just as an but also as a way to correct the course it misunderstands a new media world in which every and is at risk of being not by argument but by sheer force false news stories posted on websites were prevalent in this election were widely shared political videos some styled as newscasts containing outright image posted by individuals and shared by and endlessly shared quotes and video clips of the candidates themselves repeating falsehoods during the months i spent talking to partisan page operators for a magazine article this it became clear that while the ecosystem contained easily identifiable and intentional it contained much more of something else i recall a conversation with a fact checker about how to describe a posted on a website and promoted on a page copied from another site by overseas contractors it tried to cast suspicion on the father of a slain who had spoken out against j trump the overarching claims of the story were disingenuous and the facts it included had been removed from all useful context and placed in a sinister its insinuating mention of in proximity to mentions of and its misleading and strategic mention of amounted to a repulsive smear it was a story that appealed to bigoted ideas and that would clearly appeal to those who held them this was a story the likes of which was an enormous force in this clearly designed to function well within economy of sharing and it probably would not run afoul of the narrow definition of stories like that one get to the heart of the rhetorical and strategic risk of holding up as a broad media offensive especially after an election cycle characterized by the euphoric inversion of rhetoric by some of and by the candidate himself as the campaign criticism of trump was instantly projected back at his or at the critics themselves puppet no puppet the this tactic was used on the language of social which was appropriated by opponents and redeployed in an open effort to sap its power while simultaneously taking advantage of what power it retained were cast as the real racists progressives were cast as secretly regressive on their own terms this was not a new but it was newly effective it matter that its targets knew that it was a a clear bid for power rather than an attempt to engage or reason the referees called but nobody could hear them over the roar of the crowds or maybe they but realized that nobody could make them listen as shorthand will almost surely be returned upon the media tenfold the fake news as widely understood and has already begun to encompass not just fabricated but a wider swath of traditional media on and elsewhere fox fake news misleading claims about ford keeping jobs in fake news the entirety of fake news this wide formulation of will be applied back to the traditional news which does not yet understand how threatened its ability is to declare things even when they are may try to address the narrow version of the the clearly fabricated posts has plenty of tools at its disposal and has already promised to use to bar sites that have been flagged as promoting falsified content from using its advertising platform but the worst identified defenders make their money outside anyway another narrow response from could be to assert editorial control over external forces tried to a very limited with trending topics members of the editorial staff wrote descriptions of trending news accompanied by links they deemed credible this initiative collapsed in a frenzy of bias accusations and political fear but it is easy to imagine a system in which a upon reaching some high threshold of or a upon reaching some cumulative could be audited and declared unreliable this could resemble experiment to tag satire articles as such a number of narrow measures could stop a fake story about the for example but where would that leave the rest of the answered and and barely better positioned against everything else that remained it would be a news environment in which almost everything there before remained the main difference being that it would have all been not fake is a place where people construct and project identities to family and peers it is a marketplace in which news is valuable mainly to the extent that it serves those identities it is a system built on ranking and vetting and and yet one where negative inputs are scarcely and where conflict is resolved with isolation that provisions for open conflict on a platform present any easy for it has been a source of constant fake news operations are closely aligned with the experienced incentives of the economy more than most of the organizations that are identifying them their removal will be an improvement the outrage at their mere and at their promotion on a platform with the stated goal of connecting the will have been justified but the outrage is at risk of being and will be followed by the realization that the colloquial the amateur and for which truth is defined first in personal and political and which must only meet the bar of not being demonstrably false will continue growing gaining authority by sheer not despite but because of it the company that created the system that resulted in hoax news stories should try to eliminate and with any luck it will but the system stands to remain intact media companies have spent years looking to waiting for the company to present a solution to their mounting business concerns or perhaps because its being credited with causing those concerns some have come to the realization that this was even absurd those who expect the operator of the dominant media ecosystem of our in response to getting caught promoting to suddenly return authority to the companies it has superseded are in for a similar surprise

political opponents pressed him on the claims during the trump doubled saying he would eventually reopen trump university something i could have settled many trump said during a debate in could settle it right now for very little but i want to do it out of he people that took the course all signed most many many signed report cards saying it was it was it was but the position of trump and his legal

the united states is a leader in technology but it may well be a laggard when it comes to using technology for political mischief the role that fake news stories on sites in particular played in last presidential election continues to be a issue did fake news tip the balance in the can do more to prevent fake should executives dispute the notion that fake news on the social network might have swayed voters but political analysts say the warning signs of this debate could be seen in other countries years ago take the where a spokesman for its shared on an image of a girl believed to have been raped and killed by a drug dealer checkers later revealed that the photo had come from and mark write the role of fake news posted to in the recent presidential election is likely to be debated for even years but there is little doubt that the social media network has had plenty of influence in a reminder to register to vote contributed to significant increases in voter registration across the according to officials in nine states in that did not dispute their conclusion
the early stock market reaction to j election victory was overwhelmingly positive but that mean a trump presidency will be good for the economy stock markets often serve as an economic increasing stock prices are equated with economic victory but these inferences are too because some increases connote good while others do not reading market movements such as the steep rise in stock prices in the early as well as the subsequent ups and downs requires a stone constructing one takes an understanding of what drives stock prices and how that relates to the overall health of the economy buying stock in a company entitles the owner to a percentage of present and future profits the share price should be equivalent to a prediction of what these future profits will be the and stock when they excel because these stocks are traded assets and all traders can contribute to the overall prediction if traders feel stock prices are low relative to future they will bid up if they feel prices are they will sell and drive down prices in this the final price represents a collective prediction by the entire market an increase in stock prices therefore signals an expected increase in future profits the movement in stock prices has a direct shareholders are immediately wealthier anyone holding a retirement portfolio knows the feeling of reading stock price movements through the narrow lens of how well you can retire this does not benefit all people in the economy some shares are held by citizens of other and the shares held in this country are not equitably held but at the a surge in stock prices equals more wealth for the citizenry but rising stock prices can spell good news for other even many of those who do not own stocks can expect a brighter future this is because when companies consumers frequently also do well this notion can be somewhat counterintuitive after we often reflexively assume that when businesses make more they do so at our that by overcharging us in a the interests of companies and consumers are aligned businesses profit when customers enthusiastically buy their higher profits mean happier customers the economy as a whole is doing well by way of suppose apple unveils a new that buoys its stock price traders are bullish about the robust sales they are focused on the fact that these sales add to coffers but each assuming consumers are choosing is also presumably producing joy for consumers this example also makes clear when the stock market can be a poor scoreboard for the economy sometimes companies can profit without improving or possibly even by worsening them for part of the stock surge after the election most likely occurred because of a widely held belief that a trump administration would slash regulations that may be good for some bottom but is that good for everyone it depends do those regulations hinder only products that were profitable and good for or do they also hinder products that are bad for take the case of wells which was recently found to have created millions of accounts in names without their knowledge these accounts were profitable for wells but surely not good for consumers the extent of this behavior was uncovered because of the work of a regulatory the consumer financial protection bureau election increases the possibility that the bureau will be shut down or that its powers will be curtailed but if this prospect raises the value of bank stocks because it makes it more likely that behavior like wells can hardly cause for celebration and not good news for the economy in whether a rise in stock prices is good or bad for depends on whether the increase in profits arises because companies are serving consumers or because they are profiting at expense there is a final factor to the capacity of traders to make predictions about future profits is limited in then a doctoral student in economics at and now a principal at noticed something funny about stock prices on made a bid for

how trump could unify a bitterly divided provide jobs to many of the millions of disaffected workers who voted for and lift the stock market and tax rolls all he needs to do is what he presumably does build something and i mean a few miles of asphalt or a paint job on a rusting bridge build something something can be proud of something that will repay the investment many times over for generations to come build the equivalent of the golden gate the the tunnel or the timberline lodge or given passion for the another state park black course the first public golf course to host the prestigious united states open all of these are public works projects that are still in use can anyone name even one infrastructure project from president billion recovery and reinvestment i think so in fairness to republicans in congress bitterly opposed his public works spending and he lamented there were too few projects that stop franklin his public works administration and works progress using combinations of public and private solicited proposals from states and hired millions of workers and eventually built 78 , 000 650 , 000 miles of 700 miles of airport 13 , 000 playgrounds and 125 , 000 military and civilian including more than 40 , 000 schools in most cases to high standards of quality and design the federal government built the la national and international the upper locks and the power project on the the f bridge in new and the keys overseas highway most are still in use today to a large this is the infrastructure that made to borrow catchphrase what accomplished said a sociology professor at state university and author of the books solving the economic crisis through civic and extreme but not so much the numbers people remember today people just know there was an alphabet soup of he said they see and remember are the the bay national airport or the baseball stadium in living on that legacy repealing lowering taxes for businesses and mostly wealthy overhauling the immigration system and privatizing what congressional republicans have cited as their top legislative priorities would be divisive in a nation bitterly split along partisan and geographic lines but nearly everyone agrees that has grossly neglected its infrastructure even as the rest of the notably has raced ahead airports are like from a trump said at university during the first presidential debate land at la you land at you land at you land at and you come in from and and you see these incredible you come in from you see these incredible and you land become a who could also called for a big increase in infrastructure spending single best thing the federal government can do to promote economic growth is to repair and build the transportation the railroads and said roger an emeritus professor of economics at and a senior fellow at the institute for economic policy research been neglected for 30 last author of the book roads that built a history of the interstate highway and a white house adviser on transportation issues for president h w navigated the country in a 1949 commodore on a mission to investigate the state of infrastructure was trying to see if this was really a crisis or a media he told me this week from where working on the rail project found out pretty dire in terms of total infrastructure for a nation that leads the world in global our systems are trump has pledged trillion over 10 but no one i spoke to thought that was enough doubling that would be more said and campaign proposal was limited to infrastructure projects that could pay for themselves out of user which seems like a shortsighted approach most economists say the best way to finance a big public works particularly given low interest would be for the government to borrow most of the money from investors pulling off something on the scale of the public works programs would be no small feat recent federal infrastructure including reconstruction after hurricanes and as well as the stimulus hardly inspire confidence a professor of history at said he doubted trump could replicate achievements had a coherent if not always a consistent way to address the depression and the economic said was eclectic in his approach because he was even more was surrounded himself with informed and was prepared on day 1 to begin not sure that policies go beyond his electioneering said afraid a new he referring to the public works stand for promises without but in the spirit of give trump the benefit of the as has suggested need his own versions of l interior who ran the and his close adviser harry l who ran the trump will also need to be asked states and cities for but he made nearly all the final decisions himself was a fanatic about said a commissioner in new he helped lay out the

j victory could well push the party system toward a clash between an overwhelmingly white ethnic party and a cosmopolitan coalition of minority groups and whites despite the unexpected trump lost the popular vote in an election that in some respects closely resembled victory over mitt in 2012 an ordinary end to a very abnormal campaign the power of party identification held approximately 90 percent of republicans in camp campaign may set in motion a process that reorients politics toward the cosmopolitanism versus nationalism divide that he reconfiguring our party system and shaping our politics for decades to come the power of social identity suggests that such a dynamic could be difficult to stop once set in motion in recent the democrats and republicans have battled along a axis of conflict that emphasizes disagreement over the size and scope of government rather than divisive disputes about racial identity during the 2008 and 2012 presidential for john and ran against domestic policy proposals on issues like health care and the economy after the republican party hoped to continue along this path and expand its appeal to young minorities and women but as the political scientists miller and norm candidates and parties sometimes in flanking moves so as to enlist coalitions of disaffected by changing positions on social issues that cut across party they seek to attract voters who are only loosely attached to the other party trump seems to have pulled off one of these maneuvers in shifting from traditional conservatism to a kind of nationalism though the move cost him votes among he attracted support among the larger group of whites without a college degree substantial minority of whom had backed in pulling in just enough votes in the rust belt to tip the election despite all the attention paid to economic anxiety as the basis for the evidence to date is more consistent with his brand of identity politics being the most important cause of this shift in voting patterns from 2012 of course economic anxiety and group animus are not mutually approach has the potential to transform the party system the success of his campaign may encourage other republicans to adopt his model he has shown that the penalty for deviating from orthodox policies is minimal and that an style can have significant electoral advantages though presidents cannot impose their will on most of domestic they can help define the issues on the political agenda in the choices that he trump may play down conflict over the size and scope of government and shift the political debate toward questions of national immigration and culture few republicans are likely to want to cross trump and his energized supporters given the threat of a potential primary challenge in 2018 for decision to name as his chief strategist the head of a website described in an article in the conservative national review as catering to small but vocal fringe of white and though the move lacked recent no republicans in congress which made the issue into a partisan dispute with democrats trump has also stirred emotions by promising to deport two to three million undocumented immigrants by the fate of a tax cut normally the top domestic policy priority has received less attention the party will almost certainly pursue success is likely to provoke a response from democrats that could accelerate this shift they face an outraged liberal base that is likely to reject conciliatory messages intended to win back votes among the white working class the party might instead double down on cosmopolitan appeals to the minority voters and white voters who were the main target of campaign the strategy failed in but the incentive to try again is clear democrats came closer to winning several sun belt states where minority and white populations are like and than they did some traditional strongholds with higher numbers of like and a focus on cosmopolitanism might make electoral sense for democrats given the changing demographics of the but it could further weaken their appeal to whites without college dividing the electorate by race and class even more nothing about this process is of course republicans may yet succeed in steering trump toward a traditional agenda of tax cuts and deregulation but the effects he could have on party system could be of far more lasting consequence than almost any policy he might propose

prime minister of japan is planning to sit down with j trump in new on in what would be the first meeting with a foreign leader since his election wants to find out how serious trump was during his campaign when he repeatedly criticized japan on trade issues and for not paying more of the cost of its own defense and since the establishment was expecting to win the wants to assure trump that he is willing and eager to work with him the prime minister is concerned about commitment to protecting japan the united states is most important and is legally obligated to defend it against attack there are around 50 , 000 troops stationed in a powerful deterrent against the rising threat of north and an increasingly assertive china during the trump suggested he might withdraw troops not without resistance from members of officials at the state diplomats and military advisers the united alliance has been in place since the end of world war and has a lot of backing on both sides of the pacific ocean maybe there are signs that japan might be willing to pay or do but many experts contend troops are not only defending japan but the united own interests in the pentagon is budgeted to spend about billion to support troops and bases on and elsewhere around japan this year japan is set to spend billion to support the in addition to at least billion on related including compensation for the communities that host the bases and funds for relocating troops under its which was written by occupying forces after world war japan can keep an army for defensive purposes but has said he wants to revise the constitution and expand the military in his government requested the latest in a series of increases in military spending japan has committed to the nuclear nonproliferation and will probably remind trump of that on the campaign trump decried the cost of providing a nuclear umbrella to allies such as japan and south that do not have their own nuclear arms in trump told the new times that he was open to those countries building their own nuclear but on twitter this week he denied having said so has reaffirmed his commitment not to develop atomic weapons any move to do so would face severe public opposition in the only country that has suffered a nuclear attack he has been one of the biggest enthusiasts for the partnership or as it is known though japan was the last of a dozen pacific rim countries to join the sweeping trade pact trump repeatedly criticized the during the presidential campaign made politically painful concessions on agricultural imports to close the deal and get manufacturers access to export markets in the united states and elsewhere the trade partnership could bolster the limp economic growth rate in his country and serve as a counterweight to the superpower acknowledged after victory that the partnership was in a difficult but his government still plans to have parliament ratify the and he has not given up on selling it to trump may also seek to soften angry campaign in which he accused japan of crushing the united states on and manipulating its currency to gain an economic advantage trump says for free trade in but wants a for the united states what that for remains a mystery

over the past president v of has received two starkly different messages about hacking into computer networks from the current and future presidents of the united you and not even sure it was you the white house confirmed in a statement on that eight days before the presidential the united states the government directly regarding malicious that was state it sent the message over a rarely used a connecting the nuclear risk reduction centers in both which they had agreed three years ago could also be employed to deal with major the warning only the latest after verbal cautions by president his defense secretary and the director of national intelligence was reported by the post the warnings to against further hacking into polling or registration or any further effort to affect the outcome of the are being hailed by the administration as a success in deterrence after they a year and a half of hacking activity seemed to or and there is no evidence that voting or counting of ballots was disrupted on election day but more than a few experts in deterring take a more skeptical view they say the had already achieved their main to demonstrate how they could disrupt the electoral process with the leak of hacked including from the democratic national committee and campaign john d suffered nothing worse than a they note no no counter no embarrassing revelations engineered by the united states and he now has the satisfaction of dealing with j who during the campaign praised promised to build a more productive relationship with and maintained there was no evidence that the were behind the hacking anything wrong happens they like blame the trump said in an 10 debate with know if the doing the hacking maybe there is no trump contended that the allegations of activity were intended to for advocating a new relationship with he frequently repeated similar sentiments in the last weeks of the suggesting the hacking was a fabrication the leaks of emails worked largely to his embarrassing democratic leaders like representative of who was forced to resign as the chairwoman of the democratic national committee larger strategic message is that the united states and need to cooperate on a range of issues but for now the situation underscores the uncertainty around the world about the direction of foreign policy and gives the opportunity to exploit differences between the current president and his successor until trump is inaugurated on 20 it is also raising the question of whether the white house pushed back hard enough when intelligence agencies concluded on 7 that officials could have authorized these a a computer expert at the center for strategic and international studies in dismissed the claim that it had deterred hacking seems a little bold to claim this is a success for since the deterred from doing he said hacking work was mostly complete the issue now is whether they will be deterred in the and the guessing is they will not strong private warnings enough to constitute in the appear to have paid less of a price for their hacking around the election than north did for its attack on pictures entertainment in 2014 that attack melted down about 70 percent of computers and servers at its wreaking considerable and embarrassed many executives it was in response to the release of a that imagined a plot to kill the north leader after the the united states issued more sanctions against north and encouraged china to limit the all of which runs through switching centers many experts had expected the white house to follow a similar path with the white house concluded that the and the unstated suggestion that the united states had the power to reach inside networks and see the origin of might suffice it is not clear if the administration plans any other actions against before departure from but that seems less and less likely the 31 warning did not deal with the hacking of the democratic national committee or which r clapper the director of national had previously said was conducted with the knowledge of the leadership it referred only to the concerns about hacking around the election process and the fear it was originating from though it stopped short of saying it was a attack

what are the economic benefits and drawbacks of global who are the winners and losers in this story of economic these are the questions students will consider as they learn why trade became such an important issue in the 2016 election as part of the they will also consider the implications of j related campaign promises background global trade was one of the core issues trump returned to over and over during his 2016 presidential campaign in the the states that effectively handed trump his election day victory were the rust belt states of and states that were predicted to vote for yet have been by an exodus of manufacturing jobs why has message that politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of moving our our wealth and our factories to and resonated with so many why has he condemned the north free trade agreement the worst trade deal in and declared that entrance into the world trade organization has enabled the greatest jobs theft in the lesson begins by having students investigate where their possessions are then they use a times video and article to help them better understand the complex consequences of increased trade further we offer opportunities for debate and argument analyzing the effects of global trade and doing additional research warm what countries make the products we this activity can be started for homework the night before or completed entirely during using a computer or their students should find out the minimum wage and the per capita of three or more countries that produced the highest number of goods for the class or their small group they should find the same information for the united assuming the is not included in their list already be sure students understand what these economic terms mean after they have gathered this students should consider any trends they notice about the countries that produce most of the goods they and their classmates identified how do wages and economic activity in these countries compare to the same categories for the united all of this information can be recorded using this handout to better understand how global trade works and the consequences of students should watch this 2012 times video here are questions for writing and 1 how is the a product of global 2 how has the economy lost some jobs as well as a as manufacturing has moved 3 how does comparing the united largest employers today with those in 1960 tell a story about how the economy has changed over the past 50 how does apple fit into this 4 what groups are the winners and losers in the economy 5 according to the why are our economic problems so hard to an article to annotate and more but not for what fuels the backlash on students should read and annotate peter s more but not for what fuels the backlash on here in an excerpt from the so you can quickly assess its reading level and get to the heart of its below are questions for writing and 1 the article libraries full of economics textbooks have rightly promised that global trade expands national wealth by lowering the price of lifting wages and amplifying what went why was global trade such an important issue in the 2016 election for many 2 the article administrations in the united led by democrats and republicans have embraced liberalized trade as a central component of the foreign policy yet only 19 percent of voters said trade with other countries created more jobs in the united according to a new news poll released in why is there a disconnect between government trade policy by both democrats and republicans and what voters 3 the consequences of increasing global trade for workers and the economy are complex who are the who are the how are some groups both winners and 4 the article factories produced more goods last year than by many indications yet they did so while employing about 12 3 million workers roughly the same number as in when production was roughly what it is how can this be that factories are producing more than ever but while employing fewer 5 what is what is the explain how each has affected workers and the economy 6 a an economist at have a public policy toward trade we have a public policy on what point is he and why is it relevant to this 7 what kind of safety net do government programs provide for workers displaced by increased global how does this safety net fall short in the united discussion or argument writing is increasing global trade a force for positive or negative or should the united states pursue more free trade agreements or trade protectionism as the best solution to the negative consequences of after watching the video and reading the students have enough information to support both sides in an debate or piece they can also suggest policy proposals for supporting workers or businesses hurt by the changing economy for is there anything government policy can do to raise wages and working conditions for service workers now that many manufacturing jobs have if you want students to have more information to bolster their here are additional resources from the times and going further 1 the rise of automation changes to the economy brought on by global trade are happening at the same time as an increase in automated manufacturing peter s students can watch the video above about how china is rushing to develop and deploy a wide variety of robots for use in thousands of factories they can read the article robots grow workers struggle to keep does automation present a bigger threat to jobs than foreign should we try to slow down advances in robots and artificial should we think outside the such as with this proposal to give every adult an automatic paycheck a plan known as basic 2 women trying to join the workforce in article a small band of women risk it all for a chance to tells the story of a group of women in rural who fought the established patriarchal social order for a chance to work in nearby factories where they could earn money and independence what does look like for these how does it present both opportunities and for students who want to explore this issue ms has another related rural women in chase 3 raising or lowering labor one of the complaints against free trade agreements is that workers overseas are not guaranteed the same protections as workers in like and fall short of pledges to overseas are trade agreements unfair when they help to move jobs from countries with higher labor standards and stricter environmental laws to countries without the same level of will the transition these countries make to a more modern economy naturally raise labor standards
as negotiators meet in morocco to hammer out details of the landmark global climate change accord reached in almost a year the independent international energy agency warned that the nearly deal was too weak to meet its avowed temperature target the annual world energy outlook stated that reaching the targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was and that meeting those targets would slow climate change yet the estimates also showed that the result of those reductions was not likely to keep the temperature increase beyond preindustrial levels 2 degrees as hoped the authors meeting the national commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions would still allow temperatures to rise 2 7 degrees by 2100 meeting the most ambitious temperature goal discussed at the conference would be next to the report transformation required for a reasonable chance of remaining within the temperature goal of 1 5 degrees is a shifting mix of energy sources that favors renewable energy and more efficient energy use are putting those targets within reach the annual report of the international energy based in noted that renewable energy was with more capacity added in 2015 than for oil and nuclear power combined fossil fuels will have a substantial role to play in the global energy mix for many years to come especially natural which is rapidly displacing coal era of fossil fuels is far from being even if the pledges are fully said executive director of the agency he the share of fossil fuels in the global energy mix is about 81 if goals are the share will drop only to 74 percent by 2040 this is in part because even though renewable energy sources are finding their way into electricity oil is still an important source of power for transportation and petrochemical production there are winners and losers within fossil said the biggest winner worldwide in the projections is natural and the biggest loser is coal the largest coal producer and has been pulling back and appears to have reached the peak of its coal use in 2013 declined to discuss the effect on the projections of the election of j who has called climate change a and pledged to abandon the deal and to promote a revival of coal are a technical said come and go around the and this is a perfectly normal he said the group would be watching the actual policies and actions that emerge from the trump since changes may have global once the policies do will include in future said the report predicted that by 80 percent of the new energy generated to meet global demand would come from natural gas and renewable sources like solar and wind power a push to use energy more efficiently is expected to help in the fight against climate citing predictions that world energy use is expected to rise more slowly than in the even in the face of continued economic growth an analyst with the institute for energy economics and financial a progressive research organization based in said that the decline of coal and the explosion in renewable energy provided a simple who exit fossil fuels and embrace solar and wind will reap financial rewards and avoid stranded is a term applied to fossil fuel reserves such as coal and natural gas that are still in the in many scenarios of addressing climate companies would not be able to exploit their reserves oil companies like have disputed the issue the new report states that unless governments work hard to address the issue for a smooth and orderly transition away from fossil is a risk that major losses will be
as the technology industry came to grips in the last week with the reality of a presidential election that did not go its many in silicon valley landed on the idea that widespread misinformation spread was a primary factor in the outcome on both and altered their advertising policies to explicitly prohibit sites that traffic in fake news from making money off lies very likely a worthwhile even if it comes too late the has loosened our collective grasp on the and efforts to fight that dismaying trend are obviously worth pursuing yet it would be a mistake to end this investigation at fake news in the dangers posed by fake news are just a symptom of a deeper truth now dawning on the with billions of people glued to and other popular social media has become an increasingly powerful cultural and political to the point that its effects are now beginning to alter the course of global events the election of j trump is perhaps the starkest illustration yet that across the social networks are helping to fundamentally rewire human society they have subsumed and gutted mainstream media they have undone traditional political advantages like and access to advertising and they are destabilizing and replacing institutions and established ways of doing including political transnational organizations and unspoken social prohibitions against blatant expressions of racism and xenophobia most because these services allow people to communicate with one another more they are helping to create surprisingly influential social organizations among groups these ad hoc social movements range widely in from white supremacists in the united states to in to in the middle east to the hacker collectives of eastern and but each in its own way is now wielding previously unthinkable resulting in sometimes destabilizing geopolitical spasms now have billions of people on the and most of them are not that happy with the status said the president of the a research firm that forecasts global risks think their local government is authoritarian they think on the wrong side of the establishment aggrieved by identity politics and a middle many factors accounted for economic anxiety in the industrial an inchoate desire for some kind of change in the national and some mix of latent xenophobia and sexism across the electorate but as even trump acknowledged in an interview with aired social media played a determining role in the race in the the concerns of supporters might have been and his candidacy would almost certainly have foundered after he was universally written off by just about every mainstream and he faced disadvantages in organization and access to traditional political expertise yet by putting out a message that resonated with people trump hacked through every established political order this new people are now empowered to express their grievances and to follow people they see as echoing their said it for social i see trump for people who like an predictable this is the scariest thing about not that it may be full of lies problem that could potentially be but that its scope gives it real power to change history in unpredictable ways but where we are time to start recognizing that social networks actually are becoming the forces that their boosters long promised they would be and to be rather than by the huge social changes they could uncork this should come as no surprise in a we are now living through a kind of version of the utopia that some in tech once envisioned would be unleashed by social media over much of the last we have seen progressive social movements powered by the web spring up across the world there was the green revolution in and the spring in the middle east and north in the united we saw the occupy wall street movement and the protests social networks also played a role in electoral politics first in the ultimately unsuccessful candidacy of dean in and then in the election of the first president in 2008 yet now those movements look like the prelude to a crackup in the global order in this organizing on played a major role in the push to get the country to leave the union in the a firebrand mayor who was vastly outspent by managed to marshal a huge army of supporters to help him win the presidency the state has used social networks to recruit from around the world to fight in and as well as to inspire terrorist attacks overseas and in the united both a socialist who ran for president as a and who was once reviled by most members of the party he now relied on movements to shatter the political status quo why is this all happening clay a professor at new university who has studied the effects of social suggested a few reasons one is the ubiquity of which has reached a truly epic scale last month the company reported that about 1 8 billion people now log on to the service every month because social networks feed off the various permutations of interactions among they become strikingly more powerful as they grow with about a quarter of the population now on the possibilities are staggering the technology gets when the crazy social effects get said one of those social effects is what calls the of the a term coined by the researcher p to describe the range of subjects that the mainstream media deems publicly acceptable to discuss from about the early until the very recent it was usually considered unwise for politicians to court views deemed by most of society to be out of the things like overt calls to racial bias were of like the but the shifted that window was kept at bay because of pluralistic said person who was sitting in their basement yelling at the about immigrants or was willing to say white were more than other kinds of they know how many others shared their thanks to the now each person with views can see that not alone and when these people find one they can do things create publications and entire worlds that bolster their and then break into the mainstream the groups also become ready targets for political figures like who recognize their energy and enthusiasm and tap into it for victories notes that the window just shifting on the right we see it happening on the too sanders campaigned on an street platform that would have been unthinkable for a democrat just a decade ago after the way forward for democrats will very likely be determined as much by collectives on as by elites in as a likely to see more unlikely candidates and policy positions than we would have in the past the upshot is further unforeseen events absolutely going to get more of these insurgent and more crazy social said trump is just the tip of the iceberg prepare for interesting times

a federal program meant to encourage investment in the united states from wealthy foreigners is increasingly supporting large luxury real estate not the development in the rural and downtrodden districts that some say were the original targets of the program with billions of dollars flowing mostly from wealthy the program faces an uncertain future in congress reset the expiration date on parts of the program to 9 the program grants permanent residency in the united states to those who are willing to immigrate and invest in a business that creates at least 10 jobs many of the projects that have received money have been in real though investments have also gone to charter medical centers and manufacturing plants some billion of investments have been made through the program since according to the an industry group in critics have derided the program as essentially a legal way for immigrants to buy their way into the country j election adds a new wrinkle he campaigned heavily on immigration pledging to build a wall on the border and increase the deportation of criminal he also said he wanted to reduce legal immigration and ensure jobs are offered to first trump will actually follow through on these pledges remains to be said w a law professor at university and an immigration lawyer is always difficult for congress to enact significant immigration changes because immigration is so complex and the united states is not alone in offering residence for investment and have versions of the as do several small countries competition among nations is rising for their with st being the most recent to revamp its program foreign interest is growing according to an analysis by professors at new investments in the program are increasingly financing luxury or real estate developments among nearly billion gathered in the last year from 2 , 000 investors to build a casino in las million from 1 , 200 investors for new yards project and million from 300 investors to construct the hills the program was intended to reward people for putting money into the united states projects that raised more than billion were practically nonexistent in the program before prof of new stern school of business wrote in a march report on the program but when banks turned off the credit spigot around the 2008 financial developers started getting more creative in finding alternative financing tracks 27 projects across the united states that have raised more than billion from foreign investors many of these projects are run by large commercial developers who could proceed without any foreign investment but are reaching out to foreign investors for cheaper financing than they would receive from banks reformers from both political parties are calling for a much tighter definition of the areas eligible for investment through the program to remove the tracts in prosperous urban areas and get money to ones they are also looking at raising the investment minimum to in they hope to make the projects more accountable by requiring better disclosures to protect potentially vulnerable immigrants from fraudulent schemes federal securities regulators have filed several enforcement actions against people committing fraud through the program in recent years the issue has friends and foes on either side of the political aisle senators from rural parts of the country want more development dollars coming to their while those from large cities want to maintain the status quo as for the immigrants they are entering the program mostly in an effort to gain permanent residency in the united which gives project developers more power so many there are a lot of people who are adversely affected but only by a and there are a very small group of developers who benefit they said a fellow at the center for immigration studies in the hills is being developed by an entrepreneur who also owns the it has nine acres and 12 stories and includes a hotel and a residential condominium tower three hundred investors contributed million to the project in the form of a loan it is estimated to create 3 , 629 jobs the which is the largest commercial developer in china and is owned by the richest is said to be seeking foreign investment program financing for its vista hotel in the city approved the project last the group is also developing one hills hotel next to the new in that city the a global development conglomerate based in is developing resorts world las with nearly billion of program money the billion project includes 3 , 100 rooms and 100 , 000 square feet of gambling a panda habitat and a theater is developing a multipurpose entertainment complex and observation tower along bay that will be the highest building when completed foreign program investors are contributing 63 percent of the financing through a million loan about 540 investors are involved in the which is expected to create more than 6 , 000 jobs and 350 foreign program investors put up million for empire a mall and hotel complex planned for island is a partner in the which aims to create 4 , 500 jobs all of this investing has created a backlog of uncertain futures

the clock has started for one of the most eagerly awaited market debuts of that of the popular messaging service the social snap has filed confidentially to go with an eye toward being valued at more than people briefed on the matter said that would make snap the technology company at the time of its market after and the company is aiming to begin having its shares traded as soon as though the final timing for an offering has not been determined the confidential made with the securities and exchange commission before the presidential election last comes amid a relative drought in the market for initial public offerings there have been 96 offerings of companies with a market value of more than million in the united states so far this down 41 percent from according to data from renaissance capital a successful debut of snap could help revive that encouraging other technology companies to go public it would be the first silicon valley lingo for private companies valued at billion or more to go public next year unlike or the lender snap has a main business that is not subject to a web of government regulations that make a public listing complicated a snap share sale is also expected to eschew the complexities of previous technology initial public offerings like in 2004 like and other tech recently amended corporate charter shows that a different class of stock would enable its top including its to maintain control even after the service is publicly traded yet snap will encounter intense scrutiny from potential as rivals try to encroach on its turf by copying some of the photo messaging signature features in rolled out its version of the stories photo and video service a spokesman for snap declined to comment on the which was reported earlier by founded in a university dorm room in has become a darling of the tech as it has grown from a simple service into a digital video phenomenon its lofty goal is to essentially become the equivalent to television it has built up its popular stories in which users upload photos or videos and share them with followers and it gained new levels of popularity after rolling out features like which lets users transform their likenesses into cartoon silly faces or taco bell paid for by sponsors such has been the popularity of that media organizations have rushed to establish beachheads on the service even the white house has set up a and president has given an interview on the political show analysts have estimated that which began its advertising business less than two years could reach billion in sales next up from more than million this year financial information will be known when its offering filing is publicly disclosed if the company decides to go ahead with a sale of its shares the confidentiality of filing was made possible by the our business or act of which permits companies with less than billion in revenue to conduct much of their preparation for an away from the glare of public scrutiny box and even the soccer club united have filed confidentially for stock listings in the united states in this way under the companies must publicly disclose their offering documents some 15 days before they start pitching the proposed share offering to prospective investors in what is known as a the investment banks and have been hired to lead the people briefed on the matter have previously said unlike some private snap has had no trouble raising money on the private so investors were not given preferential treatment regarding how many shares they will get in the event of a public according to corporate documents filed in this sets snap apart from offerings from square and box both of those companies had to give some of their private investors special deals that diluted other early shareholders when square went public last some investors received an additional 10 3 million which came at the expense of other investors when box went public in some of the earlier private investors were entitled to extra shares will certainly be an indicator of whether there is a big pile of investor cash ready to go into the said silicon valley managing director of corporate finance is unique growing is doing some interesting things with glasses and has gotten a lot of attention there a lot of that
this election year has often felt like one enormous swarm of poll vote forecasts and nonstop statistical analysis and coverage has provided little relief how key was the vote to j did young voters shy away from what about all this number crunching led the two of us a and a polling editor to wonder what might be missed when we try to explain entire groups as being or if we write that rural voters were especially likely to back are there assumptions that we might be but that actually hold true for many rural if we say that millennial voters were unlikely to support are we getting the full the video above is our attempt to unpack just a few of these terms we hope it will serve as an invitation to keep and to look at the headlines we see reporting exit poll statistics as only telling part of the story
models are the statistician box once said this year was no exception on a model built by j campaign gave him an 8 percent chance of has reported at that point in the the model gave him the same chances by election his odds were but trump was still not favored to win near the end of the a model built by the republican national committee showed him losing over all and in states like and according to politico won each of those so did trump simply beat the or were the odds wrong all one of the reasons assessing models is so tricky is that difficult to know for sure only over the long run that a model can be judged to be well calibrated what we can is check to see how fragile our model was to different assumptions what we said on the last day of the based on we said had about an 85 percent chance of winning and trump 15 or slightly less than a shot the final result of far from what we thought was the single most likely and our live forecast was quick to adjust as votes began coming in but final electoral count most likely 306 to once the race in has been called is well within the range of what we said was plausible the chart below shows which outcomes we thought were most likely were we too at various points during the the editor of called the model to react to new polls we preferred analysis suggested that very few voters changed their minds and that the impact of most campaign events was small given the amount of uncertainty in the a model should not overreact to a single poll released three months before election day but in her blamed letters from the b delivered to congress 11 and two days before election day and campaign models moved sharply in the last few as did our own so what if we had used only the final 10 days of would we have given trump higher we would but not by much if we had used only the final 10 days of we would have given about an 80 percent chance of only slightly lower than what we actually said and still far above 50 percent even shorter windows give similar results no window of polls that would have pushed trump to be the favorite what if we had assumed and would all shift in addition to whether older polls are one of the biggest differences between models involved the question of how much the states move together does a polling miss in one state tell you much about a polling miss in other the technical word for this is correlation if the states are more the possible distribution of outcomes gets wider if the states move the distribution gets narrower our model kept this parameter at a middle the states were neither perfectly correlated nor perfectly independent even at its most making the states move together more flattens the distribution and makes a win from trump more but at best he would have been just a 24 percent favorite what if fit our model somehow knowing the results of it probably would not have changed much the state polls missed by larger margins in 2016 than they had in recent but the results completely unexpected it feels like an even larger miss because the polls missed by enough in enough swing states to give the election to the trailing candidate via the electoral college national polling performed better than a lot of people is increasing her lead in the popular vote by the day it may take months for analysts to determine why state polls were far off in the and northeast modern polling faces including the decreasing use of landlines and the increasing difficulty in finding people willing to but we can expect the polling industry to work to adapt what would we do what would we think next time about a state like dozens of polls showed with a most above four points none showed trump ahead in our polling database of presidential polls since we found 248 examples in which a candidate led in every poll of a state conducted in the final 150 days of the including 49 where the margin was within 10 points states with only one the trailing candidate won in only two cases three if you count others were north in 1980 and south in 1992 in each every poll showed the democrat and the republican candidate won the even among races won by less than 10 a win rate of 94 percent about the same as the 93 percent chance we gave in models are box some are was the upshot forecast we think a quantitative forecast can help people to take a step back from obsessing over the latest daily poll release by averaging polls together and arriving at a probabilistic the aim is to help people take a more nuanced view of the one that is less driven by whatever the latest polling number happens to and instead summarizes all of the available with the context of history but we humans are bad at understanding uncertainty reactions to victory suggest despite our we failed at explaining that an 85 percent chance is not a 100 percent chance if we did it all we would probably emphasize uncertainty in a more visceral rather than using a simple statement of an analogy to a event like an field goal or a shaded margin of error by more effectively communicating the uncertainty in the hope to give our readers a more useful indicator of the state of the race one that is built on data rather than anecdote and conjecture
so just when we thought that 2016 get any more it with a trump victory i told you last week that strange happenings were afoot in the what with the cubs winning the world series and all i hear that new yorkers are taking it pretty hard are people stocking up on canned greetings from the land of duck and not sure quite sunk in but foods and subterranean real estate are in demand and sounds like a hunting club so where shall we a little weary of the conversations get right to what do you think will happen trump will set up an administration the sun will rise in the east my dog will chase squirrels the world will go on glad to hear taking it well he stayed cautiously neutral in the but a very good boy i think you once made the point to me that there are no permanent victories or defeats in politics so perhaps a good place to start a conversation about the future been since i came to at the collective failure to understand that point it is patently true upon the most cursory inspection of recent history in democrats were popping champagne over the dawn of a permanent era of progressive politics now they see most of their dreams being unraveled and republicans celebrating today will sooner or later be miserable i made a things are looking better already both winners and losers who ignore this reality make silly unforced errors the losers err on the side of excessive like the classic threats to leave the country reader email has informed me way harder to leave the country than one might think we in all that much demand and the winners fail when they convince themselves that since victory is they can set an agenda that attracts no one from the other side looking at a president trump and a house and say we are in for a stretch of dumb things presidents generally get most of their big changes done in the first year or two president did that with health care his agenda was nothing compared to w who did everything from tax cuts to getting authorization for the invasion but was certainly a big lift it was also a central campaign promise i know you think it was a bad idea i think that strategy is enormously shortsighted i remember thinking when the democrats held the white house and both houses of congress in though they have it might be wise to give a little to bring some centrist republicans into some day the republicans might be in a position to reverse everything if they have zero political investment in and sure here we are my point is that of course a president should have a vision that matches his ideology why he got elected but i think it is impractical and imprudent to forgive me for another reference to is spinal turn it up to 11 give on a few things where you have because someday going to need friends to protect the stuff you care about most the trump administration might learn from the outgoing horror at seeing some or all of repealed we part company here my perception of was of a democratic party willing to work on compromise legislation while the republicans just stalled there was no unified republican just a ton of people who wanted to be but kept changing their mind but the bottom line is that left behind the old congress now got guys who sleep in their offices and even talk to the other side at the house gym secretly a lot of them are actually but i take your point and another recommendation i would make to president make friends everyplace that was the magic golf with the same people every week since i have no prepared to look on the bright side for a while the republican hatred of is so great that even if had gotten elected it would have been really hard to get the necessary fixes through congress trump has promised and as of his interview something better that preserves the most popular parts of the program so see what he comes up with i know a big fan his agenda and agenda really do congress is set to have a big influence on the agenda over the next and and trump will figure out how to make their ideas jibe plan includes a health care replacement plan for it will actually do some of the things liberals really like getting more people covered i realize that very disappointing for progressives to see but not like it will be replaced by nothing this is one area where the product usually resemble the recipe i remember presidential candidate saying all health care negotiations could take place in on grab your crystal ball and give me a couple of other predictions seeing a big tax cut and huge spending on infrastructure repair followed by a stupendous rise in the national debt certainly true that neither party has been great at getting the deficit under control in my lifetime nobody calls his or her congressman and just do sit only one side adds to the deficit while simultaneously complaining too big but move on obviously cranky how any other how about the early the republican establishment seems to have as white house chief of staff but is going to be chief strategist which could mean anything to me is the kind of guy democrats should learn to live with they and going to be a republican white house but is a very bad dude who represents all the worst strands of racism and misogyny in the trump crowd who do you think will really have the it looks like both will be influential after watching the i find pair of appointments too surprising they signal that in as during his trump will seek to merge traditional republican politics with his unconventional brand of populism and what about it seems now the wall may be a and the deportees will be only criminals has been trying to deport undocumented immigrants who break the law for years see where the big switch is i think given what heard so far in that trump said that securing the southern border will probably involve a mixture of wall and and that he plans to limit deportations to illegal immigrants who have committed crimes those steps would not require the kind of massive deportation force that some predicted and feared been thinking a lot about the source of strength rural areas and declining small cities you always told me that one of our problems is that have stopped moving to where the jobs apparently right and prefer to stay be angry and elect trump president one interpretation another is that people simply have the skills for the promising jobs that would require a especially since we stopped teaching vocational and technical skills so they stay put i find this the more compelling view i always prefer the explanation that just boil down a move i have three so i confess to using that approach sometimes as to how all this affected my colleague nick published a wonderful book earlier this year called without it shows the collapse of employment among men over the past 50 years this got much worse in the wake of the great recession and the disappointing most of which yielded no income growth for the entire bottom 80 percent of the income distribution in other the economic recovery was only really salient for the richest fifth of the population important which i plan to reiterate regularly when trump begins his economic program by reducing taxes for the rich and regulations on the banks the problem just material especially given the expansion of welfare benefits the loss of dignity that comes from not creating value through honest work for neither party has addressed this dignity crisis for men without a college education an obvious connection here with the explosion of suicide and opiate abuse in rural i think all pretty clear today that a cry of rage from white and trump was pretty good on the end but beyond a huge infrastructure repair plan which was actually clearer on i heard a whole lot of solutions when trump talked about kicking out illegal immigrants and canceling experts scoffed at the unworkability and undesirability of the specific proposals but i talked to tons of people supporting trump who basically know if that stuff will work but finally a guy who at least is saying try something to bring back someone who cared about them the bottom line was change versus no change almost always the way voters decide presidential elections and i am sorry to say that was the candidate all she promised was more of the administration plus that infrastructure repair it made sense in many ways the country has recovered from a stupendous economic collapse under but if not a happy going to convince you by showing you graphs on the unemployment rate i know this election is really hard for progressives to but a way to understand at least in part a few years ago i was having lunch with who is president of the center for progress and liberal think tank presidents are secretly i asked her to given me a simplest explanation for why some people who never prospered over the past few years nonetheless loved president so much she gives them i thought that was very and i think a big part of going on today as well with trump i like your as far as the emotions goes as to ability to follow through see how it works out especially if the new first move to support the common man is deregulating the banks i just laughed out loud about that one but the holidays are and everybody deserves a little bit of a break from 24 7 politics why god invented football obviously we share the same basic theology be taking a conversational too but while being thankful on be counting our talks as one of my blessings me happy thanksgiving
the reported that attacks against surged last driving an overall increase in hate crime against all groups the which is the most comprehensive look at hate crime expanded on previous findings by researchers and outside who have noted an alarming rise in some types of crimes tied to the vitriol of this presidential campaign and the aftermath of terrorist attacks at home and abroad since 2015 that trend appears to have spiked in just the last with civil rights groups and news organizations reporting dozens of verbal or physical assaults on minorities and others that appear to have been fueled by divisions over the election in its report on the cataloged a total of 5 , 818 hate crimes in 2015 a rise of about 6 percent over the previous year including and property destruction against gays and others attacks against saw the biggest surge there were 257 reports of attacks on mosques and other hate crimes against last a jump of about 67 percent over 2014 it was the highest total since when more than 480 attacks occurred in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks attacks against people also sharply increased blacks were the most frequent victims of hate crimes based on while were the most frequent victims based on according to the data but the increases in attacks on these groups were smaller than the rise in attacks against and people over 59 percent of the hate crimes that the recorded were based on the ethnicity or ancestry religious bias accounted for about 20 percent of all and about 18 percent of attacks were based on sexual orientation law enforcement officials acknowledge that the statistics give an incomplete picture because many local agencies still have a spotty record of reporting hate 26 years after congress directed the justice department to begin collecting the data need to do a better job of tracking and reporting hate crime to fully understand what is happening in our communities and how to stop b the said the regards the prosecution of hate crimes under federal jurisdiction as the top priority of its civil rights branch since the hate crime monitors like the southern poverty law center have reported a rash of verbal or physical abuse targeting minorities and others at mosques and elsewhere some supporters of j say they too have been victimized
was so committed to his new that he was willing to take a flying leap off a balcony the actor performed his own stunts in this conspiracy including a terrifying in the from an apartment down onto a car a said has gotten so and audiences and looking for that switch shot where clearly not you i thought if got this guy where him against the i wanted them to see me get a little beat in starting night on the takes his knocks as bob lee an sniper lured back into action when his former commanding officer brings him into a clandestine only to frame him for murder adapted from the 2007 mark as well as of the hunter the series was scheduled to debut in before its premiere was postponed twice after mass shootings in and baton la in an interview at the new a father of proud and ambassador for hidden a support network for military caregivers talked about the art of the long shot and guns in society these are edited excerpts from the conversation is finally arriving after a postponement how did you feel about the we have a really good show that should stand apart from current events but i applaud the sensitivity we talked about changing the title after the show was but it has somewhat of a audience because of the movie so this postponement allowed us to refocus the marketing and make it clear that bob lee was set up for an assassination that he was not a part and is in pursuit of the actual shooter it also gave us time to let people know that a touchstone of our show is to treat veterans with to treat weapons with respect our techniques are sound no flippancy with regards to the within the first five you know that this is not a show glorifying gun violence what about the role won you the first thing mark executive said to me love this and my first and i found that so flattering and from there his attitude was one of it your then i got really into the idea of the action of it and i do action much longer and i got to help choreograph the fights and come up with really twisted ways for myself to get injured so it like to jump from the fourth a tiny plastic hook on my vest and one cable on my back that cable is connected to a and a man on a hydraulic with essentially a spool and a that determines whether you live or die the craziest thing about and i know how morbid it but your brain thinks committing suicide so when i finally took that first step my brain was is shooting a sniper rifle just like any something and meditative about the head space a sniper needs to get into in order to hit a shot a distance of a half mile or more the breathing is absolutely essential you have to gently pull the trigger at the very bottom of your exhale because even your heartbeat can throw off the accuracy of the shot at that distance how did you i went to united states marine camp and they took me to the range with three bona fide marine snipers on my second on a at almost 900 i hit it and they were dumbfounded this story can be verified your take on gun gun laws background yes get rid of automatic weapons being so easily yes the thing about the gun debate that always stands out to in the big cities like new and it makes sense for us to not everyone should have but there are a lot of people in rural communities that might be 20 minutes away from a police station or an ambulance so how are you going to tell somebody like that that they i think oftentimes the problem in this and sort of what we see in these election is that there are many different realities and you apply your to all of them just not fair after filming the you recuperated at the beach in with your family are you a hometown boy made i definitely am is a state less than a million and outside of i may be the most famous suffice it to say that everyone in knows my name

j election victory was powered in part by forceful opposition to what he described as an economic and political system rigged against the people for the benefit of shadowy forces in the news the banks and the government trump and his allies often describe that system with one globalism it is a word that conjures many none of them shuttered unchecked immigration and a distant cabal believers controls the economy and the media analysts who track extremist groups in the united states have expressed alarm at the use of the word by the they say it carries multiple meanings from benign to sinister and often serves as a for and conspiracy theorists is a principle driver for the fears that animate the radical right in the united said the editor of a published by the southern poverty law center is the globalism is often used as a synonym for the system of global economic interconnection that has been critiqued for decades by liberal groups like labor environmental organizations and opponents of the international monetary fund and the world bank but for the far the term encapsulates a conspiratorial based on xenophobia and according to mark a researcher at the league a host on the media site rebel explicitly rejected its use as a synonym for in a video she posted in she said the word meant rule by autocrats such as president former president w bush and the united nations who value false flag of and immigration from the third almost always sneer down their nose at disdain national laugh at religion and generally despise the west while holding a creepy affection for the third she added want open cheap labor and to benefit their business and political and are all too willing to shaft the little people to achieve the website run by k newly appointed chief white house frequently attacked globalism and during tenure there but no one may have done more to popularize the idea of a globalist conspiracy than a radio host who commands an audience of millions through his media empire he has been called most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary by the southern poverty law center among his the sandy hook school massacre in was a hoax and the sept 11 terror attacks were an inside job posted his own definition of globalism to in 2014 in his trademark he described it as a digital control engineered by shadowy corporate and political elites he called it total form of the who has enthusiastically supported hailed the republican as a historical figure who appeared on his show last has in turn heaped praise upon reputation is trump said will not let you down you will be very i hope and i think be speaking a so what is trump talking about when he talks about his hope provided a definition in an email before the election last groups in the united states began to refer to globalism at the end of the cold when it replaced communism as an idea that was an danger to the said they have also referred to it as the new world and soon they saw its tentacles everywhere the shape of that conspiracy had distinctly in part because many of foes had historically seen communism as inextricably linked to said members of the far right became fixated on prominent like the businessman and philanthropist those conspiratorial beliefs were bolstered when former president bush celebrated the end of the cold war in a 1991 speech by saying it was the dawn of a world his use of the phrase was taken as proof by many that a globalist conspiracy really was afoot was very easy for especially because he was the one who said to take that ball and run with said that point the phrase became the short hand for that kind of globalism conspiracy the multiple meanings have made it a powerful political and and his frequent references to globalism have drawn in a wide and varied audience is a very efficient net to unite disparate parts of the from the mainstream to the said the director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at state professor called globalism defining folklore and narrative for the racist but said it had also a convenient to explain the various declines that the united states is perceived to be globalism was an important theme in the final weeks of for when he told a rally in in that his opponent for the had sat at the heart of a conspiracy with international bankers plot the destruction of the league criticized the speech for classic conspiratorial talk has continued after the election trump referred to a plot against him again last when he complained on twitter that protests were the work of the news media and paid protesters a trump ally and host on fox business later accused of many on the far right have celebrated election victory as a momentous blow against the globalist conspiracy last claimed on that trump had called him personally to thank him and his audience for their support and to offer to appear on his show again soon ms the trump did not reply to an email seeking comment late night then pivoted to what he thought was most the coming destruction of globalists that hijacked the primarily the news media and international business people soon they would be destroyed once and for he suggested is battling back to restore humanity and to break the he said not gonna be any dtente we know and just here to let you know
referring to not new or democrats these labor democrats are conservative people to begin so said the president newly minted chief of speaking about a state like had long eluded the republican party so he said in that is appointed by j trump on to the position in the white first appeared in the new times on sept 2008 leaders confronted by resistance to the headline read the article discusses attempts by union members to court democratic votes during president first presidential campaign and acknowledges certain hurdles they issues of gun rights and race the times sought out then chairman of the republican to offer his opinion which appears toward the end of the proves eerily prescient given narrow victory over in was the first time since 1984 that has voted in favor of a republican presidential the article also offers some insight into who in 2008 like fellow voters this year in lamented the loss of jobs in the proved anything but prescient bigger problem is that has a sort of show pony denying that race would play a factor in the election speeches and the classic double speak and being a great that kind of thing play well in five weeks carried with a margin
if there is one thing that has caused me regret in last it is including my mobile phone number in my voter enrollment form after moving back to from the east coast there much or any activity around the presidential election in but we were lucky enough to have dozens of state propositions and local measures to consider state a local soda tax you name it and we had a chance to vote on it we also had the opportunity to receive an endless streams of texts and phone calls in the weeks leading up to the election it would take an astonishing civic sensibility to not be annoyed by all this attention as wrote over the the cell number has become as important as the social security number the backup for on all sorts of and connected to all sorts of databases people feverishly protect their social security but they often think twice about handing out that cellphone number they should reconsider being so free with that number trust me on this

open 23 2016 sort of censorship has no place in a free and open should be free to consume whatever material they regardless of how distasteful others may find provided all subjects involved are performing with of hilariously 23 2016 only thing more astonishing than the fact this ban is happening at is the fact it appears the people enforcing it think it 'll be possible to hilariously was even pushing for this to 23 2016 so it 's now illegal to show female ejaculation which in itself is not only legal but perfectly natural but films can still show drug use and how about sports like it 's not really conventional to beat someone until they pass completely and furthermore who was even pushing for this to happen should not be regulating what is moral just what is 24 2016 the hell kind of a category is who gets to define when it comes to government should not be in the business of regulating what is or just what is do you click on the comments to explore the conversation further or

positive the nightlife community has never seemed more focused and closure provoked real action but while the club may be set to do you feel that nightlife has been leaving the north of england for

their experiences above the line in this article commissioned to further tell the and there was lively debate after it was published many of you also telling stories of moving the other great for the up north is better for an 21 2016 in one of the suburbs at the end of the met most of my life loved the the the the culture up miss the things that make great do n't miss the the the crush of people on the tube love the walks in the countryside up love the great for the up north is better for a middle aged wheezing asthmatic with an energetic need to get their out of 21 2016 need to get their out of all those charities really do n't need to be there they can have a small office that they share with other and move the entire rest of their staff somewhere cheaper in the meantime they are wasting their money on wages and and doing nothing to support a better economic balance in this country drives me love to move back to 21 2016 love to move back to the reminder that our mayor is a former gay just made me well up with pride an liberal city with character problem is looked for jobs in my specialist field ever since i and have n't seen a thing stuck down here in my overpriced 5 person house share in the south the front page of the guardian 5 may 1821 frank baron for the guardian can help the north and save itself financially by moving back 21 2016 guardian can help the north and save itself financially by moving back north with modern communication there is no good reason to be in sell the guardian building and rent inexpensive offices up the survival of the guardian is more important than the desire of guardian writers to live in one more presumably from the west 21 2016 other week there was a piece about the number of moving out to it was n't a brain drain so presumably they were all going in that do you think have you made the would if you from the have you noticed a similar debate about to or from the and on that publicity is bad point raised by another reader 25 2016 there no such thing as bad publicity for the election because of the huge animosity to it was probably true that all publicity was good publicity for trump that 's not going to be the case once he takes office unfortunately i think he knows and already he is moderating his tone and output 25 2016 is no such thing as bad publicity in many ways look at all the careers built on it trump obviously thinks being is a bit like being a or a couple of your comments on trump vs the 25 2016 he 's the media are within the trump let 's report on pence getting booed at you clicks trump 's long history of corruption and let 's report disproportionately on and treat trump like a joke the media did as much as anybody to elect trump during this election 25 2016 people who voted remain at least try to acknowledge that some of the population may have a valid reason for voting to leave the we 're never going to get back to more progressive regard to this quoted passage above the it mirrors similar claims made about many of those who voted or trump the thing is that i still have n't heard an explanation of those reasons that makes sense beyond the obvious ones seeking to excuse or explain away the fact that millions of people have used their democratic choices in what by all ordinary measures are illogical and inexplicable ways may simply be ignoring a plain truth that those people decided that giving vent to their racism and xenophobia was worth the risk the headline on my piece on the relationship between trump and the everything i had been trying to say trump v the did his tactics mortally wound the fourth read the had released a video direct to camera on setting out his plans for his first 100 days it was classic trump using the power of social media to bypass news and press outlets entirely and speak directly to the people what doing is to cut out the role of the media as a filter that stands between a president and the and by doing so he is raising a serious threat to many of the values that media outlets hold fact and fairness to name but three don images is there no such thing as bad publicity for 25 2016 i think his entire philosophy is based on the old saw is no such thing as bad he does not mind upsetting in fact by this point he seems to be doing it deliberately because when everyone 's talking about the latest thing he came out or the latest group he they are still talking about trump after the shocking some might say results of election this year in the us and can developed nations continue to take a superior view over the political injustices of the electing a misogynist as leader of the world shows that sexism is alive and well all over and although the contexts are we can find strength from working together trump is a vile misogynist but he 's not the only one read can feminist activists in china inspire women in what can women teach us about fighting the state for human how can college students in and the us support each other to stop sexual times of solidarity between those who face discrimination can help us fight back against the forces we agree with be covering the global struggle on our women and girls series a few of you have been responding to our colleague thoughts below on cat 25 2016 trump 's tweeting part of a dead cat strategy do you mean the one he wears on his thanksgiving just heal 25 2016 think that trumps mo is pretty clear make any process appear as chaotic as possible and leak names that are wildly inappropriate then when the picks are merely terrible people will think it 's not as bad as it could of saw it play out constantly in the campaign but most clearly in the debates where objectively trump performed awfully but the expectations were so low that it was considered a win for him to even turn on those terms will wear thin very quickly vagues 25 2016 like the dead cat analogy perhaps that was why people voted for him to hide something even more sinister before we move on to talk a bit more about some of the other stories that have got you talking this a couple more views on the questions raised by 25 2016 people who voted remain at least try to acknowledge that some of the population may have a valid reason for voting to leave the we 're never going to get back to more progressive politics the people who may have voted in the and the ones who offer the number of votes you feel that has not worked for them or their communities either try to understand this and move and be ready for when the opportunity inevitably or you can just carry on blaming for calling people stupid and never regain political power 25 2016 think because the level of debate before the referendum was so poor and full of lies and that people have been left quite bitter we did n't even come closer to the question be better off outside the we had a vote on it but our understanding is no better than a year a go i feel like every day i am waking and finding myself working out how i am going to explain to people in our morning what trump was tweeting about last news we regret to inform you that the of the us has been tweeting again seems completely unprecedented to have the of the us telling us that the cast of a play have been rude to his or that the new times is or that thinking about appointing this person or that person to a also gives us a question as journalists does he do it as part of a cat where you throw a dead cat on the table to distract from something another thought from a reader on that 25 2016 we too quick to blame for primarily because we have n't colleagues in our us office invite you to share your thoughts after what many feared would be a fraught atmosphere at the dinner table on thanksgiving in this open was your thanksgiving fraught with election read more whatever your is not going away perhaps even any time soon in line with that picture of former prime minister the most commented piece on the guardian today is this on john recent case for second referendum is credible read more readers are sharing their views in response to question below share yours in the comments or click the links to get involved in the conversation 25 2016 we too quick to blame for may be true that reasoned and nuance discussions are few and far between these and that people will lash out at a target that best suits whatever opinions they already hold i think there 's been a surge of this kind of reciprocal shouting because of the recent furore and hyperbole around the referendum which a large group of people who previously had little interest in the system in other words i blame 25 2016 we too quick to blame for five months there 's no evidence of great popular opposition to leaving the the lib are the only major party in and wales opposing and their poll ratings are stuck in single figures in 2005 remember images 25 2016 seems to me that may et are to blame there was no need for a referendum it was it was political it was irresponsible and without a contingency plan they are negligent and are to blame for not providing a credible opposition and alternative narrative voters are to blame for being gullible and 25 2016 we too quick to blame for in fairness it 's not a new trend newspapers are always keen to blame long term economic trends on the most recent same bad news stories which are currently all being blamed on would have all been blamed on conservative government policies before the and before 2010 they would have all been blamed on the global financial crisis simple narratives are but usually wrong the autumn statement was astonishing nothing for the the families who are just managing maybe even more nothing at all for the more for councils so they can afford to provide social care for older and vulnerable people even though it is the biggest single cause of the crisis eight charts to help you understand the autumn statement read just when it seemed things be along came the institute for fiscal analysis of what the numbers mean for real people the single most striking conclusion was that by for most families pay would only just be back at the same crew that rubbished the judges for doing their job of adjudicating on a legal row also known as judging was back on the airwaves yesterday heaping scorn on the ifs for doing its job of studying budgets and mapping their consequences there are some senior politicians who are beginning to sound like the wing or do you think they have a are those of us who voted remain too quick to blame for everything the other economies are not exactly and is it legitimate for the to keep fighting for what we believe or does there come a point when we have to get on and live with hello everyone looking forward to starting our weekly where we gather with readers to discuss the top stories we will have lots of expert comment and views from journalists above the line if you want to talk about anything let us know in the comments or by
on a evening in a mongrel is wandering between the seats in a room above a pausing to sniff handbags for hidden owner of the wee ginger dug is whose popular of that title propelled him into the midst of the that sprang up around the campaign for independence in 2014 as delivers an entertaining disquisition to the roomful of dedicated souls who have braved the wintry one could be forgiven for thinking this was another example of the phenomenon that many argue contributed to the loss of the independence yes supporters talking to here in where locals opted to remain in the by to the narrowest margin in the whole of these activists are all too familiar with the that led many independence supporters to believe that more of the country was of their view in the final giddy weeks before the need more local focus and a more so not caught in the bubble we were last says as the discussion after talk turns to strategy for a second referendum campaign members are far less about independence than their leadership got to be about and giving people the proper insists who heads the group for and the meeting with that in mind feel there are certain on currency for that are going to be asked the next that we have the answers to of independence have never stopped wanting to talk about it to anyone willing to listen so why has a national survey billed by first minister sturgeon herself as biggest listening exercise in our been such a muted barely mentioned at last annual curiously devoid of the usual social media blaring and what does that reveal about the state of the independence as well as those willing to vote for the the most significant mass of the hugely expanded membership since the first independence sturgeon challenged activists to reach everyone living in in 90 days through doorstep discussions and town hall meetings launching it at the beginning of the leader argued that the changed circumstances brought about by the vote justified a new debate on the 300 , 000 people responded within the first though it would be fascinating to know how many of those had previously voted against independence not one suspects the conservatives and never tire of pointing out that no voters would be far happier if their decision on 18 were taken as their final answer local branches attest to many hundreds more survey leaflets notably devoid of heavy branding being across the country by an indefatigable core of activists which remains the envy of every other political final results which the does not intend to share publicly may well provide party with useful not least about the third of supporters who voted for and how many of them are likely to support the ultimate preference for independence in it is difficult not to conclude that the which ends on st 30 has been something of a fools errand for those loyal they are the first to admit that the exercise has drawn a mixed with many refusing to speak to them at all those most willing to they are previous no voters whose position has changed since but polls suggest that only around a tenth of those who opposed independence in 2014 have switched and almost as many have moved in the opposite anecdotal findings only reinforce the sense that prediction on the morning following the referendum result that a second independence poll was was made in haste not least if by she meant they reflect a broader after two referendums and two national elections within 18 voters have minimal appetite for further upheaval latest polling found limited backing for a second independence referendum before the leaves the at with the projected results almost identical to last time voting against independence and in these are the unyielding numbers staring down sturgeon as she weighs up when and whether to call a second did she hope to achieve with beyond busying the troops for a few short cynics would say just the idea was first announced at the spring well before as the leadership sought to quell calls for a speedy second referendum several senior advisers have since acknowledged that the throwaway notion had not been expected to receive such a positive response from members and independence activists not though very the same the membership grew like after her eat me there was much glee from some quarters about how the would cope with this rabble of and conspiracy madly straining at their reins towards a second and there has been a tendency ever since to treat them like toddlers in need of constant has forgotten how to fight for social justice read the majority of new rather like the have revealed themselves to be profoundly just like those activists in they have been waiting patiently to dissect the failures of the 2014 campaign in a formal party setting some warned when the survey was announced that any initiative focused on the of who voted to remain within the would undermine the far more pressing internal it is axiomatic that members want they are far less than their leadership fears when veterans of independence movement staged an alternative fringe festival to run concurrently with the annual conference in last it ended up being complimentary and not the insurgency that some had it did reflect many independence at the way grassroots energy has been into winning elections for the at the lack of consensus or strategy on big questions like the at the

prime announced participation in the program to resettle central refugees from a camp after attending president summit on refugees in from a surprise in at his little attention has been given to the details of this new policy or about the camp itself this is particularly notable with reiterated immigration policy not to settle any illegal maritime arrivals many of the central refugees will have crossed their borders via overland critics might concentrate on whether this announcement was price of entry to the summit or even speculate it is part of a agenda to woo power player it is important to unpack and understand what this new decision means tangibly for the migrants and us in ban on asylum seekers to us says immigration head read what do we know about the camp in what is the humanitarian migration what are they fleeing and after what does this mean for humanitarian program in have been fleeing serious gang violence in the northern triangle of central el and for is the second most dangerous country to live after as gang members target young boys to destroy businesses and abuse girls and women murder rate is the highest in the world at 90 4 homicides per 100 , 000 in according to the office of drugs and crime the average is 6 2 armed gang members are destroying local businesses the police or law enforcement does not deliver criminal justice no rule of law is in proper place highly corrupt governments fail to protect its violence is not strictly covered by the 1951 refugee convention migrants fleeing from gang violence fear their safety back home but they do not face persecution corrupt officials involved in violence can justify the failure to protect their therefore it is indirect state persecution by critics in the us also said granting migrants a refugee status was a redefinition of a refugee but the administration acknowledged the urgency of this humanitarian crisis where innocent children were targeted by gang has detrimental side effects economic and malfunctioning public including hospitals and are indirect consequences of the state failure to guarantee public safety and personal severe droughts have worsened the conditions in central even there was hurricane in 2016 the flows of humanitarian migrants fleeing from poverty and natural disasters are likely to continue and grow women and children are particularly vulnerable unaccompanied minors and mothers with children have been crossing borders to the us and this the administration announced it would work with the and to process refugees from central on top of the program opened in 2015 at the regional the among nine countries in north and central concluded a series of comprehensive recommendations in to address the plight of people fleeing violence in el and action the government of entered into a protection transfer arrangement with the and the to receive applicants most in need of immediate protection after by the us government in their countries of refugees from the northern triangle of central to the there were 1 , 830 new applications registered in in which was a increase from 2014 among 890 were from the a increase from the previous migrants are in are roman catholic and another are protestant in el are catholic and are protestant in el abortion is subject to jail terms even when pregnancy is caused by rape and the pregnant woman is under age same in are is an innovative emergency resettlement mechanism that can process up to 200 individuals at heightened risk it has undergone its initial pilot phase first beneficiaries come from el and are being relocated to the us discussions are under way with potential additional transit and destination countries this includes over integration and public main reason central refugees want to go to the us is that the richest country in their region where they already have families and friends to rely on they find and survival tips through these social networks which is an important pull factor for migrants for this even is not easy for them to integrate may be an attractive place for central but far away from their countries of origin across the pacific where they may not necessarily have the networks to support them for smooth transition and successful they need community and businesses to offer jobs for their and successful integration governments alone support newly arriving migrants who may end up relying on government subsidies they need community support and over refugee deal is tough for people who have little resilience left read of raises another serious concern for those across central has been as a pandemic disease by the world health which causes birth defects in babies born to mothers with the virus cases were reported in 20 countries in central including the northern triangle the prevalence of gang violence and the absence of proper public health systems in the region make it difficult for health professionals to reach patients and eradicate the disease if the virus spreads further in the migration flows would it means for questioned by journalists at the summit in new denied that there was a deal with the us taking refugees from and island after two the government announced a new us deal to transfer some of the detainees from and to the us difficult not to think of it as a swap deal not a 1 1 refugee swap but a bundle swap we still know in the with trump winning the election and implementing the deal no the faith of refugees in both camps looks quite bleak he may think not a fair deal to swap refugees from with minors from is renegotiating with calling the deal a of speculating unknown details of the deal over vulnerable populations across the we need to think about the consequences of this policy decision in the regional context what we do know is as of they are 1 , 269 including 45 in and new guinea who are mostly genuine refugees they be settled in but will be sent to the us the swap deal sounds like an solution to a very simple problem in a expensive and complicated refugee counts whether they are offshore or far away across the pacific for this new policy is a surprising opportunity for will never be a welcoming new no

downing street has hit back at the institute for fiscal studies after it said workers face the longest period without a increase in wages since the second world war number 10 said these figures were misleading because disposable income figures show that people are getting better off in a separate report the resolution foundation said that family incomes would grow for the rest of the decade but by less than after the financial crisis and not for the poorest who will see their incomes fall it we can look at the outlook for family incomes in the coming and it paints a grim picture our new income forecast brings together lower earnings higher and changes it shows that the rest of this parliament looks set to be as grim as the with incomes growing by an average of 0 2 per cent a compared with 0 5 per cent a year between 2010 11 and 2014 15 while top earners were hit the hardest following the financial the big difference looking forward is that the biggest losers are lower income with the entire bottom third of the income distribution set to see incomes fall in the years ahead could be halted if the people decided the costs of leaving the greatly outweighed any tony has said in an interview marking his return to political the former made more than in a month from giving speeches to us financial and a his register of interests the former conservative health has urged the government to invest more in social care speaking on the world at he said he was that did not address this in his autumn statement the next two years are going to be incredibly difficult and i think the time is now for trying to put some measures in place to try and help health and social care through those next two has called for more money to be spent on social care and mental health speaking ahead of campaign day on he said the campaign had three elements three elements one hospital of waiting times and sustainability and transformation which are putting at risk a lot of departments all around the country the second element is social of social the need to improve social care and improve the way in which we treat care workers very responsible and very well experienced people they should be treated better and paid better there is a mental health crisis across the country i feel very passionately about why i have appointed a shadow minister at cabinet level just for dealing with mental health because i think as a country we have to face up to the crisis fund it but above all change the mood music as well the biggest killer of men is suicide from mental health conditions terrible visiting the hospital in today has reportedly dismissed reports that he plans to emigrate to the us as all from me for for the comments number 10 has hit back at the ifs it says that if you look at disposable not then people are getting better are from hits back at says real household disposable incomes will rise by by ifs looks at wages but better to look at net you look at livings standards they 're at their highest ever ifs figures relate to earnings number 10 is talking about disposable a different measure that includes benefits and and looks at left after tax and national insurance have been paid open the group campaigning to keep in the single has put out a statement from saying the ifs analysis shows that the economic warnings about issued during the referendum campaign were accurate he this is clear proof that the vote has made working families worse off the irresponsibility of leave campaigners was breathtaking they should now be admitting that economic warnings made during the campaign were not project they were project promises that would make better off now appear naive and complacent the conservative former work and pensions told news this afternoon that he did not accept the ifs claim that workers face the longest squeeze on wages for 70 years asked about its he surprised because wages are increasing increasing across the board and well above inflation there was a period when they were absolutely static but over the last two and a half wages been increasing and the forecasts all the way have been that wages will continue to increase so i this dire prediction of no increase at all since the also said that he did not accept the forecasts from bodies like the ifs and the office for budget responsibility about the impact of on the economy my sense about this is that the economy is already confounding the forecasts all the from the ifs and from the and everybody all said that we were going to see a downturn immediately after the vote we seen that the is growing faster than they predicted we just saw the debt fall three days when they predicted it would rise so my sense about this is we are into territory where nobody really knows that the future smith is right about wages growing but he ignores the fact that they fell so in real that they have not caught up with where they were before the crash the resolution foundation makes the point today in this in its autumn statement analysis published this morning average weekly in real terms resolution foundation here is john the shadow on the ifs analysis this lost decade for living standards is unprecedented in modern history and is a damning indictment of the abject failure of the economic policy during their six wasted years in office the economic has meant decline in living standards for working people even as the and the big corporations are given large tax promised action in the autumn statement for those about instead he has betrayed them by continuing to slash failing to raise the living to the level failing to deliver more funding for our and social care and now threatening pensioners with removing the has different priorities and will prepare our economy for instead of cutting taxes for the and giant we will make sure our is properly support the pensions and introduce a real living wage built on an economy that invests for the so that and no community is left behind the ifs has now put up on its websites its distributional analysis slides one shows the impact of all tax and benefit reforms since the 2015 election they are highly regressive the gains in the autumn statement light green were very and came nowhere near compensating for the impact of the benefit cuts announced by last year distributional analysis this shows the impact of the tax and benefit changes on family groups pensioners have done especially wealthy pensioners families without children were in the and families with children have done worst distributional impact ifs and here are two more important charts from one of the ifs presentations one shows the impact the benefit freeze was going to have on families with inflation forecast to grow at the rate expected in march impact of inflation and the benefits freeze march figures this or rather the dark green bars in this show how the impact as got worse in the light of the new inflation forecasts impact of inflation and benefits freeze march figures and figures compared here is the laura commenting on these pm really wants to make families who 're having a hard time make ends meet feel better she has huge job if these estimates are 2016 here is a chart from one of the ifs presentations showing debt as proportion of national income going back to 1700 it has been much higher but the two previous peaks were caused by the wars and the second world war national debt ifs and here are some more lines from the ifs my colleague detailed analysis of outlook for living standards suggests younger have been and will be harder notes that majority of giveaway from yet another fuel duty freeze from the govt goes to better off half of the daily jack says the public debt been higher than this in the past during world war two oh and during the the verdict from the ifs is big losers from tax benefit reforms during this parliament will be low income caveat from the lots of uncertainty here we could get a to the economy actually hit a budget surplus after much for helping the ifs says autumn statement made no big hit was welfare suggests the respondents to our poll were on the money see the economy will be smaller for every household in by because of the vote to leave the on tweaks to universal is not how to design and introduce the biggest reform to our welfare system in john lists some abandoned tougher pip selling to for social tenants for insurance premium tax tax we need to worry about quite a as it the economy away from production involving yesterday did n't change fact the big losers over this parliament due to be low income mainly due to benefit credit so far 4 changes to work allowance 1 change to childcare support 1 change to withdrawal 2016 here are the key points from opening statement at the ifs autumn statement briefing said by 2021 wages would still be lower than they were in 2008 in real terms and that has not had such a period without earnings growth since the second world war said the expected rise in inflation meant the real value of the living would rise by just over during the course of this not as said inflation also meant that real value of working age benefits like that are currently frozen in cash terms will fall by rather than said had effectively adopted ed spending plans rather than aiming for budget balance in 2019 20 will be happy borrowing of national about in 2020 21 remember that at the last election the then shadow ed said he was aiming to balance the current budget by borrow just to invest keeping to that over the parliament would have allowed borrowing of just over of in 2020 21 to misquote it be far from the truth to say that the new fiscal plans they are he predicted that the government would have to spend more money on health or social care strikingly responded not at all to calls for more money for either the or social care going to stick my neck out and suggest he be able to do that for much longer he the government for continuing to freeze fuel duty every year instead of simply abandoning the proposed annual increases one of the more expensive measures announced was yet another freeze to fuel duty the seventh year in a row this has happened if the policy is never to increase fuel duty as seems to be the we should just be told rather than being told always that it will rise with inflation next year and then that never happening this is turning into a really big problem both for the treasury and for our approach to the taxation of motoring he said the forecasts were more than the bank of earlier this month the bank projected growth of 1 5 and in 2018 and 2019 respectively the projections are for growth of 1 7 and quite a big said policy in the autumn statement amounted to not in the face of deteriorating forecasts neither tightened fiscal policy nor followed his example of sticking with previous spending plans he loosened by an annual billion or so and he loosened in a rather specific mostly by increasing planned capital spending given the choice between jam today in the form of more money in pockets and jam tomorrow in the form of potential economic returns from greater he went for jam accused of being disingenuous about the increase in the insurance premium arguing that the rate was hard to justify guilty of too many fiscal infelicities but the way in which he announced the increase in was certainly one of them it is half the rate of he as if in explanation of the rise so it should be in fact it should be lower only the value of the insurance premiums net of pay outs which one should think of as being that would imply an rate much less than not more he said the ifs backed the idea of scrapping the autumn although he expressed about whether this would happen we will also wait and see whether this really is the last autumn statement we have been here before after all chancellor also moved from a separate autumn statement and spring budget to a single autumn budget that survive a change of occupancy at number 11 at the ifs briefing news here is the full text of opening presentation at the ifs briefing workers in face the biggest squeeze on their pay for 70 years as a blow to the economy knocks wage growth and stokes according to an analysis of the latest tax and spending over autumn the institute for fiscal studies said real wages in the pay adjusted for inflation will still be below their 2008 level in the director said in his presentation cannot stress how dreadful that is more than a decade without real earnings growth we have certainly not seen a period remotely like it in the last 70 warning follows signs that the sharp fall since the referendum result is hiking the cost of imports to the and could soon be passed on to consumers at the same experts warn pay growth could stall as companies grapple with and economic the independent the office for budget said the economy would slow next year and inflation would a separate analysis of the autumn the resolution said families faced a worse squeeze on their living standards over the next five years than they suffered in the wake of the financial crisis director of the institute for fiscal has just started the briefing on the autumn says wages in real terms will still be below their 2008 levels in 2021 this is he is the key quote the outlook for living standards has deteriorated rather sharply since march the is forecasting both lower nominal wage growth as a result of lower and higher inflation resulting from the exchange rate depreciation overall real average earnings are forecast to rise by less than between now and 2021 that means they will be lower in 2021 than was projected in march to put it another way around half of the wage growth projected for the next five years back in march is not now projected to happen on these projections real wages still be below their 2008 levels in 2021 one cannot stress enough how dreadful that is more than a decade without real earnings growth we have certainly not seen a period remotely like it in the last 70 years i will post a full summary of his statement shortly only a third of voters think the measures announced in the autumn statement will help the an poll conducted for the guardian carried out its survey last night although respondents were generally positive about the measures in the autumn statement they were asked overall they did not seem very convinced that policies would do a lot to help the if the package of measures announced by would be helpful or unhelpful to the the results also asked about six specific policies in the autumn all received either majority or plurality but there were some interesting measure with the highest net support was increasing the living by an hour to but the measure with the highest number of people both supporting and saying it would make a was increasing the income tax threshold to in measure announced by in but reconfirmed by the measure with the lowest net support was abandoning the 2019 20 budget surplus are the net support figures for the six policies saying they are in whether or not they think it will make a here are the same but this time listed in order of people saying they support them think the policy is sufficient to make a unlimited interviewed an sample of 1 , 317 adults aged on the evening of 23rd 2016 interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults is a member of the polling council and abides by its rules made in a

two helicopter trips in the register of one in 2015 to the forest of dean conservative dinner and another to north summer reception in this year tony has given a lengthy interview to the new statesman here are some of the top says that he wants to help resurrect politics as the guardian reported on he is setting up a new political next year in his interview he rules out a return to the political but he explains that he wants to help politicians who are challenging extremists what doing is to spend more time not in the front line of because i have no intention of going back to the front line of to correct another misunderstanding but in trying to create the space for a political debate about where modern western democracies go and where the progressive forces particularly find their place dismayed by the state of western but also incredibly motivated by it i think in got millions of effectively politically homeless people interested in doing is what are the types of ideas that we should be taking how do we provide a service to people who are in the front line of so that we can provide some thinking and some the thing really tragic about politics today is that the best ideas about politics in politics i find the ideas are much more interesting in the technology much more interesting ideas about how you change the says that could be reversed it can be stopped if the people decide having seen what it the analysis stack up and that can happen in one of two ways not saying it will by the but it could just until you see what it how do you the two ways in which could be he goes either you get maximum access to the single market in which case end up accepting a significant number of the rules on on payment into the on the jurisdiction people may then hang why are we leaving or be out of the single market and the economic pain may be very because beyond doubt if you do that have maybe a of economic restructuring the resolution foundation has published its full verdict on the autumn statement as my colleagues heather and it is saying that the squeeze on living standards over the next five years could be even worse than it was during the financial is there living standards squeeze be worse than after global read is how it starts families face a worse squeeze on their living standards over the next five years than they suffered in the wake of the financial as slows the economy and conservative welfare cuts according to a new of autumn statement by the resolution foundation suggests average earnings are set to grow only half as rapidly as in the austerity years after the economic crisis at the same living standards will be undermined by higher inflation and ongoing welfare the squeeze of the last parliament affected workers across the income the foundation says households are set to be hardest hit over the next five because they are particularly affected by planned welfare here is the full resolution foundation report john the shadow has also been giving interviews this morning here are the key points he has been indicated that wanted taxes to be but that it was not looking to increase the overall tax burden make sure that instead of giving tax giveaways to the wealthy and and ignoring the issue of tax avoidance and tax make sure we had a fair taxation system and in that way not talking about increasing taxes or anything like what we are saying is that we use our resources more will want to abide by the principles that you spend what you earn they have given tax on capital gains on corporation on inheritance tax to the wealthy in our community and also to corporations and what we saw yesterday they were cutting the universal credits that are going to be given to what they call the just about people going into looking after their doing everything asked of them so got the wrong priorities he defended decision to support a tax cut for people paying the higher rate of income tax is backing the plan to increase the tax threshold for people paying the higher rate of income tax asked about he there are large numbers of people earning above who are in jobs like train like senior teachers and others who have been hit and do need protecting if we are going to be doing redistribution we should be hitting those who are over for our policy is on reverting to the original tax system we had some years ago we have to that the reality of those people on middle incomes and the pressures that they are particularly with regard to housing costs in certain parts of our said was committed to keeping the triple lock the law that says pensions will rise every year by or in line with earnings or whichever is higher the are committed to keeping this until 2020 but in his autumn hinted that it could be dropped after that because it is too expensive asked if was right to review i would be very disappointed if he did the triple under the government brown wanted to tackle the issues around child poverty and pensioner poverty and that is what he did he lifted people out of poverty at both stages of their both children and older people if we can grow the and we have a fair taxation we can afford was right to say the last government did a lot to reduce pensioner but the triple lock was actually a coalition not a said the failure to set out its stance was increasing economic we do these negotiations without openness and transparency people need to know where is the government going and how is it going to get there at least then you things and people will be able to settle down into serious negotiations and we will get the best deal until the government gets to that we are going to have these uncertainties and this played down the significance of a picture showing many looking at their phones in the commons chamber when he was responding to yesterday he it look brilliant but what they do now and they have to think themselves the new style in parliament at the moment is people are tweeting all the time doing a running commentary on going on it look but what interesting because got these new devices all the tweeting all the but interestingly enough the general response to the points i was making was received quite well within parliament and interesting never seen this before and this is not me boasting if you looked at the opposite me and those i held their attention even though tweeting about what responded to and looked at their phones me for via 2016 here is a full summary of the main points from interviews this said the economic future was uncertain because no one knew what the outcome of the talks would be when it was put to him that the government was at fault for telling the office for budget responsibility very little about its he said that the government had said what it the greatest possible access to markets but the outcome of the negotiations would not just depend on what the government he went on the fact it is not about what we want the outcome to be going to be a negotiation we are going to sit at the table with the representatives of the union and at this can be certain about what the outcome of that negotiation will be that is what creates the whether you are a chancellor of the exchequer trying to forecast the public finances for a couple of years down the line or whether you are a businessman making an investment in a production said the government was preparing for range of possible from the talks a sensible and prudent thing to he defended the saying the government would be wrong to ignore its forecasts have the saying its forecasts about the impact of on the economy are wrong said it was important to remember that forecasting was not a precise science but he said the government would be wrong to ignore what it said economic forecasting is not a precise science and the itself makes the point in its report that there is a very high degree of uncertainty around the report that they issued yesterday because of the circumstances that they are it was put to him that this means he thinks the forecasts should be taken with pinch of as the telegraph claims this he i think we should look at what the report is we should certainly not ignore we should look at it as one of the possible range of outcomes that we need to plan has posted this on pointing out that was right to say the has acknowledged a high degree of is a wide range of uncertainty around the forecasts says this is true said the government was preparing for a possible economic slowdown next year to me it makes given the warning signals from the to keep a little bit of firepower in the to build a little bit of a reserve so that if there is a slowdown next got enough capacity to support the to protect to ensure that the economy can get through any headwinds it rejected claims that debt was out of control when it was put to him that the government had lost control of debt he not out of larger than we would like it to rejected claims that the autumn statement contained nothing for the families who are about when this was put to he i think true at all we are facing very significant fiscal challenges within the constraints that that tried to focus what firepower we do have on helping those who are ordinary working families who are to get the scheduled rise in fuel duty was an important step in that process reducing the taper in universal credit so that people in work on low wages are able to keep more of their wages recommitting to raising the personal allowance in the income tax system to 12 , 500 by the end of this parliament despite the fiscal challenges will leave everybody in this country better off and of course a rise in the living which will put 500 a year in the pockets of somebody over 25 working on the living i think those are important steps rejected claims that the government was now adopting the spending plans proposed at the 2015 general election would have exempted investment spending from borrowing he said he said his new fiscal rules included investment rejected claims that he ignored the in his statement when this was put to he it is not true that it was not mentioned if you read the it absolutely was mentioned as i said yesterday in it may have been my first autumn but not a complete rookie and i would not have failed to mention the rejected the ideal of playing any role in the relations with asked about he if i ever need any advice from got his number and give him a call tell him not to hold his breath on sky news sky news

familiar as to be in some respects the term was because missed his targets and had to his but the claim that the conservatives were on a path towards eliminating the deficit seemed to impress the public and this strategy helped and to win the 2015 general consigned the to the dustbin in it collapsed the day the voted for but had to tell that the referendum result has blasted a huge hole in the national finances and he has all but abandoned any hope of getting the budget into surplus on his watch targets have been the government plans to carry on borrowing and spending autumn statement envisages a fiscal loosening of almost by although the treasury hopes to balance the budget in the it say when this might happen all of this is quite but it is not the economic prudence that won the the 2015 the past governing parties have been consigned to opposition for a decade or more for economic mismanagement on this scale but there is no sign of this happening to the conservatives did not ask the country to vote for and nor did or may political authority remains the autumn statement will have disappointed those who expected government to be quite different from when she became prime minister in may said she would focus her attention on those just about managing today was her first big chance to strike out in a new direction although the statement contained some progressive measures universal credit and letting what was striking was the continuity with not the contrast how much difference has she just according to a resolution foundation analysis all from us for for the comments buried the goal of balancing the budget in this parliament today and the financial markets bat an pound has jumped by one percent against the to a high also higher against the dollar tonight

that we might avoid falling real if the too is expecting average real wage growth to stall but not fall vote more optimistic than many forecasters the big picture really economy is still suffering from low productivity and a debt hangover from the 2008 with casting another head of equities at old mutual global warns that we should remain in my substantial risks to the economy bringing into question an implicit suggestion that animal spirits will suddenly rise in the years it the country continues to face the same uncertainties that triggered such a sharp decline in the value of sterling in the aftermath of the referendum vote this is from the referendum warned that leaving 500 , 000 job losses today 's says employment will rise by 500 , 000 by 2016 leave means leave chosen not to challenge the analysis of the impact of in its autumn statement reaction but of economists for has taken it on he has put out this statement the report issued today contains a number of assumptions around the impact of which simply follows the path of countless other establishment which have assumed a pessimistic outlook for the economy outside the based on bad economic whilst it acknowledges the fact that the decision of the chosen path is it then applies what amounts to an arbitrary penalty on the economy without any proper justification why does it assume lower a spending slowdown due to uncertainty and lower work of economists for has shown in each of these cases the reverse to be true our forecasts show that there is a positive impact of being outside of the single market and embracing free trade under creating an additional over the long recent for the second and third quarters have shown clearly that there is no uncertainty and on immigration our estimates are that unskilled migrants cost a total of billion a year better control of unskilled whilst continuing to encourage skilled migration can only have a positive economic impact bodies tried to forecast economic disaster based on uncertainty in the months leading up to and just after the when uncertainty was at its highest yet there is no sign that there was any economic effect so it is illogical in the extreme to forecast further disaster owing to just as the picture is becoming clearer of course it is true that if bodies like the push out continual gloomy if downing street gives no direction and when it does take a takes down the worst possible economic path then all this could come true just as they did in the spring and the they are mistaking the very worst outcome for a sensible forecast chief economist at the says poor households faces a tough with inflation likely to devour wage announced benefit cuts will wipe out the benefits announced families will gain by modest amounts of a few pounds a week from the reduction in the universal credit taper rate and the rise in the income tax personal allowance however these gains will be dwarfed by much bigger cuts to work allowances imposed by in this year a couple with two children each earning a year will see a benefit of a year from the income tax and universal credit taper but will lose from the benefit freeze and the cut in universal credit work chief executive of the charities aid fears that charities will face an increased burden as economic growth slows know that during uncertain times charities are increasingly relied upon to support those in most need in recent years charities have experienced rising demand for their services while resources have been increasingly sector reactions to 2016 autumn statement read more here is some reaction to the autumn statement from director of the resolution foundation the big picture today is the new chancellor accepting a major increase in partly off the back of the and choosing to increase it further with an expensive but welcome increase in capital spending the result is additional with national debt reaching 90 per cent of next outlook for family finances that lies behind the big growth and borrowing figures is also with average earnings set to be lower by the end of the parliament than previously increasing borrowing the chancellor has left the big welfare cuts intact and chosen not to provide significant support for the just managing families that may has rightly said she is focused double whammy of lower earnings and benefit cuts mean that the poorest third of households are now set to face a parliament of falling living standards in the months and years ahead the key task facing the government is to turn that situation chief economist at the foundation 2017 is going to be a tough year as wages will barely grow faster than prices whilst there will be modest gains for some people from autumn for most people on these will be dwarfed by previously announced cuts to benefits with average wage growth predicted to be and prices forecast to go up by most families will not feel much better off the increase in the minimum wage will bring some relief to those on the lowest although even this is lower than predicted last families will gain by modest amounts of a few pounds a week from the reduction in the universal credit taper rate and the rise in the income tax personal allowance however these gains will be dwarfed by much bigger cuts to work allowances imposed by in this year a couple with two children each earning a year will see a benefit of a year from the income tax and universal credit taper but will lose from the benefit freeze and the cut in universal credit work majority of the benefit from the income tax changes will go to and the own documents say that it will cost in spent these funds could have made a significant difference to families who are just about the institute of economic affairs this was a thin and fiddly so a relief that the chancellor has found one area of government activity to cut in abolishing the autumn statement sadly he has abandoned any attempt to balance the books over the next five years the government will be adding over to the national as much as the entire annual welfare bill fiscal rules to this government sadly seem to be no more than vague aspirations which are abandoned with the the chancellor does seem to that no need to implement policy for the sake of it a boring budget statement is better than a gimmicky director of the social market foundation this was a continuity autumn statement deficit reduction while delivering the manifesto and a productivity essentially plus of extra must wait for the major policy changes for the new industrial strategy as well as the plans for is a risk that driving immigration down to of could cause the public finances to deteriorate even further than the new forecasts chief economist at the at the beginning of his speech the chancellor made the now familiar claim that the economy is in a strong condition but the rest of his speech gave the lie to he then investment and productivity are far below our major we have a record trade an unsustainable fiscal gap between projected tax receipts and public and a regionally deeply unbalanced economy between and the southeast and the rest of the he did not but was made clear during the referendum is how unequal the distribution of income and wealth has become it is time that the national debate about the economy reflected these fundamental weaknesses tackling them will require a far more profound change to policy than the measures the chancellor announced chief executive at demos no one is in any doubt that the government has a challenge trying to boost economic growth against a backdrop of ongoing instability caused by at the same the commitment to the jams perhaps in part many voted to leave the as an expression of their frustration with the statue quo necessitates spending in areas that matter most to them this seems to be the approach is taking popular giveaways such as the fuel duty freeze mixed with investment for growth it seems that we should be raising tax bracket at helping as it does those at the upper end of the income scale while reducing the tax take here is the comment on the autumn statement sent out by leave means the successor to it is from john leave means quoting it in full it does not mention the analysis of the impact of at all the chancellor has made a good start on the road to making the economy the best in the in infrastructure and research and improving access to finance particularly for tech companies which ensures they do not have to sell out to foreign and funding for the oxford expressway are all very positive announcements this is a solid base on which to build and the huge benefits brings to our country through signature ready trade tariff reduction and deregulation that will feel like a tax cut for businesses and real tax cuts will enable the economy to fringe benefit of is that the chancellor will have to make the the best country in the world to do task now is to build confidence in the economy he has a golden opportunity to improve further the strong economic forecasts and make thanks to further detail shows that the 80 , 000 a year reduction in net migration expected to follow the vote will cost over the next five tables show that the reduction in net migration will come as a result of a tighter net migration policy and the becoming a less attractive place for migrants will cost the economy it estimates that cut in migration will cost the economy in rising to a year by this is a total of over the next five years buried on page 160 of its the makes the surprising prediction that will be paying more to the in 2018 19 and despite watchdog has calculated that the fall in the pound will push up the contributions to the budget are paid in by in 2018 19 and and in 2020 21 have stopped paying into the from march not according to the it believes payments will if wants to keep access the single market the government has said it wishes to negotiate a bespoke arrangement with the that may or may not include agreeing to contribute to the budget to retain some of the benefits that it has enjoyed from membership could also have to contribute to pension and the investment bank and if universities lose the government may have to step in the did n't pick this up a round pa of transfers only due to the slump induced by who objected to transfers 2016 finch from the resolution foundation says the autumn statement reverses only of the losses affecting the poorest half of households during this finch measures reverse only of losses for poorest half of from policies already in train this parliament 2016 as points the autumn statement document shows that the spending limit for certain welfare is being welfare cap has been it is now it has been raised higher only be assessed by in 4 years as the report the government is on course to miss the current limit by by the end of this parliament and the requires a subset of welfare spending to be held below a cash limit set in but we now expect this to overshoot by more than 7 per cent by 2020 21 the green for not mentioning climate change in the autumn statement she with election this could have been a moment for to become a in the fight against catastrophic climate change we see little evidence of a commitment to facing up to the greatest challenge of our times it is shameful that the chancellor failed to even mention climate change in his speech by caving into the motor lobby and freezing fuel duty again for the seventh year in a row the government has made a mockery of the fact that it is the hottest year on record and condemned us to more carbon emissions and deadly pollution and here is mark a member of the welsh responding to the autumn statement on behalf of despite the fearsome predictions of remain the overall prognosis for the economy is as we knew it would be the official forecast is that unemployment in 2020 after we have left the will be just 860 , 000 this administers the last rites to the infamous claim that jobs would be lost if we left the are borrowing too this and more than planned across the forecast period the government has talked tough on austerity but failed to match its words with month the government delays costs the exchequer over a billion pounds says just get on with it
appearing on that most revered of presidential forums called trump released a video this week describing his plans to great again for and i mean learned not to believe magnanimous but others really

forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every forgive because about to pop off have you lost all sense of you and talk as if we have no idea who trump is or what he has been saying for months on end but trump has made it abundantly clear opportunistic words of inclusion notwithstanding that his administration will be loyal to the fringes of the united leaving even the republican establishment running behind announced cabinet choices simply leave no room for imagining a gentler at the helm of the those of us concerned about the fate of the undocumented or the environment or reproductive rights see much reason to worry with the selection of mike and general t to inner circle list reads like a roll call to the dick fan among many other troubling all these

thing that would sound bigoted if it were about another religion but today sounds like comments are troubling rather than enabling establishment republicans as a moderating influence on the the trump administration is pulling the traditional down its own giving less extreme republicans about as much voice in this new administration as chair actually worse at least the chair had the good sense to stay quiet my worry extends beyond the realm of what this administration says and reaches into what it will do building a wall on the border is a near physical impossibility the immediate deportation of millions of people is much harder to execute than it sounds but the that can and most likely will secretary of state another hardliner who is in the running for homeland security recently met with trump and was photographed holding his strategic plan for first 365 openly in his hands nobody give this man the nuclear plain for the world to see was the of an useless program of the bush administration officially called and more commonly known as i remember vividly the panic and confusion among the of new city when special registration was first enacted in 2002 this which required visa holding men from 24 countries and north to register with the was a massive failure even the own auditor found the program to be ineffective and a huge waste of resources the cost to taxpayers was more than a year and the program alienated around the world from the united states families were torn apart because of special and the brilliant program netted a grand total of zero terrorism registration was useful only as a tool to disrupt average lives and to spend a lot of money needlessly it served no security function and trump is considering reviving it we can assume because it will make this government like doing on the backs of ordinary then this justifying a registry on fox trump surrogate positively invoked internment as a legal precedent for the program that heinous comparison led the new times to publish an by a law professor reassuring us even if the legal decision authorizing internment has never been we be worried because the judiciary now sees the legal justification for internment as constitutional that whole exercise is nuts the question is not about the constitutionality of internment the question is why the hell are we talking about internment are we seriously working through the legal likelihood or unlikelihood of holding large numbers of completely innocent people in detention racial hysteria led us down that road once to say that panic lead us down a similarly treacherous with or without a 1944 legal precedent beginning to feel like one major terrorist attack from martial law in this and the new administration even taken office yet a fiction in the us that is frequently promoted by the likes of fox news and that had a major impact on this election the notion is that in our multicultural white get theirs while every minority and special interest group gets extra privileges the idea cultivates a mood of bitterness and even if fundamentally untrue many honestly believe that are getting special privileges that some accept will lead to the imposition of sharia law in this country but this is ludicrous want special privileges we just want to be treated the same way that everyone else is treated going to get special registration hardly a fair need more than assurances from trump that thinking about the whole country when he invokes we need to know that equality under the law will be guaranteed under his administration in what we really need to be doing is proving to all that everyone deserves to be treated equally while acknowledging all of our and that the kind of equality that makes for a stronger

talent of those already in and of those who believe ours is the kind of welcoming country that allows ambition to position of the government and some others is very different from the refusal to guarantee the status of fellow nationals living in and the to the threat to draw up lists of foreign the government seems intent on sending out a welcome am determined that we send out a different one

national security council on the implications of trump 's election imagine doing 2016 but sir who himself served as ambassador in has told the independent that that giving the job to would be the financial foreign affairs thinks that appointing as ambassador to the us might not be such a bad idea after all an extract from his ft instant insight column what is the first job of a ambassador to it is to get close to the white house would have an unprecedented closeness to the us the kind of access that other ambassadors could only dream of he campaigned alongside the after the had a personal meeting with trump well before may prime was given a perfunctory 10 minutes on the phone could also play an important role in securing one of most important a deal with the us unlike i believe that decision to leave the is a disastrous mistake which will inflict economic damage on but we are where we are given has got itself into this absurd we need to look for escape routes is probably one of the few people with a chance of persuading the trump administration to make a trade deal a top of the reasons for rejecting a ambassadorship amount to little more than wounded pride suggestion is a humiliating breach of protocol it is just a foretaste of the indignities that trump is likely to inflict on over the next four years looking forward to that state visit to the statistics authority has reprimanded the department for education for sending out a misleading tweet about grammar civil service world reports leading doctors have expressed concern over the impact could have on the the press association reports if there is a dip in the number of surgeons who work in the there could be a vice president of the royal college of surgeons said he told the house of lords committee on the sustainability of the that recent years had seen an increase in the number of surgeons who were coming to work in the around one in five surgeons in the in england come from the said he percent of surgeons on specialist registers in this country trained overseas these half trained in and the other half trained outside and what has happened in recent years is the number of people coming from outside has been diminishing while the numbers coming from within has been if that tap was to be turned off there could be potentially a significant problem certainly for prof president of the royal

conservative mp who says who pretend they have won medals for when that is not the should be punished a former captain in the royal marines who received the conspicuous gallantry cross for his service in told the that the bill was unnecessary he i think just going too far to suggest someone could go to prison i think very important to look at going on with someone that is actually pretending that they served in the armed forces there may well be a serious mental health problem and actually that person just has low not a threat to the and they actually need professional help downing street and the foreign office have slapped down a suggestion from the us that would be a good ambassador to as said the inflammatory views made him a poor candidate for a diplomatic electoral commission has begun an investigation into whether broke election funding laws by apparently using money from a parliament group to fund failed attempt to win a and in the the foreign has for attacking stance on climate change during foreign office questions in the commons he also claimed that hoped to and the actions of the trump administration and and a and chair of the party in the has said he thinks the wants to stay in the single market speaking after a meeting with the in the weber what we really expect are clear proposals in my talk with unfortunately i have not heard anything i have not heard much as to how the government wants to tackle and what really means i have not received any new quite the opposite is i have been told that the as far as the economy is it wants to stay in the single market but the government would also like to continue and have very close in legal downing street said that the position had not changed and that it wanted trading relationship that allows companies to trade both with and within the single market and lets businesses do the weber has also for promoting the idea of turkey joining the while he spread alarm about it during the referendum campaign referring to weber himself in the leaflets where he showed and as possible members of the making people afraid of possible migration waves he used it himself and then a few weeks afterwards he is to and he is offering support for becoming a member of the union it is it is a provocation and it is arrogant what we hear from him i cannot respect this any what he is doing in this factories are poised to raise both output and prices over the coming months as they continue to adjust to the impact of the referendum in as the latest snapshot of the economy from the confederation of industry showed that order books for manufacturers are strong and production is expected to rise at its fastest pace in almost two years over the next three the warned that the fall in the value of the pound since

commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee that the civil service will have to expand if it wants to be able to cope with both and its normal government duties he there is a genuine issue about capacity to manage both the demands of which is complex and with big and at the same time taking forward a set of other policy initiatives that government wants to take up i think not possible to do that at a point where the civil service is at its lowest number since the second world war and continuing to government ought to do some form of independent or assessment of its preparedness for this huge task got ahead of it on who is accused of murdering the mp has opted not to give evidence in his at the old as the jury was told that had declined to appear as a witness in the trial flint said the would offer no other the has claimed ministers a over speaking at the annual conference of the airport operators association who campaigned for frankly very little evidence apart from some mildly lunatic optimism over here that it will be all right on the night like army going off to war here be all right sergeant just keep plodding along these guys have no idea where going for the next two years and the problem is that in the absence of any discussions with the on all talking to themselves they stand up in the houses of parliament going to do a good deal for any

morning may with the prime minister in number 10 this morning via here is my colleague take on suggestion that should be appointed ambassador to the tweet queries how special our relationship should be read here is how it starts interest in other world leaders has sometimes seemed closely related to whether or not his family has a golf course or luxury hotel under construction in their territory the conversations reportedly turn as much to completing a planning permission as a peace it will have been with alarm that downing street woke up this morning to find trump has been involved in some more twitter diplomacy advising the interim would make a great ambassador to from underlining how social media has become integral to modern the tweet reveals how strong and deep connections are with the how little he possibly cares or possibly knows about diplomatic and how much his ego precedes all else here is in the commons saying there is no vacancy for ambassador to the us on ambassador is no video says that although the is leaving the it is not leaving he says he wants to carry on hosting the 2023 capital of culture and he wants the to carry on participating in events like this after it leaves is now taking topic questions in the commons these are questions that have not been tabled in and so any subject can come up here is the mp black on comments on black mp to telling us to look for positives in trump 's administration reminds me of this no is worth racism 2016 and here is the quote from where he said the government hoped to and the actions of the trump administration he was responding to the mp i do think it is very important that on all sides of this house we should be as positive as we possibly can be about working with the incoming us administration it is of massive importance to our country and indeed to the world and i suggest to the member that he should judge that new administration by their actions in office of we hope to shape and influence and here is the quote where he said the would urge trump to accept the reality of climate change he was responding to and he i think it is vital that we are as positive as we can possibly be about the new as i have said i believe the relationship is of vital importance i think that trump is a deal maker and when it comes to climate this is something that the has led on we have had outstanding success yes very open with the house it is a message that we are taking to the we believe it to be we believe it be in the interests of the united states and of the world here is the quote where said attacks on trump were against the national the shadow foreign said that election was a dangerous development for the future of our because he thought climate change was a hoax she asked if may would have the moral backbone to tell he is wrong on climate when she visited him in and said if trump refuses to change his stance on climate may should condemn him i really must say to the right lady that i believe she is being premature in her hostile judgments of the and any such premature i could be damaging to the interests of this country it is important for us in this country to use our which is very to help the united states to see its as sure they will climate attack on trump could damage national interest video asks to confirm that the government is considering a transitional deal on says the government will get the best possible deal for the it will be for the and the he says the shadow foreign says we meet on the 53rd anniversary of john f death says trump is a and that we have every reason to be positive about him why should be be positive about his views on climate says it is vital we are as positive as we can be about says trump is a deal maker when it comes to climate this is something the has led on the will be taking this message to the trump he says will urge trump to accept the reality of climate says trump thinks climate change is a hoax invented by the will may tell trump he is wrong and will she condemn trump if he scraps the climate change says is being and he says trump like this is against the national says attacks on trump are against the national interest
bloodbath of an a friend emailed me watching someone get another said over the phone and this in an email from a veteran of the third draft dodger is now commander in to the full flowering of the era of which began with that now glide down the escalator at trump where trump commenced his candidacy with these historic when sends its not sending their best sending people that have lots of and bringing those problems with us bringing drugs bringing crime rapists and i are good ever a monument is erected to the trump then surely these words shades of will be carved into the marble along with coming out of her bucks a and would bring back a hell of a lot worse than in true demagogic trump bypassed the head and spoke directly to the to the biles and bubbling acids of raw emotion he said things that many temperate hardly dared to admit we carried in ourselves were hardly aware of just how deeply we resented our own how angry our interior lives with all this stuff bottled years and years of internalized from a culture that kept insisting on tolerance many discovered just what a drag political correctness was all these and to be free of freed from this code that was jamming us that was relief akin to a primal scream from the start rallies had the air of the tent that same hot thrum of militant exorcism and not fool a friend wrote stand anything but cold honesty right now this is not a winning the which would be bad enough this is white supremacy tempted to say really not that bad stances are things get said in the heat of a and we could take heart in the newly conciliatory trump on display for several days after the election then came the news that the erstwhile chairman of the trump campaign who bears a striking resemblance to the town drunk on the old was named counselor and chief for the incoming trump administration the mainstream press still feels compelled to explain the term but we know we we we white aka honky dig too deeply into the family along

his hands and let the hot mess of the bush economy continue its meltdown to the issue is bigger than any particular president after his on one the is that we all go forward with a presumption of good faith in our fellow because that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant and functioning goes to the heart of the matter the system of constitutional government is founded on deliberate fragmentation of the of and and that we all learned in high school civics for government to be effective for government to meet the needs of the people the us constitutional order requires a healthy measure of good faith cooperation among the players this good faith began to fray in the early as leaders in newt and tom delay chief among declared war on all efforts even from those in their own party to govern from a stance of bipartisan cooperation in world of moral were enemy of normal and his allies were fighting no less than a with and as he declared in a speech to the heritage war has to be fought with a scale and a duration and a savagery that is only true of civil so began the constitutional hardball and tactics that have characterized the past of politics you may recall the government shutdowns of 1995 and 1995 96 over budget and the 1998 impeachment of bill for lying about a in more recent there was the famous dinner at a steakhouse on the evening of 20 2009 the day of inauguration at which congressional leaders with by then a highly paid k street vowed to sabotage presidency by opposing every item on the new economic agenda at a time when 700 , 000 jobs a month were disappearing including those items previously supported or even proposed by the all rooting for said of trump when they met recently in the oval office if he senate republican leader later summed up the stance when he publicly single most important thing we want to achieve is for president to be a burying was the and if bringing him down required shredding the constitutional then to hell with the past 220 years of constitutional order the once reserved for only the most major policy became routinely deployed even for matters by withholding funding or refusing to consider appointments to government the senate effectively nullified laws that had been duly enacted in accordance with the constitution at a time when the federal courts had a record number of scores of judicial seats went the current vacancy on the supreme court is merely the most example government shutdowns and crises once unthinkable became so endemic that for the first time in its more than standard downgraded the credit rating of the citing the phenomenon of even lawmakers have continued to use the threat of government default as a bargaining a nuclear option if carried would have catastrophic effects on the world the founding fathers wanted they have replaced the articles of confederation with the constitution but been great for the republican which has mastered a crude but so far effective campaign as the on a platform decrying government as dysfunctional and then once in power pull out all the stops to make sure government is dysfunctional and ineffective maybe this is why congress has lower approval ratings than head lice and and why has the perpetually serene look of a man who sleeps well at night those low approval ratings mean his side is winning that all this has happened at the expense of the constitutional and of the spirit of comity and good faith so necessary for the functioning of that seems not to trouble or his colleagues in the call these people is a joke they seek to

i find detailed accounts of the first world war and disastrous arctic expeditions very readable at times like system we this system that grinds huge numbers of people into it seems so vast and

play badly look to for a taste of the awful potential to the tragedies and history those coils of ego and empire and wealth sex and sex and that often end with bodies all over the place the best thing trump could do for his children would be to put his assets in a genuine blind and send the kids away far away from to do their own thing limit visits to holidays and bounce the grandkids on his not breathe a word about business or affairs of not how monarchies roll that trump would put his children in such a legally tenuous position gives us a clear idea as if we needed it from a man who used to rely on the infamous for legal counsel of his appreciation for the rule of law here again we can expect the monarchical model people rarely grow in humility once they reach the white house to the extent trump attempts to spin and mutilate the rule of his most immediate potential check will be a congress firmly in republican led by the same wrecking crew already shown such faint regard for the

trade so perhaps a different arrangement might work better than the comprehensive economic and trade agreement full membership in the it seems there will soon be a when the finally moves towards the and might make a suitable society is and proud of it while is the lingua throughout most of is widely spoken increasing numbers of speakers have expanded our linguistic fought in in both world wars it has paid its the seven years of negotiation that went into have surely paved the way for a application to join the continent with which it has so much in common full membership might make it easier for both parties to accept a mutually advantageous trading republicans might happily exchange the monarchy and the commonwealth for a seat in and i think we might feel right at home i do not see any reason why calls the demonstrators a broad coalition of union and environmental in addition to millions who signed an petition to stop the trade express valid concerns without leaks we the citizens would still not know what was written in the treaty only after the continued protest did the negotiators adopt minute changes where is the our read it and everything was in who in the or parliaments understood what was written democracy argument does not hold only the parliament dared to speak out against the deal if everyone in the were chances are a majority would reject the officialdom must think how it needs to convince citizens of the benefits of free what are the benefits for or the common people in the trade deals impoverish the great majority of which is one of the major reason for the ongoing migration major economies became rich without free trade only after their economies could compete internationally did they gradually open their markets the latest example is but so did the us and great reference to the high court ruling on article 50 what a farce it is we have a government that only managed to persuade one in four of those eligible to vote for it to do trying to usurp the will of parliament on the basis of a very marginal referendum result on the economic front we have free traders who do not want a free market in even though makes up a significant part of most are just the latest examples of a trend it has been my impression that since the late the western world has been slipping back into a new dark where decisions are made more and more on the basis of mysticism and wish than on the basis of what has happened in the last few weeks and months i think that we have arrived i look forward to the new enlightenment may cannot tear up our right to be citizens without the authority of she can and because she has the authority of the people i wish we had a chance to have our has been an era of surprises trump call this first past the post and perhaps we vote to leave the but i want the back again before the bankrupts us is she hopes their constituents by ignoring and overruling their clear vote for thereby the from its own people disconnect from ordinary voters is what led to now in the first place perhaps commentators should begin listening to us pesky masses a big thanks to for having had the courage to spell out the truth about the rather than hiding behind the that the people have like too many politicians and commentators was it or did really say should ignore the electorate and vote to it seems democracy is only good enough if it suits her particular brand of politics and the rest of the electorate should be led to the promised land whether they choose to go there or for the a after what seems like half a i relished a complete issue of the weekly that did not contain a single reference to trump or i know pay for it next but it was great while it thank thank you i have not read or listened to any news since the disastrous us in which a minority of voters chose a demented racist to replace our first president so i was apprehensive about looking at the as i turned each i became increasingly relieved to read about the rest of the world and nothing about my country thought it was deliberate until i read the life goes on outside the a bold move by the weekly of the then current us presidential elections further proof of its rational and cool outlook e a lot like review of the penguin history of modern made me think of another small with whom the us has only recently started to mend relations despite some softening of sanctions against this country faces an uncertain still subject to continuing sanctions why does tiny a country the us used as a playground and in whose politics the have interfered for more than 100 still attract the venom of its close perhaps because is so close geographically and so long a battleground for internal us politics it is ironic that the a country defeated in the has made peace with but cannot reach a similar rapprochement with a country whose leadership and style of government the seem unable to say the wider gaps in even further suit

and 16 years to culminating in his win am finished with historical research on this which has lasted my whole life it was a conscious decision i thought i had said what i had to mainly in these two which summed up what i was able to in a massive way i wanted really to spend the time that remained on literary topics because what i really next book will take as its genesis monsieur a memoir by the and will focus on kinds of memory the selections he made and the consistencies and but also the different tones and so childhood and the later social context and so why are we obsessed with the read the book is even work in work at its very in my as long as away from his desk in in the valley outside it will remain there his debt to is evident in every page that he writes in a review for the new for the historian sir praised the years of extermination as account of unparalleled vividness and power that reads like a so it sweeping the a factual war and peace this is in some part as because make extensive use of letters and journals from victims instead of sometimes unreliable testimony of that some of his techniques for the telling of so many stories are in fact more than in terms of the judicious making and placing of laughs nonetheless at the irony the traumatic past remains very much but nonetheless you have left the period yet i have written two volumes of yes it is a from the viewpoint there is a danger in many years after the event memoirs written immediately after the like that of of and others which were very close to the may be compared almost to diaries but and i know how far i could say it about my own with the passage of time one tends to the past traumatic past remains very much but nonetheless you have left the period you have spoken to many people about you have spoken to twitter outside his home in traumatic a mirror of 20th century wrought upon him change after change he was born in known as fled to he became hidden in the seminary in he became the catholic in in the army and working under he became an academic in and he became he speaks and writes in and thinks in his he homes in on similar catastrophic on diaries and letters written the face

states is preparing for power the us has lurched to the right a few weeks before our told a reporter that if trump were he might have to leave the he laughing this time with a touch of disbelief went around the world and i got even hate mail oh yeah telling why you leave and things like that i some were worse but i think like most people part our discusses the shortcomings of the decrying reliance on the of their own their own social the underestimation of appeal to ordinary to women and even he the resurgence of nationalism in the in under in but rejects a proffered link to conditions and

appear to be close to the or to the he chose not to repudiate the endorsement of the or whatever on the one hand on the other hand accepted as his chief adviser when the man is well known for his absolutely obnoxious political and ideological views may show something of but i think he is as stupid as some describe him and if not then even because then he knows something of what he which is certainly with evil intent taking a man like that as an again in disbelief you going back to my wife and children are and i vote for he laughs again some people asked where will you so the first answer of course is but then between and trump you know which is the worst temptation to retreat is strong is too old to man the but he writes in where memory leads of a time living in he he had

grandchildren scattered round the world and his second at his there is a sense of precious time his new he describes his working it involves writing having the resultant draft typed working over it in

shadows remaining not an original gore used the term for such a as the title of his own likes the and says he must read he quickly pulls the conversation back from the empyrean to the quotidian in words to simple everyday life his second he is less literary than his a more conventional a recounting of history and the life of one who wrote it a section about the a quarrel among academics over the holocaust and how to remember the is a fascinating excursion into the politics of academia perhaps his delving back into this world explains the tribute to lodge in the title of one of the changing places the other is that just finds the campus novels very how drug abuse steered the course of history read he he writes as he now more more simply because he is old more literary efforts one of his first passes at writing when memory comes involved an attempt to summon a rush over a strawberry shake at a milk bar on the boulevard a drink remembered from his short time in with his in

in the republican party will take control of the us government for the first time since 2005 the switch from being the party of opposition to being the governing party is never easy and the deep divisions in republican party make transition unusually election added to the chaos as evident dismay and lack of preparation for taking office suggested that he had little interest in doing the job for which he had campaigned so viciously trump lost the popular vote by a significant margin and democrats also got more votes for both houses of congress this lack of popular support puts even more pressure on republicans to craft policies that a majority of can lies the problem party is led not by practical politicians but by ideologues this was not always the case republicans embraced the idea that naturally enjoyed social and economic harmony it was the job of congressmen and women to develop that harmony by figuring out how to use the government to promote equality of opportunity for

to undo all the work they had done to destroy government they set out to destroy his administration in when movement conservatives under newt captured the house for the first time since the they set

the hope that debt would end who believe in sharia law should be expelled from us read movement conservatives laid siege to remaining traditional republicans in the purging it of those they called

wealthy businessmen to take control of swing state the winking of republican leaders at the racism and sexism of backfired they found themselves trailing in the wake of a star who stripped the veneer off their rhetoric and openly called rapists and criminals and talked about women in the crudest terms trump was not one of them he was not even a politician trump is a pitching to a population primed by a generation of movement conservative politicians to see themselves as assailed by the demands of minorities and women for special treatment enforced by the trump 's tirade on and outrages us read

its adherents took advantage of new religious liberty laws to keep their children out of state schools and to demand that civic society bow to religious the religious leaders were no longer simply defending family values in a secular society they were insisting that us democracy was originally based in laws and demanding that the nation be restored to its heritage this inspired political leaders such as mike and and then there is a huckster closing a sale with whatever promises his supporters want fed on decades of movement conservative warnings that people of and women are gaming the

in an era in which inconceivable is making a habit of becoming it is perilous to offer firm predictions about the but folk carry on doing it all the same i was recently at a conference about the causes and consequences of and the where i heard the participants try to keep everyone calm by expressing confidence that those shattering setbacks to conventional wisdom would not be followed by the election of president marine pen was not two rounds of voting would see the leader of the front national beaten when it came to the final choice because moderate voters would coalesce behind whoever emerges as her prime competitor we could rely on to be a firewall against the spread of authoritarian nationalism across the west it all sounded and their confidence was buttressed by the opinion but given the recent track records of both expert opinion and this forecast was more alarming than it was my word of the year is as applied to trump peter read than peer into a foggy crystal liberal democrats might better devote their time to starting to learn some lessons from the seismic shocks of 2016 the first of these is not to surrender to a challenge made easier by reminding ourselves of the narrowness of these defeats it suits here and trumpeters on the other of the to roar that they represent for this helps them in their ambition to claim a larger mandate than they have been just as it also serves their to silence any dissent represent just over half of a very divided people trump cannot even claim that much it bears repeated repeating that he lost the popular only gaining the presidency thanks to the quirks of the electoral college had 72 , 000 people across three swing states and voted the other we would now be watching the of twitter the us trump and beaten democrat candidate did not do the courtesy of one visit while bewildering decision not to put more effort into those states she did not do the courtesy of one visit is another lesson to apply in campaigning and policymaking take the support of anyone for granted assume that your traditional base is safe when both the vote and the us presidential contest exposed societies fracturing along economic and cultural lines that match traditional was a broad narrative in the us mainstream which seemed to be supported by that a victory was just so with the referendum the bookmakers and most protagonists on both sides regarded it as that would choose to stay within the the treatment of both contests as foregone conclusions proved calamitous for and democrats by inducing complacency among supporters and their opponents treat every fight as tight and never presume that a result is in the takeaway from the us election is that it has become foolish to assume that is an unalloyed asset in electoral politics probably better off presuming the opposite in this age of rage against anything or anyone that can be depicted as or it has become a handicap to be an and a great advantage to be an this was one of tragedies she was one of the best qualified people ever to run for president as a woman bidding for a job that had always been held by she felt her credentials had to be superior to those of any male competitors she would never have secured the democratic nomination had her career been made in reality when her turn to have a shot at the white house finally came her longevity on the scene was not an but a liability one of the more obvious lessons is that you take a big risk running a widely distrusted candidate from a political dynasty in a when many of the voters are expressing anger with the status quo a similar conclusion can be drawn from the referendum the barrage of opinion deployed on behalf of the remain campaign proved far less effective at persuading swing voters than in strategists had is also no longer safe to assume that portraying your opponent as dangerous even if they are will be as effective as it used to be trump was repeatedly described as unfit to be not least by republicans made his excellent joke that a man who could not be trusted with his twitter account could not be trusted with the nuclear codes in the outers were often branded as reckless advocates of a blind leap into the unknown this was true and counterproductive as a strategy for countering them because calling them dangerous did not amount to an answer to the grievances driving substantial numbers of voters in the direction of the demagogues telling a voter that something is a risk only works if that voter thinks they have a meaningful stake in society as it is and many clearly branding the insurgents as rogues burnished their appeal for many aggrieved with the status big chunk of the electorate in western democracies for various so discontented that they are willing to blow up conventional politics if only to see what happens next a lot of trump voters told pollsters they think he was fit to be but put him there anyway five star pioneered by the has taken this to its logical conclusion with the slogan that translates as can say the new are and presume their mendacities and contradictions will be exposed once people have experience of how they wield power was doing that yesterday when he had a pop at the of rich white men like and the leader makes a good point but there was a better one he could have made why have a former commodity broker and a billionaire property developer proved more effective at voters discontented with their economic lot than did the party at our most recent general most disturbing and urgent question for liberal democrats is why their arguments had traction and why demagogic arguments are proving so resonant to so in the that included flipping substantial numbers of voters who had been for into the trump camp a bit of the explanation is that the new demagogues have been better campaigners all the sophisticated strategists employed by the in campaign never came up with a message to rival the clarity of back all the expensive consultants on team never found a match for great incendiary and divisive language has always been a tool of demagogues the new breed has taken this to another level and technology equips them with unprecedented ways of amplifying their messages trump was recently asked whether he regretted the misogyny and racism of his campaign he i twitter of trump and many noxious outpourings on the campaign trail were not said in spite of the fact that they would cause widespread revulsion they were calculated to elicit a hot response from both his zealots and opponents and by doing so generate massive amounts of media coverage a similar strategy was employed by elements of the leave campaign during the referendum friend and financier of and one of the party who were recently received at trump has published his account of their battle plan for the referendum campaign more outrageous we the more attention get the more attention we the more outrageous of outrage consciously creates a dilemma for mainstream politicians and media still operating within the conventional parameters of debate if offensive and mendacious statements are bigotry and lies will not be called out but if they are the propagators gain the oxygen they are critical reason that liberals have been losing is that they foolishly presumed that the big arguments were so well won that they need to fight for them because it was so obvious to them that liberalism and have delivered security and they think they needed to bother to continue making the case when politicians of the mainstream did talk about for too long they represented it as an irresistible force anyone on the receiving end of its negative impacts or unhappy with the distribution of its rewards was essentially told they no choice but to suck it overarching error was to assume that the arc of history was bent irreversibly in the direction of tolerance and liberty now they should know better a very old lesson must be

join me in a little thought experiment if you that the referendum had gone the other voting to leave and to remain what do you think would have would he have nodded ruefully and people have spoken and this issue is now settled our side lost and we have to get over it time to move may declines to rule out peerage for leader read would he have given the establishment the fright of their despite everything they threw at they could only win by the skin of their teeth clear now that support for the project is nearly half the people of this country want rid of it our fight goes know which bet on imagine what would have happened as a result of that narrow win for a gaping hole in the public finances had opened up as the economy and even leading admitted the machinery of state could barely cope and the rest would have denounced the boasting that this proved they had been right all that the voters had been misled and therefore must be given another we all reality did not work out this way next week the chancellor will deliver an autumn statement anchored in the admission as the financial times put faces a bill for within five thanks to the 23 the forecast is for growth and the government will reportedly have to hire an extra 30 , 000 civil servants to implement 6 , 000 more than the total staff employed by the union in other in order to escape a hulking bureaucracy going to have to build a hulking bureaucracy these bureaucrats will speak and have so be even the leavers deny the scale of the undertaking they have dumped in our collective lap the zealot who masterminded the vote leave this week tweeted a description of as job since beating there was no room for that pithy phrase on vote leave posters back in the spring the government will reportedly have to hire an extra 30 , 000 civil servants for 6 , 000 more than the yet you do not hear howling as the leavers would if the roles were reversed that this is an outrage so appalling it surely voids the referendum

of a each time they read of some new hypocrisy or deception by the forces of leave the single market is a perfect example as a admirable voices have been during the campaign the loudest were at pains to stress that leaving the did not mean leaving the single market nobody is talking about threatening our place in the single said a madman would actually leave the said in the constantly urged us to be like which in fact pays through the nose and accepts free movement of people in order to remain in the single market yet now we are told that the vote to leave the was a clear mandate to leave the single and got to get on with correct response to this should be along with a stubborn commitment to use every democratic tool at our disposal to stop it happening we know what the other side would if the boot were on the other foot but just look at the state of the official opposition is struggling valiantly to oppose the government on without appearing to defy the will of the people arguing for a bespoke one that would give access to the single as well as highlighting the risks of leaving the customs union above all making the case that saving the economy matters more than reducing immigration may clearly thinks the other way twitter the new social media prefer an even simpler the people voted to leave the not the single and should fight for place in the latter but at least message is coherent the trouble undermined from the very top this week the shadow john far from opposing urged to the enormous opportunities to reshape our country that has opened for not resistance surrender and there has been similar weakness on the question of triggering article 50 should withhold their vote until they know exactly what kind of the government intends the government has the right to implement the will but the people voted to head for the they were given no say over the destination once gone parliament can legitimately use its leverage to flush out some point none of this is any more than the right would do and this nods to a wider one that afflicts the broadly on both sides of the too we play sticking to the rules while the right takes the gloves prime example is unfolding right now the final tallies of the election show that won at least a million more votes than trump oh shrug most the electoral college is the system we have under those we lost true but just imagine if trump had won the popular vote by a only to be denied the presidency in the electoral college do we think he would have been a good sport and accepted we have to imagine we can look at the tweets he posted in when he briefly thought mitt had garnered more votes than election is a total sham and a travesty we are not a he said he called for people to take to the streets and stage a as he put electoral college made a laughing stock out of our nation the loser one twitter i would have voted for trump can laugh at the but the contrast is striking democrats grumble but abide by the republicans immediately dial up the rhetoric and denounce their opponents as eventually their ability to act that was the admitted strategy of congressional republicans in the first a determined effort to prevent him governing at play that game constantly strove to be even appointing republicans to key jobs was a republican yet renewed his term with fateful consequences a republican president would not have hesitated to install his own and one side bows to the rules and to fair while the other focuses on the ruthless exercise of power seeing it as trump stacks his team with a bunch of bigots i know which approach is the more and public spirited but the result is that in both and the right has power and next to nothing standing in its way no one wants the left to behave like the

about asking the not assuming the told the crowd assuming the answers is precisely what most news media did this at the great peril last in a widely read essay for the i called out the erroneous

dangerous how the liberal media elite failed read find their center in such a top news organizations could do less of the privileged that got them in trouble this year they could spend more time on

trump got to of votes resoundingly white at every income bracket among trump for every struggling white rural there was at least one comfortable white suburbanite appeal has always been a white not a poor white problem to show us reporters drove rental cars into the poor hollers of to ask poor whites why they were so angry they set up cameras at trump rallies to broadcast people in trucker hats screaming hateful things an image that is endlessly palatable to white whose guilt over both race and wealth is assuaged by a story in which they are the good ones what got out of it was a skewed understanding of this country and the election of a lifetime what got out on the other was a reported dollars in gross profits this year it takes two to make a message and media consumers bear

of my family are heartbroken today in red states right along with new and millions of people in blue states voted for trump the clunky state map is good for the electoral college at a but a more accurate geopolitical rendering is one in which each state is a violet hue representing voting proportions even each county is a reddish or bluish purple such maps reveal that cities and the coasts and the states have far more in common than we tell are a divided nation in electoral ideologies and there is no the between human is a more nuanced story a story that cannot be reduced to a red and blue or even a purple one sometimes it involves people doing horrible things to others an element of society magnified by news coverage for good reason more it involves people trying their best being helpful and brave and petty in the same day being complicated individuals in a world bent on categorizing as as consumer as suppliers of data and creators of outside your whirring thoughts and look another human being in the eye the story you find there will never fit on a bumper sticker for a political campaign it will never fit in a will never be told by a mostly affluent coastal which many rightly believe speak for or to them it will never be valued by one leader of which infamously said this year of the trump may not be good for but damn good for broken about media perhaps has less to do with a class system than with what created unchecked capitalism in which news is a fast product there some mass political conspiracy in the media there historic wealth inequality in and the journalism industry reflects it like any essay speculating on these themes garnered a humbling wave of endorsements the thousands of messages i received suggested that a diverse swath of society had reached a tipping point about class inequality the messages were from people who felt or people who broadened their citizens of other countries who noted similar scapegoating of disenfranchised groups in the and were also from journalists saying do such a varied group found something to align with in the same words confirmed what i have always media consumers crave national fixation with an aggrieved working class never lessened after reading my some media outlets even framed my message that the white working class was not base as supporters are i was bearing witness to progressivism in red but they saw me as some sort of trump whisperer that some interviewers insisted i speak for his voters ironically reinforced my message that entrenched narratives lead us away from the truth forget about political stripes protect the who voted for trump knew about the women stuff they knew about the minorities stuff they deterred that those caustic elements of their personality affect is

their political stripes how journalists should organize and fight in such an environment is a long and uncertain discussion what is clear is even if they get every story right from now to they fight a losing battle without the trust and support of the public to regain that a good place to start would be media literacy outreach efforts in public local organizations and other community spaces civics

worth noting that the coastal were never meant to unearth stories across the middle of this country those states ignored by presidential campaigns and therefore by the press corps that follow them someone else used to do must rebuild local is no coincidence that the rise of endless cable and coupled with the economic fall of local and rural occurred just before one of the most divisive political climates in history there was a time when we all watched the same three national news networks the same affiliate we all read the same handful of national newspapers the same city rags one danger in that centralized information model was that a single group white men set the rules and told the stories in this new now is the time to support independent journalism read digital in which media sources are decentralized but not necessarily presents a new sort of danger with half of us on fox half of us on or and nearly all of us on pipelines of tweets and posts by we not only receive different information we perceive different realities for much of the less and less of that from journalists stepped foot in our own let alone our towns or counties due to the economic withering of local news most of the journalists i trained with at the turn of the millennium have been laid off or fled to industries with more stable was lost in that but perhaps more was gained in the opportunity we now have to rebuild local journalism in a way that not only rectifies geographical imbalances but includes voices from previously unrepresented harnesses technology to engage and include previously passive and makes the stories of previously isolated people available not just to themselves but to the across the myself are working on doing just that in my see this land the new territory and fly over all of which were founded in recent years by for doing multimedia and even literary work about the heartland the places they cover contain stories and lessons relevant to the entire country few would have been better equipped to handle media for than a for the nationally infamous baptist clan has resided in the state capital they frequently fan across the state with protest signs reading hates one of the first lessons i learned as a budding reporter was how to both dutifully report the news and not be used as a puppet receives coverage in outlets when but by and large their sidewalk show ceased to be newsworthy when it became a strategy to play the news media for free airtime this situational code among journalists who could instead sell papers and increase ratings by placing horrific stunts front and center is one of the most human approaches to journalism ever had the honor of sharing it is the opposite of a cable reveling in are part of the the media consumers might consider turning off those news sources that have proved themselves both easily manipulated and compromised by their own ideologies trump knew the most powerful journalists would have a blind whether willful or to his supporters in their own economic class his media mastery is such that he might create a network under the trump a veritable state television station with a mission cynical media vision might have a blind spot itself a ruthless businessman perhaps understand why most people become reporters the vast majority of whom are the least elite bunch of rogues you ever saw wearing wrinkled dockers from sure as hell for the money or the both of which are in short supply in most newsrooms it is for the word image or that bears witness it is for eschewing the human habit of making assumptions in order to dwell in which rarely lead to infallible answers and always point toward universal human ideas will soon control all three branches of government so long as the bill of rights remains intact and they will never seize the fourth estate the passion that fuels a journalism or that fuels respect for and support of the is the same passion that will work to keep this country out of the shadows for the next four years just shy of a week after the election the day died the civil liberties union tweeted that it was stronger than it had ever in its after an influx of new mainstream media got this election wrong and even played a leading part in its unfolding but if you care about the sensible reaction to this fact is not to vilify all media as at least one trump voter suggested with a hang a sensible as a media is to demand better of it and to do better by it to acknowledge that your participation shapes it each click begets more if you something better to be aware of its sources and funders to pay at least as much for its most responsible outlets as you pay for coffee above to understand the necessity of its there is no true journalism

her prepared remarks and subsequent comments to strongly suggested an interest rate rise was on the cards in as most economists now said the economy had strengthened since the last meeting and inflation was moving she admitted the aftermath of the us election had caused and the fed would have to take this into following criticisms that the fed was making for political she defended the central talk in the immediate wake of victory that she might she stated clearly she wanted to serve her full term until 2018 shakes hands with joint economic committee chairman senator coats after her testimony to congress much discussion of the lack of wage growth and how to tackle and how to help people who are not from the growth in the some comments about how low interest rates mean companies are more likely to do share buybacks than invest says its not clear to her why investment spending has been but denies the low interest rate policy is part of the with profuse thanks for for turning the session ends questioning turns to and what steps fed has taken to address the says is one of most significant risks the country and the fed is working with others to make sure there is a system to deal with them have to make sure controls financial institutions have in place are sufficient we are proposing highest standards firms systemic should meet and it is a broad threat and fed cannot deal with it alone she says that in every country that has suffered it was because central banks had to compromise their independence defends the independence of central banks hot topic at the says congress establishes the goals for monetary but it is critical the central bank can make independent decisions to pursue those goals without interference while being accountable and need to be able to not think about the short and sometimes they need to do unpopular things ken says wants to serve full term despite criticism by they also disagree on 2016 is asked about the the legislation brought in to regulate financial institutions after the financial which trump has talked about says she would not want to turn back the and would not want all the improvements under frank eliminated more on the aftermath of the says that markets are anticipating fiscal policy will be and this could have inflationary consequences but she adds that there is still much uncertainty about future we will watch what decisions are made and factor them into our uncertainty about these matters will last for some considerable time we have said gradual increases in rates are near term risks do seem reasonably balanced the the committee reached in is appropriate one no i fully intend to serve out my term ends in a trump had been critical of and there had been some talk she might resign if he won the now for my own is looking at economic data thus the evidence since we met in is consistent with the expectation of strengthening inflation moving up will many economic policies which congress and the administration will consider in the months to come when there is greater the committee will have to factor their assessments and perhaps adjust the outlook depending what happens has begun her testimony as a reminder is available us congress as the introductions begin at congress ahead of analysts continue to suggest a rate rise in is pretty much nailed on at capital roll on aside from a slight rise in us treasury yields seen little major effect on financial markets after said interest rates could rise fact is a rate hike has already been priced in markets think there is a roughly chance the fed will increase the target federal funds rate it now looks almost impossible for the fed not to raise rates next month painted itself in a corner and has to respond with a hike or all hell will break loose in the markets only strengthens the case for the fed to act rising bond yields since win further add to the argument for the central bank to raise rates ahead of starting her

as the effect of earlier oil price weakness filters out in the transport component made the first positive contribution to the rate of inflation since 2014 as this energy drag we expect the headline rate to hit the target in the second quarter of next year if there is one criticism of the overall inflation it is that price gains are not especially that inflation is certainly not a hindrance to a nor indeed should it be a massive drag on the plans for 2017 we may get some further insight from chair testimony this afternoon a central part of the discussion both today and amongst fed officials over coming months will instead revolve around the neutral rate in her introductory remarks suggested that the fed funds rate is below the neutral rate and the of falling behind the curve seems this indicates that the pace of hikes could continue to be slow next although this will of course depend on some of fiscal plans but until the details of these plans become expect and other fed officials

supporters that outweighed a decline among supporters this given the concerns over policies on some investors believe needs shaking and like pledge to cut regulations his promise to cut taxes must be a factor too while trump fans move their money into riskier supporters are being much more conservative many fear the will pull into recession the buttonwood column has swiftly commented on ed proposal to reform central bank argues that some of the criticism heaped on central banks has been a lot of the current criticism of central banks assumes that they had some hidden political agenda support the election of or to warn voters off behind their policy shifts that is in my view in a low low inflation banks have had little option but to keep policy many of those that tried to tighten policy have been forced to retreat and central banks tend to reflect the consensus view of economists which was that would be bad news who think the consensus view has been proved wrong might note that the government has yet even to start the exit central banks may have made mistakes but they are honest buttonwood convinced by the most radical part of the paper the suggestion that central banks and politicians should on fiscal and monetary policy in times of crisis on its own this sounds entirely sensible but if you think central banks are in the political firing line what would happen if they started commenting on fiscal particularly close to an imagine if ms were to advise the republicans against tax cuts for the with an interest in monetary policy should read this excellent paper

a man who uses misogynistic language and has been accused of sexual assault is soon to become the 45th president of the united states of for feminists desperate to see the first female the result was how could someone with such disregard for rights become trump boasted about being able to freely grope women because he is and by the end of the race 12 different women had come forward to accuse him of sexual assault he also suggested during his campaign that women should face form of for having before backtracking and saying states and congress should take the lead with lawmaking on this matter after the publication of a video in which he describes women by the experts and many predicted that lost the female vote but this turned out to be incorrect it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their to exit of white women voted for trump those without a college degree supported trump over democrat candidate by nearly two to one white women with a college degree only narrowly voted in of by six percentage points by of black women and of voted for some feminists are finding it difficult to comprehend why women so offended by misogyny that they voted for en mass we interviewed women across to find out why they voted for trump and why they describe themselves as feminists what they a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or she thinks and makes her own worker who lives in the much state of voted for trump she describes herself as socially financially independent and educated female i either friends or except for one voted for trump i want to show it was not only men or educated citizens that voted trump i am an economic conservative who is registered as a affiliate i feel that trump has the best economic polices to create jobs and therefore rebuild the economy truly thought video of as been having two and a i can make an educated guess that all heterosexual men have bragged about their exploits with women to another man at some point believe in equality between the sexes i have the right and capability to make my own and live the life i choose for myself because i am a feminist i know and exercised my right not to be put in a box or voting group and to freely think and make my own judgment as to who i thought would be the best candidate for president it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their actions a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or she thinks and makes her own choices thought the sexual allegations were unsubstantiated and therefore equivalent to and campaign mudslinging if these women had truly been assaulted why wait until one month before the election to come forward to the press not the authorities thought it incredibly hypocritical to him as a sexual predator when we know for a fact that bill is and helped him cover it up through libel and slander of the women who did come forward this change my opinion about except for maybe a more sympathetic attitude and feeling that the media was treating him gender has no bearing whatsoever in their qualifications for a including the presidency was not clear as to what her policies as president would except to maybe continue with the same failed practices her policies would not have helped our depressed and stagnant economy i believe plans for job creation benefits including minority groups i also and have for a long to a more isolationist foreign not going to vote for somebody because of their gender or trump voter a mother of two boys who is currently not calls herself a feminist most but she is fiercely opposed to voting for someone based on gender alone instead she backed who shares her own beliefs including not raising taxes her home state of a mix of farmland and more white and less educated than the national mean voted for trump some things i would be a feminist but it mean i vote for someone because she has a vagina always voted republican and always support the party they pushed a female candidate through to break the glass ceiling of a perceived gender equality the end of the day video of did not affect my support for him what he says and what he does matter in those senses because looking for somebody that has the same beliefs as i do in running a country at the end of the day all sinners and we all say things like this it uncommon we act like the president of united states should be some holy person can go through all the us presidents and you will see sexual dysfunctions in all of their personal even husband had an affair at the end of the my sex life does not involve his work life and my sex life does not involve my life these women that came out about trump could have been hoping for media or maybe just simply paid by to make her criminal issues look not going to vote for somebody because of their gender or race there is nothing other than whether they can run the country or a which naturally lends itself to traditional twitter republican nominee was knocked out of the presidential heather brown backed trump brown believes that under trump the us economy will prosper and the average will be able to succeed in areas where they are currently home work and finance she says that trump the misogynist reported to really just felt like they pushed a female candidate through to break the glass ceiling of a perceived gender equality bias politics can be unscrupulous it demands you constantly remember that behind every door lives a pushed agenda you are

ultimately impacts the trajectory of a nation when i make such important decisions i do not make them so lightly as to base them on race or gender i voted on shared belief compatibility and frankly got a lot more airtime than who was polite and played by the rules was too quiet for a nation that chases tornadoes and is captivated by blazes failings him and make him a lot more riding on this presidency than political a which naturally lends itself to traditional femininity always been attracted to alpha males but after the popularity of 50 shades of hardly alone get me an fully capable

amount people can earn before losing universal credit were crucial he went if we really want to see the right thing happen to people out there who try and get into work and stay in the allowances are critical and i would recommend and hope that my colleagues in government will think very carefully again about the decision to reduce those allowances i the problem with the deficit and of course we want to reduce and not asking for more money asking for wiser spending of the money have a very good opportunity now to do something that is really and bold and right for those that we really want to improve the lives which the prime minister rightly said was her target group it is a very conservative thing to do to help people who are doing the right thing to improve their smith said if the government cannot reverse the proposed cuts for everyone affected it should single parents and the disabled he went i urge my my to do just it is the right thing to it will be the thing to do that

has said professor john whose exit poll in the 2015 general election was the first to indicate an overall conservative victory said the way people voted in the referendum was different to the way they vote in general elections as the press association he told a briefing by social there was a very substantial difference by education in willingness to vote leave or remain this was a referendum which was essentially between the social liberals and the social conservatives in our which is rather different division from the one the opinion polls are usually trying to which is between left and right

challenge of effectively establishing modern public the limited and education that it would be possible to and the lack of economic particularly job prospects the government has also considered the interaction of any potential community with the us naval support facility a vital part of our government will instead seek to support improvements to the livelihoods of in the communities where they now live i can today announce that we have agreed to fund a package of approximately over the next ten years to achieve this parliament is to seek expenses from independence campaigners who camped out on its grounds after spending more than on legal action as the press association the group were evicted from the site earlier this month after losing an appeal against their removal the parliament spent of public money on the legal including more than on the petition for the removal and more than fighting their unsuccessful appeal all from me for for the comments another is which was set up as a progressive remain campaign during the and which was backed by has put out a statement this afternoon the shadow chancellor john for being too willing to accept in his speech yesterday the national a member of steering we would not support using parliament to directly block but what is the point of our having the right to vote on article 50 if they do not use it to extract concessions against hard must champion the progressive elements of free the environment and human rights doing this is not about betraying the will of the people it is about opening up the negotiating process to public scrutiny and doing it effectively means retaining parliamentary leverage over article group also for saying in his speech that opposing or even delaying article 50 would place the majority will of the people and on the side of certain corporate who have always had the people at the back of the another is we are at a loss to know what kind of political strategy involves condemning your own people as corporate against will of the at a time of rising nationalism and right wing populism this choice of language is irresponsible and wrong the overwhelming majority of members backed remain they were

is not just a binary the focused his questions almost entirely on and argued that the government was a total of has expressed in prof the chair of the child abuse inquiry she was speaking at after the mp asked about the and report saying another lawyer working there has has refused to say whether the government has discussed giving a peerage to the outgoing leader the asked if there have been any official conversations on this topic and may all i can say to is that such matters are normally never discussed in a spokeswoman for may would not comment on whether might get one but you will have heard the prime minister talk in about her views on the system and making sure that it people who really contribute to society and their was a slightly odd answer because peerages are no longer supposed to be given out as they are given to people who will contribute to the and the argument for giving a peerage is based on the fact that have only three peers in the lords not people appointed as despite coming third in terms of vote at the general the lib have 104 peers may has refused to condemn proposal to ban from entering when the mp tommy asked about may said that the would the

commentators are saying about on but more than martin win martin win for bad for may latest for reaction the daily verdict on heated failed to dent the lines could be quite effective if deployed by a more nimble debater but may can just attack him for incompetence every the morris of better outings in recent questions on government 's the so far on sharp form by sticking to the one topic and reminds he said it would be a success the peter walker may needs a new writer for her jibes at sounding a bit flat these all relative of but no doubt that is getting better at the financial of better

there is no agreed reasonably effectively may will not be losing any sleep about this but poll findings on how the government is handling ought to generate at least a little concern in downing street the main thrust of response was that i the splits in her government are nothing compared to the divisions on in the shadow cabinet in the chamber this attack line did not really but may is right to say there are tensions in on this subject in his economy speech yesterday john the shadow indicated that the party would oppose any move to demand a second referendum on the even though some are in

missed the question from the leader at because i was writing up a snap verdict so here is a quick summary he started by asking about the institute for government analysis saying the plans are and may the most important thing for this government to do is calmly and carefully get on with the job of preparing for complex negotiations and one of the most important things we can do is not give a running then asked about statement about how the would probably leave the customs union may said that the issue of whether to leave the customs union or remain in it was not a and she said that only

since becoming the us trump has left some people worrying about their rights he has vowed to roll back on abortion freedoms and deport millions of illegal immigrants with criminal records he has also appointed who has been a as white house chief of the liberties being challenged were fought for and won in the the liberation for battled for abortion to be made legal happened in the in 1967 and the us in in the civil rights led by martin campaigned for racial equality and against how do those who stood up for these freedoms feel about we spoke to activists in the us and the about the and whether they believe what they battled for is now at risk we also asked their advice on dealing with political uncertainty and standing up for what you believe interview includes an assistant to martin who fought for the civil rights movement at he was sentenced to 34 years in prison for alongside nine other black men the conviction was later from am opposed to cynicism too much of that about the election i believe that there are more people in the us than there are those of the i worked with martin king and the southern leadership and later i worked with the national association for the advancement of colored people in the we struggled for voting civil rights and housing rights and we were but our success also brought a reaction how republican candidate got elected in he ran on a law and order campaign so fast forward to today and president election in 2008 in a a of martin king but after eight years it has brought a reaction every time you make progressive steps forward there is a reaction so i am not disillusioned by recent events i understand the counterbalance of not just in the us but also in the trump has both now an opportunity and a responsibility to lead rather than backwards i believe that there are more people in the us than there are those of the same in and but the problem is that people of have to exercise their participation in civic engagement we had a low voter turnout in us this year and when that happens it opens the door for a reaction rather than a more progressive move forward as i i am concerned but not disillusioned because i believe the forces of history will always move towards equality and freedom as we say in the is a constant struggle if you want freedom you have to always stand up for it and push for you cannot just relax twitter civil rights leader martin king with his and colleagues during a civil rights march were a period of social transformation but to make changes you also need to transform the consciousness of people and what we have to work at now i hate cynicism and too much of that about the election result we have to deal with what happened from a much more optimistic perspective in the when we shall we were not overcoming but we sang it because that was our hope and desire we must continue to do to show we are overcoming and setbacks there will always be setbacks and struggle the question is whether we are willing to overcome from next four years are a time to hunker down and grew up in about a mile from i went to mainly populated by white students there was a lot of racism at the time in and the south as a but where i lived was more diverse and although it was felt that black people should stay in their own views changed based on two the 1968 candidacy was a national spokesman for resistance to racial and the assassination of martin king that same year the strength of support and the riots in and other cities brought the grievances of black people to the at least for me my cause was the war movement twitter segregationist politician addresses a 1976 rally in in he attracted of the vote and won five southern states my over the all the movements rights and civil gradually effected changes in policies but effect a change in the mindset of many of the who had supported those policies in 1968 of voted for and i assume that all of them to some racist i would not be at all surprised to find that of are still racist that they all voted for while women have gained there is still a large group of men who are more comfortable with men in charge and issues such as access to abortions still create major sexist voting blocs for i believe that most actual rights that i fought for in the are believe that most actual rights that i fought for in the are but regulations will be sent back to the states who will use them to curtail abortions and push down black turnout immigrants who are here illegally will be deported by the millions until employers make a stink a ban on immigrants pass even a trump supreme court police presence in cities will climb and police shootings will continue but not like police officers are currently being convicted for killing unarmed suspects the next four years are a time to hunker down and protests will only serve to the and give trump someone to blame for his policy failures from east in the and there was less inequality and people were was 16 in 1970 as a young i was involved in the youth wing of the party i was mainly involved in the trade union i helped to get the policy of gay rights equality on to the trade union policy book in 1977 i also campaigned to improve rights and fight for equal pay there was a huge amount of optimism back then we felt like we were moving the agenda forward and changing the but of course all that was trashed when thatcher came to power she dismantled rights since successive governments have taken it apart further if my younger self could see the world he would was all that effort worth of my life has been spent under regimes that are officially or nominally but when we started getting political we hoped this be the we wanted progress there has been progress in some not all doom and less war and tackled major diseases the way we treat one another in public life and the relationship between state and citizen has got markedly worse union rights have gone backwards and been huge growth in inequality back in the and there was less inequality and people were happier as a result there was a feeling we were all going in the same direction and part of a big enterprise if my younger self could see the world he would was all that effort worth i would like to see the young fight now like we they after the ones affected by all the decisions made today people need to get out there and not just about from we fought for seems to be being the late i was passionately interested in ideas and even though i was very young i went on the big war demos and i was a somewhat naive member of the young communist league in the i was into feminism and rock against racism always been firmly on the that changed at all utterly terrified and appalled by the lurch to the right the latent racism and xenophobia emerged and been whipped into a frenzy by the media is highly dangerous and any hopes and beliefs i had that we were making slow and painful progress towards a better working model of human community and progress are in tatters i fully understand why happening and i feel powerless to change it working on fear is stultifying and must be overcome if the left start fighting back it could get unspeakably 67 from wish you younger people had made your voices heard there was the big war demo in 1968 i went to the rally in square but i join the march on the us embassy later i heard that it ended in serious violence and people being and i was glad i gone because i was and still a pacifist twitter war demonstrators run past downing 27 1968 from biggest issues we were fighting for were an movement and civil rights black had been fighting for their civil rights ever since the days of and the civil war and still those rights were being denied them in immigration from the and later from and and had been met with fear and prejudice among the indigenous white working class whose homes and jobs they were seen as taking now needed to ensure the civil rights of black people this did become something of a generational as the older generation who had struggled through the depression and then had to fight for their country in the second world war had a sense of entitlement to the jobs and security they had fought for and resented having to share or sometimes even lose them to foreign think the rights my generation fought for are being at least not so far they have actually become orthodoxies i think and trumpery are the manifestations of a rebellion by the new alienated and dispossessed i wish you younger people had made your voices heard more after you are the ones who have inherited the mess my generation have evidently so who are we to start advising from believe humanity will i was in high school in a comfortable i was a member of the young socialist the youth group to the socialist workers party mostly my work focused on rights and ending the war i did at night leaflets to telephone the precursor to one of my first paid jobs was at the abortion action alliance i remember the power of mass movements the thunder of protest voices marching down new city the feel of the nubby grass underfoot as you ran from one part of the demonstration in to another i remember folk music being baked into our lives a lot blue jeans were so was hair sue and her we are in an urgent situation with the i am very worried about saving our environment that needs to come first especially because i have a i worry about rights to control our own bodies because of the views towards people who are not i also worry about fascism and history repeating itself i worry about the economy the overwhelming majority of us no longer know the how to use the soil to create how to care for others when they are sick and i worry that the old need to survive will lead us into war but i have a powerful belief that when you have lost everything that is when the beginning comes and we will have a new we will learn from one another humanity will elections rights on on via on on on

new role as pathfinder according to the official among the first humans in the alongside three other arks which probably contain other species from the milky way there of be scary undiscovered planets

first time in mass effect both male and female leads and exist as separate also know that the family will be in the he voices the trailer the guy in the black told that he was a but that new draw your own conclusions there also heard through the leak of someone called and a called it could be that the mysterious we saw in an earlier trailer the game informer article mentions a enthusiastic human

effect so far has been the ability to make all that handy scenery explode into fragments earlier this us retailer best buy accidentally posted an early offer mentioning destructible cover not much else is known about how this works but it will be interesting to see how different alien environments react to combat situations and what effect this all has on tactics a recent cover feature in game

countries to sign up to the regional comprehensive economic its own version of trump proved to be a real isolationist and walked away from open trading and imposed trade he might imagine this that would protect workers and bring jobs home but empirically we know this just tends to lead to higher inflation and and job losses we do have cause to worry that without to defend and promote a liberal global trade and investment economic damage and impoverishment would spread through the global does believe that would benefit from targeted infrastructure spending but less impressed by tax as mainly benefit the better irony of trump 's of his tax cuts go to the top only to bottom my chart the other big worry is that trump could drives up the us national debt to alarming the other major concern about is about a mishandled fiscal expansion and unfunded tax cuts that would entail a substantially wider fiscal deficit and more rapid expansion of public debt the bipartisan and independent committee for a responsible federal budget has calculated that what little we know of including repeal of could put about trillion on to the outstanding level of public now standing at by federal debt would rise from 80 to over 105 per cent of increasing the us ratio of debt to from about 77 per cent to at least 105 per cent once debt levels exceed 90 100 per cent of economic growth becomes seriously major risk then is that after an initial economic the us becomes mired again in rising public deficits remember debt will be rising anyway in the because of and social security spending since the external deficit would probably deteriorate as the likelihood is that economic higher inflation and interest a falling and then an economic downturn might ensue and if trump is keen to push

stimulus might not actually regenerate economy at all construction but not sparking a manufacturing in this a shock boost to aggregate demand through tax cuts would likely boost inflation and imports more than domestic since the economy is constrained higher inflation and bigger deficits should lead to higher interest rates particularly if the federal reserve perceives inflation risks as having risen and so raises interest economy is more like a healthy tortoise than a sickly hare immigration reform designed to skilled immigrants or policies that boosted productivity growth might give the

sometimes i think i have never seen anything as strong as that mean that i like and admire everything about her not here to argue about who she just to note what she did i watched her plow through opposition and attacks the like of which no other candidate has ever faced and still win the popular vote to defeat her it took an unholy cabal far beyond what faced when he was the campaign of swimming with the tide of disgust about the bush administration as the new times the time all the ballots are she seems likely to be ahead by more than votes and more than 1 5 percentage points she will have won by a wider percentage margin than not only gore in 2000 but also in 1968 and john f in twitter concession know can flip that and see that trump was such a weak candidate it took decades of scheming and an extraordinary international roster of powerful players to lay the groundwork that made his election possible defeating in the electoral college took the 2013 gutting of the voting rights act by republican appointees to the supreme court it took vast republican voter suppression laws and tactics set in place over many years it took voter intimidation at many polling places it took the long republican campaign to blow up the boring bureaucratic irregularity of use of a private email server into a scandal that the media obediently picked up and reheated us yet to join ranks of countries with female leaders read took the director of the using that and his power to stage a misleading smear attack on 11 days before the election in flagrant violation of the custom of avoiding such intervention for 60 days before an election it took a compliant mainstream media running after his sabotage like a golden retriever chasing a tennis ball it took decades of conservative attacks on the served as deputy counsel to the senate whitewater that fishing expedition that began with an investigation in a messy real estate deal in before bill presidency and ended with a campaign to impeach him on charges related to completely unrelated sexual activities during his second took a nearly reality the that deified racism and narcissism as essential to success and power as the feminist media critic points trump said and did was framed in a way to flatter and more flatter his the colossal infomercial fictionalized the cheating businessman as an unqualified success and gave him a kind of brand recognition no other candidate had it took the full support of fox whose roger was so committed to him that after leaving the company following allegations of decades of sexual harassment of he joined the trump campaign it took the withdrawal of too many from even that of journalism into the partisan unreliability of sites and bubbles of social took the mainstream of failure to address climate change as the most important issue of our time it took decades of most media outlets letting the propaganda arm create the false framework of two equally valid opinions rather than reporting the overwhelming scientific consensus and tremendous danger of climate change to stop it also took using as a tool of evidently considering his grudge against the democratic nominee important enough to try to aid the campaign of a racist authoritarian now appears to have so close a relationship with that he often appears on the channel and news site rt he tweeted protests when president information was included in the panama papers hack and has been coy about where his leaked information on the democratic national committee came intelligence experts say it came from

have become increasingly based on the evidence they have that direct goal is not to support the election of as many democrats have but rather to disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine standing in the world more beef over loss is with liberal young and old read it took a shortsighted campaign of hatred on the an almost hysterical rage like nothing i have ever seen before about any public figure some uncritically picked up outright and spin to feed their hate and rejected anything that diluted the purity and focus of that including larger questions about the other candidate and the fate of the earth it was so extreme that in recent i was attacked for posting news stories on social media by furious people who took the position that to be overtly was to be covertly if the perfect is the enemy of the whose friend is the greater of two a lot of people seemed to think the primary ended the night trump was elected i saw that from climate and others who you might expect would have turned to face the clear and present danger of a trump presidency i for much about failure to address the pipeline adequately which was and but overshadowed by what we heard so little million dollars or so invested in the pipeline and the guarantee he would use presidential powers to push it and every pipeline like it through impossible to disconnect the irrational emotionality from and the misogyny continues since election been hearing too many men of the left go on and on about how was a weak candidate wondered about that word not only because it is so often associated with but because what calling her weakness was their refusal to support her as if sent a pink lifeboat and we sent it because we wanted a blue and now we are very upset that people are as my brilliant friend put it some point soon we need to discuss whether sanders would have been able to but helpful it just sounds like democrats should have cut into lead in the misogynist vote and the vote by running a white come to terms with the racism and the misogyny before analyzing the because otherwise just going to replicate it forever and if you think that the angry vote won sanders would have fared let me remind you that patriarchy and white supremacy are the cornerstones of the i know that if had been elected there would not be terrified and weeping people of color all over the small children too afraid to go to a shocking spike in hate students with smashed dreams marching in cities across the country i deplore some of past actions and alignments and disagreed with plenty of her 2016 positions i hoped to be fighting her for the next four years but i recognize the profound differences between her and trump on immigration and and her extraordinary tenacity and courage in facing

the world is shocked that elected trump as its 45th president exit polls show that the country is sharply divided on trump along the same lines as its sharp divisions on climate ideology was the single strongest determining factor in the election of republicans voted for while of democrats voted for ideology is also the primary factor associated with acceptance or denial of global as climate scientist explained eloquently in this twitter global weirding with episode was the determining factor in the presidential election trump won white voters by 21 percentage won minorities by 53 points minorities are also far more likely to accept and be concerned about climate change than white as bee white bear responsibility for electing twitter full frontal with divide was the determining factor in the presidential election won urban voters by 24 trump won rural voters by 28 points in many cities are leading the way in taking action to curb global voters younger than 45 went for by a while older voters preferred trump by 11 points voters under the age of 30 voted for by an margin young are far more likely to be concerned about climate change than older there is a gender though smaller than many expected despite accusations from 15 women that trump or assaulted and a recording of trump bragging about sexually assaulting he only lost the female vote by 12 points the same margin by which he won the male and approximately the same margin by which beat and among women white women even favored trump by 10 and white women without a college degree by an astonishing 28 points misogyny dissuade women from voting for him they normally favor democratic presidential candidates by a margin of about 20 points more than men also the margin by which women are more concerned about climate change than did elect and then important to remember that as with gore in more voted for than her victorious opponent gore received about a half million more votes than w bush will likely receive over a million more votes than trump bush and trump were elected because of the antiquated electoral college the popular vote was closer in 2016 than in 2012 or 2008 republican voters were willing to forgive many disqualifying flaws they care about his constant lies per cent of evangelicals voted for trump despite his long history of immoral behavior but many voters willing to overlook the scandal of emails and much of support was concentrated in areas like my home state of where she won by over 28 while enough rural white trump voters were distributed across swing states to give him narrow victories and electoral college votes trump won four states with a total of 75 electoral college votes and by margins of 1 3 points or the same reason why republicans control a large majority in the house of representatives despite receiving more than a million fewer total votes than their democratic republican voters are more widely geographically distributed than urban democratic voters has become a that minority being rural white explaining the election result is simple republicans voted for trump and democrats voted for received more but trump won most of the states in which the vote was close trump won in areas with less whiter populations with fewer immigrants in these insulated people fear their way of life is and largely right the us a coal manufacturing country anymore trump promised to change but he and his policies will hurt his voters is changing and not the fault of democrats or but trump made them scapegoats and made empty promises to turn back the clock democrats need to find a way to connect with and help these groups who feel the government on their does this mean for the john wrote last now that the republican party controls the us they own climate change for was the country most to blame for obstructing international efforts to curb climate change our senate refused to ratify the protocol president w bush refused to take any action to cut us carbon pollution senate republicans blocked the cap and trade legislation passed by the house of representatives in 2009 over the past four the us has taken action and shown leadership in tackling climate change as a humans had a slim chance of keeping global warming below the dangerous limit trump and congressional republicans have vowed to reverse that progress the energy page of official presidential transition website focuses on extracting and burning lots and lots of fossil fuels and scrapping climate trump has already appointed a climate denier who wants to dismantle the clean power plan to lead the transition if the republican party continues on this the costs and suffering from intensified heat and sea levels engulfing coastal etc it will be on the do we do the we must continue trying to break through republican science denial many republican policymakers are rumored to accept global warming in we have to change the political climate so that this a disqualifying position for a party leader to take in public there is no reason that republicans have to deny climate science and in the only major political party in the world that and most of their voters support climate action we can donate to and volunteer to help bipartisan climate groups like climate which is working with policymakers from both parties to build the political will to solve the climate problem these groups are now more important than probably be able to limit global warming to but is less damaging than and less than 3 5 or as the renowned climate scientist once climate change will be a combination of and suffering never too late to take action to limit the amount of suffering our children and grandchildren will face due to climate cities and states will have to keep leading the way in cutting carbon pollution will have to keep fighting to rid the of the intellectual rot that currently plagues the party and while fight to right the the rest of the world will have to pick up the slack and fight even harder against climate change as said in her gracious concession loss hurts but please never stop believing that fighting for right is worth get to work on make smart change

trump has done pretty well for someone ridiculed by most of the liberal media as an incoherent babbler his campaigning speeches were just people chuckled but the speeches worked and they did so because trump is a brilliant and careful rhetorician his slogan of renewed domestic glory great won over what was which met exactly the same fate as the remain insipid the language of political discourse greatness and strength are both examples of a a guiding metaphor or image for a political argument it is striking how often trump deployed the frames of happiness and going to be so going to

bound to but others say it have to must we always fight framing with or is it time to try something recent it has become fashionable in political psychology to say broadly liberals and conservatives respond positively to different sorts of frame this is one of the ideas promoted by the cognitive linguist whose popular book on think of an became a battle manual for despondent democrats after w second election victory in an earlier moral suggested that a major difference between conservatives and liberals lies in their mental models of the family republicans love a while democrats prefer a this pointed out trump is not some bizarre perversion of republican party on the he played the campaign as the ultimate threatening to ban and from entering the and ready to insult anyone who disagreed with him a pragmatic par as well as a master of political model of liberal v conservative frames has been developed by the psychologist his scheme lists six axes along which people make political value and research suggests that liberals respond more strongly than other people to arguments within the and and less strongly to the others respond more or less equally to all six this is offered as one explanation as to why the frames of strength and group for are traditionally while the left invoke empathy and people that this difference makes a campaigning job fundamentally easier than a as lecturer in political psychology at the university of explains shows that people endorse ideologies because they offer feelings of certainty and she says has been argued that hold a sort of psychological because they provide simpler and possibly less ambiguous ideas on how society should work such ideas would be especially appealing to those who have been feeling powerless or out of and the recent economic crisis or increasing terrorist threats might have made people especially prone to feel this in the issue of abortion rights in the one side uses the frame of life the other the frame of choice and trump campaigns did employ what are often thought of as frames but not only those a professor of political communication at tech and the author of several books on frame observes that both campaigns employed great deal of safety as well as loyalty of the not the not the trump also exploited the frames that supposedly appeal most to liberals think part of that he is also speaking out using the and in other those theoretically owned by his opponents trump claimed empathy for downtrodden while the aggressive moniker however unfair in evidently idea that the right are better at framing than the left has been common since the early but there are differing ideas about why it should be so some people think frames are more attractive to many people because they are simple and easy to understand like think the problem is that democrats have not taken framing seriously enough to do it right others add that institutions are key a philosopher at the university of east and a green party runs the green house and the words whose aim is to explore ways of communicating ecological issues more powerfully to the public more resourcing is he for the left to match the

perfectly neutral language that is completely free of but clashes of highly potent frames can easily just lead to entrenched positions in a kind of frozen rhetorical as with the versus standoff in the us twitter mark former of the has said that framing and spin have rendered the political environment toxic what if the overarching frame that governs our political disagreements is itself too much of politics right is conducted within a in other person or side is needs to be punished i believe this is an easier for liberals to engage in given that their moral foundations are so strongly linked with and although conservatives are not immune to this by any means but how easy is it to someone when you view them as unfair and harmful to the equitable view of humanity to which you this is already happening with trump and trump supporters things would be more if we switched to a comic which the conservative philosopher defined as one in which people are mistaken all people are exposed to situations in which they must act as there is a deeper problem with over the notion that the right are so much better at framing than they are it is that it implies an uncomfortable theory of false consciousness among the benighted ordinary folk who vote for causes and politicians they must be blinded by the they could not possibly be deciding on the basis of the actual people and policies could maybe they are it could very well be that the success of the way the and trump campaigns were framed was just a symptom of something rather than the proximate cause of victory the appeal of certain

words matter the process of understanding why trump is now heading for the white house starts with the correct description of what has happened in the eight years since became economists call the turbulent period that followed the collapse of brothers the great recession others say the us along with other developed nations is experiencing secular stagnation it to avoid using the d dictionary definition of a depression is a downturn in economic which sums up precisely what has occurred since 2008 growth rates globally have remained low despite colossal amounts of stimulus living standards have barely risen and the threat of deflation has loomed large the depression since 2008 has not been as severe as that of the but there are echoes of it all the in the food banks that are the new soup in the mass movements of migrants in search of a better life who are the modern equivalent of the in the grapes of and in who has tapped into anger that has been bubbling away quietly for turning point for the average worker came in the because for the first 30 years after the second world war the gains from rising prosperity were evenly shared but this trend was broken around the time of and the end of the war since productivity in the us has more than but average hourly compensation has increased by only the fruits of growth have been captured by the not the tendency was especially pronounced in the years immediately after when lower interest rates and quantitative easing fed through into rising asset prices rather than into higher wages between more than of us growth went to the richest which included the financiers who had caused the crisis in the first is not just that workers have been struggling to get a decent pay rise jobs have become harder to find in the last with many dropping out of the market altogether the participation rate among males to fell at the time of the crash and has never in the the outlook for working people in the us has improved over the past couple of years because the collapse of energy prices has led to lower inflation and higher real incomes but it has not been enough to counter the feeling that the system is director of the resolution provided a useful breakdown of voting patterns in last presidential election taken at face the results seem to show that did well among those voters on the lowest incomes she led among those earning less than a year and by among those earning between and these statistics are misleading there was actually a net swing to the republicans between the 2012 and 2016 elections among those earning less than a year and a swing among those earning to by there was a swing to the democrats among those on higher and this was particularly pronounced among those earning more than a reasons for trump were also the reasons for john read interpretation of these numbers would be that on average or below average incomes voted for in 2008 and 2012 because they expected fundamental change from which they would benefit they were still waiting for the change to come in 2016 and thought trump was more likely to provide it than the better who have being doing just fine out of business as supported as the candidate of the status quo for wall street and silicon valley she was the safer choice as in other western the party ostensibly of the left had nothing to say that its traditional base wanted to have been three stages to this process of political estrangement when the postwar era parties of the left focused exclusively on economic issues the emphasis was on curing the ills of the poverty and slum housing governments were committed to full employment and redistribution and were prepared to use controls on goods and people to deliver those goals there was little appetite for fighting cultural wars neither harry in the us nor clement in could be described as a social second phase came in the when the parties of the left backed both economic and social reform in the it was the era of civil rights legislation and great society to tackle poverty in the government had its national plan for the economy but also gave a fair wind to changes never the abolition of capital the of legal easier divorce and the relaxation of censorship third and final phase of this process began in the parties of the left gradually accepted defeat in the economic war and devoted their energies to winning the cultural war instead it was taken as a given that the focus of policy should be control of inflation rather than full employment it was accepted that there should be as few impediments to free markets as with government intervention limited to tackling any problems that might arise curbs on trade unions introduced by parties of the right were not rolled back was seen as an unstoppable force that ruled out the interventionist policies of the past the democrats in the us and in the limited themselves to topping up poverty wages and argued that the answer to jobs being shipped overseas was for the newly unemployed to get better a parties of the left had nothing to say when the financial crisis of 2008 exposed the weaknesses of growth and economics they could point to some notable victories in the culture wars reforms that have made the us and the much more tolerant countries than they were three or four decades ago but under depression conditions that has not been enough the failure to articulate an alternative economic strategy has led to the erosion of political support in their old where disenchanted voters feel ignored and that means is that the political divide is now not

inflammatory campaign he will attempt to pursue from the white this speech may be something of a guide examines the likelihood of each of the 18 presidential acts and 10 bills trump outlined in becoming checks and balances of the us system will partially constrain as with any us president but the supreme court is likely to soon have a conservative justice once trump takes and congress is controlled by his fellow republicans state governments may resist some of the next initiatives by taking his administration to stances seem to shift after win read trump will also have great leeway to act on his in line with precedents set by w bush and to expand the powers of the executive text is drawn from campaign site on the first day of my term of my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in propose a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of can propose an amendment and congress can reject it the republican leader of the first took office in 1985 and has already said he opposes term limits a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition public and public will have the power to halt hiring at federal but he has also said he would expand the size of agencies he has exempted as the border immigration and customs enforcement and there are about 2 85 million federal according to the bureau of labor statistics a requirement that for every new federal two existing regulations must be requires congress to repeal and will almost certainly have its support to strip away environmental protections and financial regulations his is ambitious in its scope but republicans have fought to deregulate banking and the oil and gas industry for decades a 5 on white house and congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government a lifetime ban on white house officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for would need help to truly cement such though he could create rules for his white house staffers congress would not likely support a ban for its more than 400 former members of the 112th and 111th congresses have become according to the center for responsive including some of the most powerful former for this at the would primarily affect democrats ousted from congress and the administration since 2011 his transition on the other is already being filled with former lobbyists and courted by current ones bans on foreign interference could create legal knots for the trump white however he has a host of foreign business with as many possible conflicts of and a great deal still unknown about his dealings abroad on the same i will begin taking the following seven actions to protect i will announce my intention to renegotiate or withdraw from the deal under article renegotiation of a major trade deal could prove it took years of work across bush and bill white houses to finalize the deal restructuring or withdrawing would also present a logistical since car and airplane for are already multinational industries twitter why elected trump could quickly hollow out the trade deal by enforcing some provisions harshly and not as he has though this could cause higher consumer prices a trade war with countries such as i will announce our withdrawal from the i will direct my secretary of the treasury to label china a currency leaders and chuck a republican and democrat said on that trans pacific partnership was in effect killed by the election the deal was designed in large part to curb economic influence in the and its nullification will not improve us ties to who will probably turn to their closer neighbor nor will direction to his treasury which is in his improve relations with china i will direct the secretary of commerce and us trade representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact workers and direct them to use every tool under and international law to end those abuses will have the power to direct enforcement priorities for his cabinet who can sue companies or countries they believe culpable of abuses i will lift the restrictions on the production of worth of energy including natural gas and clean lift the roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure like the keystone to move cancel billions in payments to climate change programs and use the money to fix water and environmental will be able to reverse any and all of executive actions on climate including his block on the keystone which he ruled against after a state department review found it would not significantly create lower the price of gas or break us dependency on oil imports as trump will become the only leader of a large industrialized nation to doubt climate a crisis which even leaders such as the and have pledged to act on trump could simply ignore the us commitment to the climate though withdrawal would take four years he has appointed a climate whose organization is in part funded by coal to head his transition and could also try to gut environmental though he would face a fight in the within agencies and from states such as ambitions to resurrect the coal industry face a larger problem than environmental safety decades of economic driven by the boom of natural gas his promise to water and environmental infrastructure also runs directly afoul of his promises to reinvest in the coal and natural gas the latter linked to earthquakes and the former to air and water pollution on the first i will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of cancel every unconstitutional executive memorandum and order issued by president will have great leeway to rescind executive though he would almost immediately run into practical problems in undoing them he can revoke 2012 order to protect about 1 3 million young for leaving them vulnerable if still not the priority deportation any orders relating to signature as with environmental would be sent into the gears of and could disrupt an already nervous industry he could also rescind ban on but would almost certainly face the courts for this decision a supreme court accept the begin the process of selecting a replacement for justice from one of the 20 judges on my who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united released two lists of totaling 21 though senator mike lee refused consideration it is the prerogative to nominate supreme court though this year the senate has shifted the balance of power between the branches by its unprecedented block on even hearing garland cancel all federal funding to sanctuary would have the ability to revoke federal funding to cities such as new and whose local governments try to shield migrants without criminal histories so the mayors of new and have pledged to defy trump the president has only weak legal power to meddle in city but he could threaten them with withdrawing funding begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that take them has promised to deport migrants with criminal records and without and to expand the definition of as he will have discretion to guide law enforcement priorities as widely as he sees fit twitter top and second pledge refers to a punitive action that the state department can take against countries that refuse to accept deported people in the supreme court ruled that the us cannot detain migrants longer than six months if their home country refuses even in cases with criminal records spent much of campaign falsely blaming for and of when the president was actually following the law and had deported a record number of only recourse in the cases of these countries is a denial of which would almost certainly strain diplomatic relations suspend immigration from regions where vetting cannot safely occur all vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme 2015 pledge to all from entering the us eventually became a promise to suspend migration from unspecified countries most of the power to regulate immigration lies with and constitutional experts are divided about whether such a ban could be ruled legal as the scholar wrote in supreme court has never decided specifically whether a religious preference could be a valid basis for also rests on uncertain constitutional especially in the context of a proposed religious test the us already has extraordinarily strict screening procedures for migrants and but presidents have wide discretion for enforcement powers the fight over such a ban would land in all three branches of government i will work with congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my class tax relief and simplification act an economic plan designed to grow the economy per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and in combination with trade regulatory and lifting the restrictions on energy the largest tax reductions are for the middle class a family with two children will get a tax cut the current number of brackets will be reduced from seven to and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified the business rate will be lowered from 35 to and the trillions of dollars of corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a the conservative tax foundation nor the nonpartisan tax policy center have predicted major tax benefits

discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the us energy infrastructure act leverages and private investments through tax to spur in infrastructure investment over 10 years it is revenue choice and education opportunity act redirects education dollars to give parents the right to send their kid to the religious or home school of their choice ends common brings education supervision to local communities it expands vocational and technical and make two and college more affordable could use federal funding as a carrot and a stick benefits for compliant withdrawal for reluctant ones to try to persuade states to abandon common core educational but he will not have power except to advise and make recommendations to them he has also not said how he would fund his school voucher program repeal and replace act fully repeals and replaces it with health savings the ability to purchase health insurance across state and lets states manage funds reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the there are over 4 , 000 drugs awaiting and we especially want to speed the approval of childcare and act allows to deduct childcare and elder care from their employers to provide childcare and creates dependent care savings accounts for both young and elderly with matching contributions for has been similarly vague about how he would replace the affordable care which the congress will almost certainly try to if not repeal millions of people stand poised to lose and not clear how the removal of government in an industry six years into adjusting to would affect private providers or things you can do now to prepare for the worst under trump read more end illegal immigration act the

as of the nation reels in the wake of the election of people around the world are struggling to figure out next as protesters take to the climate scientists issue dire and immigrants face down fears of some people are wondering whether the states will truly ever be united many in the us and around the world fear the taking to bed and streaming while drinking wine a particularly effective way forward for the country for guidance on how to move past and we asked those best equipped at knowing how to laugh in the face of pain and comedians having a twitter while i am not sold on the term i am still going to use it i am going to my sense of social responsibility and remember that everyone has their own unique and to have compassion before vitriol i am not but if i may their term for merely this i may decide this is the time for my global time to finally see or live in a have to move forward no matter what because that is the nature of political cycles i think in our best interest to process all our emotions as they come and then remember that positive change just happen every four it happens all the time and this a just a roadblock and evolution are as vital a part of democracy as compromise and precedent for i will be replaying clips from the simply to exist in a bubbling hot tub of denial once i move past probably download seven more guided meditation and commit to more flax in my diet inevitably going to be bumpy so might as well keep both ends of my body on have to get back out twitter i have little wisdom to share today it feels dark scared what i do know is that i have a voice and a platform and so many others whose lives will be affected by this election do not though today is a i have to get back out there i chose my job because i wanted to make the world a safer place and starting tomorrow allowing myself a i will get back to work when you are join fall for the same old twitter the only answer i have is for me to get back to work i tell anyone else how to deal with it not black or gay or a woman and i know the fear in their hearts after something like this i can read all the articles about how poor whites who voted him in because in ravaged rural communities and they see any change in the last eight years so they were going to vote republican no matter about holding the media and news companies accountable for reporting on how about fuck the democrats in the first place for every swaying the nomination away from my answer for getting over all maybe fall for the same old shit news outlets can go to can we laugh we because we always will i laughed at jokes about on be fine comedy is indestructible you destroy it just like a war on terror you destroy a concept or a feeling send this to them look how righteous i am i have to go tell jokes in times fucking square tonight back to for those who have a twitter i think being about the situation is the first step totally understandable to feel dread right but more important to not let that dread incapacitate you occupy your mind with being vigilant of the oppression around you it has become so easy to justify oppression in our and we need to be ready to stand for those who have much of a voice right now there are a lot of citizens nervous and scared right now i feel like helping in whatever way you can to and strengthen will also help yourself to cope trying to find ways that make it easier for us all to listen to each other is a fantastic endeavor right way to move forward that i am personally trying is to inject more logical thinking into my comedy material it seems as a country right we are leaning more on emotional response and less on logic to make our decisions comedy is great because it can help condition people to think more critically about things without it coming off as forced comedy can disarm and open people up to new ways of thinking rock and his for seem like there are any easy answers to fixing all this right but weed is more legal now so roll a grab your and look to the must be twitter comedians are surviving this election the way everyone else only a little bit easier get me this quite the most disastrous thing that has happened to me in my entire life my anxiety is so bad physically incapable of being depressed i got up and took a hike this morning who am it because i wanted to feel good it was because i literally wanted to stomp on something as hard as i could and i decided the thing i was going to stomp on was planet earth i would die to change this outcome if i could truly i have no unfinished business on this planet been on had some great i did i saw the that being of all the feelings had today despair one thing not feeling is block not a silver just a fact i take for granted that in this i am luckier than the other people living through this nightmare i get to make jokes and pound my fist and get and because a comedian and because a person who was born in this not much of a chance this presidency will affect me even with even a fraction of the force with which going to devastate everyone else i have no advice i know we need to fight this and i know we need to hang on to whatever feelings we have now that feel like like momentum because if going to stop this piece of garbage from treating our country the way he treats everyone else who has ever crossed his going to need to be vigilant for a long need kindness and twitter my job is to allow people to feel like moving forward by being able to laugh about difficulty or take a break from the real world by laughing for a while until i can think of something else more worthwhile i will keep doing this i was lucky enough to perform in prison for an mostly men of color audience this year it was one of the best shows i have done because something special was going on in that room that just about audience and a comedian it was about understanding people different from you and knowing that fear might creep up but staying open is essential these men are living in actual prison and many of them have already paid their debt to society but cannot be paroled for whatever reason and they find ways to move forward behind bars with no freedoms i felt it in the kindness that they showed me and how one of the prisoners offered to pray for my who was going to have surgery at the time i am of a different faith than that prisoner but during that moment i accepted whatever prayers from whatever religion because what was behind that was kindness and moving forward this kindness and empathy is going to feel very hard but this is part of getting things done in a country which feels like not your own active or twitter any survival tips for facing down a trump like to quote trump for this they go we go or if you live in a state legalized they go we get for i think this is all a big shocking sign that we need to do more for each show understanding for one join forces with allies and help curate the world we want to live in as for how to move we need to get active some friends and i put together a called nasty women we raised for the downtown la center and it felt amazing going to keep doing them becoming active in the parts of the world you see as needing empowerment is a beam of light at the end of what feels like a dark just got material for the next four twitter trump is a big orange bug zapper of and he just gave me material for the next four years he do anything that you want to make fun of a a a cartoon take it so seriously you do anything about it invest in spray tan and learn more this question of do we move was posed after that was a serious situation it was catastrophic people died that was a real moment this sucks buffoonery but we go forward we laugh at it and we hope he fuck things up too time to listen to women and people of twitter advice on moving say for straight white male comedians time to stop giving advice and start listening to women and people and people of color instead of jumping to figure out my going to listen and read and watch and try to be ready next time so ashamed this caught me will keep me twitter i survived election night because i was on a show in with four wonderful female comedians and we got to vent on stage and afterwards comfort each other we got to convey every emotion we were experiencing in the moment which is what i hope everyone is doing you have to get your feelings process them and move to action you have to turn those feelings into quantifiable steps to support organizations that will help further your vision of what should be this has been a very nasty election i felt like i needed a shower i had a sleepless night on but this morning i got hugged my talked to my mom and told her i loved her and then i realized love is what will keep me going i need love to fight resident the tonight has never been more twitter how do we move comedy has never been more important i have a feeling there will be some new policies suppressing critical voices in the next year or and if not a direct policy at least a threat of violence is already so comedians are going to play an important in prodding and exposing the trunk of hypocrisy and rights violations that will be in the few years sure will make it easy in most but in some of the more important issues we will have to look deeper into really going on so our jobs just became a bit more not only to brighten the spirits of those who need and to make sense of going but also to make sure voices of dissension and criticism are heard if the press gets curtailed in how they can report on or if we allowed to protest any comedy will be our only resort it seems to be the main outlet where a lot of the country gets their news from anyway if you look at under a republican the economy tanks and the arts up on history and take twitter going to spend the next couple months taking and writing a ton of jokes we back down so you better bet going to be loud and queer as fuck the next four years find and stick together with your community and people of read up on history because the revolution or the second world war is coming and i will definitely keep making fun of trump because only thinking of him as a giant orange will make you feel better that such an unqualified man is our president we have to listen to one another and love each other but also stand up for yourself and know that progress takes time and we need to keep fighting to get there as a just please before the apocalypse on on via on on on on on this content
2 another big week for me and my cancer they but so and things are really hotting up before the us election got a good show managed to persuade piers as one of the few journalists who actually knows trump to speak to us from his car while filming in for and really interesting about what the media have understood about the piers is also one of the people from the worlds of journalism and broadcasting many of whom if honest i really claim to know especially well come forward to make my life easier they know this or by offering good wishes and positive thoughts and if my experience is anything to go if you know anyone with a cancer diagnosis hesitate just drop them a line to let them know thinking of them genuinely appreciated show went i but still suffering from occasionally quite acute fatigue i blame the as i get anything like this in the course of seven cycles of also since the really only able to sleep on my back my kingdom for a pair of can i hear despairing partners the doctors reckon this might be because of the impact of the radiotherapy on my which been by the well with the malarkey except that at around five on morning i get the first signs of an unmistakable and potentially very painful condition kidney i was first diagnosed with them more than 25 years ago and every now and again since a new one would get stuck in my kidney and kick off a bout of the name given to the excruciating pain that can come with them this time a couple of painkillers see it off but stand if you can face for what happened a few days 3 first day on the new treatment and one having to pay and my first visit to what one of the nurses laughingly described as otherwise known as the patients medical day so at there i am being shown into the discreetly hidden from the regular day unit be visiting later for my infusion and guess it looked very similar to its and while on the subject of business the seats were actually staff were of and i got my first dose of the very expensive plus per which the currently treatment was first class as previously no problem with the principle that i should pay for as the should be protected from additional unfunded treatment costs i choose to avail myself of but i still struggle with the royal taking a markup simply to supply an already very expensive drug by the is already standard treatment as part of chemotherapy for my cancer in the us and charging a private day rate as a whole day for a treatment that takes just over an hour taken to calling it my very own for scandal i hope putting the money to good which is perhaps something worth looking having received my i was escorted back downstairs to rejoin the rest of the human race in the and do you aside from having identical seats to i think there might actually be more space down but time to get reacquainted with the as its name is a rubber cap attached to a refrigeration system that rapidly cools the thus reducing the risk of hair loss that some chemotherapy drugs otherwise more or less guarantee it work for but it really worked for me over seven cycles of to be a few quizzical looks from other patients more used to seeing women using it and the endurance test that is the first 20 minutes of wearing it as it literally freezes your scalp brain freeze and multiply by was a very small price to pay of course forgotten how hard it would be and very nearly took it off but in the end the name of the new machines they now have at the and a from the staff got me though it so i still have hair on my 5 would turn out to be one of the most difficult since i was diagnosed back in march and none of it to do with my cancer or its metastases directly for a i have been suffering with constipation of cancer patients once it gets to 5 or 6 days as it has for me can become almost painfully uncomfortable then there was the discomfort under my right ribs put down to my liver playing up more another hangover from the radiotherapy and to cap it all was the recurring renal colic from my kidney stones and their appalling sense of timing and the twist the painkillers a mixture of paracetamol and codeine tend to work less effectively over time make you more cut a long story was a bit of a perfect in increasing discomfort and waiting until enough time had elapsed to allow me to take more painkillers which no longer quite do the and make the worse as a i leave the house and have no desire to eat or drink and the latter set to provide the biggest twist of all 8 at for blood tests preparatory to the next dose of new due by after such a dreadful i can add extreme fatigue to my list of ailments dress and have to sit slightly for a rest blood tests show sharply declining level of which means no for me unless they recover doctor also spots that my blood pressure is pretty low and i get when standing up and so prescribes intravenous fluids to 9 at looking forward to radio 4 today same thing happens extreme fatigue and dizzy when i stand up decide might not be possible the by the have been nothing but support itself over the course of my cancer travails return to hospital for more iv fluids i think these are probably the consequences of the radiotherapy taking my appetite for and drink and my simply not drinking enough for far too 10 to to see whether platelet levels have improved sufficiently for treatment to proceed not only have they gone down further something my consultant starling and her team are unsure of the cause of but my blood up and down like a a i was admitted as an to the to try to get these things sorted out and see what might be done with my kidney which are still giving me three days as i write intravenous fluids and antibiotics and a host of new medications later where i still the ward staff are great and

trump has promised to build a wall along the border between the us and after his electoral triumph over many are wondering whether actually pull this or any of his other controversial along with many other minorities in the were railed against by trump during his campaign in the to the he vowed to rid the us of yet despite this adding to his record of xenophobic trump was elected the 45th president of the united states mapping the trump 10 countries and regions feeling the heat read real estate billionaire promised to scrap the north free trade agreement on grounds that it at the expense of us workers he has also threatened to tax the money sent home from the us by migrants to in for the aforementioned spoke to in the us and about the election of and how they think his presidency might affect their lives what they underestimate the consequences that damaging our economic ties can have on feel dismayed and deeply disappointed as bad as that the worst part is feeling powerless we have a say in an event that can have catastrophic consequences to our economy in the us we are seen as collateral damage even those opposing trump seem indifferent to the economic and human pain this situation can inflict on us i understand the economic pain that people in the rust belt are feeling successful trade agreements transfer some jobs from one country to another but are net job creators to all involved countries under the us gained jobs in the south at the expense of the rust belt north gained and the south has but this is the result of failed compensating measures within both countries boosted wealth across the subcontinent cutting ties with will also harm the us it surprises me that during the campaign no one pointed this out and perceive that trade is a game under the us gained jobs in the south at the expense of the rust belt it surprises me this was n't pointed as trump adopts a pragmatic the damage can be limited to a further decline in my purchasing power owing to the peso devaluation and a difficult business environment while expectations are better anchored if he feels obligated to deliver on the promises made to his voters and revokes things could be much worse our government has little leverage because underestimate the consequences that damaging our economic ties can have on them they are self absorbed and busy inflicting pain on one another of will probably send us into an even deeper power trump has over over our over our our perception of our freedom of over the way the world will see us is terrifying and he is not even the president we woke up to find the exchange rate at 20 50 pesos for the dollar we went from 18 70 per dollar on election to 20 20 yesterday and 20 50 today expected to reach 30 by the end of the year we have been humiliated in front of the deportations of many who live and work in the united who send money home and who contribute tremendously in that way to our economy will probably send us into an even deeper recession his misogyny is worse than any machismo we have ever see we 're surprised how many love adore are more than willing to welcome in any who wishes to make their home for the next four bring your come live bring your help us out we are a welcoming country with amazing fantastic great cities with interesting museums and landmarks and restaurants and we hope they will seriously consider it that goes for people who want to escape the our collective the democracy was something to aspire to the spell has been broken in many ways in even the least educated among us believe this man to be a buffoon his ideas are uninspired and poorly that his misogyny is worse than any machismo we have ever seen we are surprised by how much and how many love adore are now wondering where to turn to for inspiration and what way of life and ideology will now inspire this we ask has created a dangerous stereotype of in the have a visa and i can travel throughout the us whenever i which is a lot but i am concerned of the increase of hate or that as a result of the stereotype i live in a place visited by a lot of tourists i worry that they will think that i am or that they think i am a drug dealer or a is not fair that a presidential candidate has blamed because of issues they have he has created a dangerous stereotype of in the us there are a lot of undocumented but a lot of us are living legally in the us many drugs go the us through the but what they forget is the us is the first drug consumer worldwide what they say is that they are in part responsible for the drug cartel violence in some we make jokes about it we now say that we are no longer the country with the stupidest president in the world silver lining is that perceives trump as a common politics in can find common ground to make front to his politics and maybe force the common efforts by different parties before the 2018 presidential election i really hope margarita will engage in alliances with other parties to win the will suffer irremediably if trump imposes tariffs on imports renegotiating for example or tax the remittances the fiscal situation in is already strained owing to low oil prices and corrupt politicians with vast regions of the country in hands of or crime trump adds chaos to the already dismal state of government with inept and corrupt politicians like president and the foreign trumps adds chaos to the already dismal state of government with inept and corrupt are going to inflation and currency devaluation will spike making expenses more difficult recession is already showing its claws and jobs cuts are on the rise in major banks as we silver lining is that perceives trump as a common enemy ended up being popular in the wrong first it was a feeling of then it was a surprise we did not stop laughing with all the irony in those fear campaigns of the media work very surprising that they work at all in the us all that money spent to promote and his hate campaign would have been used for something useful ended up being popular in the wrong things could change in if trump complies with the construction of his good things could happen in the reactivation of the local economy destroyed by the reactivation of small businesses currently by big foreign corporations i hope trump will comply in the destruction of and keep away that have damaged our country so the wall is also for the it could fall from power and give way to a government that needs so badly the fall of the government without the support of would be hope that trump will comply in the destruction of and keep away us corporations and mining companies that have damaged our country so i hope that he a good relationship with without interventionism or simply keep away and in city twitter why

accusations of and determined not to show it is easy to imagine trump making a hasty and disastrous call with a few translated into trump could not only lose the he could plunge the us inextricably

the and local are becoming more likely as the endgame in the fight against the caliphate battle is being fought out on two main fronts one is the siege of northern principal city trump has the conduct of the which involves the mainly and militias backed by 300 us special forces commandos but he has not offered an alternative the same holds true of the attempt to seize the headquarters in in northern trump says that defeating terrorism is a top priority and he will the shit out of but including appears to know what this means in practice if the battle goes will he will he cities where millions of civilians is he prepared to deploy us ground what will he do as seems both sieges become bogged or begins daily executions of is also silent about significant military intervention in and

suggested he may also seems likely to get his way in where forces have pushed his to the brink of victory in and elsewhere trump has made no serious objection to actions in even though the says they may constitute war crimes he seems content to have remain in or even to treat him as an the renewed use of chemical for new or a suddenly escalating humanitarian and refugee catastrophe could all trigger a new crisis that blows up in forcing him to move against the idea of zones and civilian safe havens still has backers if trump goes down this he could end up directly confronting allies cannot do much about insouciance but they will strongly oppose him if he tries to run down the as he has suggested pressure on easternmost members in the and in terms of political missile deployments and military exercises is reaching new heights and operations are increasingly reported in and elsewhere in the eastern remains a ticking any of these could ignite at any time in first 100 governments want to present a united front but trump seems more interested in buying off by acquiescing in reclamation of former cold war spheres of influence disdain for the he loudly applauded vote to leave and

it is no use pretending presidential election victory is a disaster for the united states and the world it at least in a victory for prejudice and for ignorance and spite it represents the triumph of economic nationalism and introspection over internationalism and the global good it is a victory built on fabrications because of will ultimately confounded by its contradictions and its immorality it will be defeated but correcting this deformation will not be easy it will take time and the damage will be explanations have been offered for defeat last week all have an element of truth for she was an uncharismatic figure the democratic base was uninspired and many stayed at home doubts surrounded her past not least in respect of the foundation in many she represented a discredited political establishment there was about her candidacy an sense of entitlement there was her ambiguous legacy and was a reaching up to a place of power no woman has ever gone a mostly unspoken misogyny undoubtedly played a part in her the complacency of the democratic party and liberal too comfortable after eight safe years of did a great disservice the party and its elected representatives badly misread the mood of the nation for the most did independent pollsters and the us media they initially dismissed trump as a clown and then with to give him too easy a these factors contributed to demise but they are not the whole story trump won because he successfully tapped the alienation and disillusionment of white men and women who comprise of the electorate and turned out for him in large numbers as polling breakdowns the determining factors were not education or not religion or not sexual predations or entanglements they were race and linked to economic distress trump exploited a feeling among whites from all suburban and that inclusive and was not working for were significant numbers of people who felt their grievances were no longer being listened to by a centrist party that had loosed itself from its moorings as frank said in these pages last democrats went from being the party of town in to the party of vineyard of the and they did so at roughly the same time that the republicans were sharpening their deadly image of the of the constituency that switched to trump was railing against a sense of being overlooked during eight years of president race unquestionably played a part when trump shrieked his slogan great what he was really saying was white when he spoke about curbing immigration and building a when he minorities and people from foreign countries he does not know or when he vowed to scrap international trade deals that he claims are destroying jobs in the when he railed against selfish allies who do not pay their the subliminal message was always

of the popular vote but was handsomely beaten in the race for electoral college votes and too little attention was paid to the effect of a decision by the supreme court in 2013 when it struck down a key part of the voting rights act of 1965 by a five to four vote what this did was allow nine states with long records of voting such as south to no longer seek federal approval to change their laws the effect was seen last week as the what has been happening in north a battleground state with a history of racial discrimination in voting republican lawmakers and officials have gone to remarkable lengths to drive down turnout among black who disproportionately there were numerous other examples across the including stringent voter id rules that the federal government had stated earlier this year had a disproportionate effect on minorities for the leader of the free world to allow voter suppression is beyond supporters and opponents alike are about to discover is that like the billionaire is much of what he promised on the campaign trail will not be delivered or will be so watered down as to make no says he will cut raise public spending and slash the federal deficit impossible all at

commercial realities mean he will not he says he will make strong and its then kowtows to the most formidable strategic and undermines he says he will be best friend but his campaign was not above antisemitic trump voters really believe the border wall they need a reality check the power of us presidents to act unilaterally in or any other domestic is extremely circumscribed trump would face endless legal challenges and he would need agreement and funding from prospect that much of what trump has promised or threatened will not happen is welcome perhaps the responsibilities of office will

for 240 has toyed with the idea of a woman becoming president this for an all too brief it looked as if the idea might become a reality but the dream of a female president has remained just a disingenuous myth occasionally serves up in but never permits to spill into its facts instead of witnessing the landmark moment of a woman moving into the oval we can now see the misogyny that became a feature of the 2016 presidential campaign bedding down in the corridors of power when trump called a in the final only a few days after a series of recordings revealed him admitting to a series of sexual aggressions and many people thought it was the end of his bid for the presidency social media during election night revealed trump supporters male and female voicing the view that a woman is simply not capable of being too weak to stand up to foreign leaders and the sucker punch for those of us who believe that this particular woman was spectacularly more ready for the white house than her grossly and abusive opponent is that as has historically been the case once a female candidate did not carry even the female vote a staggering of white women voted against and for the man whose statements and attitudes brought kicking and into the light twitter concession speech in conceded the she tried to offer hope to the especially the young of know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass but i know someday someone and hopefully sooner than we might think right of we may not think that right because right now the media is focusing its attention on economic and racial it is not interested in the of but that is also the story of this which was fought over a series of myths and outright two solid the media engaged in spreading and misinformation about the first serious female candidate for president for a few days after we learned that trump likes to grab women the the mainstream media began admitting how many of the derogatory stories swirling around were how many were literally fictions but then the and the story reverted to its misogynistic relentlessly informing the electorate that is untrustworthy it was character and it who still believes these claims are factual and on the some 59 million people do should consider how closely they resemble the stories that have always been told about female both real and fictional to do so is to that it is time to stop as some commentators are that failed us the truth we failed understand a you must know its stories taking a hard look at some of the tales told about the idea of a female president can teach us a great deal about this as well as those to come the women who have become presidents in the history of fiction are not quite as vanishingly scarce as they are in but not exactly numerous until very the fictions were as presumptively white as the candidates just 14 women have mounted a serious bid for us three of whom made it to a major national although only one secured that nomination five became third party and two became major party running both of whom lost we have had three female secretaries of one female speaker of the house but no woman has ever been elected to the executive branch of the idea of a woman in the white house has always prompted the same it is either a a disaster or a cheat was endlessly called to shouts of her although her crimes always varied had she murdered or had she covered up wrongdoing in the deaths of at stolen or was in it matter what mattered was the idea of illegitimacy most stories imagine a female president who murders or sleeps her way into or inherits the fictions about women becoming president have always worked to invalidate the very idea for the novel by a former speaker of the house and avowed enemy of newt which tells of a woman who becomes first woman president and chooses politics over national resulting in a style its now has been tipped for a cabinet because propaganda neither history nor fiction are there more than a handful of stories that imagine a female president who could ascend to the highest office in the land through merit and hard instead she either murders or sleeps her way into or she inherits the from a man fictional depictions of a female presidential candidate on the actual campaign trail are even this may correlate with the fact as herself she was always more popular in office than while running when female presidents are they are in office thanks to a of some which is also power was handed to or she inveigled her way into it either crooked just like fiction is a club into which women presidents admitted they are segregated by cropping up primarily in satire or science female presidents are a or exist in an alternate reality women are disproportionately more likely to become president in disaster movies and because only when large segments of the human race are eradicated do we imagine women in charge in early science fiction the apocalypse often took the form of the nullification of as real political gains sent masculinity into an imaginary crisis from which it has not the any writing that considered the possibility of a woman president focused not on what it would mean to but on what it would mean to men even when written by a woman what seems to be the earliest fictional depiction of a female presidential candidate was a burlesque provoked by the first woman who ran in beecher published narrated by a man who thinks he supports rights until he meets who wants to be president her name your says it she is aggressive and a unwomanly amphibious loud and vulgar by no she is also accused of swindling and fraud she singlehandedly we are whole woman for the main argument for proposing was to introduce into politics that superior delicacy and which women manifest in family it was her fault if feminism take because she was doing such a bad job at representing should sound because it is a very persistent pretends it is perfectly comfortable with the ideal of a female only to discover that it is disappointed or horrified by every human woman it encounters words like enter the story when women fail to that women should cleanse politics with their purity was the view taken by beecher who made the news in 1888 by predicting would soon see a woman the men would vote for her out of pure gallantry and not quite how it played out women even get the vote until when the 19th amendment was ratified newspapers instantly produced satirical visions of women marching into the white house one imagined the inauguration of the first woman will be a parade

are a lot more on my way home today i walked passed a patrol of armed and i was suddenly surprised by how normal that has become to me definitely become part of the scenery in and are part of a new at vocabulary along with national security alert levels in public places have been heightened and i think people and perhaps still a lot more wary about two months after the attacks a car and people threw themselves to the ground i had a hard time going out to concerts and big events for a and even i have to scout out the fire escape when i get there my friend was killed at the last year and i still get used to that he was a kind accepting of everyone and brimming with potential not a day where i think about that and feel sad and bereft attacks are being used to often spend nights near the republic square the and i was shocked to see how empty it months after the attacks i also surprise myself i go as i prevent myself to stop at the square for a moment and to feel did change my relationships with especially with some friends as i come from a town in the suburbs which has a lot of immigrants making up the with of origins debates about what happened and what is still happening are part of our daily life and some friends have the same opinions as me some people i thought i knew started to call for or to call refugees animals because they thought they were having really racist thoughts and talking to some very good friends of mine because what they said really hurt me my father being i got personally offended by been said by some people i think the attacks are being exploited by politicians to win the upcoming presidential elections they just scare people and hope to win like and now no difference between the parties as they just all target 22 nationalism is is in an utter mess and has been for a long time the front national have made gains the country so in on the magnanimous fear since the and the left is too to do anything about it the fact that veteran leftist is putting himself forward once again for the next elections speaks volumes about the lack of progress made by socialism in the past few years here people are exasperate by the their handling of the travail protests was country is currently having an identity crisis politicians have been saying that is the home of secularism in the same breath as saying that is a catholic what they really seem to be getting at is want levels of nationalism being stoked by even the politicians is scary obsession with referencing the as the is as nauseating as it is historically inaccurate i really tell if resilience or simply hard to say been a real change the country has rocked and but its foundations are solid it feels more like what a or the crash of strong reactions at slowly dwindling out one year you deny something did but the scar is if not the is poised to the various cafs already people have resumed their normal lives looks the same it was before those appalling events it has may be seeing more cops and soldiers patrolling in the but not that striking if a change has taken it is happening at a deeper level and while true the emergency state has been there been any report of real though some may have flared up every so really tell if resilience or simply numbness and resignation as a matter of if the purpose of the attacks was to spread then it panned out people are both willing to resist and if something must it will and hardly anything you can do to prevent so the best course is to carry on as before and be oblivious of the danger which is the right path to tread has changed dramatically since the has changed dramatically since the attacks during 2016 there was this fear of mass gatherings and the possibility of an attack politically has changed politicians had been making a discourse out of what it means to be for years but since the every party and every politician has something to good and for bad the whole political debate gravitates around what defines the fundamentals of society and on what kind of social contract we all rely my biggest hope for is too stay united and not to get lost in adversity i wish that we can continue to live with different especially in a city as mixed as most relevant think is the rise of the every day i hear conversations about whereas it was not the case before when i talk about politics with my the first issue they mention is immigration the migrant crisis which is facing has bolstered this atmosphere the most relevant thing is the rise of the national front takes advantage of it in the little town where i live near of the inhabitants voted for them at the last regional election it is a democratic town i was at the counting after the election with my father and the mayor told us believe of the population i administer vote for them taken we also were and it is far worse in other regions in the wake of the a released a song in which he says have no choice we have to live together or to die it is exactly what i feel if our country is divided then they have won the terrorists want the national front to win the election next they want to divide the nation quite the i would like to see a united country which has no scapegoats angers is doing very not feeling very optimistic the coming presidential elections will make the latest one seem like a walk in the park there is so much frustration and degradation in all our that i see how this could end well i buy those wonderful resilient stories we are bombarded with is doing very poorly i teach young and those last two felt many

representative m thinking has overstayed its future of the democratic party begins with cleaning house at the democratic national committee without a dynamic progressive committed to a strategy leading our party and a staff committed to humble outreach and genuine advocacy for needs we are doomed to repeats of 8 once represented the working class not any more read platform may have been the most progressive in but the people felt it enough to have a good plan on paper we now have the chance to build a that wholeheartedly supports that platform and turns it into our guiding our next leader the thinking and strategies that have defined the top levels of democratic politics have overstayed their both with the party faithful and with the country as a cannot rely on the same social media messages and stale talking points that got us here nor can we fall for the dangerous notion that if only talked more about privatizing social might have won over more moderate voters there is no evidence that such triangulation has any credibility with the and our party needs to recognize that once and for unusual ideology has taught us that many of the political fights ahead of us have nothing to do with the arguments of the past 20 years party leaders need to recruit candidates with a genuine understanding of the issues that matter from economic insecurity to the future of rural to social justice to education we need to work with grassroots organizations to build a fresh party for the future just putting fresh paint on the party that lost the white house is not an t have to make a positive case to voters of democratic party was dealt a body blow in this election educated and white voters especially in places along the rust belt have fled the democratic party they voted for trump in record numbers to make matters 6 million voters chose to stay home as underperformed with virtually every coalition demographic the we is not an easily block twitter demonstrators in new city protest election victory the soul searching begins some will say the party must become more progressive others will say we must refocus on the white voters that drove the presidency in the and yet others will say we must continue to focus on engaging and mobilizing the coalition we must reject the false choice of having to choose between being more progressive or cultivating a populist economic message or continuing to fight for the causes of our increasingly diverse base we have to do all the three we have to make a case to every voter of color of what we intend to do to improve their lives because simply pointing to the intolerance and bigotry of the republican party is not enough the we is not an easily block the soul searching must reject stale conventional political wisdom and outreach strategies and embrace candidates and alliances to move the party forward we must own a message of economic populism that embraces not just the white working class but workers in the economy that have been left behind and who feel like the recovery from the great recession has not reached them we must do more than commit ourselves rhetorically to reforming our criminal justice system and our immigration system we must more fully commit ourselves to reforming both systems we must be responsive to the voices in the country that are fighting to ensure that life in this country is valued our party is old and stale the greatest asset we had going for us was that we saw the demographic changes in this country and elected a candidate that reflected that change and he gave us an affirmative case for change the job is to mobilize its supporters to the and we failed its time to must stand up to those who have too much love this country and i am worried about it why i think the question cannot be should democrats do to but what must we regardless of do to secure good secure middle class safe drinking water and respect for all regardless of race or we must do is take on what called the princes thirsting for in the late control over government itself they created a new despotism in its service new mercenaries sought to regiment the their and their my three of the privileged hedge funder mercer and venture capitalist singer and spent millions of dollars using populist language in attack ads against me as welcome their trump presidency a for the warn climate scientists read thrives when everyone is lying about and as democrats as citizens we must be more we must name the names of the modern from peter to to who are using chump change to play with local elections and national must stand up for water and stand against abuse of eminent where the worst kind of corporate power teams up with governmental power to take land for dangerous fossil fuel projects we must stand up for unions not just before an stand up for prevailing speak up for project labor stand up against misclassification we must unapologetically oppose the merger as a reckless concentration of and push where we can for breaking up the stranglehold of big big and big agriculture in other we must be honest about and truly stand up for those who have too little against those who have too much must follow the lead of sanders and you drive through the rust belt states that handed trump the presidency states like and you see a people in profound economic crisis the only jobs are retail jobs at or the dollar or if you are really a job at the local hospital the costs of and childcare are skyrocketing credit cards are maxed and college is a pipe dream the epidemic of drug addiction is destroying whole families no one must look to for hope and lessons on how to win d read the foreclosure crisis 10 years the banks seized millions of and no one ever went to jail for it corporations can break move their plants to lay everyone off and get away with course people are angry for the democrats offered a counter narrative they are the villains the corporations like the pharmaceutical the health insurance big agribusiness and by and been willing to take on corporate power in a real way they offered a systemic critique of the rigged economy and broken and shown that they are willing to fight are a few notable like warren and sanders now democrats need to follow their lead or democrats will keep over and over twitter the democrats should follow the lead of sanders and his willingness to take on corporate power trump played to the worst xenophobic fears of rust belt channeling their anger against anyone from them but he also offered a systemic critique that sounded a lot like warren and his closing ad bashed the and corrupt political establishment the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals the political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our so he won those key states and is worse for is a moment of reckoning for the democratic party democratic party win if it smells like corporate the democratic national committee ended its ban on donations from federal lobbyists and political action committees a policy put in place by in 2008 at corporate money could flow in unchecked the democratic party would have the resources to win up and down the ballot wrong in the rule change symbolized a deeper disconnect between the democratic party and the voters it relies upon millions of those voters made known their outrage at business as usual via the the sanders to no avail in millions of voters stayed home the a catastrophic electoral rout despite a hideously despised republican nominee millions of voters made known their outrage at business as usual via the the sanders to no want a democratic party that smells like corporate influence for the democratic party to reclaim its it must be its best the party of the people the first step is to clean house time for a leader like congressional progressive caucus and for a return to winning strategy the progressive and populist agenda that emerged from last democratic convention was a great one time to pair it with a surge of investment in organizing and an embrace of candidates who can bring new voters and energy to the party democrats must stiffen their spines they won the popular after all they have a mandate to oppose bigoted agenda at every turn and a passionate and growing mass progressive movement on the streets demanding they do everything in their power the sharper the contrast between democrats and the billionaire billionaire the greater the chance for a speedy democratic elections on on via on on on on on this content
thanks everyone for taking part this and for all your comments keep the page open for longer but we are heading off been a long hope everyone enjoys their and see you next about that question from earlier 11 2016 says that it was may who called trump talked to trump earlier on a downing street statement said it added that the prime minister called congratulate him on his election campaign and and confirmed may had been invited to visit the us soon as he did n't call but she called in the know colleague seems to have more guardian staff 11 2016 were being told today by one of the senior who is trust on this that it works that way world leaders frantically phone him and they choose who to put through 11 2016 mean everyone phones the new us president at the same time and he chooses what call to take first and trump talked to another ten people before talking to think find a substitute for my 2016 in a week that feature a great deal of there was one topic that unified the divided nation the outrageous changes to the shape of our beloved chocolate the most read list on the news site was reassuringly marks then the us election the people know where their priorities lie got to be honest i always thought that was something that people only ever bought in a panic at airports if forgotten to get someone a gift when they were abroad 08 2016 always thought they made triangular so it fits in the of it unify us for long there had to be a just got real via argued that it summed up easy to scoff at the fact that it takes food to act as a focal point for what is happening in this when there is so much that has been truly awful about this hate the immediate retraction of a promise of extra funding all of these things should be more alarming than a slightly smaller chocolate or a pricier snack but all of these things have become part of a ominous collective sigh that has summed up the past few months 2016 has been defined by a creeping sense of dread that all the progress humanity has made over the past few decades if feeling particularly might be about to then she was writing in the golden era before trump was elected and we found out that had died in a week that brought us closer to had our own reasons to feel that droning mix of fear and a inquiry concluded that the austerity policies amounted to of disabled rights the work and pensions dismissed the scathing report as and to disabled people which is because say the conservatives telling paraplegics and cancer patients that being forced to pay the bedroom tax whilst having their disability benefit cut and social care removed really as bad as you is the definition of and offensive been a lot of talk of a possible future president in but this reader see 11 2016 astonished to see people quite seriously expressing hope that will run next time all the stuff about writers hoping to tell their daughters that they could be president just like was undermined by her surname dynasties are part of the this article suggests it likely to happen is unlikely to run for president read more world leaders have begun congratulating trump on his election win as people around the world anxiously wait to see how their country will engage with the new us president was the first global leader to speak to trump on the phone he was also one of the first to congratulate him publicly after a meeting in new in where he met both trump and he described trump as strong trump in turn called fantastic victory has divided society some are relieved to see who they believe supported the brotherhood lose others are and fear the repercussions of his win as part of a community project we asked people in to share their thoughts with us what they was more than thrilled by his win as a fascist be concerned much with the state of human rights his support will directly result in more bloodshed and more violations of law and human rights in the controls the most powerful office in the this will give a huge push to all the in the world talking about the extremist terrorist movements electing an as a president is going to feed more and more the image those movements are trying to spread about the us as the biggest devil in the and will further inflate the violence and terrorism this will only help increase the instability and the warfare in the and maybe the whole live in a police state where activists and journalists disappear or are jailed the administration had been putting pressure on our government to improve human rights and freedom of but i doubt administration will do the same this is evident from our current eagerness to connect with and trump are heavily disliked in the middle east by and while trump is openly hostile to and clueless about the policy as secretary of state has been very deliberate and damaging to the region despite her more tolerant and inclusive is it time to take a step 11 2016 was elected he was practically hailed as the second coming of remember it people crying in people hugging in the the world was going to be a better fairer place what absolutely the same old same the rich got richer the poor we have the situation in it looks like the have elected the and its going to be the end of the will have to wait and but i think that neither one is so bad or the other one was so good w response to the news this week was one of the most simultaneously heartwarming and tight to the ones you please he because all got is each it seems to be a thought that occurred to quite a few of my friends at the same time the worst has my friend are terrified and just wanted to say that i love you and if you think about a hopeful response to an otherwise hopeless event someone you love them in the face of events that negate brotherly love is a small but resolute instance of resistance now a worth of reading cookbooks on a daily basis for my job has made one thing clear people who love to love to share and the one thing they share more than anything is a love of feeding people and the belief that cooking a meal for someone is bold and an act of true love wrote a book called stirring slowly this which is full of the kind of warming meals you just want to come home to on a cold night she talks about food that heals so you know invite each other round to dinner make for colleagues bring cakes into offices and flapjacks into classrooms take care of each other eat together i interviewed photographers taken pictures of trump throughout his and it struck me just how malleable the is one of the described trump as being very different in person from his public charming but said he was exactly the same as in that what you see is what you get the two photos were admittedly taken a decade but the disparity in their stories seems to suggest that trump is even more that we to the point of never having a stable version of a man who makes up his life as he goes powered by a kind of narcissism and presumptuousness photographers on their best trump think he 's a damaged read do you think of is he a what do you make of his change of tone since being share your views below a 11 2016 trump phone may or the other way certainly seem to be at the front of the queue went outside to discover a trump sign on my in a window that did not have that sign on were the closet trump a question been hearing again and again in the past few days i heard it at an election night party for students of alma mater a student there told me that no one had been a vocal trump supporter among the student but as the returns rolled she wondered how of them must have be closet trump fans i heard it talking to cultural critic who looked at the strong support for trump among white women exit polls suggested of white women voted for trump and concluded that it was very difficult to say no one who was theoretically on the left voted for win came as a shock to many now wondering who supported him all simply did not talk about it for some a source of anxiety at a protest in a young woman told the post that she was deeply upset by the people who had voted for trump see people differently now i smile at people on the street anymore because you never she said did voters feel the same sense of shock that there might be closet supporters who had been around them all the do you have any advice for who are devastated by this stages of mourning a

trump has won science and scientists played almost no part in the campaign scientists must consider how they fit into a trump future this be easy many scientists are scared in the tribal world of us many now find themselves on the outside looking in most university scientists are and the 2017 house and senate will all be republican for this nothing portends disaster more than the elevation of a opponent to national and international of the competitive enterprise to oversee the transformation of the environmental protection those academics who lean republican of whom are since you would despise rejection of what a w bush adviser once dismissed as the anyone interested in evidence over speculating on details like who trump will ask to replace john as his science scientists should not just be asking what trump will do for them they should face up to the difficult question of what they should be doing for trump some scientists will have to join the white house itself when w bush was his administration had a hard time finding a scientist willing to serve as his science advisor when jack a highly respected administrator and physicist who was also a took the job he was excoriated by his peers and excommunicated from some scientific circles we see hints of similar responses to election already earlier this week the physical society issued a press release congratulating trump on his victory and encouraging him to sustained and robust funding of scientific research a top the received so many complaints that it felt compelled to retract it and issue an apology some have already written off science advisor for of state university not sure science would because there be any science get much except when it gets in the way or bolsters support for a political was called a upon taking the position under bush there are thousands of political including many science that will need to be expert advisory bodies constituted and and experts put into staff positions under the white house any scientist who agrees to hold their nose and work with the trump administration should expect much of the same criticism received by such as government will not have much choice but to engage that is their job the rest of the scientific community must still ask itself some difficult questions we suggest money all that the late stages of the presidential 69 prize winners endorsed and pushed for more funding for research and policies that support the scientific workforce they suggested that there were other reasons for their but focused on what the next president might do for the interests of the scientific incoming president of the geophysical union expressed a similar a fear that the scientific infrastructure in the is going to be on its everything from funding to being able to attract the global leaders we need to do basic science trump imagines that the scientific community could cause him one option would be to do what did to reactionary doctors in setting up the and their mouths with trump could echo promising to science to its rightful by increasing funding it would be the art of the and it would put critical scientists in a difficult position no one knows what trump will do on science or much else the history of us science funding shows that republican presidents more eager to spend on than their democratic priorities have with democrats spending more through the environmental protection agency and commerce while republicans spend more on the national science foundation and national institutes of health overall spending on is not with party mainly because science funding has long been a bipartisan priority other than the massive injections of cash through the and smaller stimulus package more science funding has remained pretty stable as a proportion of government discretionary spending since the end of world war two without much discussion of the fiscal trump has announced grand plans for increases in us infrastructure investment for this could mean funding for perhaps newt will revive his vision of a moon base and a mission to mars the demoted since the end of the cold could receive a boost that advocate for more science funding have already sought to tie in funding with calls for greater investment scientists need to consider how to react to possible increases in funding as well as express fears of decreases in doing they might position themselves as representatives of the public good rather than just another special interest group should pragmatism trump how should scientists engage on policy issues such as vaccination and climate where republicans are often accused of being or at war with despite rhetorical nods to the social conservative wing of his party during the campaign and his enthusiasm for convenient conspiracy he is clearly a pragmatist with little worry about changing his policy should therefore ask themselves whether they would support policies that did what they regard as the right but for the reasons policies focused on deploying electric vehicles and nuclear or wind power may be justified in purely economic rather than environmental terms environmental regulations may provide convenient cover for the taxing of imports as the struggles to justify a new protectionism when it comes to climate maybe the pragmatic business of policy design might finally take precedence over trying to convince a republican congress to see the world through a climate eyes two days after the election a spokesperson for tweeted the strong support of the agreement on climate change many environmental scientists have long seen as antithetical to their cause would they make peace with big oil in order to defend the or will the battle against perceived enemies of science now take place on multiple would be easy for scientists to bring back an opposition strategy focused on defending a on much harder will be for the science community to support a government under the control of president trump and a republican congress choices will have to be made scientists should be aware that the that many followed to oppose president w bush may not work as well under a less president who really benefits from science and earlier this when a trump presidency still seemed science policy writer drew an uncomfortable picture in a commentary along with other has systematically ignored the concerns of people such as those who voted for trump or for according to rather than challenging established have often bolstered while pretending to remain distant from politics campaign tapped into a constituency that had been largely shut out from the benefits of technological progress and disproportionately suffered the consequences of expanding global trade us and elites pretend that unfettered technology will not only grow the economy but also close the gap between rich and poor a recent issue of wired magazine brought into conversation with the gurus of silicon valley hailed the magic bullets of telling best way for the tech industry to tackle inequality is for it to do what supposed to innovate in ways that create actual gains in growth and tells us how bad this analysis is technology tends to widen the gap between rich and simply because rich people are better able to take advantage of productivity gains than poor people and yet the narrative of technology continues trump gave an interview to a heavily partisan news site that has become depressingly in which he with reference to artificial have always been concerned about the social breakdown of our culture caused by now is the time to ask who really benefits from and to rethink the responsibilities of scientists in engaging with inequality scientists who choose not to engage with a trump administration risk fueling the resentment and disenchantment that brought it to power the scientific community could respond to the populist surge by devoting more attention to understanding the consequences of technological innovation on while developing alternatives paths to ensure that its benefits are shared more equitably and negative consequences more effectively anticipated and scientists and other the surprise election of trump to the us presidency comes with choices many of us were dismayed at the vote and now the election of trump how we inside our own communities and in relation to governments will determine whether we remain relevant or the constructive role that we should play in policy and regardless of our elections on on via on on on on on this content
world leaders have begun congratulating trump on his election win as people around the world anxiously wait to see how their country will engage with the new us president the order in which trump spoke to leaders around the world has sparked speculation as to how he will shape his foreign policy in the 24 hours after his victory trump spoke to and south the may was 11th on the action planned after second night of protests across us read was the first to have a conversation on how to closer diplomatic with the us prime discussed regional security and how to defeat a key promise in election campaign but although the and the offered they his leadership a of asked people around the world to tell us what the situation looks like from where they how their governments are responding to victory and how they think his leadership will affect their and the us will probably grow closer but as citizens we will suffer from endorsement of our live in a police state where activists and journalists disappear or are jailed the administration had been putting pressure on our government to improve human rights and freedom of but i doubt administration will do the same this is evident from our current eagerness to connect with trump i hope he hires a team that understands the complexities of the middle east it is evident he does n't have a and trump are heavily disliked in the middle east by and while trump is openly hostile to and clueless about the policy as secretary of state has been very deliberate and damaging to the region despite her more tolerant and inclusive gone through a very similar election scenario in in 2012 where both candidates were i was not very surprised by the outcome the democratic party underestimated popularity and the dislike for i feel a lot of votes went to trump out of spite for perhaps if a different candidate had gone against trump the outcome would have been different just like what happened in it looks like the population is now sharply split in with each side the other i think the most dangerous thing that can happen to a intolerant people in power might make it easier to challenge them as they are now out in the but healing the rifts in society is much harder i simply hope trump will become a president for all us as is his and reign in the hateful extremist tendencies displayed by white hope he hires a competent team that understands the complexities of the situation in the middle east and as it is evident that he does not have a trade conflicts but he will use his business wisdom to deal with feel great about the result a tremendous win for the for those who were constantly ignored by political elites in i like trump a lot because he knew the real problems of the country rather than just chanting politically correct us is divided probably more divided than when i worked there for three years that happens when you are obsessed with gay rights and minority rights but forget to promote the most basic right of living a better life for the majority he will be a great president if he improve some of his to plot and the are now dead trump is likely to be a more pragmatic figure than so relations will improve going to be some trade conflicts if trump lives up to his word about but i believe he will use his business wisdom to deal with it china will have an easier situation and a stronger influence in the region a cooperation between these two countries could benefit humankind i wish that trump could be more presidential he will be a great president if he improves some of his rhetoric i hope that he can get along with have a lot of supporters for trump mostly from say the result was shocking would be an understatement victory of an fanatic like in a country known around the world for its liberal virtues and is something that adds to the swerve of the world to the right he adds on to the list of politicians such as in in and of in maybe we are witnessing the gradual transition of the world into a global we have a lot of supporters for trump mostly from parties another moment of jubilation for them maybe the consequences for foreign policy will be beneficial as trump has publicly shown his admiration for and his way of governance but his temperamental nature makes trump truly so we will have to wait and see as long as he turn rhetoric into i think the world will be southern where most of the people have a similar opinion to me but in the northern areas of the stomping ground of the ruling opinions may differ the philosophy of of a mutual peaceful which was even enshrined in our foreign policy until an ideological regime is something i firmly believe and the rise of a person like trump is a question mark on existence itself the hidden silent majority that is supposed to have created this ruckus may not be as silent as they are portrayed to be as in every other some are always bound to feel during the rule of a government they which could be for cultural or economical reasons beyond doubt this result was the result of what they call some sort of racial hate storm against the former policy on terrorism and the domestic election helped me to see what the us truly is under the pop culture disguise they have a huge rising tide of fanatics and a population desperate enough to find hope in them maybe his campaign of rhetoric and hate was a charade to reign in their support as long as he limits himself to rhetoric and dare turn rhetoric into i think the world will be of the few things politicians agreed on was to openly reject trump has been hostile to our so i am not optimistic about having a fluid relationship with the us his proposals against make it really difficult to support and trump mark a politicians must not pander to it read government made it clear that it supported i am really worried about the impact this will have on our future society is fragmented as there is a strong division between the actual and former government but one of the few things politicians agreed on was to openly reject us now has a president who is who openly supports and illegal who hates who thinks climate change was invented by china to make us industries less competitive what can go has been always a very progressive nation we have many but one of our main characteristics is that we are open to different religions or race discrimination like but here we face integration or at least not like in other parts of the voted for him because he said the things that many of them think trump is a clear representation of the average and that was like a kind of dangerous homer it also shows how unhappy they are with the political types of leaders that are spreading around the world are setting in a new with policies that i think compromise worldwide security they are on the rise because of need for an answer to but the only thing they achieve is to deepen and create a more segregated and unfair have been humiliated in front of the power trump has over us over our our our perception of our freedom of over the way the world will see us is and he is not even the president future deportations of many who live and work in the us who send money and who contribute tremendously in that way to our will probably send us into an even deeper recession we have been humiliated in front of the we woke up to find the exchange rate at 20 50 pesos for the dollar we went from 18 70 per dollar on election day to 20 20 on and 20 50 on expected to reach 30 by the end of the are more than willing to welcome in any who wishes to make their home for the next four years bring your come live bring your help us out we are a welcoming country with amazing fantastic great cities with interesting museums and landmarks and restaurants and we hope they will seriously consider it that goes for people who want to escape the our collective us democracy was something to aspire to this is something that has changed the spell has been broken in many ways we are disappointed in even the least educated among us believe this man to be a his ideas to be uninspired and poorly that his misogyny is worse than any machismo we have ever seen we made fun of him we are surprised by how much and how many love adore are now wondering where to turn to for inspiration and what way of life and ideology should now inspire ask this us generally does the same thing no matter in the result might have been but hardly going to change anything in south our government is already pandering to trump as they would to being subservient and uncritical is all the administration will even if the us government starts to deport i hope they freeze out the government and treat it with the insignificance it course you worry that such an election might make extremists feel entitled to commit hate crimes on the other the us generally does the same thing no matter in voted as it was the others who bother voting as they feel by the politics that won it it is something we know quite well in too this is not someone fit for office this is someone who needs could see the relations being much less friendly than they have been really hard to know at this point in time how presidency will affect i think it will have a big impact on our economy because the us is our main economic this is where we export the majority of our goods and trump wants to get rid of our prime minister said he would work with but the truth is they have very conflicting views on almost so i could see the relations being much less friendly than they have been lately with trump as people all over the globe are in danger i am scared and i am sad sad to see so many people showing showing hate towards their every talked to or who has posted on social media seems to think the same and the age of popular 2016 in long reads read man is devoid of common sense or a sense of he thinks better than jokes about assaulting which we know he he thinks too smart to file his taxes this is not someone fit for office this is someone who needs biggest concern for and all nations is how trump will behave towards 39 if senses weakness or he will take full advantage and seek to further and the he will finance populist movements across the as well as launching military operations where advantageous to interests in that the might need to look to china as its only powerful ally in of global stability a really sad big concern is that the us will tear up its climate change commitments and its rapprochement with both would be highly disadvantageous to and interests in working towards global conflict reduction the overwhelming majority of are worried about the trump presidency have pinned their hopes on a who a politician to fix the precise same system that produced him in the first place that is why both and the foreign have been lukewarm in their reactions to say the least i am saddened but not surprised after showed that complacency has created a significant percentage of protest voters who wish to destroy the current economic order even without a coherent alternative the us is now deeply divided into two the trump camp that is predominantly and the other that has a high percentage of ethnic minorities that racial divide is deeply worrying mood here is one of shock and fear for the know that nationalist parties all across believe their luck the middle ground has shifted to the right i hope that moderate leaders take heed and produce a backed by that is much like the shows how vulnerable democracies are to simple populist arguments when the circumstances are right in both the us and the the vote was decided by a tranche of voters whose lives have more despair than hope for the future i am bitterly disappointed with both but the leaders on the losing side did not articulate any policies that would give the voters hope for change they badly misread the mood of the left behinds the much like the shows how vulnerable democracies are to simple populist and cracking very dark jokes about the end of the it is only going to encourage supporters of marine pen in the upcoming elections in it is going to make the relationship with the and that much more friends are trying to keep business as usual and not discuss it in cracking very dark jokes about the end of the world but then the memory in is regardless of their political all my acquaintances are horrified that the us has chosen such an inexperienced person and failed businessman because his have not been stable or profitable for anyone but himself his language and his lack of control are hope he does not influence other world leaders to become more like him or dominant and ultimately ineffective heads of repressive countries i hope that he does not commit nepotism

former said that if us early warning radar showed the country was under attack by nuclear there would be time for a president to receive a briefing that could be as short as 30 seconds and the would then have between three and 12 minutes to make up his mind he would have to take into account that the early warning system had been wrong before and could be vulnerable to ever more sophisticated think lacks knowledge of the and knowledge of nuclear weapons and the consequences of their use not competent he lashes out at the smallest provocation and he divides the world into winners and said a bully and i have confidence that he would be reasoned and restrained in a have argued that in the decision time is not that short the fact that the us has so many options and missiles as well as bombers means it does not have to launch on warning of an attack there would be more time for trump to think and ask for prompt launch of our nuclear missiles is not required nor is it us peter

long as not proposed by a democratic wrote on an fas is the lesson from decades of us nuclear weapons and arms control management if that trend then we can expect the new trump administration to reduce the us nuclear weapons arsenal more than the administration the current arms treaty limiting the strategic arsenals of both new expires in 2021 a decision will have to be made whether to replace it or let arms control wither both and trump could save tens of billions of dollars by cutting arsenals as part of any would ask for the scrapping of the us missile system currently being

trump has invited may to and affirmed his belief in the special relationship between the and the us the invitation came in first conversation with the trump reportedly spoke to nine other world

press conference with the vice ma says china and the are enjoying a and are taking their relationship to a new level the former has denounced trump as a misogynistic but also set out three lessons progressive parties can learn from his election victory all from me for today i have to get to a school which is late for the comments this is from the harry trump special wants to bilateral trade and be to invite her to 2016 this is from the evening gather invited may to visit as soon as possible and it would be a great to welcome her to 2016 may has spoken to trump this is from ship minister had her conversation with president elect at time this 2016 it is worth noting that of the three lessons that ed thinks progressives need to learn from trump two are ones that has already embraced policy agenda is not and he can credibly pose as an outsider but he is not particularly comfortable championing nationalism or patriotism ed the former was on the world at one talking about trump he expressed horror at politics like and this he accepted that trump won support because people were rightly fed up with the economic status said that he thought he had a of this problem when he was leader of the party but that his solutions were obviously sufficiently he lost the general since then appears to have given the subject more thought because in his interview he offered some fresh thinking on how political parties could respond to these challenges it was one of the most interesting interventions heard from any politician since election here are the key identified three lessons that progressive politicians could learn from the success of trump parties like needed to offer big stop defending the system like insiders and embrace he said i think there are deep lessons and what are the first of all the economic because whatever you say about trump and they offer big solutions i think they are false and we should not invent false gods of our own but our solutions are too incremental and not big enough for the diagnosis of inequality and the problems that we being political insiders is a massive problem trump was the outsider and i do think in a sense that got him permission to be heard and i think we have to think very hard about how we defend the broken politics that people but actually want to change this issue of nationhood and patriotism and the truth is that trump has invented a nasty view of but we yet have a convincing one of our own simply defending openness on its without has been proved to be deeply insufficient he said had failed we should certainly be saying has failed the current economic system does not work it has accrued the gains to the top and people have got squeezed and left said following the he accepted that there would have to be some controls on the free movement of citizens into the politicians had to understand he said having seen the referendum we have if at all to see some change in relation to free said that he still believed in and the advantages of the single but that this needed to be combined with fairness described trump as misogynistic and said people should be about his election the idea that we have shared values with a misogynistic groper beggars think we should be deeply worried about the implications for many of the things that we care tackling climate he says invented by the and a dealing with problems in the middle he says going to almost immediately the capital of with all kinds of implications that has for the middle east peace his attitude to and then this fantasy about trade this guy is anti an odd combination of protectionism plus the old tax cut formula that has got us into a lot of this mess in the first said election was symptomatic of a in ed will the has suggested that

in my the and the have just created president an unqualified candidate who came up not through but through inheriting a gift for and being on won the popular trump won enough to get a majority of electoral votes that was a move to the right not unlike and the rule of prime minister in yet i also have to admit in answer to the question most often i hoped but never quite believed i would see a female president in my lifetime at not a woman like a first female president were someone or another woman who knew how to play the game and i have been surprised but just play the she changed the insisted that rights are human that women can decide the fate of our own that workers of all races should get paid the same as white men for the same that fathers can and should be equal that rights and rights should be fundamental to foreign and that global warming was a reality why she and always has supported more by women than by more by voters of color than by white and more by scientists than creationists also why she is deeply and vehemently resented twitter concession know there have always been women who could have changed the game i was in college when chase smith became the first us senator to oppose the trump of his day she also became the first woman whose name was placed in nomination for the presidency by a major party yet that was as far as she got in i ran as a delegate pledged to congresswoman a candidate for the presidency though she was only on the ballot in 14 she spoke out against the and against racism and sexism in education and politics in the public she took the male sign off the white house truth is that for two and a half this country has excluded females of every race from its top also the of males who are or otherwise seen as needing an also the who identify as gay or and also the who afford to purchase a college degree there has been only one president who and none who was openly atheist or agnostic add this and been selecting our top leadership from of our talent at most we may be giving birth to but there will be years of labor to come why electing was such a crucial beginning we were rewarded by his intellect and gift for his cool head and warm heart i believe he will be remembered as a great yet was often paralyzed by corporate and religious powers that are deeply and and include a male cult of guns sometimes i thought if his opponents had cancer and had the they accept in public opinion issues were rarely supported by more than a third of the their representatives were elected and by unlimited corporate gerrymandering by state and low voter turnout they took and kept control of the once centrist republican party that had produced chase smith and was the first to support the equal rights we need to be aware that this obstructionist minority is still hooked on hierarchy and still opposed to issues of equality add the fact that many especially powerful seen a female authority since and they felt and regressed by the prospect of in the most powerful position in the world add those white who are about to become a minority for the first and are opposed to everything from birth control it lowers the white birthrate to immigration it have racial and religious of this is guilt they fear being treated as they have treated others there is hostility to and real economic all of which trump or exposed the result a being not negative almost every issue of equality now has majority support in public opinion ideas of race and gender are activism and are exposing the racial violence that has always been sexual assault from the campus to the military is no longer and very public misogyny has unified educated men and inspired activism the hill but deepened and multiplied trump has helped to expose desperation among those jobless and working poor who support him only because they oppose is also telling that the angry third or so of this nation are desperate enough to support a soft by stereotypical man like trump he inherited his has no athletic or military record and no financial success earned on his has cheated the white male constituency he now behaves as a sexual predator toward women that alpha males are supposed to and sports cotton candy hair and suit jackets that fly open to reveal a gelatinous mass though a word is supposed to be his his own lawyer is a believer in the big lie theory if you say something again and people will believe to paraphrase the great his every word is a including and at times like used to truth is revealing because trump came up through mainstream corporate media that depend on ratings and not through a political media must take responsibility and refuse to give the next despot the estimated in free exposure that was given to trump centrist republicans must also take back their shattered party from extremists and even in this we have to recognize that electing one president and nominating one potential female president was only a beginning we all will have to learn that the president can only hold a finger to the wind we must become the truth has been revealed the next few years are going to be hell we know from family violence the paradigm of all violence that in that the most dangerous time is the moment just before or just after escape this is when a person is most likely to be beaten or killed because she or he is escaping think this country is in a time of danger because most of us are escaping control by some of us just as we would never tell a man or child to stay in a violent we will never go back to the old hierarchy despite

rural areas they were setting off was not inevitable there is no doubt that who has more experience that almost any candidate was qualified to do the job she may yet win the popular vote the problem was she did not have the qualities to win an election she maintained the coalition of the minorities and the university educated but could not them in sufficient numbers where it even as many emerged

young son and wife in daughter and the rest of the brood surrogates and forming the 18 pundits have pontificated about whether trump would ever be able to be whether he would behave himself long enough to have a stab at winning the most powerful job and when the moment and he presented himself as us he did it in classic he appear presidential he rewrote the rulebook on what it is to be so twitter highlights from presidential victory he stuck to the and he read from his teleprompter but not many historic victory speeches made over the ages have begun to keep you waiting complicated business many have gone on to say of their vanquished rival that owe major debt of gratitude for her service to our having threatened to jail her on live just a month previously not many of the oval office have promised to our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the while at the same time being the first major party nominee since to refuse to disclose their tax was exactly the opposite of what was supposed to have happened from the vantage point of most pollsters and media outlets and political leaders of both main this was going to be night she certainly thought so what now looks like overweening confidence was built into the architecture of new where she was meant to celebrate victory under an elaborate ceiling composed of thousands of panes of glass an allusion to her 2008 concession the she even turn up was it a final lack of strength from a woman who has proven herself capable of withstanding the harshest knocks political stuff is and as trump put was it a loss of either sent in her place john the chair of her campaign who unwittingly played no small part in her demise as the subject of hacked her he delivered a pitiful appeal to the by now bedraggled democratic crowd to hang on in there through to the can wait a little but only for a little within half an the presidency had been called and hopes of highest office were dead forever twitter how the 2016 us election night was sublimely cruel for her that her hopes of finally breaking through that glass ceiling were dashed by a man for whom the first question put to him in a debate was why he had called women and and who just a month before the election was heard on a hot bragging about how he made uninvited sexual protests sparked across us by trump 's shock victory read then this election night will go down as a sublimely cruel occasion not just for but also for the 60 million who voted for her sometimes the election gods decide not just to inflict defeat on a party but to do so in the most agonizing like torturers playing with their so it comes to pass that 8 2016 goes into the annals as one of the most anguished experiences that one half of the people have ever been unfortunate

the long i have a lifelong republican who voted for am very disappointed about the but i be despondent i am by nature an optimistic person as the evening wore on and it became clear that trump was going to i started thinking about what is actually going to happen after this in the there will be dark and things will happen that are not good for our or for the world sure that the affordable care act for i believe that the republicans will start to realize that they really get what they wanted after a republican he has made that clear he just agrees with them on some or claims to i think the first half of term will go very badly for the voters will become and the midterm elections in 2018 will be disastrous for them democrats will probably end up with control of both houses of congress get a new supreme court but not worried about whether be too conservative i would be more worried that they be qualified in the long i have believe in checks and voted for voted shortly after polls open on and i voted for trump no disrespect intended to the third party but a vote for an alternate candidate is in reality a vote either trump or so i was faced with a vote for an incompetent or a crook i chose to vote for the incompetent in the end it the emails that sealed the deal it was the remaining hope that and would modify the impending chaos the system of checks and balances appears to be in position to better counter trump than trump has already lost substantial support among the so he count on either the existing supreme court or congress to ignore there is the press what we see is a press overwhelmingly a vote for means we can not count on the press to honestly and diligently keep the public informed of potential malfeasance nor at this point can we count on the institutions of government to counter in any meaningful way so i voted for the candidate likely to lead us into the weeds without establishment underestimated the voted for i think all astounded instead of predictable fifth facing nobody quite knows what i never thought this was a serious possibility until but the establishment apparently made a misjudgment in underestimating the rage after decades of being impoverished to benefit the since the primary was rigged against the only major this was the next prominent way to give the democrats a heave else refreshing to see their awfulness finally backfire on not exactly shocked at but dismayed that so many of my fellow citizens still refused to look outside the duopoly or help the greens reach federal funding levels the impetus is understandable this is a rejection of the status quo more than an actual endorsement of racism or but the forces unleashing are volatile and damn scary as the bigger struggle starts after voting positive change only comes from public so arguably a better chance for it now than under a democratic president if no actual policy coming from the oval space for saner voices to shape it be but at least the citizenry seems ready to seriously push back the campaign got younger voters surprisingly engaged and proved that candidates have to be owned by corporate money if enough remember the power lies with we may have a fighting chance after am ashamed of how this plays with the rest of the voted for lost this election because sexism enabled voters to perceive the most qualified candidate in the world as someone more reprehensible bar the most despicable person who has ever sought the presidency because the contingent of mostly white overlooked empathy for minority groups due to their own positions of privilege because of voter because we watched happen and refused to heed its am ashamed of how this plays with the rest of the world ashamed of my state in particular and dread what consequences it will bring the fallout of supreme court turnover alone will last long after his term is done it should go without saying that a president should not threaten the wellbeing of certain citizens as a main selling point in his and my heart goes out to any individual who feels unsafe i know the cold fear you are experiencing the only way we can think to proceed is to brace for a prolonged fight ahead of man slated to be president has built his platform on harming the vulnerable and shouting over the voices of the oppressed if you find this rhetoric if you are then seize any opportunity to defy it do not wait to speak out until they come for you to your loss is the loss i am sorry they were too blind to see waking up to today scares voted for my wildest dreams i never would have thought the public would swing so wildly away from reason as to elect someone like trump i grew up in a family a liberal but my father was conservative been a single mom working multiple jobs to keep a roof over my head and struggled to make ends meet as long as i can remember i understand the feeling that represent the but the waking up to today scares me and left with only kind of world will my grandson grow up what will happen to friends and people of color who unlike born here someone once called it my how could it be a good idea to elect a man who treats women so makes promises he has no interest in learning the nuances of and brags about not paying why does the public react so negatively to a woman taking a role of where is the critical decency and respect have gone out the door in this election and just sold our collective soul to the country split in two and at rock new voted for in the morning and sick to my stomach as i type this the racist won the misogynist won the xenophobe won i guess the moral of the story trust the not even and experts beyond my station will be dissecting this for years to come and there will be questions how did the republican party allow that reprobate to hijack did the media in their quest for ratings become unwitting dupes providing thousands of hours of free and unfiltered missing opportunity after opportunity to fact the blame game to commence and plenty of blame to go around as for i blame the democratic party i blame i blame the republican party has become the party of fascists the democratic party has become the new republican party the faction that sanders represented was the electrified the energized faction and with good reason single payer raising the minimum climate tuition free state colleges and a variety of other progressive issues resonated with and the working class unfortunate that version of progressive populism never had a opportunity to go to head to head with regressive at best personified my or at most cynical least not so many voters actually they were clearly that so here we are the unthinkable for at least half the country has a trump presidency the severity of this situation be understated a country split in two and at rock bottom if a if if if if a member of community if white working class and been put on notice the next four years will be

despite a lack of political business magnate trump swept to an improbable victory in the us presidential is clear that despite a series of his message resonated with a huge number of voters in key and revealed deep anger and trump wins us to deliver concession speech live read spoke to six trump voters about why they voted for the republican and why they think make a good want the legacy continued in the white is a man regardless of getting a hefty loan from his he used that money to make a name and legacy for himself i hope that experience as a businessman will enable our country to operate more effectively when it comes to managing our money i want to change to serve the people instead of a political system that wants to serve itself my life change except i will have more hope that my government is trying to make our country strong instead of pandering to its own liberal interests my main hope is that he will help balance our and secondly that he will help our economy to remain want the legacy continued in the white house we impeached one and there is too much scandal that revolves around the other why would i want that legacy in my he may say controversial but at least he tells you what he thinks i certainly disagree with anyone that has behaved in a racist or sexist way i feel like i know where i stand with trump he says what he right or and i know what dealing so tired of the media and democrats bellyaching about trump getting voted in what the people pretty sad when all you hear is gloom and doom on the which i thought was supposed to be a balanced representation of the two sides there is a whole other part to this country outside of your newsroom walls that actually thinks differently from the mostly liberal ideas that most news outlets put out there we are middle we are the hardworking people who are holding this country together with our and we are ready to have a country that keeps its book in balance like we do with our private bank accounts small business owner knows how to make deals that will make prosperous was a democrat for 39 but my children and grandchildren need an that is out of debt all that did was double the debt since he took office i will feel a whole lot safer than i ever would with the biggest question is to ask why he kept sending troops and flooding us with refugees that are not vetted for the proper amount of time with the possibility of terrorists mixing in and coming to our my great nephew is still asking that question as he did two tours in he got out because he felt the president care about him or his comrades we have the greatest veterans in the i am one of them the last two presidents care about what happened to us created but minimum wage jobs you support a family on a minimum wage our manufacturing plants are the coal industry is gone from my area and would just shut it down the rest of the way is a failure thank god i have to use it but there are families that need it and if they afford it they get fined that in itself is the mindset of a dictator was going to expand it and make it available for illegals believe trump will be a good president because he knows how to make deals that will make prosperous again we need to bring our nation together i like the fact that all three branches are controlled by the same now we can get down to the business of straightening out our taking care of our our getting the economy moving again and repealing retired from the federal government twitter how the 2016 us election night want conservative cried when i left the polling location because i like trump at all i was deeply saddened to vote for him his his mannerisms and his inexperience repulse me i wish there had been another conservative choice without simply throwing away my vote i know if i travel outside of the us i will be deeply disliked because of him he is only a investment and i am trusting in the checks and balances of our country to prevent him and his from damaging the country too much hopefully trump will not affect my daily personally do not have a gun but i strongly support the right to bear arms it as a right that ensures protection from government tyranny i am also against has the opportunity to elect a supreme court maybe even two or three members considering the current health and age of some justices justices serve for a lifetime and i do not want the justices to be liberal i want conservative laws therefore conservative justices i can deal with a somewhat low four but i deal with a supreme court that swings liberal and i deal with losing gun rights i hope the years fly by and that he will do as little damage as possible i am deeply saddened by these options and i am not proud of our president in the least is exactly what you with you know decide who to vote for until the day before voting it was one the hardest decisions i have ever made i decided on trump for one zones guaranteed full scale war with on day one i mean how do you expect to initiate a zone over a sovereign that would then in turn guarantee a conflict with which will assuredly lead to know would have been business as usual as we ever closer to a nuclear war with four years is a long time but there is always and the next election a risk but one the people are willing to take previously voted and now trump i hope for a sincere and a breath of fresh air trump is a slimy who wears it like a badge of but trump is exactly what you is a phantom and you know real about her fainting in new saying it was heat when it was a mild then saying it was pneumonia finally lying about her may be laughing at us but it took some balls to elect trump last night i think a single person who casted a vote for him felt good about it i sure but felt like there was no other choice it was either trump or guaranteed war i think trump knows he is but i sincerely think he will fill his cabinet with people who perform their functions effectively his legacy is banking on this and right now it secure because the whole even are laughing when they say trump won sincerely hard to believe i feel would have been business as she would have had nothing but political software engineer has put a wedge between the people of this first woman president should have integrity and that historic moment should not be tainted by someone like trump might not have political experience but i truly believe he has the interest at need to bring jobs back to our make the economy stronger and hopefully unite all people i feel has put a wedge between the people of this country we should be looked at as individual merits and not by the of our take nonsense from anyone and he have any special interest he has to make happy for the new trump the dream is understands and supports the no matter what you have if you work hard you can better yourself and positively shape your wealth and future made it known that she would continue agenda of redistribution what dream is there in working to see your future gains chopped up by taxation and under i would have just held out my hand and stopped dreaming under trump the dream is i may not like the trump he shows his buddies in the locker i may not agree with his insolence or his private life with but i agree with his platform and passion he gets things done and his drive is proven he fails and he fails voted for trump to keep the minimum wage hike retain our constitutional gun and keeping close to the constitution and immigration i can now start planning my next boutique without the threat of a minimum wage hike i can afford to get sick while working 60 hours a week to get my business off the ground the fear of the threat will lessen trump is a businessman he will pave the way for me to start dreaming again until this election i was independent this election i declared myself republican for the first time my friends are mostly liberal democrats they say the poorest republican they know i hope that the silent majority stops being bullied by the loud minority trump promises to rebuild our army and fight for our i look to see terrorism defeated and the war on cops to a solid declaration of war on and a halt to the preference of immigrants before citizens i hope welfare will be scaled back and employment will once again become the preferred way to support cried when i heard trump won there is once again hope for the small business elections on on via on on on on on this content

president changed trump trump could be as when he was getting his own said but the electoral campaign showed what he could be like when he was facing news says mp about the result 2016 government departments have form for using big news like the us presidential as cover for the release of potentially embarrassing information and true to departments are releasing information about the and special gifts and have not gone through the but i will let you know if anything good crops up the prime has recorded a clip for the broadcasters about election she essentially just read with minor the statement she issued earlier it was not an but she did take one question on reporter asked may if she thought trump was a fit person to be given what he said in the campaign about and about his plans and would may be able to work with she i look forward to working with trump the people have elected him as the next president of the united states and the united states share values of freedom and democracy and enterprise and i look forward to building on the special relationship we have between our two countries to ensure the security and prosperity of our two nations in the future by when the commented on election earlier she managed to combine an ostensibly friendly message of support with an implicit rebuke to trump for the stance he took during the campaign on matters like diversity and the rule of law not torturing wood dignified principled statement on the us election result from the new leader of the free contrast is quite sent out a signal that she would be willing to challenge trump in of some of the key values of may mean may may feel just as strongly about equality etc as she most probably does but she has evidently decided that is not in her or the interests to go public on these concerns at this stage that is not particularly given the obsession successive governments have had with maintaining close ties with but may could find that on this she is out of step with public opinion may sky news the north east of is famous for its parochial newspaper headlines most journalists have heard the story about how the journal covered the sinking of the titanic under the headline man lost at even though recent research established that it never used those words and that this is just a journalist myth or the tradition continues here is the lead story on the observer website grateful to for the headline observer this is from in the leadership to trump president elect his acceptance speech was a measured call for unity bodes well for the 2016 in a post on his only claims policy platform is much more centrist than people think who is much more liberal and than the says he thinks trump could end up persuading congress to adopt a new big government an extract in his acceptance the talked about new infrastructure creating new jobs that idea is reminiscent of the in that is it harks back to new throughout the trump has drawn policies from both left and right he has taken protectionism from the and a tougher stance on immigration from the republicans he has attacked political at the same ignored much of the socially conservative culture war he has pledged to cut but not to cut might explain how trump has managed to do what no other republican presidential candidate has done since the run the table across the rust belt danger is having promised presidency just brings more of the same borrowing to fund infrastructure and entitlements will come at a huge cost stimulus usually produce the kind of sustainable economic boom trump has promised at it for for that the irony is after years of gridlock between the president and it could be the man democrats despise more than any other who enables bipartisanship with trump in the white republicans in congress may end up backing a agenda similar to the one they have trenchantly opposed for much of the last eight years here is is more reaction to victory from the shadow business lewis mp u think now might be the time to show a little humility how the contributed to this the shadow justice mp worrying that trump given what he has said and given what he has done elected as leader of the most powerful country on mp what it 's some of my thoughts on trump being elected as president of the united states of managed to stop celebrating to congratulate trump who would have thought we 'd have a us president closer to the than who challenged for the leadership in the smith pen and the only international voices to congratulate trump to date no further comment late governor said campaign in poetry we govern in trump campaigned in bigotry how will he founder of the group trump video but so easy to see why it resonated much of it would have done for as candidate whose mp wife was killed in the summer during the cox i talked about winning what we would do right now she 'd say reassert what we hold in year has set out a generational challenge to everything we thought was ahead for ourselves and our families 2016
the unthinkable is only unthinkable until it happens like the sack of it can seem historically inevitable so it is with the global political earthquake that is the election of trump as the next president of the united states if he is true to his campaign which were many and win will herald most stunning reversal of political and economic orthodoxy since the new deal in the but with the opposite intention and effect it halts the ailing progressive narrative about modern and the world in its tracks it signals a seismic rupture in the global liberal economic and political order that had seemed to command the 21st century after communism collapsed and economy that the trump triumph has echoes of the increasingly alarming general rightward shift in the politics of other western to which progressives have again produced inadequate responses the parallel with vote is obvious and real is the further boost that the trump triumph may hand to nationalists in many parts of marine pen jumped quickly on that bandwagon the result will be lamented by liberals across and beyond but it will be cheered in and which will feel emboldened this is not a good week to be a or a and another dire one to be a the result is also a generational challenge to progressive politics to find the radical and credible message that eludes them in so many not just in taken this is primarily an catastrophe that has brought upon itself when it came to the us was unable to find a credible way of rallying against trump and what he represents failed that crucial test both in herself and in what she for her this is the end but she was the not the cause trump was not taken seriously and was widely not expected to beat throughout the bitter campaign at each his candidacy was deemed certain to crash and burn the opinion polls and the vaunted probability calculus rarely trended in his both are now discredited only after the less than two weeks before the was it widely imagined that the tables might turn in nevertheless by the eve of poll trump was again the trump won big in an election if the exit polls were most people made up their minds long before the furore victory was total it was more than anything on the white irrespective of age or white people mostly voted for him it was the most stunning upset in modern us not even a squeaker he won most of the battleground states into which the campaign had poured money north and en route to a decisive republican electoral college total exceeding 300 that majority is on the flyover which inhabitants of the big democratic bastions on the coasts often only see from 35 , 000 feet but the red tide pushed north deep into the and consolidated in the south although the electoral college system amplified is set to win the popular as democrats have in every election bar one since republican congressional candidates who had scrabbled to put distance between themselves and their nominee after the ugly debates found themselves riding to victory on coattails republicans held most of their seats in the senate and will be the chance to extend their majority in when the beneficiaries of the wave of 2012 face the voters more the house remained firmly in republican hands speaker and his lieutenants have more to fear from their own party grassroots and from a perhaps vengeful new man in the white house than they do from the shattered for whom this outcome is the sum of all trump is the shock heard round the world now that he has the instant explanations have already started to flood that the of this or that demographic was that he tapped the angry that he spoke for millions who felt abandoned by the prosperous and that was always far stronger than liberals wanted to that he was a celebrity candidate for the that he rode the tiger of that making great again was a message in a militaristic and imperial that white men many white had had it with political that misogyny swung that the mainstream media failed to call him that it is a verdict on the that was always the wrong that there was racist dirty work in the voting that it was the who won it for him twitter highlights from presidential victory of these explanations are irrelevant all of them have something to say but beware of instant certainties as with in the immediate aftermath of a huge a period of careful and reflection is in order this is not to diminish the immense seriousness of what happened on nor is it to understate the anxieties about what lies ahead as steps back and trump takes particular fears now stand out the first is the unleashing of an unbridled conservative agenda in now that the republicans control the white house and capitol hill a rare thing in the past hundred years in her dignified concession speech rightly the need to defend democratic she might have drawn attention to president legacy on and climate change too trump and the congressional republicans have he is more prepared to use the power of government than many of them are but they have a clear path now towards reshaping the supreme court and dozens of judicial benches in their own image the effect on gender and issues is likely to outlast period in office the culture wars will reopen abortion rights are second is the impact of this result on race in more widely trump campaigned against migrants and against insulted black and launched ads that some saw as covertly and was cheered to victory by every white racist in the land his voters a echo again will want him to deliver every action he takes in this area threatens to divide and inflame after a of uneven but undeniable racial progress in the consequences of every attempt to turn back the clock could be third fear is whether trump has any economic plan that will deliver for some of the poor communities that gave him their votes so solidly trump connected with the anger that many poor and white voters feel but what can he really do about what do most congressional republicans care about he can try to put up all the protectionist walls he likes that will please his supporters but it is difficult to see how he can bring old mills and factories back to life a lot of feel left behind and let down trump is playing with fire in the it becomes clear that he has used their anxieties to again advance himself and the urban rich class to which he final and overarching is for the world win means uncertainty about future strategy in a world that has long relied on the united states for stability but capacity to is almost limitless his environmental and trade policies all have the capacity to change the world for the worse have done a very dangerous thing this week because of what they have done we all face uncertain and fearful on on via on on on on on this content

race and sex stoke deep responses in the years ago the great oral historian studs recounted a story told to him by a woman been molested by a relative as a child tried to tell her mother but no one would believe her yet one day when she was shopping with her mother and they spotted a black man far away on the other side of the department store the women gathered the girl close to worrying aloud about the unbridled lust that that man might toward little white girls the woman told even as a young she could see the craziness in that they could not see or hear that she was being assaulted by a member of the but instead their anxiety against the distant figure of a black man obliviously going about his have been thinking about that story quite a bit in recent as pondered the phenomenon of peculiar appeal to any but especially a particular stratum of conservative women particularly intrigued by women who worry aloud about his extreme or misogyny or careless grasp of foreign affairs yet who then say that what really drives their allegiance is of the supposedly murderous and licentious this is often expressed as a repulsion so strong like the little mother and they are willing to give uncle a pass in the face of multiple allegations of sexual breathtaking unprecedented verbal incoherence and the intensity of vitriol directed at still mystifies me to a great story reminds me that there is an affective dynamic to all an emotional narrative that may make sense in an alternate universe from which i may be functionally excluded race and sex stoke deep autonomic responses in the psyche trump began his political career more than 20 years ago by taking out a ad in the new calling for the execution of five teenagers wrongly accused of raping and beating a young white stockbroker

have plenty to fear read throughout the trump has evoked old tropes of a ravaged endlessly at risk from thugs and terrorists with endorsements from the likes of the and trump has a narrative of warrior masculinity that dates back to film birth of a nation the trope of pugilistic white vigilantes fighting against lying and libertine black invaders black voters in that in order to protect the of frightened white women it seems not insignificant that trump has consistently appeared with a backdrop of attentive beautiful women who smile and wave and whom he symbolically shelters from rapists

a new lesson for and based on the tenacious nature of an all too familiar lesson for wish she had won always easier to move forward with the wind at your back than it is to advance into a strong especially one that seemingly hates your guts once again facing the sobering reality that the battle for fairness and decency starts anew each day but i also know that this is one election along the difficult path of protecting and deepening democracy commitments to civility and fairness are hallmarks of strong democracies and in my we have made progress i am committed to the promise of and now that this nasty campaign is i will continue to fight for my democracy simply too much at stake not victory is the last gasp of a desperate white morning i interviewed who was born before women had the right to vote in the us had the chance to vote for a woman who looked likely to become left that interview exhilarated about how much rights had progressed in lifetime exhilaration was in the air in new the ultimate glass ceiling was about to be shattered there was an intoxicating sense that women could achieve anything we wanted now that the future was than 24 hours later voted an unqualified misogynist who has spoken about women by the into the white house women can do anything we want it unless we aim too can run for president but be indulged in the not actively supported we can rack up decades of experience and have it in seconds we can speak up about sexual assault and then see our alleged assailant elected into the highest office in the besets us but the us must live up to its role in the world read win has trained a spotlight on the extent of the misogyny that runs through it also reveals just how far rights have how much has been how threatened the denizens of a fading feel victory is the last gasp of a desperate white patriarchy may have lost the election but that mean women lost on morning our fight but we also need to be careful not to frame victory as a case of men versus women exit polls show that the majority of white women voted for trump it seems that upholding white privilege is a bigger priority for many women in than protecting legislation that gives them control over their own if win has taught us one thing that we need to stop talking about we need to stop pretending that women in are a homogeneous group with the same privileges and priorities feminism is meaningless unless we talk about feminism women of who should feel the angriest today women of who have been most let down and women of who have the most to every freedom that women have fought for is now under do we tell our daughters about the the big girls who sat up waiting to see the sexist get his or the little ones who we told would see the first female president of do we tell them this role is still beyond the reach of any that no woman can meet the standards that are required of qualified woman with flaws has lost to a man whose tax avoidance and sexual assault allegations are not flaws enough to bar him from the nor indeed massive support was a prose not enough poetry trump even do just won now we organize to block every step of the way read through the night i heard say people respond negatively to women seeking power they hold them to higher standards trump dispensed with standards altogether women function to service as possessions their bodies are not autonomous he needs no consent to grope them this is what your daughters will see now that a man with the lowest possible opinion of women has been elected to the highest office this is what your sons will you are a powerful man in you can treat women like refuse them the right to make decisions on reproductive basically consider lives lesser than yours the patriarchy is fully restored and some women helped restore some women voted for possibly two thirds of white women for the misogyny around came from all the fans who would not vote for the many men of the left who said there was little difference between and trump because rights are low down in their list of priorities male privilege spoke on the left and the silver charts show that if only women would have won easily the rage of men is so they will unite around this inadequate narcissist to move back out of the dark ages we are going to need girls and boys to go back to to break up this band of old rich white men who have battered the soul of however heartbroken women it is they who now have to pick up the pieces it is they who have to fight for themselves because every freedom they have fought for is now under

things he congratulated trump he had to he offered the best wishes he thanked president for his leadership he reassured the public on the us alliance he essentially said the alliance would outlive any

seen the most extraordinary transformation in living standards in human i have great confidence that all our engagement will continue to be strong and intimate let me say that i understand that have been confronted by the intensity of the political battle in the united states trump himself described it as being at times a nasty and it was certainly by our bitter one you have seen already the way he reached out to bring together and the people do fight their political contests hard but this great nation of the united states has the capacity to come together and it behind the behind the that they have chosen is making a short statement about the trump victory shortly he will take no questions underestimating quiet and shy trump voters 2016 tony should continue to have no better friend than 2016 tony to the new president who appreciates that middle is sick of being taken for 2016 mike is speaking we are the oz we expect and bill shorten to comment shortly the appears what seen tonight in the united states presidential election is shocking and disappointing an president has been elected on a platform of xenophobia and nationalism i expected more from our cousins they have let us down the following weeks and months will reveal what leaders across the world will be wondering if the moment is truly over if what will replace the true strength of democracy comes from all of us respecting the will of the regardless of the decisions that they make the darkest moments provide us the opportunity to test the strength of our and our commitment to them we cannot retreat from democracy out of fear and anger we turn a sober eye to our alliance and consider whether it continues to serve our are bound to respect the outcome of a democratic but we are not bound to any country which does not reflect our values and markets have been severely rattled by results people across and the world have been rattled by these results but now more than in light of everything seen in the united we must work to defend the values that underpin our great democracy i am confident that we will do just that everyone is out for a frolic has helpfully sent out his thoughts as was on display with the us election result shows that commentators and activists were out of touch with everyday people while the media and commentators fell over themselves to write trump trump remained focused on his trump tapped into a widespread disaffection with the politically correct are many lessons to be learned from both and the us election on which the media and might like to the election analyst green has called the us election for trump there are the current 259 for the if you give the 279 and they can quote that we think the republicans will win as well so got two paths but associated press

it is one of the most astonishing victories in political history it will leave millions in the us and beyond in wondering what is to and how did trump do was the first reality star and the first since to win the nomination for president of a major political party he was the first to spend part of his campaign denying sexual assault allegations and clashing with the family of a fallen soldier and a miss universe at he is the oldest person in history to be elected us simple copied and recast promise to make great again in four words it captured both pessimism and both fear and hope the slogan harks back to a supposed golden age of greatness the or the and implies that it has been lost but then promises to restore it it went straight to the unlike rival website manifesto and more nuanced was an appeal to the not the in a country where patriotism should never be a host on said in lot of this support for with all his flaws which he displays is about the country patriotic feelings people they feel like the country has been let down our elite leaders on issues like they regulate any immigration it seems they regulate trade to our to the working man or working advantage they take us into stupid wars their kids fight but our kids trump wins presidential plunging us into uncertain future read patriotic they believe in their country is deep sense that the country is being taken away and betrayed i think that is so deep with people that looking at a guy flawed as hell like trump and at least a way of saying i am really angry about the way the elite has treated my country and so deep that it overwhelms all the bad stuff from trump that strong a strong force 2003 trump became the host of the reality show the in which hopefuls competed for a chance to work for his for a decade millions of viewers were fed the idea of trump as a successful a boss with the power to biographer gave him 10 years of being in front of the public being the being hiring famously firing being the guy who can fix the one who knows being the big authoritarian patriarchal lost the the trust and a weak message read think that has imprinted on a lot of that they that that makes him that combined with the reality phenomenon in which it became acceptable to have something that really true it a kind of a thing and shifted our idea of an acceptable version of the media trump had accumulated not only financial capital but celebrity capital on 8 he cashed in twitter victory speech in full he faced a candidate whose unpopularity rating was surpassed only by his own as the wife of a former

at work that not even and the democrats could long political career also came with most notably the investigation into her use of private email server when she was secretary of state she was judged to have been and the issue flared up again in late when the said it uncovered a new batch of emails the whiff of scandal persisted despite his decision to clear her again just over a week later historians are likely to debate how crucial director intervention was in tilting the race when set against her own failings as a politician twitter bizarre road to the campaign in three republican seemingly declared war on his own party during and after a traumatic primary he attacked the bush house speaker former nominees mitt and john and many more it was anything but a united front and it would normally have cost him in terms of a lack of or financial many trump voters relished his attacks on the party establishment they complained the the members of congress they elected made promises they fail to keep they noticed the years of deadlock and government shutdown and thirsted for change so when and company condemned it actually worked to his advantage as a rallying point for his supporters he ripped up the rule book as the maverick outsider set to march on at the the republican national committee never lost faith in him chair was quick to declare trump the nominee and twist and turn and excuse his every chief strategist and communications director aggressively pushed the trump cause even as pieces of debris flew off in every the party machinery kept working to deliver

held the white house for eight years would have been the first candidate since bush in 1988 to extend one hold for a third term even high approval rating evidently did not dim the appetite for his direct mastermind of election wrote in the new times last presidential elections are shaped by perceptions of the style and personality of the outgoing incumbent voters rarely seek the replica of what they have they almost always seek the the candidate who has the personal qualities the public finds lacking in the departing republicans view dimly the very qualities that played so well for in 2008 deliberation is seen as patience as weakness his call for tolerance and passionate embrace of growing diversity inflame many in the republican who view with suspicion and anger the rapidly changing demographics of the emphasis on diplomacy is viewed as who among the republicans is more the antithesis of than the racism and was wildly there was outrageous and offensive statements that alienated disabled people believers in constitutional democracy in any normal such a volatile package would have been disqualifying but while those voices were amplified in the there were plenty of people who agreed with him some could not stomach the idea of a female president some proved that racism has not withered but rather in some cases has since the election of the first majority of white including three in four of white evangelical protestants said society has changed for the worse since the in a recent survey by the public religion research was the ultimate protest vote with obvious echoes of told meet the press in the across the i understand why a lot of people are angry and they see trump as their human cocktail that they get to go into the voting booth on 8 and throw him into our

a month ago i tried to write a column proposing mean nicknames for on the basis that it would be funny to turn the tables on him for the cruel diminutives he applied to pull it off there is a darkness about trump that negates that sort of a folly so an incompetence so profound that no insult could plumb its has run one of the lousiest presidential campaigns ever in saying so i am not referring to his business practices or his vulgar remarks about women i mean this in a purely technical this man fractured his own party his convention was a fiasco he had no ground game to speak of the list of celebrities and pundits and surrogates taking his side on the campaign trail was extremely short he needlessly offended countless groups of disabled mothers of crying the bush and among others he even lost for now he is going to be president of the united states the woman we were constantly assured was the candidate of all time has lost to the least qualified candidate of all time everyone who was anyone rallied around and it make any difference the man too incompetent to insult is now going to sit in the oval whence he will hand down his verdicts on the grandees and sages of the old there is a bright side to a trump victory after there was a reason that tens of millions of good people voted for him and maybe he will live up to their high regard for him he has pledged to the of and maybe he will sincerely tackle that task he has promised to renegotiate and maybe will finally come to pass maybe win so much for us he once predicted in a campaign that get sick of not deceive ourselves we going to win anything what happened on is a both for liberalism and for the world as president trump goes about settling scores with his former picking fights with other and unleashing his special deportation police on this group and we will all soon have cause to regret his ascension to the presidential throne what we need to focus on now is the obvious what the hell went what species of guided our democratic leaders as they went about losing what they told us was the most important election of our at the top she has an impressive she worked hard on the campaign trail but she was exactly the wrong candidate for this populist moment an insider when the country was screaming for an outsider a technocrat who offered when the country wanted to take a sledgehammer to the machine twitter victory speech in was the democratic candidate because it was her turn and because a victory would have moved every democrat in up a notch whether or not she would win was always a secondary something that was taken for granted had winning been the number one several more suitable candidates were ready to go there was with his powerful plainspoken and there was an inspiring and largely figure each of them would probably have beaten but neither of them would really have served the interests of the party so democratic leaders made their candidate even though they knew about her closeness to the her fondness for and her unique vulnerability on the trade issue each of which trump exploited to the fullest they chose even though they knew about her private email server they chose her even though some of those who studied the foundation suspected it was a sketchy try to put over such a nominee while screaming that the republican is a monster is to court disbelief if trump is a as liberals often democrats should have put in their strongest player to stop not a party hack chosen because it was her turn choosing her indicated either that democrats mean what they said about that their opportunism took precedence over the or maybe supporters among the media help either it always struck me as strange that such an unpopular candidate enjoyed such robust and unanimous endorsements from the editorial and opinion pages of the but it was the quality of the enthusiasm that really harmed her with the same arguments repeated over and two or three times a with nuance and contrary views all the act of opening the newspaper started to feel like tuning in to a cold war propaganda station what it consisted was virtually without flaws she was a peerless leader clad in saintly a a caring benefactor of women and a warrior for social scandals real the economy was doing well was already people supporting if they it was only because they were botched humans racism was the only conceivable reason for lining up with the republican candidate how did the crusade the fourth estate came together in an unprecedented professional consensus they chose insulting the other side over trying to understand what motivated them they transformed opinion writing into a vehicle for high moral boasting what could possibly have gone wrong with such an put this question in slightly more general terms and you are confronting the single great mystery of 2016 the class just spent the year rallying around a professional really all that and either insulting or silencing everyone who accept their assessment and then they lost maybe time to consider whether something about shrill shouted from a position of high social that turns people even larger problem is that there is a kind of chronic complacency that has been rotting liberalism for a hubris that tells democrats they need do nothing they need deliver nothing really to anyone except their friends on the jet and those nice people at the rest of us are treated as though we have nowhere else to go and no role to play except to vote enthusiastically on the grounds that these democrats are the thing between us and the end of the world it is a liberalism of the it has failed the middle and now it has failed on its own terms of enough with these comfortable democrats and their cozy system enough with and its

preparing the ground one senior diplomat told the guardian the guidelines would be a trade off between speed and the guidelines remain flexible they are easier to if they are very they are likely to take more diplomats are keenly following fallout in the some say they have been shocked by the media response to the high court decision on role and the limited of judges the welsh law officer has strongly the attacks on the high court and explained why he wants to be able to make representations at the supreme court member counsel general for said the had been deliberately misrepresented by some he there are those who have deliberately chosen to misrepresent the facts to challenge the independence of the one of the cornerstones of our democratic parliamentary system the reporting of this judgment in some newspapers was frankly a disgrace and an insult to the good name of democratic structure of the and indeed this assembly is built on a foundation of the rule of law and the independence of our judicial system the tragic recent history of is littered with examples of countries that overthrew the rule of law and undermined the independence of the courts that road is not a democratic one and leads only in one direction i would hope those who may have made comments and statements in will want to to the assembly in why he wants to appear in person at the supreme court i consider that this case raises issues of profound importance not only in relation to the concept of parliamentary sovereignty but also in relation to the wider constitutional arrangements of the united kingdom and the legal framework for think it is of paramount importance to at this point that despite the political furore surrounding it and the frankly alarming tone of much of the press as the high court itself this case involves a pure question of law it is not concerned with the merits and demerits of leaving the union and the politics surrounding sole legal question at issue is whether the government can as a matter of constitutional law use the prerogative powers to give notice of withdrawal from the union in seeking to intervene in any the welsh government will seek to reinforce the importance of parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of established principles of constitutional that the welsh government was not seeking to reverse the result of the referendum he having outlined what the case is about i should also make a comment on what it is not about the first minister has made crystal clear and i repeat that sentiment the welsh government respects the result of the referendum and this is absolutely not about overturning that decision the legal commentator has posted a good story on his page he says that the lord chancellor and justice is being sued by six high court judges for age discrimination two of the judges are also claiming sexual discrimination and racial discrimination is an extract from post all the claims relate to reduced benefits the judges can expect to receive under a new judicial pension scheme introduced last hearing has been arranged before a tribunal judge who is not affected by the new pension arrangements there could be further hearings before appeal thought to be unprecedented for serving judges to sue the lord chancellor and the ministry of justice turning back to the ifs report this is interesting a table showing how many of the fiscal targets set by the treasury since 1997 have been met success and failure of treasury fiscal targets since 1997 ifs counts 12 targets in and concludes that only two of them have been hit both were rolling targets that did not involve balancing the budget in a given but setting plans that involved balancing the current budget over a and then later a timetable that may sound like but the ifs commends this approach only two targets managed to be met that is the coalition initial target to aim for a balance on the current budget five years out and its subsequent revised target to aim to achieve this three years out it is perhaps not a coincidence that these two targets also had much to commend them in contrast the other targets either had more thresholds that were more arbitrary did the cycle start and of should debt definitely fall between two future points in should welfare spending definitely be below some fixed were not sufficiently flexible in the face of adverse fiscal shocks must there be an overall surplus in must borrowing in be no more than half what it was in the weaknesses of these other targets often meant that their abandonment was preferable than trying slavishly to adhere to them here are some more pictures from tour today may stands amidst priests after offering prayers to the deity lord during a visit to temple in images may

a report into the met investigation into an alleged ring has identified 43 most grave failings identified included officers misleading a judge to get search believing the complainant known as nick for too publicly stating the allegations were credible and true and not closing the investigation main whose allegations led to the met investigation has been referred for criminal investigation the only as nick will be investigated by police regarding an allegation of perverting the course of justice five police officers have been referred to the police the including asst commissioner the senior officer in investigation released a statement saying he did not believe he or any of his officers in operation midland had committed any met accepted there had been and publicly to lord and who were among those accused he also to lady the widow of who was also accused proctor said that he had accepted apology but lamented the impact on his life and that of his friends and warned that the report could prevent victims coming forward in future proctor said he has accepted an apology from but that the inquiry had had an irreversible impact on his family and friends without i accepted an unreserved apology from sir the police in respect of operation i have informed him the detrimental impact of the investigation on the life of my friends and myself was irreversible this apology does not detract from the adverse effect and hurt of operation midland on my life and me personally i hope the police in such cases in future will always test the credibility of a complainant before someone is thrust into the public my efforts in challenging the metropolitan police service from the beginning over 18 months ago have not been for selfish reasons but in the hope that anybody now and in the future can be spared the trauma that i have experienced regret that it has taken someone in a albeit to make an but it is a moral victory for all potential defendants from all walks of life i am proud of the little role i have played i hope the police will learn from so the glaring mistakes identified from operation midland will not be repeated i have always had huge respect for the policing of our and admiration for the work police officers do this is undiminished i hope the home office will look at these matters carefully and bring forward proposals to amend the current system where a even a fantasist and can be given life long anonymity and financially benefit while the alleged suspect is routinely fingered and named by the police and in my case left destitute proctor the has expressed fears the report could prevent victims coming spokeswoman for the charity lessons must be learned from this sorry and it is extremely disappointing that this report has not been published in full it takes unimaginable bravery for victims to come forward we are concerned that this recommendations could undermine the confidence of victims to do and we cannot allow it to result in a return to the dark days when we looked the other way and failed to confront the horrors of abuse and bring those responsible to justice it makes very difficult reading for the metropolitan who despite good intentions at the failed to admit they had got it wrong when it became clear that the allegations were closure of the investigation amid immense media fanfare did a huge disservice to those who have been abused in and risked denting the willingness to take action to protect children said it was that the government would pass an anonymity before charge because it would enrage tabloid editors the government should pass an anonymity before arrest he said in another recommendation which will be challenged by some in the says police should not release any details such as age or where a suspect lives to the press or the public before an search or interview of a suspect at the age and the town where a suspect lives is often disclosed to the media also reviewed another operation an inquiry into a separate allegation that lord raped a woman the retired judge found it a grave error of and it was while the peer was still alive that there was not enough evidence to charge him he it was also manifest that he was very poorly i am in no doubt that he should have been informed during his lifetime that no action would be response met commissioner sir said the case against should been told before he died that the cps full code test had not been met and that there was no intention to prosecute pa deputy assistant commissioner the senior officer in charge of operation is one of five officers referred to police the in the light of has responded in a statement he i do not believe that or indeed any officer within operation have committed any misconduct while it is right that lessons should be learned from operation midland i want to that my colleagues and i investigated the allegations made with the best of intentions indeed i am grateful that sir himself recorded that the operation midland officers this investigation in a conscientious manner and with propriety and if a further investigation is required then i of continue fully to with it recommendation 10 of the report a suspect should have the right to anonymity prior to arrest enforced by statute and criminal sanctions this tallies with what himself has previously called for a spokesperson for the mayor of who has the power to sack the commissioner and instigate met said that a series of extremely serious errors were made by the met which threaten the trust of in its police force it is absolutely vital that victims of rape and sexual assault feel confident to come forward and report crimes and that all allegations are treated seriously by the met office for policing and will work closely with the met and other key agencies to ensure victims are always fully supported when they report a crime the mayor will now be seeking full assurances from the met commissioner on the consistency of the quality of the investigations into sexual and guarantees that the failings of past investigations will not be repeated the complainant referred for criminal investigation is whose allegations initiated operation police have confirmed the met said it has referred an allegation of attempting to pervert the course of justice to police the report says that the investigation could have been carried out without those accused by nick learning of said the principal cause of the mistakes in operation midland was the decision to search several which it described as grave error of found these searches were carried out there were no reasonable grounds to believe an indictable had been applications for search warrants had several inaccuracies these naming lord as one of the owners of a property as he was this was stating that nick had remained a witness who is telling the errors identified in the report included police seizing property not by the warrant which was not copied and returned but kept for officers also confirmed the location of the searches to the loss of of those who had been accused failing to supply a tasked with assessing with all the relevant information and rejecting the views of another consultant psychologist as relying instead on the views of without evaluating her qualifications or experience the met has said it is referring the conduct of five officers to the independent police complaints commission in the light of the report one of them is a deputy assistant deputy chair we were advised earlier today that the metropolitan police is to refer the conduct of five ranging in rank from sergeant to deputy assistant to the in relation to operation midland we understand the conduct of a deputy assistant commissioner will also be referred to the regarding a different have assembled an assessment team to relevant documentation to be supplied by the and provide me with a recommendation once i receive that i will decide whether there will be an investigation if what form that investigation will take i am aware of the significant public interest in these matters and i will announce that decision once i have made it and all concerned parties have been have not received any complaints from individuals who may feel they were adversely affected by the actions of officers involved in operation midland as in all were such complaints to be referred to the they would be given due consideration sir has released a lengthy statement in response to the is just a part of failings are identified in operation midland the principal errors believe the complainant nick was a credible person for too say publicly that the allegations were credible and obtain search warrants with flawed and incomplete to have closed the investigation accept on behalf of the metropolitan police accountability for these failures as i accept accountability for failures in any of our operations and is a matter of professional and personal dismay that the suspects in the investigation were pursued for so long when it could have been concluded much am today issuing a public apology to lord lady and proctor for the intrusion into their homes and the impact of operation midland on their lives the public identification of suspects compounded the harm of our investigative have all suffered as a result of the investigation and our description of the allegations as and we should not have said and we should have tested the credibility of the complainant more rigorously before conducting the goes on to highlight the pressure he says officers were these investigations and those in operation many of which led to convictions started at a time when there was significant concern that numerous sexual attacks on children and others had been including by the metropolitan police in decades gone worse were the allegations that abuse had been covered up by the including the was in the context of the creation of an independent together with parliamentary and media scrutiny that officers made their and do not expect the sympathy of the suspects in these cases but i do believe that it is necessary to understand the pressure on the investigators at this time the report by retired judge sir into operation midland says that officers misled a judge to get search warrants and identified 43 says the investigation was riddled with and a complainant will be investigated for attempting to pervert the course of justice the report does not name the complainant but the main allegations that triggered the operation came from a man known as including four detectives and a deputy assistant will be referred to the independent police complaints commission for his sir calls for an inquiry by the into the false grounds used to get search warrants met sir said he accepted there had been and that the investigation should have been closed sooner it has been confirmed that the met sir has ahead of publication of the to the former conservative who was one of those investigated by operation head of said he was after by the met were identified in the a letter dated 8 now that we have received the final version of sir report i am writing to you formally to convey my apologies for the failings by the metropolitan police service that sir has identified in the way in which we handled operation midland in which you were a has and i that there were significant failings in the way that the operation midland investigation was told proctor the approach adopted in believing the complainant at the outset was and that were made to test the credibility of the complainant he while it was right that the allegations had to be the effect of the approach adopted was to unnecessarily prolong the length of the investigation also said it was to have searched for these failings by the police i would like to offer you now an unreserved apology the key questions we are waiting for from the report the met have concluded their investigation does it say about the credibility of the main was the met right to investigate his claims for as long as it could have it been done what does make of could the met and maybe prosecutors have been quicker to assess that his testimony would not be enough to get a case to were there sufficient grounds for the search warrants detectives if is harsh about the met may experience considerable difficulty on this doers say about a policy that police should believe victims of sexual unless evidence to the contrary support sir call for anonymity for suspects in sexual abuse and rape high in the met does blame was in day to day but his overall boss was assistant commissioner pat who is close to had not already announced his intention to retire by would the pressure after the report have been such that he would have been forced the of operation midland and their families have any confidence in the the media are gathering at a location in south for the release of the report on a board stating the values is a we will learn from experience and find ways to be even we will build trust by listening and responding the home affairs reports that the former mp who was one of those wrongfully accused of being part of a has received an apology from the met police shaw is reported to have to former mp proctor over failings in op 2016 this is a useful explaining the people involved with operation midland midland explainer the review into how yard handled claims that prominent establishment figures sexually abused and killed children between the and will be published at report into the operation which investigated allegations that the likes of former military lord former home and former mp proctor were involved in a ring is expected to make difficult reading for the force all of the accused denied the allegations and were subsequently cleared of any involvement without any arrests having ever been made operation which cost and was based on the claims by a lone complainant known as closed in march amid widespread criticism and calls for the met police to ordered retired high court judge sir to conduct an inquiry into the operation after an outcry over police actions and in the which saw officers obtain warrants to raid the homes of suspects and search their have already been complaints that the full report will not be published with the met citing the need to withhold and sensitive has accused the police of a demanding that the report be released in full lady and proctor have also the decision to publish the findings on us election day proctor have chosen this date deliberately as a pr as part of their pr campaign to cover up the disaster that was operation after the will be holding a press conference at

to become the 45th president of the united or trump has to win 270 electoral college votes the candidates have spent what feels like 100 years locked in mortal but in the next few hours there will finally be a victor probably if a or a mandatory prepare for constitutional remind me how the electoral college works each state is assigned a certain number of electoral ultimately based on its population has the with 55 seven states north south and have just three electoral votes gets three there are 50 states in the most of these are republican or democrat they vote the same way every time going back at least six elections so the presidential election boils down to just a handful of the 10 or 11 states that have a recent history of selecting both republicans and democrats this is why voters in places such as north and new are subjected to a barrage of television advertising and campaign stops also why you have not seen and trump holding rallies in or twitter how does the us electoral college faces a much more difficult path to victory he needs to win almost all of these swing states to become the next whereas if wins two or she wins the race this is because democrats start from a stronger position there are 18 states plus that have voted for a democrat for president in every election since 1992 that batch amounts to 242 electoral votes there are only 13 states that have voted for a republican in every election since 1992 those states carry just 102 electoral simply wins all the states that have voted for her predecessors in the recent then adds has 29 electoral she is the next president if she loses but and north she will be the next needs to hold on to all the historically republican win states such as and which are usually republican but where he has struggled in the polls and then win enough swing states to tip him over closing et in because now the real fun polls close in eastern and most of of each state are on central so the polls there close at running is the governor of in the past 50 years the state has voted democrat only once for in some states we will know the winner almost immediately after the polls close most news including

perfect as the race is to heat et close in west north and expect the result from west very quickly trump should win easily north and are swing states and will take longer has been seen as a reliable bellwether voting for the presidential winner in every election since 1964 that run might be coming to an either because of the changing demographics or because of the strangeness of the current in terms of the of both candidates while its demographics are complicated a mix of rust big farmland and more the electorate has grown more white and less educated than the national mean that trend appears to account in part for strength in the buckeye state this the message of love because is was born in you could also make a point about spreading a message of love or of someone pretending to

believe that if trump win it is effectively game over gave him less than a chance of winning the presidency if he fails to take the buckeye if trump loses north or or it also becomes very difficult

immigration minister peter claimed to have the numbers on the senate anyway but nick warned he does not have his party at this has finally settled on a backpacker tax policy and will try to amend the

set to over the direction of said party take the low road on fear and division re said politically correct said it it is goodnight from me and goodnight from him mike bowers thanks to the brains trust you know who you are and thanks for your company love the senator is speaking on the rejects point about the production of suggesting he has tried to get documents in the past from other departments we not going to take a lecture off you guys on the standards of senior officers who are paid pretty significant goes through the revelation from that he had a conversation with mark during the campaign then somehow former family first senator bob day is says tersely to the labor benches that senator day would and sell any one of and is a better man than it is all over the greens senator nick a member of the has outlined his concerns with the is particularly concerned at the lack of access to the attorney documents he says the government is obstructing the goes to this contained within the over access to documents the committee has sought access to any documents and correspondence which would clarify the nature of any consultation that occurred with the it has made requests for information from the department that are relevant to the terms of reference this includes an order for the department to produce sent on 18 2016 the department has advised the committee that it has provided relevant documents to the and that these are still being considered with a view to the making a claim of public interest immunity the committee is concerned that the has only been prepared to provide documents that could in some way be construed to substantiate the assertion that the direction was substantively discussed at the meeting on 30 despite other participants contradicting this claim the committee has not been provided with any of the documents it has asked for pertaining to the direction in his the refers to handwritten meeting notes taken by his which merely refer to the process of obtaining as defined by the direction and guidance note no documents the committee understands have been produced to substantiate the actual consultation process and drafting of the wants a senate select committee created to assess whether they are reasonable claims it is time for the senate to stand up and be counted because we are being treated by contempt by the says he is talking to labor and other senators about the gives no indication whether he has the numbers for the committee the opposition and greens dominated the senate committee so there is always a dissenting report from government senators say the inquiry set up by labor destroyed the career of the solicitor is from the dissenting during the course of the government members came to the conclusion that the position of the had become untenable the subsequent decision to resign in the view of government members of the commendable and perhaps an unavoidable consequence of the public members regret that this set up by the labor party to attack senator the hon of the commonwealth of has in the end destroyed the career of the solicitor general who was himself appointed by the previous labor members of the committee are concerned that the majority on the committee have used the senate committee and thereby the to pursue a partisan political agenda recommendation the senate disallow the amendment to the direction or the attorney general withdraw it and that the guidance note be revised accordingly recommendation 2 that the within three sitting an explanation to the senate responding to the matters raised in this report recommendation 3 that the senate censure the for misleading the parliament and failing to discharge his duties as appropriately senator is for telling the committee hearing details about advice he has given without the permission of his the says the is a senior public servant and should abide by the rules of his job said not just that he but that he consulted the solicitor 2016 the attorney general was not informed the direction was wrong in law a result of not consulting 2016 says the senate has concluded misled the senate he had consulted 2016 the senator a member of the legal and constitutional affairs beats down on the report this committee is renowned for the inappropriateness of its inquiries because they are always political inquiries the senate committee chair has told the senate that the attorney general is unfit to hold office as she tabled the report into the senate committee report calls for senate to censure after his failure to consult with the former solicitor general on a direction that the must gain consent before providing advice to other government post has been the nationals leader and deputy is blaming for the backpackers which is highly confusing because as i have said this was a proposal that emanated from the 2015 budget revel in the they revel in the they revel in creating chaos they know full well what their objective fruit pickers will pay more tax than any backpacker from overseas under the nation pact tweet is even more confusing when you consider the backpacker tax but with tax free threshold with differences for resident tax and non residents tony and original proposed tax in 2015 revised package in revised labor announcement today the greens have announced they will move their own amendments to the backpacker tax bill which seeks to tax backpackers at the same rate as the greens senator peter has been consistent on not wanting change on the tax as opposed to which opposed but without stating its alternative position but without the the greens amendment will not the greens will support the amendment for a backpacker has said if the bill is the government will knock it off in the lower means it will be status quo or will says in the absence of the the default tax will be which was what the government originally proposed in 2015 it all was claiming the no matter what happens the greens have led on this issue we were the first party to oppose the backpacker tax we were the only one to take a policy to the election we were the ones who discovered legislation was required and that the automatic default is not the default position of the tax is complicated the key thing to remember is that though the government originally proposed the tax in this has been argued about ever since no backpacker legislation has passed the house since means there is no change to the existing position which means some backpackers will continue to qualify as residents for tax getting a lesser rate and some will continue to qualify as getting a higher is talking that a default rate of will start on 1 2017 the only thing due to come in on 1 was the law if their legislation passed both houses of parliament if the legislation fails to pass then the status quo remains that is some backpackers are treated as and some are at an individual have told me they want this bill dead they will never trust the government again did not even visit during this debate he has done nothing to fix the mess his government created no props opposition deputy leader leads a visual taunt with members holding up a photograph of former senator bob day with education minister mike bowers for the loses the right to ask a question by using props just to keep you

contribute which trump loses every state with even a hint of democratic flavor and drops a few big republican ones too the fantasy scenario for every who yearns for sense of shock and offense at candidacy to be reflected in the electoral not only loses the big battleground states of north and he hemorrhages support losing losing and then in the stroke that places the election among the routs losing in states where republicans have simply never lost in the modern era voters in turn out in numbers to defeat voters do the same in in and immigrants unite with educated white including a lot of moderate to deliver the first democratic presidential victory in the lone star state since even beats trump in where pious voters decide at the moment of truth that they cannot vote for a candidate who wants to them by the republican leaders get on the day after the election and declare that the nomination of trump was a historic mistake thousands of words are spilled haranguing republicans for nominating a candidate whose appeal to the base may have been strong but who obviously was not a serious contender to lead so great and diverse a nation final electoral twitter the trump bank which trump wins the 270 electoral college votes he needs to grab the keys to the white house with a surprise victory in the upper despite failing to convert in the more familiar battleground states of and in this squeaker trump owes his electoral life to white voters especially rural white voters as the night grows trump realizes that he has lost and owing to a strong vote against him both places he has lost because there are too many people in the suburbs who have some actual experience of the federal government and who are horrified to their teeth at the idea of his taking the white house surprisingly strong turnout among trump supporters in the white communities of has failed to push trump over the democratic wall of and its suburbs but trump has performed strongly all night in the battleground states that winning north and and luck trump picks up a single electoral vote in rural one of two states that split their electoral votes against all odds and the predictions of most he pulls off an upset win in which has not gone republican in a presidential election since but which is more homogeneously white than its neighboring where ends up having failed to inspire voters in to turn up on election and where republican governor political machine has once again succeeded final electoral twitter the which blood pressure climbs to before finally reports a conclusive win for at handing her 29 electoral votes and the white house twitter how does the us electoral college one be pleasant has had some expected victories over the course of the bagging and and the states she was supposed to win in the upper and seeing all the talk of a strong early vote for democrats in come true the people who were supposed to vote for her are voting for her nonwhite educated white voters and no reason she win but the night has been over and by signals that have made democratic eyes twitch the independent voters of new have responded to and concluded that really rather not have a dynasty in politics they give trump four electoral votes then trump wins north where there admittedly are plenty of white republican where republican efforts to quash voting have succeeded be if lost it in how was supposed to win it gets really when the result comes in a large share of voters in suburbs are registered and maybe had the same kind of feeling new have enough with the so stalls out at 266 electoral votes trump gets to 243 and all eyes are on nonwhite voters in turned up at the polls as they might have turnout among white voters in retirement communities has proven absolutely crushing the vote around seems to have failed to materialize and still counting and st then final results in where won by more than 260 , 000 votes in come and the state is clearly trump cries foul but nobody can hear him through the cacophony of popping corks final twitter the which gets the constitutional crisis implicitly promised the moment who has been involved in more than 4 , 095 according to one set foot on his golden escalator the election turns out to be close closer than anyone would have thought maybe trump wins new and makes a sweep of the other battleground save to produce a 269 269 electoral vote tie or maybe which even in the relatively placid year of 2012 took four days to report its election comes down to a margin like the one that separated gore and bush in resulting in fights over absentee ballot a refusal to concede on either side the mother of all legal battles the 2016 election cycle has proven its ability to soar beyond the human and surely no mere mortal can comprehend how hairy things could get the most horrible scenarios appear to lie down the path of an electoral tie what happens nobody really knows while the constitution prescribes that congress shall step in to resolve such a and while a couple of early elections were close enough for congress to get there really are no applicable precedents since presidents are technically chosen by electors who meet to cast formal votes in it is conceivable that a might break a tie in favor by going against the will of his or her voters but then congress must formally count the ballots in and if but one senator and one representative disagree with the each chamber must vote on the validity of the count you see where this is going this is a congress that cannot so much as tie its much less leap constitutional hurdles would a result ever emerge on the other would the supreme court get still one justice what if they who would ultimately prove more trump or the some bridges are better left uncrossed until necessary final pass the scotch twitter the make great the cubs won the world series and guess these things happen in threes 2016 the age you thought you were living in is yesterday this is the age of reality the era of entertainment the time of trump and any fool not foolishly attached to her or his notions of the yesterday could see it coming voters by the worst of what trump had to say simply voted for him but millions of additional voters suburban immigrants who have already paid their republicans who came to their and men everywhere found that when they stepped into the polling they either check the box for a relic of political past a no less or they as bothered by and by the actions of his as they thought after not serious about wanting to deport millions of just as he serious when he said what he did about serious when he impugned serious when he said were rapists and were serious when he called for a nuclear and serious when he said journalists should be silenced and when he over and that should be in prison big night begins in new continues shortly thereafter in and north rolls through and and then earlier than anyone could have thought through where he maintains a second home nobody can believe it when trump wins it turns out that voters in stayed and a surprising number of centrists in the suburbs decided that no candidate who loved golf so much could be so bad trump wins maybe misses in and misses in the upper but by then over 300 electoral so who hang the white house with a big gold and brace yourselves for whatever may be final twitter

we get from the supreme full rejected calls from several for the government to hold a vote on triggering article 50 before the supreme court judgment it was right to wait until the supreme court issued its he said but he told the conservative although he could not agree to her proposal for an early vote on a article 50 he was by the idea and when peter a said the government should just hold a vote on a resolution backing triggering article said that the government was not proposing but that the commons itself could decide to have a vote he also suggested the government wanted to clarify the law on prerogative powers not least because they cover decisions like going to said although the high court ruling implied that the government had to pass primary legislation to be allowed to trigger article the supreme court ruling could say something different he was responding to questions about whether parliament would have to pass a bill to allow the government to trigger article or whether just passing a resolution easier would be enough if the government loses its appeal to the supreme defended the independence of the although he refused to condemn those newspapers that attacked the high court judges for their article 50 ruling he there are a number of pillars of our one of them is the independence of the judiciary which we have maintained for and one of the others is the freedom of the press which we are still maintaining after said some of the trolls who have attacked the woman who brought the article 50 should be prosecuted he let me comment on the issue of miller said with respect to that that i deplored i find words strong enough frankly to say how much i detest the attacks on her and frankly from what heard about them i seen them myself directly but from what heard about them they sound to me to be effectively criminal because incitement of threats of racial are all refused to endorse communities secretary claim that the high court ruling was an to frustrate the will of the suggested that the proposed march on the supreme to be led by would be pointless he the right to demonstrate is another of our freedoms but say this one of the great things about our supreme indeed all our is it matter how many people it move their judgments by one comma and what we should be proud said the government would announce in due course whether it intended to remain in the customs union the issue of a customs union is a complex there are many different configurations there is turkey inside the customs but outside the single there is inside the single market outside the customs and outside the customs union and partially in the single market we have to make a judgment on what is best for in both in terms of its access to the market and to the rest of the world and we will make that judgment in due course and make it public in due course speaking to the in may has also said that she still expects to be able to trigger article 50 before the end of march she clear that i expect to be able to trigger article 50 by the end of march next year what said consistently and i continue to work on that basis we believe the government has got strong legal arguments be putting those arguments to the supreme court and the supreme court will make its judgment of the leave means leave campaign successor to has welcomed statement he we welcome the statement made by the secretary of state reaffirming the commitment to and their pledge to deliver on campaigners should make no mistake the ruling by the high court will not sabotage it is a game being played by campaigners who are damaging national confidence and our national economic interest they should stop playing games and get behind the opportunities offers as the timetable is still on the supreme court overrules the high court judgment or it comes down to a parliamentary it is crucial that article 50 is triggered as soon as possible to ensure that confidence in the economy is maintained speaking in may has reaffirmed her opposition to holding an early general election but she would not rule one and she repeatedly said the general election be in not that it be then asked to rule out an election any time before she been clear on this right from before i became prime that the next general election should be in 2020 we should get on with the job i think what most people want is for government to get on with the job and put in place necessary going to take time there will be getting on with it and we will be leaving the she think i could have been clearer about an election in the statement is finally over i will post a summary of the key points shortly the brown asks why he no longer supports the case he made as a backbencher when he proposed a bill calling for parliamentary control of the references to 1999 parliamentary control of the executive bill here it is have raised this the says does not have to reply because this does not relate to his ministerial responsibilities now the conservative says that although are now demanding a vote on triggering article they voted against a rule bill he proposed himself in saying article 50 should be triggered the martin asks for an assurance that there will be no change to the rights of people in the from says that he thinks their rights will not change at but he says he will right to with a firm answer a asks if the government is worried about the courts stopping ministers using prerogative powers to go to says that that is one of the reasons why the government is so keen to get a definitive ruling from the supreme court in an earlier post i wrongly described mike gapes as a conservative that was just an extended typo he of a mp berger quotes from a constituent who said he voted to leave the but did not vote to suspend the rule of law so why the government accept the high court says the government has a right to appeal against the decision he does not see how you can accuse the government of suspending the rule of law smith says has seven times refused to condemn the comment from last week attacking the high court so will condemn the plan to march against the supreme says the right to protest is an important one but one of the good things about our judiciary is however many people it will not affect the supreme ruling one says marching against the supreme court will not change its decision one the says used to fight for rights but now he is fighting for the prerogative rights of the says the rights of parliament are derived from the views of the voters mike a asks about column in financial times and asks if the government is planning a transitional exit says he does not anything in financial i wrongly described gapes as a conservative sorry he is of course a mp

when will we know the us goes to the polls on results will start to come in on from about in when some states close their polling stations on the eastern seaboard of the us some states with clear majorities for or trump will be called very quickly depending on how close it is and how certain key states the final result could be known anywhere between and the early evening bear in mind that in is midnight in new so it is likely that and trump will speak to supporters sometime late afternoon be getting results from and from around noon though it may take a while to know who has won in either place if trump pulls off a surprise in he will be in a strong position the result in will be a big indicator one way or the followed by new and north many states will call early at about will win if going to win the this could put her ahead on the day for the first time we may well have a result by twitter how does the us electoral college is the us electoral of it has nothing to do with schools or universities it is not a building or a but rather a way of counting votes in the presidential state is worth a certain number of electoral college votes if a candidate wins a then that candidate wins all of that electoral college votes my year with covering a curiosity that became a dark phenomenon read number of electoral college votes a state gets is based on its population size a state gets a vote for each of its house of representatives districts plus two votes for its two senators the more people in a the more members of the house of representatives it has and the more electoral college votes it has 55 north has has has and so on there are 538 electoral college votes in total that means the first candidate to reach 270 electoral college votes wins the presidential election there have been cases in which there is an electoral college in when finally emerged as and more in the sitcom veep in a tie would likely look more like the latter than the former is it possible to win the popular vote but not the electoral college just as labor under won the popular vote in the 1998 election but win a majority in the a presidential candidate in the us can win the popular vote but fall short in the electoral college vote this has happened four times in us 1888 and when w bush beat gore in the electoral college despite losing the popular vote can trump really voters in could have crucial role in tight us election race read he could though it looking likely in the past week lead has largely off the back of the announcement that it was reopening an investigation into her email server some national polls have even showed trump drawing even with her but has consistently led in the electoral and many polls project her electoral college result at 270 or more most polls now project trump at 200 to 215 electoral college making his task of winning 270 more difficult a blue state and what is a red the 2000 election the us media have used the red and blue to depict how states are likely to vote democratic states are shown in blue republican states are shown in red because red is usually the of the and blue is traditionally the of the right if i look at one of those electoral college it looks as though trump is winning everywhere a sea of red going on is winning a lot of states but many of the states he is winning are not full of people so they have small numbers of electoral college votes by has a of including new and are swing and which ones are states are like marginal seats the ones on a knife edge that can swing between the two parties sometimes they are referred to as purple states mixture of red and swing states to watch in this election are north and new only needs to win all the blue states plus one of these swing states to win the whereas trump needs to win all the red states and all of these swing states to reach 270 do actually there is no consistent method of voting across the with each state running their elections polling hours will vary by city or county as well some states use paper as does some use electronic where it looks as though the voter is using an three states and conduct voting by mail for though in voters also have the option of attending a polling us election how much do you remember from the presidential read states use punch card where the voter uses an implement to punch a hole through the ballot which is then read by a device first time i voted in a us election from the state of mailed me a punch a pad and a metal spike so i could cast my this form of voting gave rise to the term a in when result was challenged on a number of bases including whether a vote was valid if the punch seem to go all the way through the only voting for are voting for a wide range of measures and local tax levies for should the county impose a tax to provide more funds to the local state should the state county officials such as coroners and dog catchers judges they elect judges in governors states are voting for governors this state legislators voting for your state all 435 members of the federal house of elected every two 34 federal voting for your local state federal government and in several state and local plebiscites all at the equivalent of what are voting for tomorrow a democracy the difference between senate and the the congress is the general term for the entire legislature the house of representatives is like the lower house in and the senate is like our senate that it is an upper it may or may not have its own quirky la rod and the republicans are likely to control the house of mainly because the state legislatures get to draw their own boundaries and have ensured the districts are as friendly as possible to the republican democrats may well control the senate it is on a knife edge if it is tied at then the casts the deciding vote meaning the presidential election and the senate election are two to watch in tandem so tired of hearing about emails just give me the potted she was secretary of state us foreign used a private email server to send and receive work rather than use the department of secure email have sought to assert she violated state department protocol as well as federal laws regarding record keeping the opened an investigation to determine if any of the information was classified some of it was but the determined in that while was it would not recommend charges against her email issues pale in comparison to w who 22 million emails he kept as president on a private email server but the controversy has dogged as it fed a perception that she was not an honest person last 11 days from the the announced it was reopening the email investigation based on newly discovered that is emails on another computer lead substantial at that point took a blow this week 48 hours from election day the has announced that it reviewed these new emails and uncovered no new and thereby stands by its recommendation that should not be charged with any crime twitter campaign that email investigation has been this means in terms of voting intentions is hard to say should she at least start her presidency with a investigation into her emails still hanging over her are three facts i can wheel out impressively on ways the us election could play out read did you know is the of us it is the ultimate bellwether it has voted with the us president in every election since 1964 this year population is older and whiter than previously and will probably vote for trump it is likely that for the first time in more than 50 years will go with the party that win the did you know that us territories get to vote in the primaries but not the general people in and the virgin islands get to vote for who should be the candidate but they get no say on who

there has arguably not been a us presidential election with so much at stake for the rest of the world since the second world war one candidate stands largely for she would do slightly more than her predecessor to shore up the existing liberal world order her opponent is vowing to turn that order on its jettisoning alliances and free trade while seeking to cut deals with the authoritarian trump is elected on it is likely to trigger a foreign policy crisis inside as the diplomatic and security establishments scramble to discover whether he meant what he said on the campaign trail those who believe that the election talk was all bluster and that trump will tack back to a more traditional republican foreign policy once elected are likely to be according to an analyst at the institution in us trump and in tight race on campaign 's final day live read more view is he is a more ideological candidate than we often appreciate and while there is a lot of bluster and a lot of ignorance on a wide number of there are certain things that he has been pretty consistent wright said think he is opposed to us alliances and i think he would try to withdraw the us from security commitments around the world he is and he would veer towards a more and he is he is some believe that trump would be confronted with a series of resignations by diplomats and generals if he tried to turn these campaign platforms into administration policy on the other wins the electoral college she will face the opposite how to distinguish her foreign policy from she has expressed an inclination toward a tougher stance in and in for but the for a change of policy has shrunk with every passing week as has sought to create new facts on the ground in the last stages of the era more weeks would go by while a new administration dives into an inevitable policy review events around the globe may not wait that long whoever sits down at the desk in the oval office on 20 next year may be forced to take some of the toughest decisions any us president has much sooner than he or she would faces host of global threats during transition until next president read power and influence is being challenged around the world at an accelerating and nowhere more so than on the peninsula the north has sped up tests of nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them expert opinion varies on whether his technicians have succeeded in making a nuclear warhead small enough to put atop a and there is a general consensus that if they have not done so they will soon it is also widely anticipated that in the next few north will perfect an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the us west coast former and current us administrations have taken the strategic decision that should be prevented from reaching that by force if necessary but the ultimate decision will most likely be taken by the next foreign policy advisers have that she would focus on the looming crisis early in her term in reassuring japan and south that the us will not abandon and seeking to put pressure on china to enforce trade sanctions more effectively that may well not leaving a administration with the choice of agreeing to a resumption of with and accepting its nuclear weapons as long as it restricts missile development if that were it would alarm us allies who are already within north missile allies are likely to reach that point of alarm far more quickly if trump reaches the oval office he has questioned the value of us alliances in the and he has floated the possibility that countries like japan or south should develop their own nuclear weapons rather than rely on the us strategic umbrella if he sticks to that policy in there could be a sudden nuclear arms race in and possibly beyond a trump administration would have to face the direct threat of a north missile he has said he would put more pressure on china to get tough with its and he has said he is willing to meet in the on the grounds a or a chance that i can talk him out of those damn he has he is quite willing to contemplate using the us nuclear arsenal if the weapons cannot be he why are we making why do we make china china tantalized by us election mayhem and prospect of trump as president read his or her first year in a new us president would also face a direct challenge to us power in the western pacific the of laying claim to reefs and rocks in the south china sea and turning them into naval and air bases gives potential control over some the busiest shipping lanes in the world us influence is under further threat by the rise of in the who has threatened to eject us casting doubt on his agreement to allow new permanent presence likely policy will be to continue faltering to and to restoring the faith of us allies in the region that will help them resist attempts to dominate the south china sea it is a policy that is held hostage to some extent by ultimate and it could lead to a rapid escalation of tension in the region trump has pointed to the as a reflection of us weakness but has not said what he would do about it he has focused more on the threat posed to the us by its trade relations with china in the transactional model of foreign relations trump he could agree to turn a blind eye to creeping takeover in the south china sea in exchange for a bilateral trade deal with on better terms why plans for zones in could provoke conflict read new us president will arrive in office at a time of significant military advances against state in and but diminishing options when it comes to helping shape the opposition battle against the regime and its and backers it is possible that the rebel stand in will have fallen by giving the regime the upper hand and postponing yet again any hopes of a political

indicated that he would seek to work with and in a combined fight against and has not voiced criticism of the bombardment of areas such as eastern that policy would also have heavy costs the opposition and the gulf states would see it as a and the new administration would have to deal with the reality that neither the regime nor has much immediate interest in fighting and administration

take a leadership role in negotiations with over and the stalled peace which have hitherto been left to and she could also opt to send lethal aid to as a way of increasing us the world views the us from to north read is likely to take the opposite approach he avoided criticism of for its actions in hinted he might accept the annexation of and ignored us intelligence findings that was behind the hacking of democratic email a trump administration is unlikely to contest enforcement of its influence in eastern and aides have consistently that one of her priorities would be to show us willingness to shore up and and will attend summits of both in has by that is obsolete and questioned whether its security commitments in are worth what the us is currently spending on them he said he would check whether us allies their obligation to before coming to their calling into question the purpose of the pact later in the he changed saying he would seek to strengthen the but a win for trump on would nonetheless deepen anxiety in eastern such as the that a would come to their in the face of encroachment two major free trade projects of the the transatlantic trade and investment partnership with

from the day that she stepped into number it has been a to some of her colleagues that may ought to call an early general election as it has also been to many on the other side of the commons her majority in parliament is slender and just became slimmer with the resignation of the mp a disillusioned outer the conservatives are to retake his but they be so fortunate with other john major started with a larger majority in the parliament that began in 1992 and had lost it by the time he was done another reason for her to go to the country early is that the majority really belong to may it was won by that bloke who used to live at number 10 she lacks the personal mandate that flows to a prime minister who has won an election in her own way she has behaved towards senior members of the old regime has created a big club of enemies on her asked recently what he was up one very senior figure in the cabinet my then there is at some point in this probably at several there will be torrid political and constitutional crises over departure from the union there will be resignations by ministers there will be deadlocks and breakdowns in the negotiations it is highly likely that there will be serious economic convulsions as well so goes an argument popular with for may to herself with the much larger majority that the opinion polls indicate can be hers for the asking that would give her five clear years to get through and all its may has heard those arguments and used to dismiss them she said the voters for an election she thought that what the country most wanted was stability it fit with her image of herself to do something that would look opportunistic nor did it suit her temperament her team calculated that was in such a dreadful state that the need to rush for a quick that calculus been changed by the high court ruling that the government must secure parliamentary approval before it can formally trigger divorce proceedings with the it has the court ruling was as the more hysterical have been an example of elitist judges frustrating the will of the people the court was reasserting the fundamental principle that the executive cannot rule by monarchical but must seek the consent of parliament if it wants to change the law there is an alternative to the rule of law it is called dictatorship those who campaigned to leave the in the name of restoring parliamentary sovereignty ought to be able to grasp government might overturn the ruling with a successful appeal to the supreme but that looks unlikely if the supremes agree that the government has to ask parliament before it can activate article it is as yet unclear how may intends to conform to the instruction some in government seem to think that they might get away with tabling a crude motion demanding that parliament simply her decision that would be defiant of the spirit of the court ruling and perhaps also of its letter which is why some ministers think they will have to bring forward would not take that as an opportunity to block most were and so were the majority of but they are not going to flatly defy the referendum result parliament might have something to say about the timing of the departure march is a lousy choice of month to start the countdown to withdrawal there is a presidential election in next spring and elections are due in the early autumn nothing meaningful will be negotiated until these are which means current plan simply diminishes the time available to try to make a success of it and peers could be doing both her and a if they slowed her down by a few parliament will definitely do is demand to know more about the exit if i am not being naive in imagining that such a thing exists for more than a hundred may has sheltered behind the meaningless mantra means as one of the first to mock the vacuity of that i have to confess that it has proved a more durable blocking mechanism than i a testimony to the potency of stubborn repetition one explanation for this long silence could be that the government has an exit plan of such elegance that it is being kept concealed to build up the suspense and increase our collective awe when it is revealed in all its brilliance me was at the parliamentary awards dinner when had the audience in involuntary spasms by declaring that the government would make a of there are some over there that need foreign secretary the prime minister responded with a threat that was no less vicious for coming in the guise of a joke had unwisely compared himself with the throttled by may the dog was put down when its master decided it needed any yes she really did in a room crowded with senior politicians and the prime minister told her foreign secretary that she would kill him when it pleased government is concealing its intentions not to keep the guessing but to try to hide its internal confusions and the negotiations and that will be in less than six time if may preserves her a lot of it will become very public anyway she will have to tell all the key actors in the including the commission and the heads of what sort of deal she is looking for it will not stay secret for five minutes the big at the heart of the negotiation will be between immigration and trade that is already as are the various permutations of a deal one of the arguments for not calling an election was that it would force an early reveal of precisely what may wants from the negotiation and that would inflame divisions if the consequence of the court ruling is that she has to show more of her hand that reason for avoiding an early election falls away the fixed term parliament act is often cited as an obstacle written into the statute book during the coalition years to stop the doing the dirty on the lib or the legislation does make it more laborious to trigger an election in the old the prime minister could just pop down to buck house to ask for a dissolution and her majesty would oblige to get an early the government would have to engineer a confidence vote and deliberately lose it that would look strange it might try to repeal the but that could run into trouble in the lords an election can be triggered if of vote to have one that would be hard for the opposition parties to frustrate as one senior figure puts vote against and the lib having both called for an election when may became prime would find it difficult to explain why they want one you might think that would nevertheless try to prevent an election when its poll rating is so dire and the have a robust lead often in double

one of the curiosities of the long rise of is that the party that wraps itself in the union and invokes a version of seems to have such a limited understanding of and its institutions a ruling last week by three judges that parliament is sovereign and must and the triggering of article 50 to begin the process of the leaving the union should have been a cause for celebration the judges listened to legal arguments citing explained very clearly and carefully why parliament is sovereign in these matters and must pass an act to begin was furious at this supposed incursion he said that he had a one of his that is in full flow talks in almost mystical as if he has some form of extrasensory perception that provides him with a unique insight into the course of national affairs and the tide of opinion having had such an enormous influence on shaping recent perhaps the trainee demagogue has started to fall for his own is plotting to overturn the result of the referendum and betray the nation there are certainly a few people trying mistakenly and pointlessly to reverse but they are not running the government and do not have the numbers in the house of commons or the country will as sensible acknowledge the question is in what form that is deeply because it creates the false impression that will be blocked from leaving the locked in by dark betrayal narrative has echoes of 1918 in immediately after the country had lost the first world war fair and the nationalistic right said that the army had been betrayed by the wicked politicians of the establishment who had sued for peace in that it cannot be long before a leading figure from warns of stab in the a phrase heavy with historical import from the same dangerous reaction demonstrates again that the party he built has more in common with continental populist parties and the wilder fringe movements on the right and left than it does with the tradition of parliamentary democracy and respect for institutions is a in the of the infamous politician who the anger of it is not just that has lost touch with the constitutional fundamentals other parts of the broad movement some and the press have also reacted as if the article 50 decision constitutes a judicial coup against the vote a constitutional crisis is with parliament supposedly pitched against the people some of the more vocal in the parliamentary party have indulged this illustrating what happens when campaigners become too hooked on runaway populism fresh from undermining the governor of the bank of they are now on to the judiciary is there any part of the which theoretically they are dedicated to they attack in lurid is even the queen needs to calm down the anger against the judges would be justified if they had declared the referendum invalid and banned they did no such thing they simply confirmed that parliament should have its proper place in the process of course it is not even as if the judges in this case have been particularly which has been a problem in recent with some judges pushing the interpretation of the law in a direction in tune with their thinking or trends in law here in the article 50 case they took a thoroughly traditional and praiseworthy they were branded which is unintentionally revealing the charge that judges being unelected equates to illegitimacy is yet more crazy populist talk we do not elect judges and for good reason centuries of constitutional development and experimentation produced a compromised and weakened by in which the judiciary is independent parliament makes the laws and the courts interpret the law and make judgments of we could try electing or ordering judges to disregard and ignore the rule of law on the order of but the international historical precedents do not suggest it ever ends someone who voted to leave the i simply cannot see the problem with the courts and parliament doing their respective jobs properly nothing could be more in tune with the vote to leave the union than three judges applying the law and declaring that parliament must give the for article 50 twitter said he had a that is it is important to understand the limits of what the court decided and what parliament can reasonably do next it is not a mandate to stop the leaving the those who think it is are the mirror image of the those equally who refuse to accept that they lost the referendum and want it set aside mount attacks that are almost as frenzied as those of the the and some are behaving like are not calling leave voters they are the next moment branding them which is just a nicer way of saying stupid but neither set of extremists is representative nor has a majority parliament or the country what becomes ever more apparent over is that there is a need for an alliance between moderate which there are leavers and moderate those who regret the result on 23 but accept it if a deal can be done after two years of talks with the it will involve a degree of which again is supposed to be a there is no bespoke deal to be because the it will be time the chances of the former rather than the latter outcome being the result are greatly enhanced by moderate leavers and if you voted remain and want to avoid a hard for terms of immediate next steps and article the commons wants assurances that the government has achievable aims in its negotiations there is not an appetite for blocking the process the situation is more complicated in the house of but even there peers must know that an early election by the government voting itself out of would see may returned with a landslide majority for triggering article 50 and a mandate to get on with may not come to although the government has not helped calm the situation by rushing to appeal to the supreme court may would have done better by calmly accepting the outcome and saying that it illustrated the soundness of a system that rests on the independence of the government accountability to parliament and

once upon a a long time small children might get told off for being loud or unruly as we called it not so much in cool to be disruptive what every startup in silicon valley is straining to what has done disrupting the hotel industry as has disrupted taxis and amazon has disrupted bookshops and almost everything else two years ago i went to a conference in and met many people claiming to disrupt many in one what no one anticipated was though it may be convenient to summon a motor vehicle to home with a tap of a button or to buy things while wearing and possibly it might also lead to where we are 6 2016 two before the world changes trump is not just an star gone rogue he is not a version of lord sugar he is what happens when technology changes everything wrote the professor at business school who coined the is the mudslide how some scrappy little upstart like overthrew the colossus that once was how some small new technological breakthrough can have trump the breathing version of the scrappy little upstart that overturns an entire industry only this time not an have governments have stood by and watched it take down all industries in its path the market must do what the market must do only the wave is breaking on its what the last week of this presidential campaign has shown us is that technology has is is threatening to upturn the democratic process itself the most most equitable form of governance the world has yet come up many crucial it even matter who wins on because perhaps the best thing you can say about trump is that if it been him it would have been someone else the opposite of the great man theory of a misogynistic star is not the days the same hackers who took down twitter and and the and and last week in the biggest attack of its kind that the world has ever started on a country computer had been used to infect inanimate objects in our homes the connected devices that comprise the of things and been a bit are hopelessly has harnessed these to

entire infrastructure to a worst case that the hackers behind it are for when aim their massed computing power against is everyday objects in our own toasters and refrigerators because this is where we our toasters and refrigerators may be about to be used to subvert the democratic process of the greatest democracy on if that reads like the most lunatic sentence ever you maybe been paying close enough attention to this is the year when it hits home that technology is not just some cool gadget in our pockets the facilitator of the degraded news space that treats facts and lies the same that has enabled thousands of algorithms to scrape the for stories about trump and then was robot accounts that caused to trend after each debate and allowed trump to claim how a man who set foot on the street for four with just his create havoc in the critical last week of the campaign by leaking emails that potentially implicate has inserted himself like computer into the heart of the democratic process infected it he like the law of unintended consequences writ in human we mind the fact that the data he leaked was stolen here in the liberal we championed it because it was stolen data that served to underscore our liberal sensibilities at least mine and not so then technology is neutral there is no left or right there is only hackers and and in reported last earn money via for writing stories about trump and making them go viral on a single town there are at least 140 websites about politics run by kids who make money from fabricated stories teenagers can earn up to a month by making up things about trump they care about trump or or anyone else just worked out what the us public wants to read and have found a way of serving it up to them whether true or best way of making money via is to write and the best the stories that are spread widest and furthest in and are stories about trump more false stories about in 2016 we read the news we want to read the the means by which and give us more of what we or what we already know our searches and our are programmed to reflect our previous searches and is becoming not so much a bubble as a ghetto walled closed not just that search engines have been shown to influence election results the higher up a name is listed in any the more likely they are to win also that the less we know about how other people the less we increasingly living in an echo exposed only to views which chime with our own the impression this gives is that everyone is like thinks like wants to be like most people are not like us maybe what 2016 has come to teach us that and the idea that and are out to make the world a better place is both absurd and matter what mark wants or what intends the people who donated to intend to get the first potential female us president investigated by the nobody wanted their fridge to bring down intend to drive all newspapers out of business just something that is happening along the this the big

it has become painfully clear since vote to leave the union that government and its supporters have little or no idea where the country is heading lacking a plan or a shared they are united by an arbitrary and destructive rush to the exit their hysterical reaction to last unanimous high court ruling that cannot quit the without consent also reveals extraordinary ignorance about where as a have come from it is dismaying that those who campaigned so passionately to reclaim sovereignty appear not to have the first idea about their constitutional is a fundamental principle of democracy that parliament is sovereign not the government not the executive or a clique within it certainly not this prime who lacks a personal mandate sovereign power resides with our representative parliament this state of affairs did not come about by chance a power struggle between the crown and its subjects raged almost unceasingly in the centuries following the proposition that the monarch cannot rule

the landmark bill of rights twitter the infamous lord chief justice of england is caught and beaten by a mob during the glorious 1688 is also a fact of constitutional life that the senior judges do not make domestic law their independent role is to interpret laws agreed by say what they mean and how and if they may be legally implemented when joined what was then the the communities passed by parliament in incorporated many laws into domestic law thus it is both illogical and ignorant to castigate the high court for doing its job and stating the constitutionally that having passed the only parliament can override it by consenting to activate article 50 of the castigating the judges and by anybody who has the effrontery to agree with is exactly what the hard and their accomplices in the

living including nationals now afraid to speak openly for fear of rebuke or more reasonable supporters have rightly distanced themselves from campaign to the judges responsible for last ruling but the decision to appeal to the supreme court means judges sitting on highest who will consider the matter next may now also be subject to overt political pressure and similarly invective in turkey or such tactics by the state and its surrogates might not be considered surprising but sort of country is becoming that this sort of menacing is not only tolerated but implicitly encouraged by senior

actually have been awoken this year by rhetoric the bad news is that the such a vital element in the coalition built by in his two successful presidential is relatively sluggish this time as is turnout for young voters the fall in black turnout could be especially perilous for in swing states such as north which has been identified by both candidates as a key early voters change their as trump has and have they trump is trying to use the furor over the renewed interest in emails to persuade those early voters feeling remorse to switch their preference that you see that was a big

here are the main stories on article 50 court plan to trigger by the end of march will not be derailed by a high court ruling that parliament must vote on the no 10 has reaction on the continent to the high ruling on article 50 has been with national governments and the commission regarding the decision as an internal alone has the power to trigger by notifying of the intention to leave the the high court has pound jumped on the news that negotiations over withdrawal from the union could be after the high court rejected government claims that it has the sole power to trigger article is the most important development in the story since the election of may as prime minister and easily the most encouraging day for those who backed remain since the referendum on 23 posted vast amounts of commentary on this but here is what it means in six key the court ruling is much more definitive than anyone expected for green at the government is appealing to the supreme but informed commentators seem to think it more likely than not that the government will lose unless the government does win at the supreme parliament will get to legislate on invoking article 50 and that means a proper passing through the commons and the with and peers getting the chance to amend it may has been refusing to give parliament a vote on the terms of once power shifts from the hands of the executive to the legislature the prime minister loses some control the key point about today is that and peers for the first got a strong chance of shaping the start of the the chances of being overturned are still very minimal it is just about possible to conceive how the could stay in the votes to insert a second referendum clause into the article 50 and some economic catastrophe results in a sharp change in public opinion by but you would be unwise to bet on it most and peers who voted remain accept that the result of the referendum should be but the chances of being not have increased significantly there is a majority for a in parliament if there is a it will now have the chance to exercise there is now a real possibility that may will not be able to trigger article 50 before the end of march the government says it still intends to meet this but the need to legislate could lead to a an early though by no means now does look more likely than it did this time all from me for today i had been intending to cover other but afraid this one took for the comments the votes of northern in the house of commons could prove critical if may and the government is forced to ask parliament to trigger article eight democratic unionist party are guaranteed to back in the commons given that they were the only major political force in the assembly to active back a leave vote in the position of the two ulster unionist tom and in south is interesting in leader mike called for a remain has now switched position and said its will back the government to allow for the referendum result to be implemented the party will argue this is because the entire electorate of the has spoken in the referendum and it is their duty to back up that outcome in the switch though may also be due to fears of being further outflanked by the especially given a number of recent defections from the to the democratic unionists in essence the is again moving to the right in order to slow down its decline vis a vis the three will definitely vote to block given that the party campaigned vigorously for remain and was involved in last failed legal action in the high court to declare null and void in northern will not vote in the commons because it boycotts the parliament although the party will come under fire accused of failing to add to the remain voices in the chamber that could scupper it is the votes of the unionist bloc that will prove far more critical if and when the referendum result is tested in the house of commons expect more demands from first minister foster for special treatment for northern farming subsidies for ulster agriculture for in order to bolster the numbers in a vote even one after a general election here is the on the court mp judicial these judges are politicians without accountability mp aided and abetted by seeking to tell electorate to sod 2016 a majority of voters now want to remain in the according to a the press association report but there was little sign that the majority in of remain reflected a change of heart since the referendum vote to leave just of leave voters polled by research said they would now vote while of those who backed membership on 23 said they would switch in the other direction the remain advantage came from voters who did not take part in the of whom said they would now back against who would vote to leave found that the conservatives were ranked the best party to handle negotiations with the remaining with the backing of of against for for and each for liberal democrats and greens the conservative former has joined those saying parliament should now have a proper debate about what will entail he told sky the question is not who makes the decision on whether leaving the union because the public have made that decision in the think the sooner we get on to the substantive discussion in parliament with the government about the nature of our new relationship with how going to trade with these key partners of ours like and how businesses here in and across the country are going to have the certainty so that they can invest and hire people over the next couple of years for me these are the key issues and i would be arguing for the closest possible trading and economic relationship with outside of the because got to respect the referendum here is the conservative chair of the commons treasury committee a remain voter in on the court ruling whatever the supreme court the government should be much more transparent about its objectives in the in some and the sooner the better it should also ensure that parliament can the and vote on are many good reasons for this among it can enable the construction of public consent for the future relationship with the the is a public debate is needed about where we want to arrive before taking it is always a good idea for the pilot to discuss with the passengers and crew where they might want to clarity about the objectives would enable a serious discussion with other member states to get prior to the triggering of article it can reduce the economic damage caused by uncertainty over the likely shape of the future relationship with the it is the uncertainty about the terms of that far more than the additional time required to clarify the negotiating that carries the more significant cost clay for the guardian have cut the odds on a general election taking place next year now at vine seems to vine there will now be a general election in 2017 a history is thinking along the same you 're the pm you can get bogged down in both houses on or you can win a landslide in a what do you 2016 here is an article 50 court ruling reading the lawyer and financial times legal says the judgment looks the judgment at early to be almost it was made unanimously by three experienced appeal sitting exceptionally at first they are the lord chief the master of the rolls and the leading public law judge at the court of appeal it is reasoned and detailed at one the court appears to hold that the case was too weak to win on its own regardless of the did the government it seems that the crucial issue is the impact on the rights of citizens if the article 50 notification is irrevocable then the argument is that these rights will be removed automatically in due course this cannot be other than by an act of government could have this difficulty by not accepting that the notification was irrevocable including lord who wrote article 50 of the say a notification must be but it saw this legally sensible move as politically unacceptable looking at the the impression is that the concession on this crucial point determined the outcome of the the barrister and legal says in a financial times article that if the government loses its may will not be able to trigger article 50 by the end of march as she hopes imagine this it is 2018 the promised trade deals have failed to appear unemployment and inflation are on the rise the public mood towards has turned and so have negotiations with our biggest and nearest trading partner in that any rational mp would wish back in she had left ajar the door to remaining in the why make the decision with modest if you have the opportunity to make it later with points will be debated in the commons and they must also be debated in the in practical it is difficult to contemplate that these steps drafting a debating it in the voting on placing it before the house of lords and then addressing amendments introduced by the upper chamber in the commons again can sensibly be taken after the result of the supreme court appeal is known but before whatever else the decision unless the supreme court overturns the high march deadline will be ancient white at the institute of government has a on what the ruling means will and lords vote to pass the will of course come down to politics both the commons and lords have a majority of members who argued for the to remain a member of the but they may not wish to vote against the decision of voters taken through the particularly as most constituencies outside the northern and the major cities voted against remaining in the they will wish to ensure that the decision to trigger article 50 receives an appropriate degree of parliamentary scrutiny depending on how the bill is drafted and it is likely to be very short there may be moves to amend it to place conditions on the government before it can trigger article 50 these could take the form of timing or process requirements for a requirement on the government to provide parliament with information about its negotiating position before triggering article a law says on his economic law that he thinks the appeal to the supreme court will lead to the court of justice the court of justice of the union getting involved in case of an appeal of the high decision before the in my the referral to the is legally unavoidable will not deal for now with arguments of judicial politics or pragmatic views on the likely course of even if the parties do not challenge or even raise to the consideration the matter of the of and article 50 it is a logical given that the needs to take a stance if on this point in order to be able to rule on the case if it quashes the high it needs to clarify the points of law which the high court would have gotten of which concerns the of an art 50 notification if it upholds the high it is accepting the assumption that an art 50 notification is irrevocable either the cannot escape a substantial consideration of the interpretation of article my this engages the obligation to request a preliminary ruling from the under article and not doing so triggers a risk of infringement of law by the due to the acts in this of its highest hooper at politics says leave campaigners should not worry too much about the judgment i really remember the poll tax riots toward the tail end of government i i remember seeing stories about it on the but since i was only eight years old the political ramifications of what i was seeing rather eluded me but despite my hazy i think it is safe to say were it would have to include many representing constituencies which voted to leave the to vote against giving the government authority to invoke article the resulting conflagration would make the poll tax riots look like a summer picnic on the political says on that are guilty of hypocrisy it is spectacularly delicious that leading are arguing that the high court today got it wrong today in ruling that we cannot leave the without the assent of parliament in that almost their entire campaign to get us out of the was that courts and must be and no longer subjugated to at the says the ruling was a for the government the high decision is exemplary in its clarity and reasoning anyone interested in a tutorial on the constitution should read the first 56 paragraphs the legal challenge was not supposed to be a major obstacle for the government all it needed to assert and defend were the own constitutional requirements in failing to understand the constitution of its own the government was taught an embarrassing lesson by the high court on the strand here is the politics weekly with heather freeman and martin kettle discussing the elections and article 50 court election and article 50 court case politics weekly read more here is some complicated reasoning from the times does today 's article 50 ruling leave election some points to argue 2016 the conservative former attorney has also been speaking to sky news here are the key points he made grieve said he thought the article 50 ruling could the triggering of article 50 if the appeal there would have to be primary he said it could be but it would be debatable and amendable he said this would not necessarily take a long time at the end of the day you can get primary legislation through parliament quite quickly it has been known to be done in 48 but as an he said this delay the triggering of article said the government was not ready to trigger article 50 now it is worth bearing in mind that the government ready to trigger article 50 itself at the moment at all because it really know at the moment what it is going to do said he did not think his successor as attorney would have to resign if the government lost its appeal is an issue of not he said the high court was there is a hugely principle in this country that laws and statutes conferring rights on people passed by parliament cannot be removed without parliament voting to do it that is what this question is about grieve sky news burley high court ruling summed up in a paragraph by 2016 the has been giving a statement about the article 50 ruling to broadcasters here are the key said unless the judgment is overturned on the government will have to pass an act of parliament to trigger article 50 asked if it would be possible for the government to give a say just by having a quick vote on a narrow he not there would have to be an he said other is right see said the government was appealing against the court ruling although it accepted parliamentary the people were ultimately sovereign and people voted for it was biggest mandate in he said and he said that had voted six to one in of letting the people decide through a referendum sky news here is the official downing street statement on the article 50 ruling a spokesperson the government is disappointed by the country voted to leave the union in a referendum approved by act of parliament and the government is determined to respect the result of the will appeal this judgment made its views on the three judges responsible for the article 50 ruling quite clear in this headline earlier has since been statesman thought voted to leave the not to set the clocks back to on that mail headline an article for the new bush challenges liberal to speak out about views like this the first has put out a fresh statement about the article 50 ruling she says the government should accept it and shelve its appeal she the high judgment is not a surprise to anyone who has been following this and the government should now accept this decision rather than take it to the supreme the government is now in the position where the court has ruled against it and is insisting that parliament must vote before article 50 can be triggered underlines the chaos and confusion at the heart of the handling of be clear the prime minister has not tried to avoid parliament because of constitutional principles but because any vote in parliament would expose the complete lack of a plan for what whatever eventually comes forward from the government to will not vote in any way that would undermine interests

when it came to the question decided by the court who has the power to trigger article suddenly they found that parliament was not quite so sacred or central that some things were best left to ministers to decide the judges have called out that hypocrisy they have decided that the should have to comply with their own logic and bow to that as has said he that a is imminent that parliament might opt for a as the former leader put or even that it might halt you can see why a the remain camp still has a majority in the when you add up not just the and the liberal democrats but also the estimated 185 who wanted to stay in the if they all united and voted as they did on 23 they could block do that too many would regard it as a constitutional to go against the verdict delivered in the referendum others have a more practical fear of contradicting the wishes of their own local anxious they would pay the price with their own are the judges who ruled that should vote on read that fear will only fully kick in if may presents them with a a motion to trigger article 50 or not if the choice is any less stark than if may proposes detailed legislation then that would give plenty of wriggle room they could say that while the public voted to they did not vote for this of leave that would give the remain majority in parliament the chance to slow things down and demand a much softer other factors could prove decisive the coherence of in parliament now matters if the party can get its act together and unite the demand that remains a member of the single market then it will have real muscle the early signs were not recall that the first public figure to demand the immediate triggering of article 50 was hours after the vote but and others have set a good needs to press the case against hard strongly and other thing to remember is that parliament is not just the commons the lords will have a say too unelected peers thwarting the will of the people may look like a democratic outrage but and the rest can hardly complain the lords are an ancient part of our parliament and parliament as they never stopped reminding us is say if attempt to overturn public trust will fall even those of us who voted leave in order to ensure that our who make political decisions in this this ruling in the high court is a nice irony i personally have a problem with anyone using any democratic or legal means to achieve any political end they want and no doubt that have the right to cancel if they choose to do i would advise them to use their power respectfully and wisely the reputation of the political classes in this country is already very and any attempt to overturn the referendum result is likely to send it down even further with baleful make any difference in the long run is a moot point there are powerful vested interests in the already at work to get the ballot overturned or render it meaningless there are equally powerful interests in the itself who are willing to help them out i bet against them succeeding as the and have referendums in the are flexible friends but that will leave a pertinent question do votes actually count for anything in these or are they merely glorified opinion the public must get a say on the final the conservative commitment to the principles of parliamentary representative it is disappointing that decision had to be made in the court a failure to consult elected representatives of the public on the terms of the negotiation package would undermine the very principles that and fox have championed this will provide some clarity on what has been a completely chaotic showing from the government so will be vital that parliament now works productively together to get the best possible negotiating deal to take to given the strict timetable of exiting the once article 50 is it is critical that the government now lays out its negotiations to before such a vote is held so team have been all over the place when it comes to what is best for and time they pull their socks up and start taking this the people voted for a departure but not for a which is why what really matters is allowing them to vote again on the final giving them the chance to say no to an irresponsible hard that risks our economy and our the appeal is unlikely to succeed twitter prime minister may government has announced that it will appeal against a judgment by a court that restores sovereignty to the parliament to legislate for the legal landscape even for the sake of that just looks bad the vote leave camp campaigned for sovereignty to be restored to the parliament it is symptomatic of their many inconsistencies that they now argue that this crucial decision ought not to be taken by has caused havoc already now parliament must save us read three days of legal the writing was on the wall for the government when it was forced to make the significant concession that article 50 is both unconditional and irrevocable that might be true but it is at least open to challenge legally the irony of the appeal is that it now opens up the box of whether the article 50 question on can be answered only by the court of justice if what sort of delay will that my the government has poor prospects of succeeding in the supreme court the high key reasoning is that the government without the intervention of parliament confer rights on individuals or deprive individuals of there is no answer to this the removal of the ability to seek authoritative rulings of the for is but one material change in our and it may have a profound impact on fundamental and social rights other major rights merely by the arguments i see a comeback to the various fatal gaps in the which the court found to be most fundamental rule of constitutional law is that parliament is and that legislation enacted by both houses of parliament is supreme if means the court has confirmed that only parliament can trigger it both houses of parliament now need to stand up for the national interest and demand accountability from the and for their constituents the courts have done their bit for the rule of law on behalf of all of now needs to do the this is what taking back control really ruling is a huge victory for our parliamentary democracy this is what real sovereignty looks and this is what taking back control really decision is about parliamentary sovereignty and our constitution it is not about leave or remain it is actually about whether we have a sovereign parliament in this and as such the decision is the right got a bill of rights in 1689 which gave parliament powers and took power away from the executive and the monarch those who wanted to leave the campaigned on the basis of parliamentary so it would have been completely inconceivable for the executive to overreach its prerogative powers and trigger article 50 without any form of parliamentary scrutiny or specifically legislated to hold an so it is now important that the government puts its plans before parliament so that can these plans before the decision on triggering article 50 and beginning the this ruling halt but further everyone high court ruling does not mean parliament will prevent they what is they why because they may not get a chance to the judgment is not the end of the there is an appeal to come but assume the supreme court upholds the verdict parliament then would have a right to vote on the triggering of article 50 will they use this opportunity to block the almost certainly the 650 479 are reckoned to have backed remain over half of conservative so there prior to the a parliamentary majority in of remaining but things have changed since 23 for one elected representatives were shown to be out of touch with their 421 of 574 and welsh parliamentary constituencies voted to leave polling that significantly more than of 2015 conservative voters and more than of voters backed leave voting against a referendum result generated by many of their own voters is not something many would willingly countenance court what does it all read most parliament seems likely to do is to impose procedural conditions on the prime minister these may include the need to report back regularly on the negotiations providing the kind of running commentary she has resisted to date yet even it is hard to see how can materially affect the final outcome article 50 lays down a deadline once a deal is they will face a choice between whatever may has achieved and no deal at all there will be no scope to modulate what is on the this is as it should be not as if politics was held in high regard before the referendum i shudder to think what would happen following a unique democratic moment that the population in a way even elections fail a parliament that had approved the legislation providing for the vote decided to overturn it because it had come up with the so to the final irony the chances are this ruling will not halt but further it a judgment hailed by serve merely to place a parliamentary stamp of approval on an outcome they on on via on on on on on this content
the first voter i heard mention name was a mechanic in a small town near my upstate new home it was days after trump announced his and i was at the start of a drive across the united like many trump supporters want his name used or his picture taken an outraged press was loudly mocking trump and he was embarrassed but he was clear why he would vote for trump no dream for anyone who a lawyer or he said we are getting a raw deal immigrants are taking all our i pressed putting over 100 , 000 miles on my i heard a steady and growing crescendo of support for trump one that changed from embarrassment to pride in the early days of the most were like of older whites who had dedicated their lives working in the communities where they were born he owned a gas and spun a long tale of opportunities lost and grievances mostly voiced at many of them arcane and petty he was obtuse about whom to other than a vague but he was emphatic about the need to get this country straight twitter 69 for the i was hearing a rising euphoria for trump from many white i was also hearing an equally loud and growing disbelief from the media most journalists ensconced in their new or offices refused to accept that someone as and crass as trump could appeal to voters trump in many of their were simply dumb or overshadowing any notion that these voters might also have some valid trump started winning the outrage and disbelieve increased i continued my drives around the us and saw a feedback the loud distaste voiced against trump by who they saw as only added to his was like that she was shopping in the goodwill in buying a vacuum cleaner and an electrical stuffed parrot have always like she shy about her situation am she said she also shy about her support for or why yes i am voting for trump tired of politicians he is putting on a great pissing them other bastards off they deserve was like many other towns with their share of enthusiastic trump supporters it had suffered a devastating economic downturn in the and when the cotton gin mills closed other than jobs related to the state it has since offered little opportunity those in town whose lives were not connected to the university lifeline were the trump voters the white people in town like the has long been divided along racial with black residents confined to a lesser choice of and schools and trump was dividing them further twitter 54 for the was shopping in a small store down the road from like every minority voter i talked hated trump would vote for anybody but trump he say he but sure talks that way from my them are the worst had returned to after a period in the military a deeply religious he punctuates every sentence with the am for praise the lord trump will probably start us another war praise the lord and he is a racist praise the twitter months went trump just exploiting and expanding white he was also exposing a divide between those with good and those without a version of the school room front row kids versus back row became if i wanted to talk to a community overwhelmingly supporting i would go to a white town or neighborhood nearest the rusting factory surrounded by razor i wanted to find or or even i would go near a or go to the wealthier neighborhoods near tech or near headquarters of global has changed fundamentally over the last 35 and i saw and heard the impact of those changes had finally started upending a longstanding and ugly racial removing legal barriers that had made the playing field anything but level for minorities overwhelmingly supported the new despite still suffering economically and socially more than white twitter the view from feel let down by their we replaced that system with one based on building a playing field that was tilted dramatically towards anyone with the education the jobs requiring muscle decreased going while the jobs requiring school increased compounding the pain from we started giving the winners a much larger share of the early trump voters i met were the losers from these changes their once superior status based only on being white was being while their lack of education was also being punished they lived in towns and communities devastated by economic upheaval they were born in them and stayed in despite their fall for who had focused on their community over it felt like their entire world was trump gained as he marched towards the his message started to resonate with these entire communities including those that were doing well economically many solidly have or who are suffering more than supporting trump has become a way of showing support for their failing communities it had become entire communities were joining the kids twitter ayers for the guardian this was the case in communities like an town of less than 500 laying in a small break in the hills along the river works in the gas station she was blunt when i asked her about her life is a jobs all left there is nothing here anymore when aluminum factory jobs all she is also blunt about the pain in her life have five kids and two have addictions there is nothing else for kids to do here but drugs no jobs no place to stopped and voted for the first not the second now i am voting for trump we just got to change twitter 52 for the found a similar viewpoint in communities such as west is a and has spent her entire life in her community was born and raised here i am not happy middle class is getting we work for everything and get nothing i hate both of the but i would vote for trump because the war was a disaster why we got to keep invading countries time to take care of ourselves communities are dealing with lost and changing which are no longer a sources of but simply about getting by life for many has become a constant anxiety over upcoming bills they are also dealing with social problems that always follow economic such as families broken children struggling with little eroded and substance abuse a quick salve to either forget or numb the the and helping to morph it into is the false national narrative that the us is a meritocracy where anyone can advance with the right and hence failure is because of being dumb or in communities i the right education is often beyond most people many residents often fail to go beyond high and if they it is an education cobbled together by night classes and community together with a concoction of programs and overwhelming debt all of this is humiliating and and has made the perfect setting for populist politics built on blaming minorities and immigrants and that is what trump has exploited he has come into these communities with white identity a message that is both simple and he will make great is a message that because viewed from these

but it is not a given that the fed will hike in says economist at there is little in the statement to suggest that a hike is definitely going to happen currently pricing in a chance of a the statement

suggests that things are moving in the right but the presidential election is an obvious reason for markets are likely to react with relief given expectations of policy continuity coupled with the reasonably firm rising employment and a gradual in inflation should reinforce market expectations for a rate hike should trump win then this is likely to hurt market sentiment given uncertainty as to what he will actually do when in power it is hard to imagine the fed hiking in this environment we also have plenty more data to come ahead of the 14 including two more job reports so there are other

remains thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation this time there were only two fed dissenters who wanted to raise rates not and who voted for a rise last has now sided with the majority breaking no great the federal reserve has opted to leave us interest rates unchanged just days ahead of the presidential said it was waiting for further

to be a focus as usual on the exact wording of the fed statement and whether it shows any changes from the comments at that meeting seven of the fed members voted for no with and backing an increase any variance here could also give a clue to the likely outcome in investors have been unnerved by suggestions that trump is gaining ground in the us presidential with one poll this week even showing

convinced by polls showing trump in the lead research director at city the markets are not in full on panic mode right suggesting that they still think could clinch a win next week this is reflected

generally lower on but us markets have outperformed their counterparts even with 6 days to go before the us election the transport considered a lead indicator for wall is higher today considering a trump presidency is considered the worst outcome for the us the fact that this index has not fallen further on the back of the bad poll news for the suggests that the us equity market may not sell off

chance of a hike tonight if the fed does that would throw the cat among the and we could see a steeper sell off in a rally in bond yields and a recovery in the in our view the bigger risk from meeting

of a win for trump next week could put the prospect of a rate hike to bed for the fed added to the fed chair and vice chair have given speeches with fairly dovish slants in recent so a in the dollar

have some clues about whether turnout is lower among those groups because more than ballots have already been cast under the us early voting system approximately 125 million to 145 million are

going on with bob family first senator has resigned from the senate in response to the collapse of his business there is a standard procedure for replacing senators who resign but questions have now been raised as to whether day was eligible to be elected at the last election under section 44 of the constitution the answer to these questions will determine who gets to fill did you know and labor wants government answers on bob day fiasco read is section 44 of the 44 governs whether a person is eligible to be elected and serve as a member of the federal parliament on a number of previous occasions and senators have lost their seats after being found to be 44 makes it unconstitutional to sit as a member of parliament if you have an allegiance to a are subject to be sentenced to one year or more in are an undischarged bankrupt or hold an of profit under the or have a pecuniary interest with the public does it affect bob day was in danger of losing his seat if he became bankrupt

the seat will be filled in different ways depending on whether a south was day was eligible to take his and then the seat will be filled according to the standard process family first party will nominate a and a joint sitting of the south state parliament will approve that the high court finds that day was not eligible to take his seat in the first it seems likely that the seat will instead

questioned whether is eligible to receive most of votes parties are required to have two candidates in a group to receive preferences and the family first group only has one when bob day is excluded if family votes are distributed to the next party on the preference labor would win the seat in a close race with one seems unlikely that family first will miss out on the seat due to this technicality a similar issue arose in when the nuclear disarmament party group was reduced to one and the high court ruled that the second candidate could still receive preferences while the law is slightly different this precedent would be and labor query whether bob day 's election to senate was valid read day is not ruled out and family first get to choose the candidate instead of there being a it is very unlikely to opt for with the being chief of and the family first state mp what happens day has been one of the most members of the senate and no guarantee his successor will have the same

trump if history is any indication its of 23 , 500 or has a per capita income of around and of my live below the poverty line one of those places where the coal dried up a few decades ago however depressing it better than it a trump good people in a feedback loop of paranoia and hate read house my children will grow up in was built in 1900 by their paternal belonged to the family ever each generation building on as needed from its original single room there are a few houses like that in the and we moved into this one mostly because we wanted our kids to grow up as he running barefoot through the woods and catching tadpoles in the stream behind the house is still an old place like that not uncommon for friends our age to live in houses recently made available by a family death we buy groceries from a general but miles to the nearest gas station or people here would vote for a villain if they ran on the republican ticket party affiliation is an inherited trait in many families some just like trump he what his supporters which baffles many given what the man but makes perfect sense if you that most of my pay nearly as much attention to politics as writing this and who are reading it many people are uncomfortable with a lot of the stuff heard about him but accept it as a necessary the main thing is to tell elites that not safe in their sinecures any that the common man is about to have his day all gone too far off the the county lies just over the river from west tried to come to but the council voted against it because they want to lose the small businesses lining the main street the company went to mason instead and pointedly positioned its store at the end of the intentionally quaint riverfront downtown now features a rundown some a liquor empty storefronts and a few improbably expensive shops all the tax revenue from the goes to talk about economic insecurity and usually imagining some angry white man upset that someone somewhere a and a woman to is getting more help than him but i picture that where it really matter what the people wanted they made their they got run over anyway a fair description of life in a place like this who admire trump for his business acumen are simply pointing out that no matter the ambiguity about his balance sheets this is a man who flies around on a which to someone making a few hundred dollars a week seems like unimaginable wealth our society values a human based on their material why then are we surprised when many people define and and is a test of fears to the population his slogan about making great again brings memories of last when the downtown bustled and anyone could make a solid assuming they too lazy to present themselves at the mine it ever an easy but it ever this hard difficult to given everything that has happened but trump exploded on to the stage with the first primary debate by telling us that the political system really is as rigged as that politics is about who you can buy and whose influence you can tap we have all known trump said it and where he built his been three years since i wrote a post about poverty trap that went viral and led to a book deal i now have the luxury of paying attention to the world around me but when i look at my hands i see the scars from knives and slicers and hot and i remember the rage that i could not name after a decade and a half of low wages and no because we all say that we live in a meritocracy and we all know but it keeps people sinking regardless it was bound to happen that a candidate running on fear would take us this far into the realm of the unfortunate fact of or at least the kind we practice in the western is that we below are turned against each other there is political value in racial strife as long as we can teach white people to hate nonwhite then we have to worry about poor people they outnumber the rich came to love trump because he speaks openly of the racial strife that politicians have been exploiting and stoking for decades to great electoral effect what people mean when they complain about political after all supposed to hate and fear a bunch of people but not talk about which is nonsensical except in the lens of where perception matters far more than substance twitter what a trump campaign rally reveals about can behave as badly as he wants no worse than people expect from the power elite as seen from is a place where bankers can unfairly foreclose on your house and then get paid by for doing it and then will demand you sign the bill his business shenanigans register as shocking because assumed that to get even close to that level already sold your just how it works none of the bankers went to and now the banks pay the equivalent of 37 years of the median wage in this county per speech to lecture for year 2016 will be political in the way you can say and people think of and bear and bailouts there will be and after this year is forcing us to grapple with a lot of realities been conscientiously avoiding trump will still walk away from this thing a winner by his lights if wins not leader of with a reputation left in pitiful dirty but as head demagogue have millions of adoring fans and a revenue stream he will avoid responsibility for what is to and rage and fear and hate are all closely unleashing them all in an unexamined pulsating mass of megalomania was at best we have already seen and we will see was bound to happen eventually that a candidate running on fear and division would take us this far into the realms of the unacceptable we stop it now the only thing we can do the thing we must if we are to save ourselves is begin to understand that if the system is broken for enough of us that we can together insist on changes that suit the instead of merely those candidates and donors who can afford to buy all the rivals they see on a primary people think trump will fix anything but a lot are willing to vote for him because whatever you think of

tony former editor has a nickname for him was how put it in the new director faces fury for cryptic letter about email inquiry read there have been many behind the rise and rampage of trump included the republican with its years of divisiveness and racially charged the with its collective chase of the next shiny and the baby feeling the cultural and economic ground give it was who sparked this strange political creature into life as the ghostwriter of bestselling 1987 book the art of the he did more than anyone to create the public persona in it he translated coarse ramblings into charming straight talk and came up with the phrase which captures brilliantly an approach to business and politics in which everything is the the most beautiful helped give trump the sweet smell of success now seemingly irresistible to millions of people clinging to the been he says the nearly 30 years after the book was the main thing i felt i want to be as far away from this man as i but i feel i created because he was a real estate developer and reality television star who it that consequential to the building on the foundation of the art of the trump spent a decade hosting the reality show the reinforcing his image as a preternatural businessman with the power to say blurring the boundaries between reality and reality just as he would throughout the presidential many supporters say they trust him to run like a the business of is business it was no coincidence that he launched his presidential campaign at trump a marbled cathedral of capitalism in he is a man who is a chameleon and have any core beliefs beyond his own and simply think that much about it until he decided to run for president and it became clear that this going to just fade that he was actually in a position to win the nomination when i my contributed to creating the public image of the man who is and people he were writing the art of the deal call it told the in an interview that broke decades of silence on the matter certainly felt a kind of moral imperative to step in and say what i knew about a man i considered to be so and i am very relieved that i trump he observed was vulgar and a narcissistic liar with a short attention no appetite for reading books and an business record a trump presidency he lead to martial the end of press freedom and the risk of nuclear dangerous worse than i imagined when he began to run unthinkable horrifying way more out of control in the last couple of months than ever seen him he have any core beliefs beyond his own and twitter tony with photographer and trump at the book party for the art of the deal at trump in 1987 fell into writing the book almost by accident a liberal journalist in he wrote a scathing magazine article on only to receive a note from the ever greedy for saying he liked it when went to interview him for trump said he wanted to write an even though he was only 38 suggested instead a book called the art of the deal trump agreed and said he should write series trumps presidential election in two cities read a high mortgage and a second child on the needed the money he struck his own a joint half of the advance and half the royalties it paid off in financial if not spiritual the art of the deal sold more than a million copies and spent 13 weeks atop the new times bestseller at the felt he was selling but to say he feels regret alone would be too simple spent a long time thinking about why i did he muses the only choice i made that not proud of in my life a complicated question to say whether i would do it differently today and if i knew everything i know about what would happen to of course i do it the complexity is that the experience of writing that book was so in a negative that it led me to change my life dramatically and move from a focus on being successful and earning more money to really exploring what a meaningful life looks quit journalism and set up a consulting the energy which aims to boost productivity with healthier workplaces spent 30 years doing stuff proud that not sure i would have gotten to if i written that book it gave me such a profound experience of the wrongness the direction of my life was taking so does good things and bad things over the course of a life if you get to the age i am and feel good about the life hard to i wish done this differently or that maybe i have landed where i delivered an address to the oxford union in the last with the title the belly of the how trump led me on the path to he are the consequences of the choices you make that you to but can little imagine potentially huge remains to be seen who else will find a moment of after election day on 8 probably not the facing bitter infighting after hostile takeover it will also be a time for the media to look at itself closely last the republican candidate bush told press playing you guys like a fiddle by saying outrageous things and garnering chairman of network may not be good for but damn good for by march trump was already estimated to have earned of media attention there will be hard questions over the thousands of hours of airtime he has been given and whether his bigotry should have been called out rather than and mainstreamed i was a reporter for many years driven by the story to write about policies just as has often been in thrall to newspapers have shown their mettle with a series of investigations and exposures the new times obtained records showing the billionaire may not have paid tax for 18 years then the post revealed a 2005 video in which trump bragged about groping women says he did not witness in 18 months shadowing this opened the floodgates for a dozen women to come forward with allegations of sexual assault or unwanted think my journey

done not with people it is expensive and it has unquantified risks when all three of those are operating there is no business model that you can establish i think what is much more likely to unfold is the government wants to go to and other companies want to build the spaceship and pays them for it their business model is selling to the is some debate around what life might look like elsewhere in the there might be intelligent life in the form of artificial intelligence or microbes your like it all if earth is any kind of example at then most life find would be microbial but consider also that

the only way you can undo what people think is but is to vote them out of the have climate change finally been are we all on the same tweeted a couple of weeks ago something that seemed to resonate with people it was something truths are established by objective truths are established by evidence and political truths are established by incessant so you can make anything true that you as long as you repeat it all the time so trump keeps calling her just part of her new name now the first bit is her second name is you repeat this often enough and then you go interview trump supporters and they a new political truth has arisen simply by repetition with the only way you can undo what people think is but is to vote them out of do you think of the i have a slightly different view never see me complaining about someone who is running for office never the issue is not who is or even what their thoughts are the issue is that your fellow citizens are thinking one way versus another in the elections so if you like your gripe is not with trump just a person your gripe is with the of the electorate that wants to vote for him who you should be talking to if people think they are voting in their own interests but are not then they need to be trained how to think about claims made by roasted rapper bob over his claims about a flat earth on are too many people out there to waste that kind of energy so why was he because he has millions of twitter followers and he invoked physics to show the earth was flat those are fighting so then i looked at the tweets where he said got physics and then i posted my tweets saying you need some more physics and then i showed people how to calculate it all and where he went wrong but i would rather train people to think straight in the first place than fix them when it is sometimes too all quantum weirdness about daily read said you are flattered and disturbed after posting various people tweet back wondering if on is that just because your tweets reflect thoughts about the thoughts i have every day are the kind of thoughts others might only have in a in a pub after a couple of beers when they are contemplating their but we do this all the time in the in the wake of there has been a lot of talk of being in a environment how do you feel about that is how you then that is the beginning of the end of an informed democracy watch other countries rise up as you not only lag but regress all the growth economies will be elsewhere because innovation and science and technology and investments in what are objectively truths are the foundations of economies if you reject it then you will be forfeiting everything that such a great nation has worked so hard to obtain my point is that if you do not embrace objective just move back

how is everyone ready for 8 i was asked to speak about a vision for the next hundred years of reproductive choice and justice such a wonderful frame to think about what a feminist future might look like but i bet like a lot of hard to imagine what the next hundred years will look like when so much of for women will depend on what happens in just 18 is no overstating how important this election is not just about the next four or eight years this decision is about sending a message about who we are as a and setting a very particular course for the women who live here look back on this time as a watershed a moment that in shape the next hundred years of first i want to share a personal story a little over six years i was pregnant with my and when i was 28 weeks i got incredibly ill i developed which some of you might know is dangerously high blood pressure during was admitted to the hospital and within just a few i developed another complication called the short version being my liver was in danger of and i was in danger of dying if my daughter was not had an emergency and was born weighing she stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first two months of her undergoing medical interventions to save and protect her that to this day i try to avoid thinking about but i was and she was and today a wonderful healthy and i feel grateful for that every share this story because this was something in my life that changed me that shaped who i am when i think about this what i think about most often is how fortunate i was that i got sick far enough along in my pregnancy that i faced with the reality of needing an abortion to save my when i think about those days in the hospital the the the the stress the idea that the government could ever become involved in my most pivotal it horrifies one thing i want for the next hundred i want for no to fear that their most personal life choices will be made by someone want for no to be afraid that her scariest life moment will be made even more difficult and traumatic by government the next hundred i want to see every woman be free from the fear that her body is not really her why i want to talk about this election tonight because at before in politics have bodies been so front and center in the national conversation and so at are choosing between a candidate who has spent her political career fighting for reproductive and a candidate who says that women who have abortions need to be punished a candidate who said this week in the final debate unequivocally that she will defend planned and a candidate who promised to choice between a person who has spent her life in public and a businessman who rips off his perhaps most making a decision between a woman who has said that rights are human and a man who says if you want you can just grab women the a feminist rallying cry right now that i like a and it pussy grabs i know that so much has been made of that and the ensuing allegations against trump by multiple women that he did just what he bragged about doing on that while some people may not see the link between sexual assault and reproductive those of us here in this room know know that there is a direct connection between those who think they can touch bodies without permission and those who think they can legislate our bodies reproductive rights and justice has always been about a fundamental respect or in this disrespect of bodily integrity and our bodies are our or make no the conversation that having right now about is not just salacious media fodder the way we come out of this moment the direction our culture shifts because of it will absolutely determine rights in the future we are witnessing a moment where our country could move backwards back to a place where will be and men will make decisions for women or towards a future where our culture and politics understand and respect women as autonomous full human are the two optimistic that on the right one the one that brings us to the feminist future all of us in this room have been waiting for when trump said he wanted to punish women for having there was outrage and he had to walk back those comments but more activists and organizations like planned parenthood were there to point out that while other politicians may not say they want women to be exactly what would happen if abortion were made in what has already happened to women like who was put in prison for inducing her own abortion in feminist future has no place for criminalizing women who decide if and when to trump claimed that what he said on that access tape was just and later when former new city mayor said that all men talk like men across the country came out to is not normal this is not acceptable men are better than this the feminist future that fighting for has men fighting alongside of men who refuse to be insulted by antiquated and sexist ideals about what it means to be a trump claimed that the women who have accused him of sexual assault were not attractive enough to warrant his unwanted when he called women when he called women the media who can so often get things wrong took him to our feminist future is not one where misogyny will go unchecked women have been disparaged and harassed for too many and not going to take one more minute of it course this feminist future the future that so close to getting not just being hinted at by the reaction and opposition to are getting a sense of what that future could look like when we see the incredible way feminists and women themselves have changed the for the first time a presidential candidate offered a nuanced and empathetic defense of abortions on a national debate stage this is a issue that most politicians but talked about lives and experiences in a way that reminded us that this issue just about policy about living in a moment when feminism is wielding more cultural power than it has in maybe ever people shy away from the word feminism any they embrace i started speaking on college campuses 10 years i would ask how many people in the room considered themselves feminists back just a few people would raise their hands when i speak at colleges nearly everyone has become so popular that the conservative right has tried to appropriate it calls herself a organizations call themselves the feminists they recognize the power that the word and the movement and they want to use it toward their very our feminist future is a smart and it knows that anyone who would legislate who would interfere in and private medical decisions have no place calling themselves being in this incredible feminist moment when the first female president is about to win by taking down a man who is as close to a caricature of misogyny as you can get being in this moment mean that our feminist future is not those of us who have been doing this work for years know that every time women make political and cultural there is an intense backlash in the midst of it and it will only intensify if becomes sure that this backlash define us that we are not put on the defensive by it that is what will truly determine our feminist future will we get pushed back on our heels or will we look straight ahead and move will we rest on our laurels because we have the first woman president or will we take our moment to celebrate and then move on to the hard work that still needs to be the people in this and the people at planned parenthood are any indication we know the answer to those is just the daughter tells me that she wants children one day she says she want to be pregnant her wife will have the but when she talks about having when i think about being a grandmother or a even one day when i think about those hundred years that been talking think about what the world will be like for them and i have i really that it will be a world that this will be a country where people determine their own world where we understand that reproductive rights are not just an issue of bodies but an economic a family and a human rights issue and the reason i have faith that future generations will see this vision of feminism and justice unfold is because of activists like you all here because of planned parenthood every day they are ensuring that the next hundred years will be years where bodies and experiences matter years where not defending ourselves from but building something progressive and something of you in this room are doing what is necessary to ensure that feminist future i could not be more grateful to and i could not be more honored to join that fight with on on via on on on on on this content
