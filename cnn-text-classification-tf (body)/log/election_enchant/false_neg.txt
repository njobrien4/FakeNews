for his second john a journalist with extensive experience in has taken a microscope to an enormous the relationship between the united states and from to the present with growing stress points in that relationship and the emergence of strongman leaders in both the beautiful country and the middle arrives during a precarious inflection point it is peppered with characters that uses to trace a long historical from a to a prominent and henry m the former united states treasury secretary is scheduled to speak about his book on at the politics and prose bookstore in in an he discussed the history of interactions between the united states and president xi and what china policy might emerge from the trump administration what has been the overarching paradigm of united relations from the century to and have been enchanting each other and disappointing each other since they first met in when the first ship landed in with a cargo of ginseng and silver to trade for tea if a pattern to the it has been rapturous enchantment followed by despair right are in the disenchantment phase of the as are the you tell many colorful anecdotes of and in contact with each other which one do you think best reflects the wider one of the main goals of the book was to bring to light stories of unchronicled influence on both sides the first minister to the court in was a young republican named was a radical abolitionist who was dispatched to by the administration believed that the west needed to give china time to develop and modernize and stop pressuring china to change he believed that the west had no right to for the way china treated and he argued that western officials should tolerate the habit of maintaining that their emperor actually ruled the entire world to encapsulates one side of the view of one that reappeared in the and lasted up through the beginning of the administration the or rather the bet that china would liberalize and become more like us as long as we facilitated its rise in opposition to other believed his views on china as one of his successors in put a that also has formed a key part of the perspective on china your book discusses the way governments in the two nations have interacted with each but you also go into detail on the roles that notable nonpolitical figures have played to what extent does the united relationship depend on the attitudes of each leaders versus those of other whether they are from the elite classes or the grass in many we and the and our elites and those from the grass are captives of our past in the beginning of the individual and created the relationship and imbued it with much of its meaning merchants and missionaries saw china as a vast market for stuff and for souls saw as a place that could save china from the depredations of other imperialist nations with its educational as a model for china to emulate at the same other groups of feared the starting in the late oppressed workers in starting a long history of fearing the industriousness of the had their own prejudices against and ideas as viewing them as sexually deviant and dangerous many of these dreams and fantasies and biases we have about each other have resurfaced in subsequent decades in claim that china has been the united states when it comes to one can hear the populists of the party in late railing on the streets of against heathen in your many years as a journalist in what were the most notable changes you saw in the united with is less willing to bend to will than before and more willing to aggressively pursue its whether they involve trade or the south china sea spent decades arguing that as china strengthened it would become more like a liberal western nation it turned out that and as such the has stopped doing china any favors much more than it is blocking the sales of western companies to firms and strengthening its alliances with nations around periphery the careful balance of containment and engagement that defined policy toward china is now heavily skewed toward containment what are your thoughts on president xi and how the united states fits into xi has said he wants to rule which i think can be translated into a desire to see china rule in this the is an interloper and would do best to retreat to and let china handle the western pacific china benefited greatly from the in the but now xi feels that china does not need the to protect it anymore it wants the out of not next not the year but one day soon with the election of trump as the next united states where do you see the relationship trump is not an when it comes to his views on china they are but so were and those of many of his predecessors during the trump seesawed between accusing china of the united states on threatening to walk away from alliances in east and thereby ceding the western pacific to and mulling the idea of some type of with china where the would accept rise if china did not endanger the status quo in trump will enter office against a backdrop of an facing a dictator in north and a china eager to capitalize on missteps how he juggles and his own competing mix of disappointment and realism about china will help determine the future of the relationship and the future of the globe if i had to i think he is going to be more pragmatic than many initially but prognostication is a tough especially when it comes to china and trump
if you are a close observer of the new as you might have noticed a headline about the fox news anchor it suggested that she had at age leaving us without favorite news this a news story written by a times reporter and it is alive and exceptionally so but it has with some on the times as an advertisement pretending to be a news story in other fake or at least a version of it a times reader from has been noticing the ad awhile and wrote me this week to complain or keeps popping up on various new times pages she said is unacceptable please stop these which frankly make me feel like the times is no better an outlet than the horrifying feeds with all of their fake news how could such fraudulent content wind up on the times through something called programmatic which essentially means that computers and algorithms conduct the transactions between advertisers and publishers rather than people machine to like a stock market matching buyers with sellers both the newsroom and its advertising department have rules that forbid misleading or otherwise worrisome ads from appearing on the site but it is difficult to apply those rules when computers are serving up the ads without a sales rep on the other end of the transaction screening out the misfits a senior vice president in says the times works aggressively to squash ads like the one that made the false claim but the nature of the mechanized system means that most of the policing is done after the fact once the ad has already appeared the ad has now been reported and taken down says another ad that fell into the same category was also removed recently says the times has one of the cleanest ad experiences in the publishing business i agree relative to the size of the site and the volume of the times have many ads that tout the premature demise of newscasters or make false claims about remedies when fraudulent ads do pop up and especially true now that the firing squads are out trying to punish those responsible for publishing during the election and are the prime because critics say they recklessly let their platforms be used by the who create fake news mark hoping to hose down the says his company is taking steps to curtail the flow of fabricated content onto its in an editorial this the times piled warning that its proposed changes go far enough and warning of the danger that awaits if to let liars and con artists hijack his as measured by sheer there is no comparison between a handful of ads on the times website and an endless gush of fake news stories that get shared by millions on one is a the other is an ocean but there are similarities too both organizations find themselves in the position of unwittingly publishing fake content that misleads and annoys and that can diminish a brand ads like the one may not be rampant at the but still worth taking a good look at whether the times is really doing everything it can to eliminate them particularly true at a moment when fake news is such a flash and when the times is dispensing advice to another publisher on how to solve its problems

if you think back to this presidential campaign and recall a lot of articles mentioning email troubles and j various you be wrong if it seems there were fewer articles about the economy and because there were the temptation to blame news organizations for this imbalance is but there is at least some reason to resist it critics have long assailed campaign coverage as focused too much on candidate campaign strategy and assessments of instead of on policies and ideas but this the candidates share the blame i compared the content of campaign ads with the content of news articles about two specific candidate traits or and the economy or jobs both the candidates and news organizations spent more time discussing the fitness for office lack of than they did the economy and the imbalance grew more lopsided as the election approached using analytic tools provided by crimson i categorized the campaign news coverage of media outlets this consisted of four broadcast three cable news national public radio and on the two news and newspapers i specifically searched for news about campaign and her email server or her campaign and and several controversies connected to campaign things like trump the khan family and the i also looked for news about the campaign appeals on the economy and jobs this list but it gives a sense of the between coverage of these controversies and the economy the controversies received more on than their views on the economy from until election percent of the stories mentioned various and percent mentioned email only percent mentioned trump and jobs or the and only percent cited campaign and the economy closer to the from the numbers got even more lopsided this was an important date just after the release of the video and a few weeks before director b letter to congress from this percent of the campaign articles mentioning either controversies or the economy discuss while only percent mention her alongside jobs or the economy as for percent mention his while percent mention him related to jobs and the economy the imbalance in coverage of the character is as is the lack of coverage about the economy compared with the controversies moving one week past the video between and election roughly half of the stories about scandals and the economy mentioned and only a quarter discussed trump and his imbroglios a mere percent of the stories in these last three weeks mentioned and the economy percent mentioned trump and the these choices have consequences according to the reports of what they heard or read about between and were mainly references to her handling of emails during her time as secretary of state in mentions of trump changed week by tracking what was happening on the campaign trail but before anyone blames the news important to examine what the candidates themselves were talking about over the course of the campaign if media reports reflect candidate discourse then it is not merely the media choosing to report on scandals it might be at least as much the choosing to campaign on them that results in unending coverage of traits and characteristics to figure out if this was the i used data from on all the campaign ads aired between and election day i coded all of the appeals in each ad and weighted the appeals by how many times the ads ran on television made more ads than and she vastly running nearly three times as many ads as he did all over half a million ads were run in during this period the content of the ads is revealing both candidates spent most of their television advertising time attacking the other character in the losing ads did little else more than of the appeals in advertisements nearly half of were about characteristics or dispositions only percent of appeals in her ads were about jobs or the economy by percent of appeals focused on the taxes and trade since the start of presidential campaign television advertising in no campaign has made percent of its television ad appeals about any single topic on traits typically garner about percent of the appeals the economy typically generates about percent of the appeals usually much more balance of this was an unusual election with two very unpopular so the flaws may have simply been too big a story for either them or the media to pass up whatever the the criterion of fitness for office dominated the messaging and made up a good share of the trump messaging as and the news media covered it
the election has resurrected the fiasco of how to fix and mac shares of the two mortgage agencies have rocketed over the last two weeks on hopes that the trump administration might end government oversight big political roadblocks though and which buy or guarantee home needed billion of taxpayer aid in the financial crisis and were placed under government debates about whether to reduce their role went nowhere because they play a large role in the mortgage market allowing them to shake off their government training wheels is a long way off even representative a republican and the house financial services committee reckons his plan to do so is a long shot worries about hurting the housing and in turn angering are strong enough that some republican lawmakers would probably join their democratic rivals in opposing any such attempt there is one relatively easy that could please most allowing and to keep their earnings since they have been forced to hand over all profit as dividends to the treasury so they have sent none of which counts toward repaying the bailout that would allow them to rebuild their capital they currently have just million each set aside against a total of trillion of loans on their and that is scheduled to fall to zero in that raises the embarrassing prospect of one or both of them having to go cap in hand to uncle for another bailout in even a mild housing downturn avoiding that ought to appeal to lawmakers a john and other hedge fund managers who bought and stock after the crash have been pushing for this for some too including in the courts j ascendancy to the white house has emboldened not least because a former partner who is a leading candidate to become treasury was a with in the mortgage lender it after its collapse and selling it last year to cit ending and status as an for the government would still leave their bailout unpaid and their future status unresolved but it would be a smart first step
there was no avoiding fearful memories of the nuclear disaster of on morning after a powerful earthquake off the coast of caused a cooling system in a nuclear plant to leaving more than spent uranium fuel rods at risk of overheating but this the electric power or the utility that operates three nuclear restored the cooling pump at the plant in about an hour and a half the plant is about seven miles south of the ruined plant where three reactors melted down five years ago after tsunami waves inundated the power station and knocked out backup generators reported that it never lost power at either the plant or its neighbor to the north after the which had a magnitude of according to the weather service took the regular actions that we should take when handling acting general manager of the nuclear power division at said at a news conference on the company was prepared for big having built sea walls rising to about feet at the plants and enclosing backup generators in waterproof said critics of which struggled to keep on top of a crisis that unfolded over the weeks that followed the calamity in said they were relieved that there had been no immediate damage but they said they remained skeptical that the company had done enough to prepare for a disaster on the scale of the earthquake five years ago that which had a magnitude of set off tsunami waves as high as feet in some places highest waves on reached about looks like the right things have been said director of the future design institute at the institute of technology and a volunteer researcher with an independent group you never know until something happens as far as this morning they did a decent but mainly because it that big of an earthquake or that big of a building higher sea for all but that is like fighting the last brown said remains to be seen how well prepared they would be for some other unusual combination of compared with five years has improved its communication with the reporting information about the cooling pump at almost as it happened on morning the company also quickly said that it had suspended the treatment and transfer of contaminated water from the where an extensive cleanup and decommissioning process is underway by the those operations had been restored i can say is response was decent and they seemed to be said director of the research center for nuclear weapons abolition at university he it would be difficult to independently verify claims because the nuclear regulation authority depends on the company to release information he added that he was not convinced that was being fully transparent about its particularly about the cleanup at the plant should be informed fully whether this operation is reasonably done with cost effectiveness and safety and making sure that the best technology is being said a spokesman for the nuclear regulation said the agency had offices on the sites of the nuclear plants and worked with and other utility companies on to confirm that the power stations were safe after the earthquake regarding the nuclear experts expressed concern about the safety of the cleanup operation at the plant the melted cores of three reactors have yet to be removed as they are still too radioactive for workers to approach since the groundwater seeps into the reactors daily the contaminated by the melted fuel needs to be treated and stored on site so has built more than tanks of about tons each the tanks are inspected four times a day to confirm that they do not said of and in an effort to halt the flood of groundwater into the damaged the company has built an underground wall of frozen dirt nearly a mile in length encircling the reactors the wall is not yet fully and groundwater continues to flow into the reactors critics worry that the sea walls or storage tanks might not withstand a more powerful earthquake or tsunami and incident at the reactor showed that quakes can set off problems even at plants that are not operating most of the plants remain closed since the but the administration of prime minister wants to restart most of them a majority of the public is opposed to such a move candidates for governor who ran campaigns opposed to the revival have won elections in recent months in two prefectures that host nuclear plants according to the a the chairman of and the were planning to meet on with one of those of to try to persuade him to support a restart of the plant there and returned to after the earthquake who oversaw an independent investigation on the nuclear accident for the said that building walls and storage tanks failed to solve the underlying problem of an country relying on nuclear power he both the government and utility companies should invest in developing alternative sources of power like solar or wind technology think we expect more of such readjusting plate movements and that has been reasonably and many volcanic activity and earthquakes have been rampant over the last five said an adjunct professor at the national graduate institute for policy studies why are we continuing to restart nuclear
i love telling people from maybe my defense mechanism for when people accuse me of being a coastal out of touch with real i like fulfilling all the stereotypes i love cheese and cheese of course i love our sports teams out of a vague sense of and my accent hard comes out in full force after ah beers mostly i love my who has called home for years her parents immigrated to from and she started public school without knowing a word of she forgot most of the her parents taught her years but taught me the words to the that we would sometimes hear when my family would go to a night fish fry up until i still believed my moral baseline bent toward empathy the i thought i where i lived for was filled with complex but fundamentally decent people who recognized that everyone is deserving of respect and could disagree without being disagreeable the state did elect walker as governor in and the legislature gutted setting off huge protests in the capitol but i think that state would vote for j turning its electoral votes to a republican for the first time since come we even voted for as much as trump won the election in lost it her which prided itself on employing all the data wizards and ground game gurus money can did not do nearly enough to lock down the upper particularly and and instead treated those states as a given is the mayor of capital in cerulean county he supported senator sanders in the democratic and said he talked at least once a week with a field organizer from the sanders campaign during the primary but once locked up the it was radio silence from the campaign i first held elected office in the early virtually every presidential been either by the candidate or by a he told me not saying this to say important but the point not only she in the but i never got a a anything after the president by made two campaign stops in during the including a huge rally with on the before election day frustration with the campaign was apparent understand the strategy never seen an explanation for other than assuming that they wanted not just a but a smashing victory the kind that trump he said voter turnout in was the lowest been in years roughly fewer democrats voted in county this year than did in the drop in turnout in county might be partially attributed to a voter identification law in the state in a federal judge found that roughly registered voters in lacked the necessary photo id card to vote under the new and a of those voters were low income election watchers have said the voter id law alone could not have flipped the state in favor did not visit once after the democratic national convention in neither did president or sanders made multiple trips to the state on behalf of but that was not enough to gin up enthusiasm like most of the my friends and family in were shocked that trump won the and the election my mom says still in my dad has progressed comfortably to anger my has been coping with the election result with characteristic wit listening to trump speeches about i was convinced to she emailed me i hate throughout the general the surrogates appeared reassured to the point of hubris that they would be able to convert moderate republican voters in suburbs every democrat we lose in western we will pick up two moderate republicans in the suburbs in and you can repeat that in and and new senator chuck said in this line of thinking was not just but disastrously so in won of counties this counties voted for trump republicans successfully built on the map that helped to elect walker to the mansion while the campaign was looking to run up the score in states like and a triumvirate of republicans also helped elect both actively and passively there is who worked his way up from republican politics in to head the republican national and to serve as chief of staff then there is house speaker d who now has a historic opportunity to pass his agenda through congress recovered from his own failed presidential will now oversee the republican governors association is a longtime radio host in who became a voice on the right for the movement after years on the he will retire from his radio show this year along with being a vocal opponent of the trump he has taken on a new role as chief apologizer for media he expressed frustration with his he had gradually grown immune to any inconvenient fact presented to them while he read news from the politico and national review throughout the his audience seemed to glean most of its news from fox talk radio and their feeds on his radio program last played a sound bite of s current head of the national security suggesting the government had made a to sway the election in favor asked his we all agree that this is a big deal and we ought to do something about he opened the phone and the first call was from who believe it i believe any of sighed break through he said is way harder to knock that stuff down than you would he says he is but not to see conservative media falling in line and supporting cabinet picks is the monster he said of the worst elements of the conservative media have now been empowered every one of them has got a strut now has a pipeline to the white house i think about spent half of arguing that conservatism was fundamentally incompatible with what trump was offering his party conservatism has been i in being aggressive but and very and also proving that you can do things and be rewarded by the he said trump
for the last four new democrats have had to contend with an in a state senate with slightly more democrats than there are how do the republicans manage to hold a the answer often lies with one rogue senator who votes with the republicans and whose heavily overwhelmingly orthodox district in voted just as overwhelmingly for j trump to the endless has never once caucused with members of his own defecting to the other side of the aisle within days of being elected in this the long electoral migraine did not lift with absentee ballots in two close races on long island still being counted to settle the final senate the democrats would need to win at least one of lure back the independent democratic conference which has teamed up with the republicans to govern the senate for several years and reclaim in order to form a working majority but declined to come revealing on night that he would remain a republican in senate allegiance if not in telling the political television program that he would to have a compelling reason to the republican caucus the mainstream he had fallen short who ran on the republican as well as the conservative and democratic ballot lines for the first time this said the republicans had not promised him anything as the voter rolls have the district which is dominated by and other orthodox residents in the borough and neighborhoods is heavily the better to register influence in city democratic which often determine the outcome of general elections but party affiliation often bows to parochial concerns many of whom send their children to want the state to provide tuition assistance for religious among other and senate republicans have been far more receptive to taking measures that would benefit religious education than the democrats the district went for a by large margins it was also an easy pickup for mitt four years ago allegiance is to their foundational religious practices and not necessarily party said a political consultant who has worked on several races involving orthodox communities democratic leaders have considered trying to oust in a primary battle but his popularity in the district makes him all but immune to challenges said they primary they could say goodbye to any possible rapprochement in the democrats responded on to decision with overt appeals to party unity a given how important going to be to hold the line at the state level against what we expect to be very draconian efforts out of that likely to have a majority of the senate be elected democratic and still not be able to said senator n of who serves as the chief political strategist a spokesman for the said of look forward to continuing to work with him to move this state without the mainstream democrats would need to win the contested long island races and strike a deal with senator d the leader of the independent democrats emerging from election day without much clarity on which party would end up with a numerical both as so often have hastened to pay court to and before ending the suspense about his met with senator the county democrat who leads the mainstream as well as john j the republican senate majority saying as recently as last week that he would join whichever side offered him the he also got a call from gov m a in his efforts to position new as a liberal foil to may have a greater interest than usual in installing a true democratic majority

a student in in western state of said he had to stand in line for six hours to exchange rupee notes banned by the government this month by the time he got to the the bank had run out of new bills a software engineer in the capital of said had to stand in but he felt it was worth it least for some black money holders will live in fear for coming next for he wrote prime minister move to ban and notes about and was an effort to crack down on corruption and tax avoidance but it caught the country by surprise and forced many to scramble to exchange their bills and secure enough cash for their daily needs some affluent who had stockpiled large amounts of cash have resorted to creative methods to quickly spend their money we asked to tell us how the move affected them and their families more than people responded here is a selection of the which have been edited run an ad and my clients have stopped all work there is an air of uncertainty and desperation i had to pull my staff away from other important work in order to make them stand in queues day in and day just to be able to get some cash to manage of my transactions are or using my debit so in terms of been little change dealing with street vendors for is a whole different story we now have to buy where prices are far higher and quality is not necessarily move was a rude shock to those who were comfortably sitting on their pile of black for essentials has become a parents are both above the age of and do not own credit or debit cards they withdraw large sums of money at a time and use them for household expenses so as to limit the multiple trips to the bank they both are not physically able to even stand in a but they did cannot buy things from nearby shops anymore because they have bills of higher denomination so we head to malls or supermarket where we can pay using credit card and debit cards small businesses have taken a at least are able to manage some emergencies by making payments but to think of the plight of all the laborers and workers is highly my it was bit of a discomfort my father had to take one full day off from his work to deposit and exchange old bills that he had same goes for my grandparents local vegetable vendors stopped setting up stalls as they have cash to buy from farmers even though they have new bills of they use them unless the other person has enough cash to return the my family has not been affected much yet we managed to deposit the or so we had in cash into our local as the bank queue had already grown large live in a rural with a small town about four miles away where everyone goes to do most of their weekly shopping as of the shopkeepers are still accepting the old notes as a and we have done most of our shopping either through those or on credit problems probably start coming some time though as we near the deadline of shops will stop accepting the old cash usage has always been minimal i was barely affected my parents who live in a smaller city faced very few problems the lines outside banks disappeared within a couple of days and things are back to normal most small shops have started accepting digital wallets or credit am not a very big fan of but i totally support this move as we see everyday how corruption cripples our main goal of this move is to bring the shadow economy inside the mainstream economy needs to expand its gross domestic product to lift people out of poverty the shadow economy yield taxes but any transaction done leaves an audit and it becomes impossible to hide illicit wealth is moving to the future where payments will be made i agree with prime minister and this move is such a decisive act of considering all the political risks and economic variables i voted him in to take tough and he is doing just cost of doing illegal business will i agree with the motive behind the i really question whether the government was prepared to implement the new scheme the government seems to be changing the policy every which feels like making it up as they go along better preparation would have made this so much easier the worst affected are those who even have bank making it so much harder to change their money to get hardly any grocer has electrical payment methods are we people bearing this we are not keeping stashes of money under our bed no bad deposited all my old notes into my account at a private bank and then withdrew an amount for meeting my daily cash expenses the process was relatively and quick move seems unlikely to change the practice of relying on cash the systems and sources that give rise to untaxed wealth remain the same as before once the immediate cash liquidity situation is things will revert to the earlier in due course it is the people who are used to corruption and tax avoidance scrapping notes will not change basic

a panel of three federal judges said on that the redrawing of state assembly districts to favor republicans was an unconstitutional partisan the first such ruling in three decades of pitched legal battles over the issue federal courts have struck down gerrymanders on racial but not on grounds that they unfairly give advantage to a political party the more common form of gerrymandering the case could now go directly to the supreme where its fate may rest with a single m who has expressed a willingness to strike down partisan gerrymanders but has yet to accept a rationale for it should the court affirm the it could upend the next round of state in for congressional and state elections most of which is likely to be conducted by legislatures that have swept into power in recent years is a huge said heather a law school professor and an expert on election law everyone has waited for the supreme court to do something on this front now one of the lower courts has the debate this were to be a nationwide would look quite she for the several scholars said the ruling was especially significant because it for the first a clear mathematical formula for measuring partisanship in a something that had been missing in previous assaults on gerrymandering the ruling by the united states district court for the western district of said that the remapping violated both the first amendment and the equal protection clause of the amendment because it aimed to deprive democratic voters of their right to be represented natural political geography plays some role in the apportionment the court simply does not explain adequately the sizable disparate of republican gains in the state assembly after the boundaries were redrawn the judges who ruled in favor of the ripple and were nominated to the bench by presidents and jimmy carter judge nominated by president w dissented the boundaries of both federal and state legislative districts are redrawn every years after the census to ensure that each district contains roughly the same number of a standard the supreme court set with its ruling in but both republican and democratic majorities in statehouses often remap districts to favor either by cramming opposition voters into a single district or by dividing them so they are the majority in fewer tactics called and courts have generally agreed that some partisan advantage in redistricting is in part because voters themselves are not spread equally across a state or district by party but the plaintiffs in the state democrats represented by the campaign legal had argued that the remapping was among the most sharply partisan in the nation their lawsuit said that in the elections for the republicans won percent of the vote but took percent of the seats a key question in as in past challenges to was whether that division was unacceptably a question that previous courts have stumbled over has come up with a standard to measure constitutionality how to distinguish between evil partisanship versus the natural advantage one party might have as a result of where voters happened to said the director of the election law project at state college of law in the court was swayed by a new and simple mathematical formula to measure the extent of partisan called the efficiency gap the formula divides the difference between the two votes beyond those needed by a winning and votes cast by a losing side by the total number of votes cast when both parties waste the same number of the result is zero an ideal solution but as a winning party wastes fewer and fewer votes than its its score rises a truly efficient gerrymander spreads a winning votes so evenly over districts that very few votes are wasted a review of four decades of state redistricting plans concluded that any party with an efficiency gap of percent or more was likely to keep its majority during the years before new districts were drawn in experts republicans scored an efficiency gap rating of percent to percent in the first election after the maps were redrawn in some experts said the efficiency gap gives gerrymandering opponents their most promising chance yet to persuade a majority of the supreme court to limit partisan redistricting does almost exactly what justice said he was looking for back in the a clear threshold for deciding what is said c the director of the elections research center at the university of under procedural cases like redistricting lawsuits that are heard by panels in district court are appealed directly to the supreme skipping the federal court of appeals but it remains unclear whether will file an appeal or accept the ruling and limit its impact to a single state were the supreme court to hear the the effect could be regardless of the decision republicans have more than doubled their control of state legislatures since and with gains from this election they now control both legislative chambers in a record states if which has a nominally unicameral is included a university of law professor and the lead lawyer for the said on that a number of state redistricting including those in north and have efficiency gap scores rivaling those of
j with his campaign sees an that has for years been taken for granted by weaker nations and is too quick to intervene in intractable conflicts far away but in his final news conference on his last foreign trip as president argued on for a foreign policy in which continues to take on the biggest global problems of the lead where others stand on the sidelines and help the least fortunate pointed out that before the order imposed in large measure by the united states after world war war and famine ravaged the globe he said that while the united states could not maintain global order on its it was the linchpin in ensuring that it continued china is an important he told reporters in the final stop on his but the did not organize the climate help write the agreement to reduce global warming or undertake the negotiations ensuring that all parties agreed to it is a very significant military but not worrying right now about how to rebuild after a hurricane in we his voice rising said a burden that we should carry final overseas trip while in office was supposed to be a valedictory but it has instead been one long exercise in crisis as he seeks to reassure foreign leaders and audiences that trump will not upend alliances and trade relationships that presidents from both major parties have spent decades carefully constructing his toughest task was at a summit meeting of the economic cooperation which helped bring forth the a trade accord that trump has vowed to kill like the rest of has also been made uneasy by the prospect of a sudden shift in united states immigration policy under trump the atmosphere during this trip has been noticeably different from that of previous ones schedule has had surprising when he seemed to have little to and staff members out of their jobs in two months have been unusually somber some of the leaders has met with have grown wistful chancellor of not known for emotional seemed genuinely moved when she said that leave from my partner and it is and on president xi of china commended for his intensive focus on their noting that the two had met nine including three times in but president v of betrayed no obvious regret when he met with for a few minutes on the sidelines of the summit meeting here has blamed for deepening the humanitarian crisis in and accused it of meddling in the united states election by hacking into the emails of the democratic national committee has praised and has openly called for improving ties both and looked grim in their brief which said was and he said he had asked if they could end the slaughter in or complete an agreement in before left office at its before a brief and probably final handshake ranked the problems resulting from alleged hacking far below those generated by fake news being circulated on social media concern i had has less to do with any particular misinformation or propaganda put out by any particular but a greater concern about the general misinformation from all kinds of on social that make it very difficult for voters to figure out true and said if elections are of fake news and false information and then the issue is not going to be happening on the he added issue is going to be what are we going to be doing to ourselves from the the remarks followed similar comments at a news conference in on in which was sharply critical of the role and other social media companies play in spreading false news a remarkable change in tone for a man who has spent so much of his presidency praising the transformational and beneficial effects of social media mark chief published a detailed post early describing ways the company was considering dealing with the problem of fake news in his news conference on for the first that he would continue to be active politically when his presidency ends he said that at he would some spend time with my and do some do some but he added that he reserved the right to speak out there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislation issue but go to core questions about our values and our and if i think necessary or helpful for me to defend those then examine it when it he said then he to what i do know is that i have to take on
seven men who authorities say were planning a terrorist attack have been arrested in the government announced on sounding an alert about the continuing threat from terrorism barely a year after the attacks that killed people in and around the arrests followed an investigation led by domestic intelligence according to interior minister who said investigators were looking into the possibility that the plot involved a attack aimed to hit several sites in the country the seven men were arrested in the eastern city of and the port city of on said at a news adding that the operation had a terrorist attack that had been envisaged on our soil for a long said that the seven men who ranged in age from to were a mix of and afghan but he did not provide a detailed breakdown six of them were unknown to intelligence before the investigation he and the a had been flagged to the authorities by what he called a the arrests occurred a few days before the opening of the popular market in which attracts over two million visitors every year in militants who had trained in and were active in and planned to bomb the but the plot was averted the mayor of said at a news conference on that the market was not the target of the latest plot he said the market would go on unless there were a and proven five people suspected of having links to the same network as the seven men were arrested on a few days into the soccer tournament being held in and two of them were kept in said the arrests were not made public at the time only a day a state sympathizer killed a police captain and his companion in the town of outside but the soccer which stretched over a occurred without incident has been under a state of emergency since the attacks in the capital region that gives the authorities broad powers to conduct raids and detain people under house among other powers president has said the government will seek to extend the state of emergency until the presidential election next spring state militants carried out the and men inspired by the group carried out an assault in nice that claimed lives on the day and the killing of a priest in the northern town of days later is wary that it may be hit again security and migration are among the main issues in the presidential campaign said on that people had been arrested in relation to terrorist networks since the beginning of the including this month alone challenge is huge and zero risk be guaranteed those who guarantee it are lying to the taking an implicit swipe at the critics of who is expected to face a tough battle if he decides to seek
the election of j trump gives the republicans in congress a chance to act on their desire to get rid of a wish that trump mostly says he shares e and the health policy analysts for the then i think safe to say few in congress thought they would have this opportunity but like the proverbial dog who has finally caught the after untold futile republicans have finally come within reach of repealing the affordable care act now comes the essential will they actually do been promising it but i am still skeptical that it will happen i believe you disagree going to let you go first why do you think do i think do it because they so thoroughly own the idea of having passed bills to partly delay or the in the house something like times just the other day senator endorsed repeal the house and senate also agreed to do in large in a budget reconciliation bill earlier this year the only thing that prevented it was that president vetoed it i doubt trump would do the same if given a similar opportunity i know that a budget reconciliation dismantling of the law is not a full because according to the rules it can only touch provisions this excludes things like requiring insurers to take all comers for premiums that vary only by age and smoking status or preventing them from imposing coverage caps and lifetime among other measures i also must add that much less confident of a repeal partial without agreement on a replacement but turn it back to do you think the has to offer a full replacement to get its members to sign on to or can it offer something that would cover fewer people and with fewer i think they can get away with slightly fewer people and somewhat skimpier but not too much a part of me that thinks many in congress were always so willing to vote for a because they knew it had no chance of being signed into law they got credit for the vote without ever having to face the downside actually repealing without replacing would mean effectively stripping more than million people of their health without anything in return this would be an unmitigated political disaster the stories of people with diabetes and more who were suddenly stripped of their insurance and left out in the cold would very likely dominate our discussion for months that leaves more than enough time to lead to significant repercussions in the midterm elections with no democratic leaders in any branch of government to i think this would be akin to what happened in the but in reverse if they can coalesce around a plan that leave too many people then i think they could move forward but in all the years since the was republicans been able to do that do you think they what do you think that plan would look one way to get from repeal to replace that minimizes immediate political risk is to pass a plan that call for repeal for several at least after the though possibly after the election between now and there would need to be some kind of transition to whatever replaces that just dump people off coverage with no alternative but the alternatives could just be not as comprehensive or costly absolutely there will be bad stories but keep in there will be bad stories under too rocketing huge cost sharing and markets with few choices is not a recipe for political success republicans now own the task of fixing those things and doing so in a way that does not look as if making better actually in a tough policy spot get the blame if they fix or repeal the and get the blame if they replace it with something people like better health policy is a very difficult and thankless task i think opt for something they can call repeal and but they could also just let struggle and die neither looks good one other way to get out from under the issue is to kick it to the states do you think a trump working with a will offer greater flexibility to states to design their own coverage plans that could diverge from if what are some ideas states might i think very likely those in congress could punt to the states for been trying to change funding to a block grant that they can then constrain over time this will be enticing for them because it will allow them to reduce spending in the while forcing states to make the tough decisions and take the blame for cuts in either beneficiaries or services fixing the markets for those who are getting health insurance through the is a different story without some sort of market which generally been opposed the same problems that existed with respect to conditions and individual ratings will exist many people will become uninsured annual and lifetime limits could reappear lots of people will have problems getting insured i have yet to be convinced that a significant number of republicans in the house might coalesce around such a plan maybe for but not sure about the exchanges even if they likely the democrats in the senate would try to filibuster either of these plans you i think democrats would filibuster anything they could the filibuster is not set in stone a senate majority can change and some are already calling for the to do so but that appear to be what the senate will do retain the filibuster this could play to their since they can propose things they let the democrats filibuster them and take the blame when repeal kicks in with no replacement perhaps another way for republicans to get out of their political bind sure have more to discuss as president administration comes into power
the mark went on his vast social network to convince an expanding chorus of critics including the departing president of the united states that he wants to combat the that is running wild across his site and and turning our politics into a paranoiac fantasy come to life been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility he wrote made significant but there is more work to be he listing various steps was like making it easier to report bad information and enlisting organizations it was heartening to especially after his earlier assertion that it was to believe that misinformation on had affected the presidential election in any real way despite copious evidence that it was disturbingly in the whether it directly swung the result or not but as went on to say that had to be careful not to mistakenly block he added do not want to be arbiters of truth which was why he said would continue to rely on community and trusted third his statement pointed up how much struggles to find the balance between its mission to be a utopia for its billion users and its responsibility to protect them from all that is dangerous terrorist and untrue but more to the it appeared to buy into the notion that truth is relative at a time when that notion has to finally go away do you really need an outside arbiter to determine whether a video suggesting without basis that was involved in john f fatal plane crash in should be allowed to truth need arbiters it needs defenders and it needs them now more than ever as the democracy staggers into its next uncertain phase with a mainstream news media that works hard to separate fact from fiction under economic and political which has contributed to that economic threat by gobbling up so much of the advertising market is going to have a special responsibility to do its part just imagine what things will look like if the unsavory elements that tore through the election false fake news and aggressive efforts to traditional journalism come back into play as j trump presses to enact his agenda if the past week provided any indication of where politics are the next four years are going to require an effort to keep the national conversation honest the national security adviser trump named last t a retired army lieutenant has subscribed to the conspiracy theory that law is taking root in the united states contributing to his insistence that have every reason to view as he recently used twitter to circulate a fake news item that the federal bureau of investigation was sitting on evidence from laptop that would and her crew away for nominee for attorney senator sessions of has falsely claimed that hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants are successfully crossing the border annually then there was the announcement by the conspiracy theorist that trump had called to thank him and his radio and audience for their support in the campaign add to that the fact that trump was the most prominent promoter of the false notion that president born and hesitate to repeat the outrageous suggestion that the father of senator was linked to the assassination of president john f then consider what it may look like when trump pursues policies regarding immigrants and undocumented immigrants not so outlandish to envision attempts to sell his plans getting a lift from the likes of or a fake site out of perhaps claiming that democrats are working with to use undocumented immigrants to poison local water supplies or some such president seemed to have had something like that in mind when he told reporters in on we are not serious about facts and true and and we discriminate between serious arguments and then we have knows of what he speaks he had to muddle through the first wave of this you might remember how his health care plan was marred by a false accusation that the plan included death panels that would decide who lived and who died based on their of productivity to as former gov put it her the false allegation was partly based on proposals to reimburse doctors for optional consultations with families over care decisions the accusations took on such power that even newt signed on to the falsehood despite the fact that he had previously expressed bullish support for planning explained himself in a letter to the new news including this debunked the myth but the authors stripped out the provision just the same and by then the fiction had negated any shot at a ideological debate as who was the chief communications strategist at the so grimly put it to me last death panels were the canary in the coal mine about the coming death of things have advanced since then fake news is limited only by the imaginations of its inventors and the number of shares it can garner on or twitter the one million shares of the preposterous notion that secretly sold weapons to news which has excelled at illuminating the fake news problem highlighted that example in its alarming analysis showing that during the campaign cycle fake news was shared among users more often than real news why people who care about the truth journalists social media giants like too will have to come up with a solution to this informational fast easier said than done the combination of attacks seeking to serious news organizations and a drop in overall trust in the news media has made many people wary of legitimate as my colleague john noted last politicized voices can easily drown honest journalism all too easily on social media there is growing talk of an ambitious journalistic collaboration to beat back the tide industry thinkers and leaders are coming together to brainstorm as the city university of new journalism and the have done them out and say high time that television news
a different environment now i feel very upset and afraid for my friends people are using the election as an excuse to discriminate against each other jade at student a west high school in on the aftermath of the presidential election
president is considering removing s rogers from his posts as leader of the national security agency and united states command after top officials expressed frustration over the speed at which admiral rogers had moved to combat the state and over the repeated loss of closely guarded administration and intelligence officials said j trump is considering admiral who is responsible for surveillance and the growing arsenal of for a top post in his including director of national intelligence overseeing all intelligence agencies admiral rogers met with trump on apparently without the white knowledge the recommendation to remove admiral a career intelligence officer who was promoted to his posts by the administration two years came last month from defense secretary b carter and the current director of national r clapper administration and intelligence who insisted on anonymity to detail the private said the recommendation that admiral rogers be removed was not related to interest in hiring him they it was driven by breaches during admiral tenure at the and his leadership of the agency the white house and the pentagon declined to comment on admiral fate reached by phone on admiral rogers declined to comment the effort to force out admiral which was first reported by the puts trump in the position of considering whether to as the man who would brief him on intelligence matters each a admiral whom the white house is considering relieving of his posts it also raises the question of why would consider firing one of the top intelligence officers in the last days of his administration admiral replacement would not be confirmed until after trump takes over one senior intelligence official argued that letting word of the effort leak seemed more about politics or vengeance than about effecting any real change representative of the chairman of the house intelligence committee and a member of transition strongly defended admiral rogers in a letter to carter and asked them to testify before his committee to explain why they want to push rogers out not by accident that admiral rogers meets with the and two days later this which is completely built on said in a short interview carter and clapper had submitted a formal recommendation to the white house to split the which conducts foreign surveillance and secures military from the command but there are questions inside the giant complex at fort where the and command are about whether the military is ready to survive on its own it relies heavily on the talent of the which dates back to the early who has begun filling the top echelons of his national security team with met with admiral rogers on at trump tower in new senior defense department and intelligence officials were surprised that admiral while on personal had paid a visit to trump first major disagreement with admiral rogers dates to the fall of when he expressed mounting frustration that which is responsible for offensive action against was not acting aggressively enough to disrupt the networks in and in the carter said for the first time that the united states was using its against the state but the effort was moving too slowly for the pentagon and carter went to fort several weeks ago to give admiral rogers and his team kick in the one official said top national security officials had also come to see admiral rogers as lacking leadership at a moment of wrenching change for the he took command after the disclosures of widespread surveillance by j the former and the efforts he directed to seal up the agency proved they said that perception was underlined by the disclosure in that the had secretly arrested a former t martin and was investigating whether he had stolen and disclosed highly classified computer code developed by the agency to hack into the networks of foreign governments martin was charged with theft of government property and the unauthorized removal or retention of classified documents administration officials had planned to relieve admiral rogers of his duties after the election and announce a plan to create separate chains of command for the and command but the supported by carter and stalled in part because of opposition from senator john republican of who heads the armed services committee under the command would remain under the armed services but oversight of the would shift to the senate intelligence committee victory complicated the planning on one major trump and admiral rogers disagree quite publicly while trump has insisted that no one knows whether was responsible for the hacking of email accounts of the democratic national committee and a range of prominent formal admiral rogers has said he has no doubt he recently said that was not something that was done this was not something that was done by this was not a target that was selected purely he was a conscious effort by a to attempt to achieve a specific coming into the admiral rogers said one of his top goals was to make sure that on the united states had consequences for the attackers in he proposed a series of possible options to respond to the which intelligence in a public said the leadership had to have been aware of but the white house rejected the fearing that they could start an escalating that the united states might not be able to win decisively
here are the top comments of the week on our digital as selected by our readers and the journalists who moderate nearly every comment this is what unqualified looks like never expected to win and never planned to govern he just loved the adulation he got from spreading his brand of hate now we have a completely unprepared administration trying desperately to do in weeks what it should have been preparing for over the last months the disaster begins it seems that billy bush has been one of the few to be held accountable for his words and participation in the onslaught of racism and misogyny in the campaign and now appointments all others are ascending to the highest offices in the land as a teacher i am already seeing the repercussions of having individuals in high office have no consequences for their bigoted remarks when a student in my diverse classroom does not understand why it is hurtful to yell the in the middle of class i can blame our leaders the misogyny will continue if we do not hold people accountable someone who understands the threat that poses to the west avoid the mistakes of and other countries where the dominating instincts of the most dangerous religion have been allowed to flourish i find it really ironic that all the groups that think they have a mandate to enforce are so intolerant of controversial views and people that run counter to their own maybe the moral and ethical standards of are not that repugnant in the like trump who has said some unfortunate as has that he if political correctness gets pushed to the business and progress grinds to a halt in fear of legal accusations that become paralyzing how many lives have to be ruined by such enforced and what about the controversial manipulators on the other side like who will hold them to infrastructure child tax paid maternity leave and dismantling trade sounds a bit like some of platform slice and dice identity politics are all well and good in the it is all about the economy and too many of our fellow citizens are hurting wake and return to the or continue to lose this sad news hurts like the loss of a family member clarity and moderate tone brought so much to the frantic scene this is the worst possible moment to lose her special gift for analyzing politics and bringing contending parties together in a civil conversation i am considering many grad schools in the for my master course next fall before the i only looked at the the the requirements and the fee and campus life i really have to think about the safety as an i expect anyone to stop me in the street and tell me to get back to china i am not so although i was so sure about some schools in and i have to sit down once and closely look at the and hope that they are not too red this election changed my mind about for a you are a white male somewhere in who just lost his job at a factory your mortgage is in your car is being and you wonder whether be able to find a much less one that pays a decent wage you have no particular animosity towards but you constantly hear the message that as a straight you are the paragon of privilege and that the hardships in your life are irrelevant or made up you feel so privileged are your struggles and fears really so different from those of the minority easy to see why that person voted for the candidate who acknowledged his fears and against the candidate who dismissed his concerns because he was not a minority less patient with sexism and talking down and more likely to stand up for others the day after the all of the young women in my office dressed in head to toe black no one no one knew that the other women would be dressed but we all were sending a conscious message of and it was comforting to see and feel that kind of solidarity this is a what locker room talk should be

if they squint hard they can see hope in the form of an ambitious piece of legislation like a big tax cut then there is the fact that will not be president and mike the faithfully conservative vice is there to keep watch those conservatives who insisted that electing j trump president would be a grievous mistake a group that included radio prominent columnists and some of the most savvy political operators in the country are now saying they see an upside to four years of a trump white house but even as they find small those who counted themselves part of the trump opposition are wondering what their place will be for the next four years in a republican party they can hardly recognize and they have begun to ponder what it all means for a conservative movement they thought they understood better said the radio host who became a vocal opponent of during the republican primaries he was describing how he had arrived at peace with the election he he realized that he had not done so at all kind of have to a lot of what you thought about the shape of he said not just that that you fundamentally misread what what is so disorienting for many conservatives is that the trump victory was the culmination of the unruly populist upwelling in first manifested in the tea party that traditional republicans thought they could eventually absorb those forces have overtaken them one by one first claiming their house majority then their john a and then an entire field of presidential candidates now it may claim their party some on team are already boasting how they plan to break with decades of conservative orthodoxy on government spending and pursue a huge infrastructure spending package that sounds more than conservatives are going to go k senior counselor and chief gleefully told the reporter in an interview published negative interest rates throughout the the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything get them all jacked said who has aimed almost as much fire at what he regards as establishment republicans as he has at democrats will be as exciting as the greater than the some conservatives say they could surely live with a few of the proposals of they find like a big spending especially if they come with sweeteners like tax breaks or spending cuts in other areas the easiest way to forge many are is to disassociate the man from the policy will do everything i can to help said senator republican of south who has refused on numerous other occasions to help including voting for him or attending the republican national convention graham told reporters on capitol hill this week that he believed he could work with trump on issues like the military which both men support expanding for the political advocacy group supported by and that decided not to spend any money on the presidential race this year despite spending tens of millions to help mitt in is also cracking the door to trump the declined to say whether it had met or spoken to anyone inside transition team encouraged on several fronts by the possibility of the republican congress working with the new said for citing the prospect of repealing some of president energy policies along with the affordable care act but as with any period of acceptance comes in different ways some find catharsis in writing others console themselves in data that show they really were not all that wrong then there are those who still talk as if they are in they have good days and bad days goes said bill the weekly standard editor and leading who has written columns about his coming to terms with trump any given said in an he feels a range of competing sentiments sort of somewhere between but and but he using modified versions of famous quote about how he approached negotiating with the soviets on the subject of it is hard not to talk to conservatives today about trump and not have them wistfully invoke their said he feared people were drawing parallels to trump that risk setting the wrong standards for success revolution that he beat jimmy carter in he said that i love that the revolution was that he governed successfully for eight years and won the cold others are concerned that the conservative movement missed an opportunity to appeal to a younger and more diverse group of voters and they wonder how it will do so with someone as divisive as trump atop the republican party a conservative radio host in and prominent pointed to the tens of thousands of voters in and states trump barely won who voted in other races but did not cast a vote for evidently because they could not bring themselves to vote for him not lightning in a he making the point that trump repelled so many voters that he almost lost like you showed up for work and they said this is your last paycheck and you and your wife go to las put it all on black and it pays the radio personality in said he at least felt liberated by not supporting trump he does not feel compelled to defend him like so many of his conservative friends do has been writing a new which he tentatively titled the right lost its but he is struggling to finish it i thought it was going to have a different he asking aloud what he still struggles with did this who are your what do they actually

something is deeply wrong when the reputation and influence can be borrowed by a source that describes itself as fantasy news to claim that he has endorsed a presidential and then be through a million individual shares the attention paid to fake news since the election has focused largely on fabrications and outright because they are easy to identify and extraordinarily viral fake news is created by the kinds of people when might call their work or admit that in it for the money or for the thrill of deception theirs is a behavior that can and should be and that is and maybe to deal with for many and especially opponents of j the attention paid to fake news and its role in the election has provided a small the discovery of the error that explains everything but as the attention has spread widely even president talked passionately about it on it may lead to an unwanted outcome for those who see it not just as an but also as a way to correct the course it misunderstands a new media world in which every and is at risk of being not by argument but by sheer force false news stories posted on websites were prevalent in this election were widely shared political videos some styled as newscasts containing outright image posted by individuals and shared by and endlessly shared quotes and video clips of the candidates themselves repeating falsehoods during the months i spent talking to partisan page operators for a magazine article this it became clear that while the ecosystem contained easily identifiable and intentional it contained much more of something else i recall a conversation with a fact checker about how to describe a posted on a website and promoted on a page copied from another site by overseas contractors it tried to cast suspicion on the father of a slain who had spoken out against j trump the overarching claims of the story were disingenuous and the facts it included had been removed from all useful context and placed in a sinister its insinuating mention of in proximity to mentions of and its misleading and strategic mention of amounted to a repulsive smear it was a story that appealed to bigoted ideas and that would clearly appeal to those who held them this was a story the likes of which was an enormous force in this clearly designed to function well within economy of sharing and it probably would not run afoul of the narrow definition of stories like that one get to the heart of the rhetorical and strategic risk of holding up as a broad media offensive especially after an election cycle characterized by the euphoric inversion of rhetoric by some of and by the candidate himself as the campaign criticism of trump was instantly projected back at his or at the critics themselves puppet no puppet the this tactic was used on the language of social which was appropriated by opponents and redeployed in an open effort to sap its power while simultaneously taking advantage of what power it retained were cast as the real racists progressives were cast as secretly regressive on their own terms this was not a new but it was newly effective it matter that its targets knew that it was a a clear bid for power rather than an attempt to engage or reason the referees called but nobody could hear them over the roar of the crowds or maybe they but realized that nobody could make them listen as shorthand will almost surely be returned upon the media tenfold the fake news as widely understood and has already begun to encompass not just fabricated but a wider swath of traditional media on and elsewhere fox fake news misleading claims about ford keeping jobs in fake news the entirety of fake news this wide formulation of will be applied back to the traditional news which does not yet understand how threatened its ability is to declare things even when they are may try to address the narrow version of the the clearly fabricated posts has plenty of tools at its disposal and has already promised to use to bar sites that have been flagged as promoting falsified content from using its advertising platform but the worst identified defenders make their money outside anyway another narrow response from could be to assert editorial control over external forces tried to a very limited with trending topics members of the editorial staff wrote descriptions of trending news accompanied by links they deemed credible this initiative collapsed in a frenzy of bias accusations and political fear but it is easy to imagine a system in which a upon reaching some high threshold of or a upon reaching some cumulative could be audited and declared unreliable this could resemble experiment to tag satire articles as such a number of narrow measures could stop a fake story about the for example but where would that leave the rest of the answered and and barely better positioned against everything else that remained it would be a news environment in which almost everything there before remained the main difference being that it would have all been not fake is a place where people construct and project identities to family and peers it is a marketplace in which news is valuable mainly to the extent that it serves those identities it is a system built on ranking and vetting and and yet one where negative inputs are scarcely and where conflict is resolved with isolation that provisions for open conflict on a platform present any easy for it has been a source of constant fake news operations are closely aligned with the experienced incentives of the economy more than most of the organizations that are identifying them their removal will be an improvement the outrage at their mere and at their promotion on a platform with the stated goal of connecting the will have been justified

to combat terrorism was to dismantle and other networks while avoiding being seen as attacking trump has shown no such qualms has said leaders contribute to the threat of terrorism by refusing to

the united states is a leader in technology but it may well be a laggard when it comes to using technology for political mischief the role that fake news stories on sites in particular played in last presidential election continues to be a issue did fake news tip the balance in the can do more to prevent fake should executives dispute the notion that fake news on the social network might have swayed voters but political analysts say the warning signs of this debate could be seen in other countries years ago take the where a spokesman for its shared on an image of a girl believed to have been raped and killed by a drug dealer checkers later revealed that the photo had come from and mark write the role of fake news posted to in the recent presidential election is likely to be debated for even years but there is little doubt that the social media network has had plenty of influence in a reminder to register to vote contributed to significant increases in voter registration across the according to officials in nine states in that did not dispute their conclusion
the early stock market reaction to j election victory was overwhelmingly positive but that mean a trump presidency will be good for the economy stock markets often serve as an economic increasing stock prices are equated with economic victory but these inferences are too because some increases connote good while others do not reading market movements such as the steep rise in stock prices in the early as well as the subsequent ups and downs requires a stone constructing one takes an understanding of what drives stock prices and how that relates to the overall health of the economy buying stock in a company entitles the owner to a percentage of present and future profits the share price should be equivalent to a prediction of what these future profits will be the and stock when they excel because these stocks are traded assets and all traders can contribute to the overall prediction if traders feel stock prices are low relative to future they will bid up if they feel prices are they will sell and drive down prices in this the final price represents a collective prediction by the entire market an increase in stock prices therefore signals an expected increase in future profits the movement in stock prices has a direct shareholders are immediately wealthier anyone holding a retirement portfolio knows the feeling of reading stock price movements through the narrow lens of how well you can retire this does not benefit all people in the economy some shares are held by citizens of other and the shares held in this country are not equitably held but at the a surge in stock prices equals more wealth for the citizenry but rising stock prices can spell good news for other even many of those who do not own stocks can expect a brighter future this is because when companies consumers frequently also do well this notion can be somewhat counterintuitive after we often reflexively assume that when businesses make more they do so at our that by overcharging us in a the interests of companies and consumers are aligned businesses profit when customers enthusiastically buy their higher profits mean happier customers the economy as a whole is doing well by way of suppose apple unveils a new that buoys its stock price traders are bullish about the robust sales they are focused on the fact that these sales add to coffers but each assuming consumers are choosing is also presumably producing joy for consumers this example also makes clear when the stock market can be a poor scoreboard for the economy sometimes companies can profit without improving or possibly even by worsening them for part of the stock surge after the election most likely occurred because of a widely held belief that a trump administration would slash regulations that may be good for some bottom but is that good for everyone it depends do those regulations hinder only products that were profitable and good for or do they also hinder products that are bad for take the case of wells which was recently found to have created millions of accounts in names without their knowledge these accounts were profitable for wells but surely not good for consumers the extent of this behavior was uncovered because of the work of a regulatory the consumer financial protection bureau election increases the possibility that the bureau will be shut down or that its powers will be curtailed but if this prospect raises the value of bank stocks because it makes it more likely that behavior like wells can hardly cause for celebration and not good news for the economy in whether a rise in stock prices is good or bad for depends on whether the increase in profits arises because companies are serving consumers or because they are profiting at expense there is a final factor to the capacity of traders to make predictions about future profits is limited in then a doctoral student in economics at and now a principal at noticed something funny about stock prices on made a bid for

states of confusion thank you beat me to the punch having left the united states in to live in for a which turned into i returned in and have daily made a mental list of the changes during that quarter century eloquently speaks to many of and i would add a few some trivial but still the rampant advance of ranging from the commercialization of to the corporate naming of our sports stadiums and other public feminism and civil rights becoming dirty the rebirth of exclusiveness and like the system and and wearing religion like a lapel pin i could go on i left when bush was elected and came back because had passed health care reform maybe it was too soon speaking as an this piece certainly resonated with the palpable the extreme wealthy the militarism at every the partisan all seem to be intensifying since when i left with my family when we return from i usually feel exhausted from the stress of my while this is all often true at least feels also true that the states can also be a wonderful place to live and travel these places you covered are all exceptional the baton and even the evangelical zeal of are not the best examples of average i spent three of the past four years in in both rural and urban reading the news from home obsessively in a much shorter period of time than has felt like a stranger i am back in the and i am very much trying to hang on to my view of the as a someone who has not gradually adapted to the boiling water of citizenship situated between and depends on the for its commitment to democracy and and especially to its resolve to enforce these principles with its allies in you believe in the principles of surely you believe that you can share what saw in before i was the continued ineffectiveness of democracy to fix the problem of mass shootings by with guns that are or seem to be sanctioned by our government those who make the assault weapons support the representatives that make them legal even with ineffective this would be an easy problem to fix then comes the news that the police are shooting anyone with a nervous especially if they have a skin color that might have a grudge against their treatment by the police has only scratched the surface the entire world is waiting for us to get our act together article inspired a thought that it be surprising if this past election contest was nothing more than the result of a friendly not unlike the one by the two duke brothers in the movie instead of a endeavor to nurture a street hustler into becoming a successful commodities it was for running for president with the goal of destroying the republican party the percent have more in common with each other than with the rest of the country many politicians have more in common with each other than with the people they sometimes try or sometimes purport to serve no surprises in this article as if in that myth in this choosing between two flawed options that do have at least one thing in wealth and power what i get out of this is that politics is not for those with a weak stomach or an inclination to be kind perhaps the same applies for new the ability to manipulate money and crowds is not an uplifting way to spend a much less a life the piece is hugely but the story within is less a sensational plot than a sad on bad characters need to move away from entertainment as a way of life not too because if we this is who our will be

j victory could well push the party system toward a clash between an overwhelmingly white ethnic party and a cosmopolitan coalition of minority groups and whites despite the unexpected trump lost the popular vote in an election that in some respects closely resembled victory over mitt in an ordinary end to a very abnormal campaign the power of party identification held approximately percent of republicans in camp campaign may set in motion a process that reorients politics toward the cosmopolitanism versus nationalism divide that he reconfiguring our party system and shaping our politics for decades to come the power of social identity suggests that such a dynamic could be difficult to stop once set in motion in recent the democrats and republicans have battled along a axis of conflict that emphasizes disagreement over the size and scope of government rather than divisive disputes about racial identity during the and presidential for john and ran against domestic policy proposals on issues like health care and the economy after the republican party hoped to continue along this path and expand its appeal to young minorities and women but as the political scientists miller and norm candidates and parties sometimes in flanking moves so as to enlist coalitions of disaffected by changing positions on social issues that cut across party they seek to attract voters who are only loosely attached to the other party trump seems to have pulled off one of these maneuvers in shifting from traditional conservatism to a kind of nationalism though the move cost him votes among he attracted support among the larger group of whites without a college degree substantial minority of whom had backed in pulling in just enough votes in the rust belt to tip the election despite all the attention paid to economic anxiety as the basis for the evidence to date is more consistent with his brand of identity politics being the most important cause of this shift in voting patterns from of course economic anxiety and group animus are not mutually approach has the potential to transform the party system the success of his campaign may encourage other republicans to adopt his model he has shown that the penalty for deviating from orthodox policies is minimal and that an style can have significant electoral advantages though presidents cannot impose their will on most of domestic they can help define the issues on the political agenda in the choices that he trump may play down conflict over the size and scope of government and shift the political debate toward questions of national immigration and culture few republicans are likely to want to cross trump and his energized supporters given the threat of a potential primary challenge in for decision to name as his chief strategist the head of a website described in an article in the conservative national review as catering to small but vocal fringe of white and though the move lacked recent no republicans in congress which made the issue into a partisan dispute with democrats trump has also stirred emotions by promising to deport two to three million undocumented immigrants by the fate of a tax cut normally the top domestic policy priority has received less attention the party will almost certainly pursue success is likely to provoke a response from democrats that could accelerate this shift they face an outraged liberal base that is likely to reject conciliatory messages intended to win back votes among the white working class the party might instead double down on cosmopolitan appeals to the minority voters and white voters who were the main target of campaign the strategy failed in but the incentive to try again is clear democrats came closer to winning several sun belt states where minority and white populations are like and than they did some traditional strongholds with higher numbers of like and a focus on cosmopolitanism might make electoral sense for democrats given the changing demographics of the but it could further weaken their appeal to whites without college dividing the electorate by race and class even more nothing about this process is of course republicans may yet succeed in steering trump toward a traditional agenda of tax cuts and deregulation but the effects he could have on party system could be of far more lasting consequence than almost any policy he might propose

prime minister of japan is planning to sit down with j trump in new on in what would be the first meeting with a foreign leader since his election wants to find out how serious trump was during his campaign when he repeatedly criticized japan on trade issues and for not paying more of the cost of its own defense and since the establishment was expecting to win the wants to assure trump that he is willing and eager to work with him the prime minister is concerned about commitment to protecting japan the united states is most important and is legally obligated to defend it against attack there are around troops stationed in a powerful deterrent against the rising threat of north and an increasingly assertive china during the trump suggested he might withdraw troops not without resistance from members of officials at the state diplomats and military advisers the united alliance has been in place since the end of world war and has a lot of backing on both sides of the pacific ocean maybe there are signs that japan might be willing to pay or do but many experts contend troops are not only defending japan but the united own interests in the pentagon is budgeted to spend about billion to support troops and bases on and elsewhere around japan this year japan is set to spend billion to support the in addition to at least billion on related including compensation for the communities that host the bases and funds for relocating troops under its which was written by occupying forces after world war japan can keep an army for defensive purposes but has said he wants to revise the constitution and expand the military in his government requested the latest in a series of increases in military spending japan has committed to the nuclear nonproliferation and will probably remind trump of that on the campaign trump decried the cost of providing a nuclear umbrella to allies such as japan and south that do not have their own nuclear arms in trump told the new times that he was open to those countries building their own nuclear but on twitter this week he denied having said so has reaffirmed his commitment not to develop atomic weapons any move to do so would face severe public opposition in the only country that has suffered a nuclear attack he has been one of the biggest enthusiasts for the partnership or as it is known though japan was the last of a dozen pacific rim countries to join the sweeping trade pact trump repeatedly criticized the during the presidential campaign made politically painful concessions on agricultural imports to close the deal and get manufacturers access to export markets in the united states and elsewhere the trade partnership could bolster the limp economic growth rate in his country and serve as a counterweight to the superpower acknowledged after victory that the partnership was in a difficult but his government still plans to have parliament ratify the and he has not given up on selling it to trump may also seek to soften angry campaign in which he accused japan of crushing the united states on and manipulating its currency to gain an economic advantage trump says for free trade in but wants a for the united states what that for remains a mystery
over the past president v of has received two starkly different messages about hacking into computer networks from the current and future presidents of the united you and not even sure it was you the white house confirmed in a statement on that eight days before the presidential the united states the government directly regarding malicious that was state it sent the message over a rarely used a connecting the nuclear risk reduction centers in both which they had agreed three years ago could also be employed to deal with major the warning only the latest after verbal cautions by president his defense secretary and the director of national intelligence was reported by the post the warnings to against further hacking into polling or registration or any further effort to affect the outcome of the are being hailed by the administration as a success in deterrence after they a year and a half of hacking activity seemed to or and there is no evidence that voting or counting of ballots was disrupted on election day but more than a few experts in deterring take a more skeptical view they say the had already achieved their main to demonstrate how they could disrupt the electoral process with the leak of hacked including from the democratic national committee and campaign john d suffered nothing worse than a they note no no counter no embarrassing revelations engineered by the united states and he now has the satisfaction of dealing with j who during the campaign praised promised to build a more productive relationship with and maintained there was no evidence that the were behind the hacking anything wrong happens they like blame the trump said in an debate with know if the doing the hacking maybe there is no trump contended that the allegations of activity were intended to for advocating a new relationship with he frequently repeated similar sentiments in the last weeks of the suggesting the hacking was a fabrication the leaks of emails worked largely to his embarrassing democratic leaders like representative of who was forced to resign as the chairwoman of the democratic national committee larger strategic message is that the united states and need to cooperate on a range of issues but for now the situation underscores the uncertainty around the world about the direction of foreign policy and gives the opportunity to exploit differences between the current president and his successor until trump is inaugurated on it is also raising the question of whether the white house pushed back hard enough when intelligence agencies concluded on that officials could have authorized these a a computer expert at the center for strategic and international studies in dismissed the claim that it had deterred hacking seems a little bold to claim this is a success for since the deterred from doing he said hacking work was mostly complete the issue now is whether they will be deterred in the and the guessing is they will not strong private warnings enough to constitute in the appear to have paid less of a price for their hacking around the election than north did for its attack on pictures entertainment in that attack melted down about percent of computers and servers at its wreaking considerable and embarrassed many executives it was in response to the release of a that imagined a plot to kill the north leader after the the united states issued more sanctions against north and encouraged china to limit the all of which runs through switching centers many experts had expected the white house to follow a similar path with the white house concluded that the and the unstated suggestion that the united states had the power to reach inside networks and see the origin of might suffice it is not clear if the administration plans any other actions against before departure from but that seems less and less likely the warning did not deal with the hacking of the democratic national committee or which r clapper the director of national had previously said was conducted with the knowledge of the leadership it referred only to the concerns about hacking around the election process and the fear it was originating from though it stopped short of saying it was a attack
the new election night coverage was a live an interactive map with an chat between a handful of political reporters not to mention more traditional reporting but the drama of election night was also in by the changing headlines that topped the home of in all the above shows how the banner headlines evolved between on and from a through a to an astonishing have a look
social media has been in the glare since the election for its perceived harmful such as the spreading of hate speech and the false information but the effect of social media on world affairs is much larger than just misinformation and mean writes in his new state of the art he argues that social media now collectively used by billions of people worldwide through services like and has grown to a point where it is increasingly influencing the course of global events the election of j who used twitter to magnify his is evidence of that writes so was the rise of whose liberal philosophy and policies were also spread by social media and there are many other such as and the momentum behind of events and movements most likely enabled by social media each person with views can see that not writes when these people find one they can get things done create publications and entire worlds that bolster their and then break into the social media is also in the spotlight for a different reason these days the kind involving big dollar signs that comes in the form of the parent company of the social media service which has filed confidentially for an initial public j la and write which is likely to take place early next is set to be the biggest tech offering since that of the company in it presages a wave of other possible public offerings from highly valued tech such as and time to mark your calendars
as the technology industry came to grips in the last week with the reality of a presidential election that did not go its many in silicon valley landed on the idea that widespread misinformation spread was a primary factor in the outcome on both and altered their advertising policies to explicitly prohibit sites that traffic in fake news from making money off lies very likely a worthwhile even if it comes too late the has loosened our collective grasp on the and efforts to fight that dismaying trend are obviously worth pursuing yet it would be a mistake to end this investigation at fake news in the dangers posed by fake news are just a symptom of a deeper truth now dawning on the with billions of people glued to and other popular social media has become an increasingly powerful cultural and political to the point that its effects are now beginning to alter the course of global events the election of j trump is perhaps the starkest illustration yet that across the social networks are helping to fundamentally rewire human society they have subsumed and gutted mainstream media they have undone traditional political advantages like and access to advertising and they are destabilizing and replacing institutions and established ways of doing including political transnational organizations and unspoken social prohibitions against blatant expressions of racism and xenophobia most because these services allow people to communicate with one another more they are helping to create surprisingly influential social organizations among groups these ad hoc social movements range widely in from white supremacists in the united states to in to in the middle east to the hacker collectives of eastern and but each in its own way is now wielding previously unthinkable resulting in sometimes destabilizing geopolitical spasms now have billions of people on the and most of them are not that happy with the status said the president of the a research firm that forecasts global risks think their local government is authoritarian they think on the wrong side of the establishment aggrieved by identity politics and a middle many factors accounted for economic anxiety in the industrial an inchoate desire for some kind of change in the national and some mix of latent xenophobia and sexism across the electorate but as even trump acknowledged in an interview with aired social media played a determining role in the race in the the concerns of supporters might have been and his candidacy would almost certainly have foundered after he was universally written off by just about every mainstream and he faced disadvantages in organization and access to traditional political expertise yet by putting out a message that resonated with people trump hacked through every established political order this new people are now empowered to express their grievances and to follow people they see as echoing their said it for social i see trump for people who like an predictable this is the scariest thing about not that it may be full of lies problem that could potentially be but that its scope gives it real power to change history in unpredictable ways but where we are time to start recognizing that social networks actually are becoming the forces that their boosters long promised they would be and to be rather than by the huge social changes they could uncork this should come as no surprise in a we are now living through a kind of version of the utopia that some in tech once envisioned would be unleashed by social media over much of the last we have seen progressive social movements powered by the web spring up across the world there was the green revolution in and the spring in the middle east and north in the united we saw the occupy wall street movement and the protests social networks also played a role in electoral politics first in the ultimately unsuccessful candidacy of dean in and then in the election of the first president in yet now those movements look like the prelude to a crackup in the global order in this organizing on played a major role in the push to get the country to leave the union in the a firebrand mayor who was vastly outspent by managed to marshal a huge army of supporters to help him win the presidency the state has used social networks to recruit from around the world to fight in and as well as to inspire terrorist attacks overseas and in the united both a socialist who ran for president as a and who was once reviled by most members of the party he now relied on movements to shatter the political status quo why is this all happening clay a professor at new university who has studied the effects of social suggested a few reasons one is the ubiquity of which has reached a truly epic scale last month the company reported that about billion people now log on to the service every month because social networks feed off the various permutations of interactions among they become strikingly more powerful as they grow with about a quarter of the population now on the possibilities are staggering the technology gets when the crazy social effects get said one of those social effects is what calls the of the a term coined by the researcher p to describe the range of subjects that the mainstream media deems publicly acceptable to discuss from about the early until the very recent it was usually considered unwise for politicians to court views deemed by most of society to be out of the things like overt calls to racial bias were of like the but the shifted that window was kept at bay because of pluralistic said person who was sitting in their basement yelling at the about immigrants or was willing to say white were more than other kinds of they know how many others shared their thanks to the now each person with views can

the house of representatives voted overwhelmingly on for legislation to extend sanctions on for a move that proponents called critical economic leverage to ensure compliance with an international nuclear agreement the known as the sanctions extension needs senate approval and president signature before the end of the when sanctions are set to expire under the nuclear which took effect in between and six world powers including the united many economic sanctions were suspended or relaxed in exchange for verifiable pledges of peaceful nuclear work but the deal also contained a provision that would allow for the of sanctions if were found to have violated the terms the legislation approved by the house on would also extend longstanding sanctions against that predate the dispute over that nuclear activities has increasingly complained about these particularly the prohibition on access to the financial system and use of the dollar the say such restrictions have discouraged many foreign companies from investing in subverting the economic rewards it expected from the nuclear agreement republicans and many democrats opposed the asserting that was untrustworthy and had gained too many concessions during the negotiations j trump said during his campaign that he would renegotiate the accord or renounce it in a march speech to the public affairs the most powerful lobby group in he said his top priority was to the disastrous deal with whether he will follow through on that pledge remains unclear the other countries that agreed to the deal with and have said they intend to honor it president of said on that he did not believe trump would scrap the telling the television channel that the of an accord would be very reacting to have also asserted that he will not be able to undo the agreement president of told his cabinet ministers the day after the election that the agreement be overturned by one according to the official republic news agency on national security including former officials of republican and democratic exhorted trump not only to accept the nuclear agreement but to use it as a way to ease tensions with on other longstanding problems
this election year has often felt like one enormous swarm of poll vote forecasts and nonstop statistical analysis and coverage has provided little relief how key was the vote to j did young voters shy away from what about all this number crunching led the two of us a and a polling editor to wonder what might be missed when we try to explain entire groups as being or if we write that rural voters were especially likely to back are there assumptions that we might be but that actually hold true for many rural if we say that millennial voters were unlikely to support are we getting the full the video above is our attempt to unpack just a few of these terms we hope it will serve as an invitation to keep and to look at the headlines we see reporting exit poll statistics as only telling part of the story
so just when we thought that get any more it with a trump victory i told you last week that strange happenings were afoot in the what with the cubs winning the world series and all i hear that new yorkers are taking it pretty hard are people stocking up on canned greetings from the land of duck and not sure quite sunk in but foods and subterranean real estate are in demand and sounds like a hunting club so where shall we a little weary of the conversations get right to what do you think will happen trump will set up an administration the sun will rise in the east my dog will chase squirrels the world will go on glad to hear taking it well he stayed cautiously neutral in the but a very good boy i think you once made the point to me that there are no permanent victories or defeats in politics so perhaps a good place to start a conversation about the future been since i came to at the collective failure to understand that point it is patently true upon the most cursory inspection of recent history in democrats were popping champagne over the dawn of a permanent era of progressive politics now they see most of their dreams being unraveled and republicans celebrating today will sooner or later be miserable i made a things are looking better already both winners and losers who ignore this reality make silly unforced errors the losers err on the side of excessive like the classic threats to leave the country reader email has informed me way harder to leave the country than one might think we in all that much demand and the winners fail when they convince themselves that since victory is they can set an agenda that attracts no one from the other side looking at a president trump and a house and say we are in for a stretch of dumb things presidents generally get most of their big changes done in the first year or two president did that with health care his agenda was nothing compared to w who did everything from tax cuts to getting authorization for the invasion but was certainly a big lift it was also a central campaign promise i know you think it was a bad idea i think that strategy is enormously shortsighted i remember thinking when the democrats held the white house and both houses of congress in though they have it might be wise to give a little to bring some centrist republicans into some day the republicans might be in a position to reverse everything if they have zero political investment in and sure here we are my point is that of course a president should have a vision that matches his ideology why he got elected but i think it is impractical and imprudent to forgive me for another reference to is spinal turn it up to give on a few things where you have because someday going to need friends to protect the stuff you care about most the trump administration might learn from the outgoing horror at seeing some or all of repealed we part company here my perception of was of a democratic party willing to work on compromise legislation while the republicans just stalled there was no unified republican just a ton of people who wanted to be but kept changing their mind but the bottom line is that left behind the old congress now got guys who sleep in their offices and even talk to the other side at the house gym secretly a lot of them are actually but i take your point and another recommendation i would make to president make friends everyplace that was the magic golf with the same people every week since i have no prepared to look on the bright side for a while the republican hatred of is so great that even if had gotten elected it would have been really hard to get the necessary fixes through congress trump has promised and as of his interview something better that preserves the most popular parts of the program so see what he comes up with i know a big fan his agenda and agenda really do congress is set to have a big influence on the agenda over the next and and trump will figure out how to make their ideas jibe plan includes a health care replacement plan for it will actually do some of the things liberals really like getting more people covered i realize that very disappointing for progressives to see but not like it will be replaced by nothing this is one area where the product usually resemble the recipe i remember presidential candidate saying all health care negotiations could take place in on grab your crystal ball and give me a couple of other predictions seeing a big tax cut and huge spending on infrastructure repair followed by a stupendous rise in the national debt certainly true that neither party has been great at getting the deficit under control in my lifetime nobody calls his or her congressman and just do sit only one side adds to the deficit while simultaneously complaining too big but move on obviously cranky how any other how about the early the republican establishment seems to have as white house chief of staff but is going to be chief strategist which could mean anything to me is the kind of guy democrats should learn to live with they and going to be a republican white house but is a very bad dude who represents all the worst strands of racism and misogyny in the trump crowd who do you think will really have the it looks like both will be influential after watching the i find pair of appointments too surprising they signal that in as during his trump will seek to merge traditional republican politics with his unconventional
the reported that attacks against surged last driving an overall increase in hate crime against all groups the which is the most comprehensive look at hate crime expanded on previous findings by researchers and outside who have noted an alarming rise in some types of crimes tied to the vitriol of this presidential campaign and the aftermath of terrorist attacks at home and abroad since that trend appears to have spiked in just the last with civil rights groups and news organizations reporting dozens of verbal or physical assaults on minorities and others that appear to have been fueled by divisions over the election in its report on the cataloged a total of hate crimes in a rise of about percent over the previous year including and property destruction against gays and others attacks against saw the biggest surge there were reports of attacks on mosques and other hate crimes against last a jump of about percent over it was the highest total since when more than attacks occurred in the aftermath of the sept attacks attacks against people also sharply increased blacks were the most frequent victims of hate crimes based on while were the most frequent victims based on according to the data but the increases in attacks on these groups were smaller than the rise in attacks against and people over percent of the hate crimes that the recorded were based on the ethnicity or ancestry religious bias accounted for about percent of all and about percent of attacks were based on sexual orientation law enforcement officials acknowledge that the statistics give an incomplete picture because many local agencies still have a spotty record of reporting hate years after congress directed the justice department to begin collecting the data need to do a better job of tracking and reporting hate crime to fully understand what is happening in our communities and how to stop b the said the regards the prosecution of hate crimes under federal jurisdiction as the top priority of its civil rights branch since the hate crime monitors like the southern poverty law center have reported a rash of verbal or physical abuse targeting minorities and others at mosques and elsewhere some supporters of j say they too have been victimized
was so committed to his new that he was willing to take a flying leap off a balcony the actor performed his own stunts in this conspiracy including a terrifying in the from an apartment down onto a car a said has gotten so and audiences and looking for that switch shot where clearly not you i thought if got this guy where him against the i wanted them to see me get a little beat in starting night on the takes his knocks as bob lee an sniper lured back into action when his former commanding officer brings him into a clandestine only to frame him for murder adapted from the mark as well as of the hunter the series was scheduled to debut in before its premiere was postponed twice after mass shootings in and baton la in an interview at the new a father of proud and ambassador for hidden a support network for military caregivers talked about the art of the long shot and guns in society these are edited excerpts from the conversation is finally arriving after a postponement how did you feel about the we have a really good show that should stand apart from current events but i applaud the sensitivity we talked about changing the title after the show was but it has somewhat of a audience because of the movie so this postponement allowed us to refocus the marketing and make it clear that bob lee was set up for an assassination that he was not a part and is in pursuit of the actual shooter it also gave us time to let people know that a touchstone of our show is to treat veterans with to treat weapons with respect our techniques are sound no flippancy with regards to the within the first five you know that this is not a show glorifying gun violence what about the role won you the first thing mark executive said to me love this and my first and i found that so flattering and from there his attitude was one of it your then i got really into the idea of the action of it and i do action much longer and i got to help choreograph the fights and come up with really twisted ways for myself to get injured so it like to jump from the fourth a tiny plastic hook on my vest and one cable on my back that cable is connected to a and a man on a hydraulic with essentially a spool and a that determines whether you live or die the craziest thing about and i know how morbid it but your brain thinks committing suicide so when i finally took that first step my brain was is shooting a sniper rifle just like any something and meditative about the head space a sniper needs to get into in order to hit a shot a distance of a half mile or more the breathing is absolutely essential you have to gently pull the trigger at the very bottom of your exhale because even your heartbeat can throw off the accuracy of the shot at that distance how did you i went to united states marine camp and they took me to the range with three bona fide marine snipers on my second on a at almost i hit it and they were dumbfounded this story can be verified your take on gun gun laws background yes get rid of automatic weapons being so easily yes the thing about the gun debate that always stands out to in the big cities like new and it makes sense for us to not everyone should have but there are a lot of people in rural communities that might be minutes away from a police station or an ambulance so how are you going to tell somebody like that that they i think oftentimes the problem in this and sort of what we see in these election is that there are many different realities and you apply your to all of them just not fair after filming the you recuperated at the beach in with your family are you a hometown boy made i definitely am is a state less than a million and outside of i may be the most famous suffice it to say that everyone in knows my name
what do you do when things turn out as you this sketches out a solution and a plan for uncertain times he also introduces a new term into the financial the industrial certainty complex as you might not a fan when returns began turning j way night and markets started to i spent the next four hours putting together a column for people to read morning a reminder of no matter what happens to stocks in the short if your goals not clear why your investments ought to you think the end of capitalism is upon and no sign of that so once the election results were returned to a topic he knows more about than nearly the estate tax my weekend column looked at the question of whether we might all be able to agree on the fact that people who work for smaller employers ought to have easier access to workplace retirement plans and it sure would be simpler if this could happen on a national scale plus a safety net ought to be bipartisan enough concepts to make a majority of congress
j election victory was powered in part by forceful opposition to what he described as an economic and political system rigged against the people for the benefit of shadowy forces in the news the banks and the government trump and his allies often describe that system with one globalism it is a word that conjures many none of them shuttered unchecked immigration and a distant cabal believers controls the economy and the media analysts who track extremist groups in the united states have expressed alarm at the use of the word by the they say it carries multiple meanings from benign to sinister and often serves as a for and conspiracy theorists is a principle driver for the fears that animate the radical right in the united said the editor of a published by the southern poverty law center is the globalism is often used as a synonym for the system of global economic interconnection that has been critiqued for decades by liberal groups like labor environmental organizations and opponents of the international monetary fund and the world bank but for the far the term encapsulates a conspiratorial based on xenophobia and according to mark a researcher at the league a host on the media site rebel explicitly rejected its use as a synonym for in a video she posted in she said the word meant rule by autocrats such as president former president w bush and the united nations who value false flag of and immigration from the third almost always sneer down their nose at disdain national laugh at religion and generally despise the west while holding a creepy affection for the third she added want open cheap labor and to benefit their business and political and are all too willing to shaft the little people to achieve the website run by k newly appointed chief white house frequently attacked globalism and during tenure there but no one may have done more to popularize the idea of a globalist conspiracy than a radio host who commands an audience of millions through his media empire he has been called most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary by the southern poverty law center among his the sandy hook school massacre in was a hoax and the sept terror attacks were an inside job posted his own definition of globalism to in in his trademark he described it as a digital control engineered by shadowy corporate and political elites he called it total form of the who has enthusiastically supported hailed the republican as a historical figure who appeared on his show last has in turn heaped praise upon reputation is trump said will not let you down you will be very i hope and i think be speaking a so what is trump talking about when he talks about his hope provided a definition in an email before the election last groups in the united states began to refer to globalism at the end of the cold when it replaced communism as an idea that was an danger to the said they have also referred to it as the new world and soon they saw its tentacles everywhere the shape of that conspiracy had distinctly in part because many of foes had historically seen communism as inextricably linked to said members of the far right became fixated on prominent like the businessman and philanthropist those conspiratorial beliefs were bolstered when former president bush celebrated the end of the cold war in a speech by saying it was the dawn of a world his use of the phrase was taken as proof by many that a globalist conspiracy really was afoot was very easy for especially because he was the one who said to take that ball and run with said that point the phrase became the short hand for that kind of globalism conspiracy the multiple meanings have made it a powerful political and and his frequent references to globalism have drawn in a wide and varied audience is a very efficient net to unite disparate parts of the from the mainstream to the said the director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at state professor called globalism defining folklore and narrative for the racist but said it had also a convenient to explain the various declines that the united states is perceived to be globalism was an important theme in the final weeks of for when he told a rally in in that his opponent for the had sat at the heart of a conspiracy with international bankers plot the destruction of the league criticized the speech for classic conspiratorial talk has continued after the election trump referred to a plot against him again last when he complained on twitter that protests were the work of the news media and paid protesters a trump ally and host on fox business later accused of many on the far right have celebrated election victory as a momentous blow against the globalist conspiracy last claimed on that trump had called him personally to thank him and his audience for their support and to offer to appear on his show again soon ms the trump did not reply to an email seeking comment late night then pivoted to what he thought was most the coming destruction of globalists that hijacked the primarily the news media and international business people soon they would be destroyed once and for he suggested is battling back to restore humanity and to break the he said not gonna be any dtente we know and just here to let you know
if there is one thing that has caused me regret in last it is including my mobile phone number in my voter enrollment form after moving back to from the east coast there much or any activity around the presidential election in but we were lucky enough to have dozens of state propositions and local measures to consider state a local soda tax you name it and we had a chance to vote on it we also had the opportunity to receive an endless streams of texts and phone calls in the weeks leading up to the election it would take an astonishing civic sensibility to not be annoyed by all this attention as wrote over the the cell number has become as important as the social security number the backup for on all sorts of and connected to all sorts of databases people feverishly protect their social security but they often think twice about handing out that cellphone number they should reconsider being so free with that number trust me on this

appearing on that most revered of presidential forums called trump released a video this week describing his plans to great again for and i mean learned not to believe magnanimous but others really want told on that we should give trump opportunity to develop the positive objectives that he may and told an audience in that he wants be respectful of the office and give the an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every forgive because about to pop off have you lost all sense of you and talk as if we have no idea who trump is or what he has been saying for months on end but trump has made it abundantly clear opportunistic words of inclusion notwithstanding that his administration will be loyal to the fringes of the united leaving even the republican establishment running behind announced cabinet choices simply leave no room for imagining a gentler at the helm of the those of us concerned about the fate of the undocumented or the environment or reproductive rights see much reason to worry with the selection of mike and general t to inner circle list reads like a roll call to the dick fan among many other troubling all these men also share a deep antipathy to views are as scary and they are well known pick for national security adviser has called a and stated that is a political that behind this notion of it being a that is not talking about the that republicans frequently invoke but about asked about current republican national committee chair and designated chief of staff told news that are some aspects of the faith that are very i realize that was a scholar of or perhaps even a a renewer of the faith according to popular comes to revive the practice of for following generations or maybe he just said an ignorant thing that would sound bigoted if it were about another religion but today sounds like comments are troubling rather than enabling establishment republicans as a moderating influence on the the trump administration is pulling the traditional down its own giving less extreme republicans about as much voice in this new administration as chair actually worse at least the chair had the good sense to stay quiet my worry extends beyond the realm of what this administration says and reaches into what it will do building a wall on the border is a near physical impossibility the immediate deportation of millions of people is much harder to execute than it sounds but the that can and most likely will secretary of state another hardliner who is in the running for homeland security recently met with trump and was photographed holding his strategic plan for first openly in his hands nobody give this man the nuclear plain for the world to see was the of an useless program of the bush administration officially called and more commonly known as i remember vividly the panic and confusion among the of new city when special registration was first enacted in this which required visa holding men from countries and north to register with the was a massive failure even the own auditor found the program to be ineffective and a huge waste of resources the cost to taxpayers was more than a year and the program alienated around the world from the united states families were torn apart because of special and the brilliant program netted a grand total of zero terrorism registration was useful only as a tool to disrupt average lives and to spend a lot of money needlessly it served no security function and trump is considering reviving it we can assume because it will make this government like doing on the backs of ordinary then this justifying a registry on fox trump surrogate positively invoked internment as a legal precedent for the program that heinous comparison led the new times to publish an by a law professor reassuring us even if the legal decision authorizing internment has never been we be worried because the judiciary now sees the legal justification for internment as constitutional that whole exercise is nuts the question is not about the constitutionality of internment the question is why the hell are we talking about internment are we seriously working through the legal likelihood or unlikelihood of holding large numbers of completely innocent people in detention racial hysteria led us down that road once to say that panic lead us down a similarly treacherous with or without a legal precedent beginning to feel like one major terrorist attack from martial law in this and the new administration even taken office yet a fiction in the us that is frequently promoted by the likes of fox news and that had a major impact on this election the notion is that in our multicultural white get theirs while every minority and special interest group gets extra privileges the idea cultivates a mood of bitterness and even if fundamentally untrue many honestly believe that are getting special privileges that some accept will lead to the imposition of sharia law in this country but this is ludicrous want special privileges we just want to be treated the same way that everyone else is treated going to get special registration hardly a fair need more than assurances from trump that thinking about the whole country when he invokes we need to know that equality under the law will be guaranteed under his administration in what we really need to be doing is proving to all that everyone deserves to be treated equally while acknowledging all of our and that the kind of equality that makes for a stronger until that day every one of us needs to be

so perhaps a different arrangement might work better than the comprehensive economic and trade agreement full membership in the it seems there will soon be a when the finally moves towards the and might make a suitable society is and proud of it while is the lingua throughout most of is widely spoken increasing numbers of speakers have expanded our linguistic fought in in both world wars it has paid its the seven years of negotiation that went into have surely paved the way for a application to join the continent with which it has so much in common full membership might make it easier for both parties to accept a mutually advantageous trading republicans might happily exchange the monarchy and the commonwealth for a seat in and i think we might feel right at home i do not see any reason why calls the demonstrators a broad coalition of union and environmental in addition to millions who signed an petition to stop the trade express valid concerns without leaks we the citizens would still not know what was written in the treaty only after the continued protest did the negotiators adopt minute changes where is the our read it and everything was in who in the or parliaments understood what was written democracy argument does not hold only the parliament dared to speak out against the deal if everyone in the were chances are a majority would reject the officialdom must think how it needs to convince citizens of the benefits of free what are the benefits for or the common people in the trade deals impoverish the great majority of which is one of the major reason for the ongoing migration major economies became rich without free trade only after their economies could compete internationally did they gradually open their markets the latest example is but so did the us and great reference to the high court ruling on article what a farce it is we have a government that only managed to persuade one in four of those eligible to vote for it to do trying to usurp the will of parliament on the basis of a very marginal referendum result on the economic front we have free traders who do not want a free market in even though makes up a significant part of most are just the latest examples of a trend it has been my impression that since the late the western world has been slipping back into a new dark where decisions are made more and more on the basis of mysticism and wish than on the basis of what has happened in the last few weeks and months i think that we have arrived i look forward to the new enlightenment may cannot tear up our right to be citizens without the authority of she can and because she has the authority of the people i wish we had a chance to have our has been an era of surprises trump call this first past the post and perhaps we vote to leave the but i want the back again before the bankrupts us is she hopes their constituents by ignoring and overruling their clear vote for thereby the from its own people disconnect from ordinary voters is what led to now in the first place perhaps commentators should begin listening to us pesky masses a big thanks to for having had the courage to spell out the truth about the rather than hiding behind the that the people have like too many politicians and commentators was it or did really say should ignore the electorate and vote to it seems democracy is only good enough if it suits her particular brand of politics and the rest of the electorate should be led to the promised land whether they choose to go there or for the a after what seems like half a i relished a complete issue of the weekly that did not contain a single reference to trump or i know pay for it next but it was great while it thank thank you i have not read or listened to any news since the disastrous us in which a minority of voters chose a demented racist to replace our first president so i was apprehensive about looking at the as i turned each i became increasingly relieved to read about the rest of the world and nothing about my country thought it was deliberate until i read the life goes on outside the a bold move by the weekly of the then current us presidential elections further proof of its rational and cool outlook e a lot like review of the penguin history of modern made me think of another small with whom the us has only recently started to mend relations despite some softening of sanctions against this country faces an uncertain still subject to continuing sanctions why does tiny a country the us used as a playground and in whose politics the have interfered for more than still attract the venom of its close perhaps because is so close geographically and so long a battleground for internal us politics it is ironic that the a country defeated in the has made peace with but cannot reach a similar rapprochement with a country whose leadership and style of government the seem unable to say the wider gaps in even further suit the configuration of a smile apropos of dental caries the sweet always did worry my m since the polling techniques have become increasingly sophisticated the landslide victories of midterm elections and both and victory were all wrongly predicted the victory for in was correctly forecast are we to conclude that voters are less honest than weekly on
in the republican party will take control of the us government for the first time since the switch from being the party of opposition to being the governing party is never easy and the deep divisions in republican party make transition unusually election added to the chaos as evident dismay and lack of preparation for taking office suggested that he had little interest in doing the job for which he had campaigned so viciously trump lost the popular vote by a significant margin and democrats also got more votes for both houses of congress this lack of popular support puts even more pressure on republicans to craft policies that a majority of can lies the problem party is led not by practical politicians but by ideologues this was not always the case republicans embraced the idea that naturally enjoyed social and economic harmony it was the job of congressmen and women to develop that harmony by figuring out how to use the government to promote equality of opportunity for those

in an era in which inconceivable is making a habit of becoming it is perilous to offer firm predictions about the but folk carry on doing it all the same i was recently at a conference about the causes and consequences of and the where i heard the participants try to keep everyone calm by expressing confidence that those shattering setbacks to conventional wisdom would not be followed by the election of president marine pen was not two rounds of voting would see the leader of the front national beaten when it came to the final choice because moderate voters would coalesce behind whoever emerges as her prime competitor we could rely on to be a firewall against the spread of authoritarian nationalism across the west it all sounded and their confidence was buttressed by the opinion but given the recent track records of both expert opinion and this forecast was more alarming than it was my word of the year is as applied to trump peter read than peer into a foggy crystal liberal democrats might better devote their time to starting to learn some lessons from the seismic shocks of the first of these is not to surrender to a challenge made easier by reminding ourselves of the narrowness of these defeats it suits here and trumpeters on the other of the to roar that they represent for this helps them in their ambition to claim a larger mandate than they have been just as it also serves their to silence any dissent represent just over half of a very divided people trump cannot even claim that much it bears repeated repeating that he lost the popular only gaining the presidency thanks to the quirks of the electoral college had people across three swing states and voted the other we would now be watching the of twitter the us trump and beaten democrat candidate did not do the courtesy of one visit while bewildering decision not to put more effort into those states she did not do the courtesy of one visit is another lesson to apply in campaigning and policymaking take the support of anyone for granted assume that your traditional base is safe when both the vote and the us presidential contest exposed societies fracturing along economic and cultural lines that match traditional was a broad narrative in the us mainstream which seemed to be supported by that a victory was just so with the referendum the bookmakers and most protagonists on both sides regarded it as that would choose to stay within the the treatment of both contests as foregone conclusions proved calamitous for and democrats by inducing complacency among supporters and their opponents treat every fight as tight and never presume that a result is in the takeaway from the us election is that it has become foolish to assume that is an unalloyed asset in electoral politics probably better off presuming the opposite in this age of rage against anything or anyone that can be depicted as or it has become a handicap to be an and a great advantage to be an this was one of tragedies she was one of the best qualified people ever to run for president as a woman bidding for a job that had always been held by she felt her credentials had to be superior to those of any male competitors she would never have secured the democratic nomination had her career been made in reality when her turn to have a shot at the white house finally came her longevity on the scene was not an but a liability one of the more obvious lessons is that you take a big risk running a widely distrusted candidate from a political dynasty in a when many of the voters are expressing anger with the status quo a similar conclusion can be drawn from the referendum the barrage of opinion deployed on behalf of the remain campaign proved far less effective at persuading swing voters than in strategists had is also no longer safe to assume that portraying your opponent as dangerous even if they are will be as effective as it used to be trump was repeatedly described as unfit to be not least by republicans made his excellent joke that a man who could not be trusted with his twitter account could not be trusted with the nuclear codes in the outers were often branded as reckless advocates of a blind leap into the unknown this was true and counterproductive as a strategy for countering them because calling them dangerous did not amount to an answer to the grievances driving substantial numbers of voters in the direction of the demagogues telling a voter that something is a risk only works if that voter thinks they have a meaningful stake in society as it is and many clearly branding the insurgents as rogues burnished their appeal for many aggrieved with the status big chunk of the electorate in western democracies for various so discontented that they are willing to blow up conventional politics if only to see what happens next a lot of trump voters told pollsters they think he was fit to be but put him there anyway five star pioneered by the has taken this to its logical conclusion with the slogan that translates as can say the new are and presume their mendacities and contradictions will be exposed once people have experience of how they wield power was doing that yesterday when he had a pop at the of rich white men like and the leader makes a good point but there was a better one he could have made why have a former commodity broker and a billionaire property developer proved more effective at voters discontented with their economic lot than did the party at our most recent general most disturbing and urgent question for liberal democrats is why their arguments had traction and why demagogic arguments are proving so resonant to

a man who uses misogynistic language and has been accused of sexual assault is soon to become the president of the united states of for feminists desperate to see the first female the result was how could someone with such disregard for rights become trump boasted about being able to freely grope women because he is and by the end of the race different women had come forward to accuse him of sexual assault he also suggested during his campaign that women should face form of for having before backtracking and saying states and congress should take the lead with lawmaking on this matter after the publication of a video in which he describes women by the experts and many predicted that lost the female vote but this turned out to be incorrect it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their to exit of white women voted for trump those without a college degree supported trump over democrat candidate by nearly two to one white women with a college degree only narrowly voted in of by six percentage points by of black women and of voted for some feminists are finding it difficult to comprehend why women so offended by misogyny that they voted for en mass we interviewed women across to find out why they voted for trump and why they describe themselves as feminists what they a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or she thinks and makes her own worker who lives in the much state of voted for trump she describes herself as socially financially independent and educated female i either friends or except for one voted for trump i want to show it was not only men or educated citizens that voted trump i am an economic conservative who is registered as a affiliate i feel that trump has the best economic polices to create jobs and therefore rebuild the economy truly thought video of as been having two and a i can make an educated guess that all heterosexual men have bragged about their exploits with women to another man at some point believe in equality between the sexes i have the right and capability to make my own and live the life i choose for myself because i am a feminist i know and exercised my right not to be put in a box or voting group and to freely think and make my own judgment as to who i thought would be the best candidate for president it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their actions a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or she thinks and makes her own choices thought the sexual allegations were unsubstantiated and therefore equivalent to and campaign mudslinging if these women had truly been assaulted why wait until one month before the election to come forward to the press not the authorities thought it incredibly hypocritical to him as a sexual predator when we know for a fact that bill is and helped him cover it up through libel and slander of the women who did come forward this change my opinion about except for maybe a more sympathetic attitude and feeling that the media was treating him gender has no bearing whatsoever in their qualifications for a including the presidency was not clear as to what her policies as president would except to maybe continue with the same failed practices her policies would not have helped our depressed and stagnant economy i believe plans for job creation benefits including minority groups i also and have for a long to a more isolationist foreign not going to vote for somebody because of their gender or trump voter a mother of two boys who is currently not calls herself a feminist most but she is fiercely opposed to voting for someone based on gender alone instead she backed who shares her own beliefs including not raising taxes her home state of a mix of farmland and more white and less educated than the national mean voted for trump some things i would be a feminist but it mean i vote for someone because she has a vagina always voted republican and always support the party they pushed a female candidate through to break the glass ceiling of a perceived gender equality the end of the day video of did not affect my support for him what he says and what he does matter in those senses because looking for somebody that has the same beliefs as i do in running a country at the end of the day all sinners and we all say things like this it uncommon we act like the president of united states should be some holy person can go through all the us presidents and you will see sexual dysfunctions in all of their personal even husband had an affair at the end of the my sex life does not involve his work life and my sex life does not involve my life these women that came out about trump could have been hoping for media or maybe just simply paid by to make her criminal issues look not going to vote for somebody because of their gender or race there is nothing other than whether they can run the country or a which naturally lends itself to traditional twitter republican nominee was knocked out of the presidential heather brown backed trump brown believes that under trump the us economy will prosper and the average will be able to succeed in areas where they are currently home work and finance she says that trump the misogynist reported to really just felt like they pushed a female candidate through to break the glass ceiling of a perceived gender equality bias politics can be unscrupulous it demands you constantly remember that behind every door lives a pushed agenda
been four years since studio seemingly closed out its science fiction series mass effect with one of the most controversial as some put endings in video game history next the beloved series is with a cast and and some interesting new design features coming two years after the acclaimed dragon likely will draw on a lot of the ideas and systems from that as well as from the mass effect canon but what do we actually about the next the most cinematic so effect has often been but never looked so much like an movie as does in the trailers a lot of what seen is and but the latest trailer released on aka shows the game looking like some ethereal blockbuster starring or and directed by got a plot to game actually begins between mass effect and twitter originates in the year the year that mass effect and right before the reapers invade the milky mass effect a group of desperate scientists and explorers form the its aim to leave the threatened milky way behind to make a new life in the galaxy is a years away it sounds like the action kicks off when the cryogenic sleep is interrupted by a very bad after which you have to lead exploration of the unknown galaxy in your new role as pathfinder according to the official among the first humans in the alongside three other arks which probably contain other species from the milky way there of be scary undiscovered planets and exotic new extraterrestrial allies in no sky with a linear plot and alien new lead twitter a few characters have been leaked or revealed including the lead protagonist or more protagonists for the first time in mass effect both male and female leads and exist as separate also know that the family will be in the he voices the trailer the guy in the black told that he was a but that new draw your own conclusions there also heard through the leak of someone called and a called it could be that the mysterious we saw in an earlier trailer the game informer article mentions a enthusiastic human police officer named and an nicknamed a lone wolf adventurer you pick up en route and whose blunt manner is likely to cause some friction of loyalty missions in which you can complete a unique and personal quest for each character to make them to unlocking bonus skills and and sometimes affecting the mass effect ending matter but history no doubt the long space journey that initiates the the bulk of is set hundreds of years after mass effect so long gone sorry on the plus no matter what you thought of that ending care at get to start afresh there be knowing references to the older games and plenty of fan service titles feature recurring nods to missions from older games and remember that bit in the citadel where you got to dance a tango with destructible one thing missing from mass effect so far has been the ability to make all that handy scenery explode into fragments earlier this us retailer best buy accidentally posted an early offer mentioning destructible cover not much else is known about how this works but it will be interesting to see how different alien environments react to combat situations and what effect this all has on tactics a recent cover feature in game informer magazine added that the cover system will be dynamic a la the last of us so characters will use it automatically without annoying button prompts possible there is also a to add some game designers really loved not yet clear what kind of see in mass but definitely coming several modes were leaked on a few months strike a horde and strike strike team missions can be tackled either solo or with up to three of your friends to gain rewards horde mode is separate to the main and provides the classic shooter experience this will earn you currency that can be used in the single player campaign likely this will follow the pattern of dragon with allowing you to purchase the the active strike team missions look similar to how dragon war table with collecting etc the has stated that will have much less of an effect on the outcome of the campaign than it did in beta is due sometime before the you enjoy the romance in games or here to stay and in likely to be deeper and more nuanced than ever before some characters want others are just looking for a good time as the galaxy crashes and burns around them the system has also been rejecting the old choices and using a new set of response professional and casual this sounds like a simplified version of where choices were shown with a symbol crying to show the tone of your seems the greater nuance in the romance system will allow for more complex interpersonal relationships with companion but the simplified system will make it easier to their reactions no longer have to figure out whether you are renegade or paragon enough to make something work sexy new box art twitter mass effect box art electronic you seen really very nice there will of course be deluxe and super deluxe editions of the the latter two offering varying selections of types and booster bad seems like main antagonist is one of the one of two new that have been leaked already and though we know much about he really seem to like the initiative the and the the major two inhabitants of the are seemingly in and turned up right in the middle of hard to say if be forced to choose a side in this galactic skirmish maybe be forced to side with the guardians or perhaps get the chance to join forces with the to establish a dictatorship for the good of humanity after your only skill trees twitter mass dragon
on a afternoon in early sister drove into the compound of the catholic convent where she lived in the capital of and called out to her fellow nuns there was no sign of the other elderly sisters who lived in the so sister went to find father the head of the to ask if he had seen them he tried phoning but there was no reply so they walked across the shady compound to the where they found the

to the but he was too late sister was already dead in an act of violence unimaginable to those who knew the small and wiry the killer had cut off her next shocked and angry locals closed their businesses and gathered outside the convent to protest against the murders people claimed the killers were being protected by the police some protesters saw the notorious head of the state intelligence general enter the convent some time father emerged from the gates and appealed to the protesters to disperse peacefully three weeks a leaflet was found at the convent urging the mission not to pursue an investigation into the murders at the convent horrified not just because of their brutality but because they took place almost a decade after the end of the civil in which were

militant groups during the civil war but it has also regularly government and paid a price for it in during the civil when the majority rose up against the abusive gunmen executed two priests and a lay preacher suspected of supporting the rebels a year a moderate archbishop was murdered by gunmen more than catholic clerics were assassinated in in the first three years of the civil war when church leaders have denounced the violence of the warring political leaders have often seen them as a threat and done whatever was necessary to silence murders at the convent followed a ripple of unrest across the region in the united nations envoy to had cabled headquarters in new with a warning that the ruling party was distributing weapons and uniforms to its youth wing in some particularly

sometimes i think i have never seen anything as strong as that mean that i like and admire everything about her not here to argue about who she just to note what she did i watched her plow through opposition and attacks the like of which no other candidate has ever faced and still win the popular vote to defeat her it took an unholy cabal far beyond what faced when he was the campaign of swimming with the tide of disgust about the bush administration as the new times the time all the ballots are she seems likely to be ahead by more than votes and more than percentage points she will have won by a wider percentage margin than not only gore in but also in and john f in twitter concession know can flip that and see that trump was such a weak candidate it took decades of scheming and an extraordinary international roster of powerful players to lay the groundwork that made his election possible defeating in the electoral college took the gutting of the voting rights act by republican appointees to the supreme court it took vast republican voter suppression laws and tactics set in place over many years it took voter intimidation at many polling places it took the long republican campaign to blow up the boring bureaucratic irregularity of use of a private email server into a scandal that the media obediently picked up and reheated us yet to join ranks of countries with female leaders read took the director of the using that and his power to stage a misleading smear attack on days before the election in flagrant violation of the custom of avoiding such intervention for days before an election it took a compliant mainstream media running after his sabotage like a golden retriever chasing a tennis ball it took decades of conservative attacks on the served as deputy counsel to the senate whitewater that fishing expedition that began with an investigation in a messy real estate deal in before bill presidency and ended with a campaign to impeach him on charges related to completely unrelated sexual activities during his second took a nearly reality the that deified racism and narcissism as essential to success and power as the feminist media critic points trump said and did was framed in a way to flatter and more flatter his the colossal infomercial fictionalized the cheating businessman as an unqualified success and gave him a kind of brand recognition no other candidate had it took the full support of fox whose roger was so committed to him that after leaving the company following allegations of decades of sexual harassment of he joined the trump campaign it took the withdrawal of too many from even that of journalism into the partisan unreliability of sites and bubbles of social took the mainstream of failure to address climate change as the most important issue of our time it took decades of most media outlets letting the propaganda arm create the false framework of two equally valid opinions rather than reporting the overwhelming scientific consensus and tremendous danger of climate change to stop it also took using as a tool of evidently considering his grudge against the democratic nominee important enough to try to aid the campaign of a racist authoritarian now appears to have so close a relationship with that he often appears on the channel and news site rt he tweeted protests when president information was included in the panama papers hack and has been coy about where his leaked information on the democratic national committee came intelligence experts say it came from and made it clear that he favored win the day dropped his the new times ran a story reassuringly titled investigating sees no clear link to with its own underplayed revelation buried the officials have become increasingly based on the evidence they have that direct goal is not to support the election of as many democrats have but rather to disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine standing in the world more beef over loss is with liberal young and old read it took a shortsighted campaign of hatred on the an almost hysterical rage like nothing i have ever seen before about any public figure some uncritically picked up outright and spin to feed their hate and rejected anything that diluted the purity and focus of that including larger questions about the other candidate and the fate of the earth it was so extreme that in recent i was attacked for posting news stories on social media by furious people who took the position that to be overtly was to be covertly if the perfect is the enemy of the whose friend is the greater of two a lot of people seemed to think the primary ended the night trump was elected i saw that from climate and others who you might expect would have turned to face the clear and present danger of a trump presidency i for much about failure to address the pipeline adequately which was and but overshadowed by what we heard so little million dollars or so invested in the pipeline and the guarantee he would use presidential powers to push it and every pipeline like it through impossible to disconnect the irrational emotionality from and the misogyny continues since election been hearing too many men of the left go on and on about how was a weak candidate wondered about that word not only because it is so often associated with but because what calling her weakness was their refusal to support her as if sent a pink lifeboat and we sent it because we wanted a blue and now we are very upset that people are as my brilliant friend put it some point soon we need to discuss whether sanders would have been able to but helpful it just sounds like democrats should have cut into lead in the misogynist
the world is shocked that elected trump as its president exit polls show that the country is sharply divided on trump along the same lines as its sharp divisions on climate ideology was the single strongest determining factor in the election of republicans voted for while of democrats voted for ideology is also the primary factor associated with acceptance or denial of global as climate scientist explained eloquently in this twitter global weirding with episode was the determining factor in the presidential election trump won white voters by percentage won minorities by points minorities are also far more likely to accept and be concerned about climate change than white as bee white bear responsibility for electing twitter full frontal with divide was the determining factor in the presidential election won urban voters by trump won rural voters by points in many cities are leading the way in taking action to curb global voters younger than went for by a while older voters preferred trump by points voters under the age of voted for by an margin young are far more likely to be concerned about climate change than older there is a gender though smaller than many expected despite accusations from women that trump or assaulted and a recording of trump bragging about sexually assaulting he only lost the female vote by points the same margin by which he won the male and approximately the same margin by which beat and among women white women even favored trump by and white women without a college degree by an astonishing points misogyny dissuade women from voting for him they normally favor democratic presidential candidates by a margin of about points more than men also the margin by which women are more concerned about climate change than did elect and then important to remember that as with gore in more voted for than her victorious opponent gore received about a half million more votes than w bush will likely receive over a million more votes than trump bush and trump were elected because of the antiquated electoral college the popular vote was closer in than in or republican voters were willing to forgive many disqualifying flaws they care about his constant lies per cent of evangelicals voted for trump despite his long history of immoral behavior but many voters willing to overlook the scandal of emails and much of support was concentrated in areas like my home state of where she won by over while enough rural white trump voters were distributed across swing states to give him narrow victories and electoral college votes trump won four states with a total of electoral college votes and by margins of points or the same reason why republicans control a large majority in the house of representatives despite receiving more than a million fewer total votes than their democratic republican voters are more widely geographically distributed than urban democratic voters has become a that minority being rural white explaining the election result is simple republicans voted for trump and democrats voted for received more but trump won most of the states in which the vote was close trump won in areas with less whiter populations with fewer immigrants in these insulated people fear their way of life is and largely right the us a coal manufacturing country anymore trump promised to change but he and his policies will hurt his voters is changing and not the fault of democrats or but trump made them scapegoats and made empty promises to turn back the clock democrats need to find a way to connect with and help these groups who feel the government on their does this mean for the john wrote last now that the republican party controls the us they own climate change for was the country most to blame for obstructing international efforts to curb climate change our senate refused to ratify the protocol president w bush refused to take any action to cut us carbon pollution senate republicans blocked the cap and trade legislation passed by the house of representatives in over the past four the us has taken action and shown leadership in tackling climate change as a humans had a slim chance of keeping global warming below the dangerous limit trump and congressional republicans have vowed to reverse that progress the energy page of official presidential transition website focuses on extracting and burning lots and lots of fossil fuels and scrapping climate trump has already appointed a climate denier who wants to dismantle the clean power plan to lead the transition if the republican party continues on this the costs and suffering from intensified heat and sea levels engulfing coastal etc it will be on the do we do the we must continue trying to break through republican science denial many republican policymakers are rumored to accept global warming in we have to change the political climate so that this a disqualifying position for a party leader to take in public there is no reason that republicans have to deny climate science and in the only major political party in the world that and most of their voters support climate action we can donate to and volunteer to help bipartisan climate groups like climate which is working with policymakers from both parties to build the political will to solve the climate problem these groups are now more important than probably be able to limit global warming to but is less damaging than and less than or as the renowned climate scientist once climate change will be a combination of and suffering never too late to take action to limit the amount of suffering our children and grandchildren will face due to climate cities and states will have to keep leading the way in cutting carbon pollution will have to keep fighting to rid the of the intellectual rot that currently plagues the party and while fight to right the the rest of the world will have to pick up the
as of the nation reels in the wake of the election of people around the world are struggling to figure out next as protesters take to the climate scientists issue dire and immigrants face down fears of some people are wondering whether the states will truly ever be united many in the us and around the world fear the taking to bed and streaming while drinking wine a particularly effective way forward for the country for guidance on how to move past and we asked those best equipped at knowing how to laugh in the face of pain and comedians having a twitter while i am not sold on the term i am still going to use it i am going to my sense of social responsibility and remember that everyone has their own unique and to have compassion before vitriol i am not but if i may their term for merely this i may decide this is the time for my global time to finally see or live in a have to move forward no matter what because that is the nature of political cycles i think in our best interest to process all our emotions as they come and then remember that positive change just happen every four it happens all the time and this a just a roadblock and evolution are as vital a part of democracy as compromise and precedent for i will be replaying clips from the simply to exist in a bubbling hot tub of denial once i move past probably download seven more guided meditation and commit to more flax in my diet inevitably going to be bumpy so might as well keep both ends of my body on have to get back out twitter i have little wisdom to share today it feels dark scared what i do know is that i have a voice and a platform and so many others whose lives will be affected by this election do not though today is a i have to get back out there i chose my job because i wanted to make the world a safer place and starting tomorrow allowing myself a i will get back to work when you are join fall for the same old twitter the only answer i have is for me to get back to work i tell anyone else how to deal with it not black or gay or a woman and i know the fear in their hearts after something like this i can read all the articles about how poor whites who voted him in because in ravaged rural communities and they see any change in the last eight years so they were going to vote republican no matter about holding the media and news companies accountable for reporting on how about fuck the democrats in the first place for every swaying the nomination away from my answer for getting over all maybe fall for the same old shit news outlets can go to can we laugh we because we always will i laughed at jokes about on be fine comedy is indestructible you destroy it just like a war on terror you destroy a concept or a feeling send this to them look how righteous i am i have to go tell jokes in times fucking square tonight back to for those who have a twitter i think being about the situation is the first step totally understandable to feel dread right but more important to not let that dread incapacitate you occupy your mind with being vigilant of the oppression around you it has become so easy to justify oppression in our and we need to be ready to stand for those who have much of a voice right now there are a lot of citizens nervous and scared right now i feel like helping in whatever way you can to and strengthen will also help yourself to cope trying to find ways that make it easier for us all to listen to each other is a fantastic endeavor right way to move forward that i am personally trying is to inject more logical thinking into my comedy material it seems as a country right we are leaning more on emotional response and less on logic to make our decisions comedy is great because it can help condition people to think more critically about things without it coming off as forced comedy can disarm and open people up to new ways of thinking rock and his for seem like there are any easy answers to fixing all this right but weed is more legal now so roll a grab your and look to the must be twitter comedians are surviving this election the way everyone else only a little bit easier get me this quite the most disastrous thing that has happened to me in my entire life my anxiety is so bad physically incapable of being depressed i got up and took a hike this morning who am it because i wanted to feel good it was because i literally wanted to stomp on something as hard as i could and i decided the thing i was going to stomp on was planet earth i would die to change this outcome if i could truly i have no unfinished business on this planet been on had some great i did i saw the that being of all the feelings had today despair one thing not feeling is block not a silver just a fact i take for granted that in this i am luckier than the other people living through this nightmare i get to make jokes and pound my fist and get and because a comedian and because a person who was born in this not much of a chance this presidency will affect me even with even a fraction of the force with which going to devastate everyone else i have no advice i know we need to
another big week for me and my cancer they but so and things are really hotting up before the us election got a good show managed to persuade piers as one of the few journalists who actually knows trump to speak to us from his car while filming in for and really interesting about what the media have understood about the piers is also one of the people from the worlds of journalism and broadcasting many of whom if honest i really claim to know especially well come forward to make my life easier they know this or by offering good wishes and positive thoughts and if my experience is anything to go if you know anyone with a cancer diagnosis hesitate just drop them a line to let them know thinking of them genuinely appreciated show went i but still suffering from occasionally quite acute fatigue i blame the as i get anything like this in the course of seven cycles of also since the really only able to sleep on my back my kingdom for a pair of can i hear despairing partners the doctors reckon this might be because of the impact of the radiotherapy on my which been by the well with the malarkey except that at around five on morning i get the first signs of an unmistakable and potentially very painful condition kidney i was first diagnosed with them more than years ago and every now and again since a new one would get stuck in my kidney and kick off a bout of the name given to the excruciating pain that can come with them this time a couple of painkillers see it off but stand if you can face for what happened a few days first day on the new treatment and one having to pay and my first visit to what one of the nurses laughingly described as otherwise known as the patients medical day so at there i am being shown into the discreetly hidden from the regular day unit be visiting later for my infusion and guess it looked very similar to its and while on the subject of business the seats were actually staff were of and i got my first dose of the very expensive plus per which the currently treatment was first class as previously no problem with the principle that i should pay for as the should be protected from additional unfunded treatment costs i choose to avail myself of but i still struggle with the royal taking a markup simply to supply an already very expensive drug by the is already standard treatment as part of chemotherapy for my cancer in the us and charging a private day rate as a whole day for a treatment that takes just over an hour taken to calling it my very own for scandal i hope putting the money to good which is perhaps something worth looking having received my i was escorted back downstairs to rejoin the rest of the human race in the and do you aside from having identical seats to i think there might actually be more space down but time to get reacquainted with the as its name is a rubber cap attached to a refrigeration system that rapidly cools the thus reducing the risk of hair loss that some chemotherapy drugs otherwise more or less guarantee it work for but it really worked for me over seven cycles of to be a few quizzical looks from other patients more used to seeing women using it and the endurance test that is the first minutes of wearing it as it literally freezes your scalp brain freeze and multiply by was a very small price to pay of course forgotten how hard it would be and very nearly took it off but in the end the name of the new machines they now have at the and a from the staff got me though it so i still have hair on my would turn out to be one of the most difficult since i was diagnosed back in march and none of it to do with my cancer or its metastases directly for a i have been suffering with constipation of cancer patients once it gets to or days as it has for me can become almost painfully uncomfortable then there was the discomfort under my right ribs put down to my liver playing up more another hangover from the radiotherapy and to cap it all was the recurring renal colic from my kidney stones and their appalling sense of timing and the twist the painkillers a mixture of paracetamol and codeine tend to work less effectively over time make you more cut a long story was a bit of a perfect in increasing discomfort and waiting until enough time had elapsed to allow me to take more painkillers which no longer quite do the and make the worse as a i leave the house and have no desire to eat or drink and the latter set to provide the biggest twist of all at for blood tests preparatory to the next dose of new due by after such a dreadful i can add extreme fatigue to my list of ailments dress and have to sit slightly for a rest blood tests show sharply declining level of which means no for me unless they recover doctor also spots that my blood pressure is pretty low and i get when standing up and so prescribes intravenous fluids to at looking forward to radio today same thing happens extreme fatigue and dizzy when i stand up decide might not be possible the by the have been nothing but support itself over the course of my cancer travails return to hospital for more iv fluids i think these are probably the consequences of the radiotherapy taking my appetite for and drink and my simply not drinking enough for far too to to see whether platelet levels
trump has promised to build a wall along the border between the us and after his electoral triumph over many are wondering whether actually pull this or any of his other controversial along with many other minorities in the were railed against by trump during his campaign in the to the he vowed to rid the us of yet despite this adding to his record of xenophobic trump was elected the president of the united states mapping the trump countries and regions feeling the heat read real estate billionaire promised to scrap the north free trade agreement on grounds that it at the expense of us workers he has also threatened to tax the money sent home from the us by migrants to in for the aforementioned spoke to in the us and about the election of and how they think his presidency might affect their lives what they underestimate the consequences that damaging our economic ties can have on feel dismayed and deeply disappointed as bad as that the worst part is feeling powerless we have a say in an event that can have catastrophic consequences to our economy in the us we are seen as collateral damage even those opposing trump seem indifferent to the economic and human pain this situation can inflict on us i understand the economic pain that people in the rust belt are feeling successful trade agreements transfer some jobs from one country to another but are net job creators to all involved countries under the us gained jobs in the south at the expense of the rust belt north gained and the south has but this is the result of failed compensating measures within both countries boosted wealth across the subcontinent cutting ties with will also harm the us it surprises me that during the campaign no one pointed this out and perceive that trade is a game under the us gained jobs in the south at the expense of the rust belt it surprises me this was pointed as trump adopts a pragmatic the damage can be limited to a further decline in my purchasing power owing to the peso devaluation and a difficult business environment while expectations are better anchored if he feels obligated to deliver on the promises made to his voters and revokes things could be much worse our government has little leverage because underestimate the consequences that damaging our economic ties can have on them they are self absorbed and busy inflicting pain on one another of will probably send us into an even deeper power trump has over over our over our our perception of our freedom of over the way the world will see us is terrifying and he is not even the president we woke up to find the exchange rate at pesos for the dollar we went from per dollar on election to yesterday and today expected to reach by the end of the year we have been humiliated in front of the deportations of many who live and work in the united who send money home and who contribute tremendously in that way to our economy will probably send us into an even deeper recession his misogyny is worse than any machismo we have ever see we surprised how many love adore are more than willing to welcome in any who wishes to make their home for the next four bring your come live bring your help us out we are a welcoming country with amazing fantastic great cities with interesting museums and landmarks and restaurants and we hope they will seriously consider it that goes for people who want to escape the our collective the democracy was something to aspire to the spell has been broken in many ways in even the least educated among us believe this man to be a buffoon his ideas are uninspired and poorly that his misogyny is worse than any machismo we have ever seen we are surprised by how much and how many love adore are now wondering where to turn to for inspiration and what way of life and ideology will now inspire this we ask has created a dangerous stereotype of in the have a visa and i can travel throughout the us whenever i which is a lot but i am concerned of the increase of hate or that as a result of the stereotype i live in a place visited by a lot of tourists i worry that they will think that i am or that they think i am a drug dealer or a is not fair that a presidential candidate has blamed because of issues they have he has created a dangerous stereotype of in the us there are a lot of undocumented but a lot of us are living legally in the us many drugs go the us through the but what they forget is the us is the first drug consumer worldwide what they say is that they are in part responsible for the drug cartel violence in some we make jokes about it we now say that we are no longer the country with the stupidest president in the world silver lining is that perceives trump as a common politics in can find common ground to make front to his politics and maybe force the common efforts by different parties before the presidential election i really hope margarita will engage in alliances with other parties to win the will suffer irremediably if trump imposes tariffs on imports renegotiating for example or tax the remittances the fiscal situation in is already strained owing to low oil prices and corrupt politicians with vast regions of the country in hands of or crime trump adds chaos to the already dismal state of government with inept and corrupt politicians like president and the foreign trumps adds chaos to the already dismal state of government with inept and corrupt are going to inflation and currency devaluation will spike making expenses more
picture the scene a us air force falcon has come down over the pilot is being held by state which threatens to behead him video shows the pilot being tortured in a while the terrorists taunt new us trump the family plead for the white house to save him the drama is dominating the news networks a media storm what will trump nobody has a clue trump lacks military experience he has never served in the armed forces nor does he have any background in diplomacy what trump does by all is a short fuse a tendency to shoot first and ask questions later his predecessors would have played for appealed to local or pursued talks while examining options for a president trump is different unused to the awesome responsibility of the oval under fierce pressure to enraged by personal infuriated by accusations of and determined not to show it is easy to imagine trump making a hasty and disastrous call with a few translated into trump could not only lose the he could plunge the us inextricably into the quagmire of another middle east war there are grave doubts about trump volatile temperament and macho doubts about volatile temperament and macho instincts also apply in other global where a us or are always critical and sometimes lethal here are five dangerous issues that could suddenly and unpredictably test the novice cool and common sense in the first days of his and hostage scenario is not wholly imaginary in last a royal air force was captured and burned to death in a cage by the after negotiations for his release failed similar repeat incidents involving and members of the and local are becoming more likely as the endgame in the fight against the caliphate battle is being fought out on two main fronts one is the siege of northern principal city trump has the conduct of the which involves the mainly and militias backed by us special forces commandos but he has not offered an alternative the same holds true of the attempt to seize the headquarters in in northern trump says that defeating terrorism is a top priority and he will the shit out of but including appears to know what this means in practice if the battle goes will he will he cities where millions of civilians is he prepared to deploy us ground what will he do as seems both sieges become bogged or begins daily executions of is also silent about significant military intervention in and and its parallel fight with the president wants two things from an end to us support for the and the extradition of a cleric exiled in the us who he blames for last failed coup with on the back foot and the and governments the feud could explode at any time as the protagonists try to redraw national boundaries and compete for territory and and eastern has raised expectations that he can repair the us rupture with but a reset will come with a price in the first authoritarian will want a relaxation or scrapping of punitive sanctions imposed after annexed in to dismay in trump has suggested he may also seems likely to get his way in where forces have pushed his to the brink of victory in and elsewhere trump has made no serious objection to actions in even though the says they may constitute war crimes he seems content to have remain in or even to treat him as an the renewed use of chemical for new or a suddenly escalating humanitarian and refugee catastrophe could all trigger a new crisis that blows up in forcing him to move against the idea of zones and civilian safe havens still has backers if trump goes down this he could end up directly confronting allies cannot do much about insouciance but they will strongly oppose him if he tries to run down the as he has suggested pressure on easternmost members in the and in terms of political missile deployments and military exercises is reaching new heights and operations are increasingly reported in and elsewhere in the eastern remains a ticking any of these could ignite at any time in first governments want to present a united front but trump seems more interested in buying off by acquiescing in reclamation of former cold war spheres of influence disdain for the he loudly applauded vote to leave and critical reaction to his notably in and point to a possible schism down the road if it trump will have helped achieve a strategic shattering years of shows no sign of backing away from its expansionist policies in the south china and east china seas it is busily transforming reefs and tiny islands into military which will ultimately give it control of sea lanes through which much of the maritime trade passes china continues to ignore the rival territorial claims of including whose commerce is directly counter the us and japan have stepped up naval and air patrols in the disputed areas they have also pursued closer military cooperation with and other regional states such as a recent court ruling in the on a complaint brought by the rejected claims as illegal but rejected the and has since sought to woo the is more than on present that the us and sooner or come into direct either by air or at sea until now a clash has been partly because neither side knows where it would lead nationalist feeling in china is periodically whipped up by the communist party if trump blunders into this delicate or deliberately tries to push the the fallout could be terms of as a trap for an unwary leader elected a new president earlier this year whom the suspect of pursuing an independence agenda it has since increased pressure on including suspending talks has been a frozen conflict for so long that it is hard to imagine it suddenly going but xi is clear that he will
it is no use pretending presidential election victory is a disaster for the united states and the world it at least in a victory for prejudice and for ignorance and spite it represents the triumph of economic nationalism and introspection over internationalism and the global good it is a victory built on fabrications because of will ultimately confounded by its contradictions and its immorality it will be defeated but correcting this deformation will not be easy it will take time and the damage will be explanations have been offered for defeat last week all have an element of truth for she was an uncharismatic figure the democratic base was uninspired and many stayed at home doubts surrounded her past not least in respect of the foundation in many she represented a discredited political establishment there was about her candidacy an sense of entitlement there was her ambiguous legacy and was a reaching up to a place of power no woman has ever gone a mostly unspoken misogyny undoubtedly played a part in her the complacency of the democratic party and liberal too comfortable after eight safe years of did a great disservice the party and its elected representatives badly misread the mood of the nation for the most did independent pollsters and the us media they initially dismissed trump as a clown and then with to give him too easy a these factors contributed to demise but they are not the whole story trump won because he successfully tapped the alienation and disillusionment of white men and women who comprise of the electorate and turned out for him in large numbers as polling breakdowns the determining factors were not education or not religion or not sexual predations or entanglements they were race and linked to economic distress trump exploited a feeling among whites from all suburban and that inclusive and was not working for were significant numbers of people who felt their grievances were no longer being listened to by a centrist party that had loosed itself from its moorings as frank said in these pages last democrats went from being the party of town in to the party of vineyard of the and they did so at roughly the same time that the republicans were sharpening their deadly image of the of the constituency that switched to trump was railing against a sense of being overlooked during eight years of president race unquestionably played a part when trump shrieked his slogan great what he was really saying was white when he spoke about curbing immigration and building a when he minorities and people from foreign countries he does not know or when he vowed to scrap international trade deals that he claims are destroying jobs in the when he railed against selfish allies who do not pay their the subliminal message was always the fear of the foreigner in conjured the illusion of a return to a society of secure safe and agreed values no wonder and other minorities are frightened no wonder us relations around the globe are in turmoil and populists and hard are celebrating no wonder observers speak of the end of the west and the demise of liberal democracy has stormed the shining city on a betrayed the founding fathers who stood tall for human dignity and universal rights and now presages an isolationist made in image a beacon of discrimination and are the peculiarities of the electoral system to too won a majority of the popular vote but was handsomely beaten in the race for electoral college votes and too little attention was paid to the effect of a decision by the supreme court in when it struck down a key part of the voting rights act of by a five to four vote what this did was allow nine states with long records of voting such as south to no longer seek federal approval to change their laws the effect was seen last week as the what has been happening in north a battleground state with a history of racial discrimination in voting republican lawmakers and officials have gone to remarkable lengths to drive down turnout among black who disproportionately there were numerous other examples across the including stringent voter id rules that the federal government had stated earlier this year had a disproportionate effect on minorities for the leader of the free world to allow voter suppression is beyond supporters and opponents alike are about to discover is that like the billionaire is much of what he promised on the campaign trail will not be delivered or will be so watered down as to make no says he will cut raise public spending and slash the federal deficit impossible all at once trump says he will renegotiate or scrap and other treaties but his conceit that this will help uncompetitive in or in is says he will slap swingeing tariffs on but he knows the geopolitical and commercial realities mean he will not he says he will make strong and its then kowtows to the most formidable strategic and undermines he says he will be best friend but his campaign was not above antisemitic trump voters really believe the border wall they need a reality check the power of us presidents to act unilaterally in or any other domestic is extremely circumscribed trump would face endless legal challenges and he would need agreement and funding from prospect that much of what trump has promised or threatened will not happen is welcome perhaps the responsibilities of office will temper his worst producing a the incoherence and contradictory nature of his economic ideas for boosting growth and jobs and moribund industrial areas suggest his grassroots supporters are destined for disappointment economic performance is what will ultimately define the trump has plenty of other horrors in while volatile personality and inexperience add extreme at home and to a host of other worries trump now has the opportunity to stack the supreme court with conservative reactionaries
for has toyed with the idea of a woman becoming president this for an all too brief it looked as if the idea might become a reality but the dream of a female president has remained just a disingenuous myth occasionally serves up in but never permits to spill into its facts instead of witnessing the landmark moment of a woman moving into the oval we can now see the misogyny that became a feature of the presidential campaign bedding down in the corridors of power when trump called a in the final only a few days after a series of recordings revealed him admitting to a series of sexual aggressions and many people thought it was the end of his bid for the presidency social media during election night revealed trump supporters male and female voicing the view that a woman is simply not capable of being too weak to stand up to foreign leaders and the sucker punch for those of us who believe that this particular woman was spectacularly more ready for the white house than her grossly and abusive opponent is that as has historically been the case once a female candidate did not carry even the female vote a staggering of white women voted against and for the man whose statements and attitudes brought kicking and into the light twitter concession speech in conceded the she tried to offer hope to the especially the young of know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass but i know someday someone and hopefully sooner than we might think right of we may not think that right because right now the media is focusing its attention on economic and racial it is not interested in the of but that is also the story of this which was fought over a series of myths and outright two solid the media engaged in spreading and misinformation about the first serious female candidate for president for a few days after we learned that trump likes to grab women the the mainstream media began admitting how many of the derogatory stories swirling around were how many were literally fictions but then the and the story reverted to its misogynistic relentlessly informing the electorate that is untrustworthy it was character and it who still believes these claims are factual and on the some million people do should consider how closely they resemble the stories that have always been told about female both real and fictional to do so is to that it is time to stop as some commentators are that failed us the truth we failed understand a you must know its stories taking a hard look at some of the tales told about the idea of a female president can teach us a great deal about this as well as those to come the women who have become presidents in the history of fiction are not quite as vanishingly scarce as they are in but not exactly numerous until very the fictions were as presumptively white as the candidates just women have mounted a serious bid for us three of whom made it to a major national although only one secured that nomination five became third party and two became major party running both of whom lost we have had three female secretaries of one female speaker of the house but no woman has ever been elected to the executive branch of the idea of a woman in the white house has always prompted the same it is either a a disaster or a cheat was endlessly called to shouts of her although her crimes always varied had she murdered or had she covered up wrongdoing in the deaths of at stolen or was in it matter what mattered was the idea of illegitimacy most stories imagine a female president who murders or sleeps her way into or inherits the fictions about women becoming president have always worked to invalidate the very idea for the novel by a former speaker of the house and avowed enemy of newt which tells of a woman who becomes first woman president and chooses politics over national resulting in a style its now has been tipped for a cabinet because propaganda neither history nor fiction are there more than a handful of stories that imagine a female president who could ascend to the highest office in the land through merit and hard instead she either murders or sleeps her way into or she inherits the from a man fictional depictions of a female presidential candidate on the actual campaign trail are even this may correlate with the fact as herself she was always more popular in office than while running when female presidents are they are in office thanks to a of some which is also power was handed to or she inveigled her way into it either crooked just like fiction is a club into which women presidents admitted they are segregated by cropping up primarily in satire or science female presidents are a or exist in an alternate reality women are disproportionately more likely to become president in disaster movies and because only when large segments of the human race are eradicated do we imagine women in charge in early science fiction the apocalypse often took the form of the nullification of as real political gains sent masculinity into an imaginary crisis from which it has not the any writing that considered the possibility of a woman president focused not on what it would mean to but on what it would mean to men even when written by a woman what seems to be the earliest fictional depiction of a female presidential candidate was a burlesque provoked by the first woman who ran in beecher published narrated by a man who thinks he supports rights until he meets who wants to be president her name your says it she is aggressive and a unwomanly amphibious loud and vulgar by no
are a lot more on my way home today i walked passed a patrol of armed and i was suddenly surprised by how normal that has become to me definitely become part of the scenery in and are part of a new at vocabulary along with national security alert levels in public places have been heightened and i think people and perhaps still a lot more wary about two months after the attacks a car and people threw themselves to the ground i had a hard time going out to concerts and big events for a and even i have to scout out the fire escape when i get there my friend was killed at the last year and i still get used to that he was a kind accepting of everyone and brimming with potential not a day where i think about that and feel sad and bereft attacks are being used to often spend nights near the republic square the and i was shocked to see how empty it months after the attacks i also surprise myself i go as i prevent myself to stop at the square for a moment and to feel did change my relationships with especially with some friends as i come from a town in the suburbs which has a lot of immigrants making up the with of origins debates about what happened and what is still happening are part of our daily life and some friends have the same opinions as me some people i thought i knew started to call for or to call refugees animals because they thought they were having really racist thoughts and talking to some very good friends of mine because what they said really hurt me my father being i got personally offended by been said by some people i think the attacks are being exploited by politicians to win the upcoming presidential elections they just scare people and hope to win like and now no difference between the parties as they just all target nationalism is is in an utter mess and has been for a long time the front national have made gains the country so in on the magnanimous fear since the and the left is too to do anything about it the fact that veteran leftist is putting himself forward once again for the next elections speaks volumes about the lack of progress made by socialism in the past few years here people are exasperate by the their handling of the travail protests was country is currently having an identity crisis politicians have been saying that is the home of secularism in the same breath as saying that is a catholic what they really seem to be getting at is want levels of nationalism being stoked by even the politicians is scary obsession with referencing the as the is as nauseating as it is historically inaccurate i really tell if resilience or simply hard to say been a real change the country has rocked and but its foundations are solid it feels more like what a or the crash of strong reactions at slowly dwindling out one year you deny something did but the scar is if not the is poised to the various cafs already people have resumed their normal lives looks the same it was before those appalling events it has may be seeing more cops and soldiers patrolling in the but not that striking if a change has taken it is happening at a deeper level and while true the emergency state has been there been any report of real though some may have flared up every so really tell if resilience or simply numbness and resignation as a matter of if the purpose of the attacks was to spread then it panned out people are both willing to resist and if something must it will and hardly anything you can do to prevent so the best course is to carry on as before and be oblivious of the danger which is the right path to tread has changed dramatically since the has changed dramatically since the attacks during there was this fear of mass gatherings and the possibility of an attack politically has changed politicians had been making a discourse out of what it means to be for years but since the every party and every politician has something to good and for bad the whole political debate gravitates around what defines the fundamentals of society and on what kind of social contract we all rely my biggest hope for is too stay united and not to get lost in adversity i wish that we can continue to live with different especially in a city as mixed as most relevant think is the rise of the every day i hear conversations about whereas it was not the case before when i talk about politics with my the first issue they mention is immigration the migrant crisis which is facing has bolstered this atmosphere the most relevant thing is the rise of the national front takes advantage of it in the little town where i live near of the inhabitants voted for them at the last regional election it is a democratic town i was at the counting after the election with my father and the mayor told us believe of the population i administer vote for them taken we also were and it is far worse in other regions in the wake of the a released a song in which he says have no choice we have to live together or to die it is exactly

thanks for trying our us presidential election results alert interested in your impressions please take this short survey and let us know what you thought of the alert experience we appreciate your feedback
world leaders have begun congratulating trump on his election win as people around the world anxiously wait to see how their country will engage with the new us president the order in which trump spoke to leaders around the world has sparked speculation as to how he will shape his foreign policy in the hours after his victory trump spoke to and south the may was on the action planned after second night of protests across us read was the first to have a conversation on how to closer diplomatic with the us prime discussed regional security and how to defeat a key promise in election campaign but although the and the offered they his leadership a of asked people around the world to tell us what the situation looks like from where they how their governments are responding to victory and how they think his leadership will affect their and the us will probably grow closer but as citizens we will suffer from endorsement of our live in a police state where activists and journalists disappear or are jailed the administration had been putting pressure on our government to improve human rights and freedom of but i doubt administration will do the same this is evident from our current eagerness to connect with trump i hope he hires a team that understands the complexities of the middle east it is evident he does have a and trump are heavily disliked in the middle east by and while trump is openly hostile to and clueless about the policy as secretary of state has been very deliberate and damaging to the region despite her more tolerant and inclusive gone through a very similar election scenario in in where both candidates were i was not very surprised by the outcome the democratic party underestimated popularity and the dislike for i feel a lot of votes went to trump out of spite for perhaps if a different candidate had gone against trump the outcome would have been different just like what happened in it looks like the population is now sharply split in with each side the other i think the most dangerous thing that can happen to a intolerant people in power might make it easier to challenge them as they are now out in the but healing the rifts in society is much harder i simply hope trump will become a president for all us as is his and reign in the hateful extremist tendencies displayed by white hope he hires a competent team that understands the complexities of the situation in the middle east and as it is evident that he does not have a trade conflicts but he will use his business wisdom to deal with feel great about the result a tremendous win for the for those who were constantly ignored by political elites in i like trump a lot because he knew the real problems of the country rather than just chanting politically correct us is divided probably more divided than when i worked there for three years that happens when you are obsessed with gay rights and minority rights but forget to promote the most basic right of living a better life for the majority he will be a great president if he improve some of his to plot and the are now dead trump is likely to be a more pragmatic figure than so relations will improve going to be some trade conflicts if trump lives up to his word about but i believe he will use his business wisdom to deal with it china will have an easier situation and a stronger influence in the region a cooperation between these two countries could benefit humankind i wish that trump could be more presidential he will be a great president if he improves some of his rhetoric i hope that he can get along with have a lot of supporters for trump mostly from say the result was shocking would be an understatement victory of an fanatic like in a country known around the world for its liberal virtues and is something that adds to the swerve of the world to the right he adds on to the list of politicians such as in in and of in maybe we are witnessing the gradual transition of the world into a global we have a lot of supporters for trump mostly from parties another moment of jubilation for them maybe the consequences for foreign policy will be beneficial as trump has publicly shown his admiration for and his way of governance but his temperamental nature makes trump truly so we will have to wait and see as long as he turn rhetoric into i think the world will be southern where most of the people have a similar opinion to me but in the northern areas of the stomping ground of the ruling opinions may differ the philosophy of of a mutual peaceful which was even enshrined in our foreign policy until an ideological regime is something i firmly believe and the rise of a person like trump is a question mark on existence itself the hidden silent majority that is supposed to have created this ruckus may not be as silent as they are portrayed to be as in every other some are always bound to feel during the rule of a government they which could be for cultural or economical reasons beyond doubt this result was the result of what they call some sort of racial hate storm against the former policy on terrorism and the domestic election helped me to see what the us truly is under the pop culture disguise they have a huge rising tide of fanatics and a population desperate enough to find hope in them maybe his campaign of rhetoric and hate was a charade to reign in their support as long as he limits himself to rhetoric and dare turn rhetoric into i think the world will be

despite a lack of political business magnate trump swept to an improbable victory in the us presidential is clear that despite a series of his message resonated with a huge number of voters in key and revealed deep anger and trump wins us to deliver concession speech live read spoke to six trump voters about why they voted for the republican and why they think make a good want the legacy continued in the white is a man regardless of getting a hefty loan from his he used that money to make a name and legacy for himself i hope that experience as a businessman will enable our country to operate more effectively when it comes to managing our money i want to change to serve the people instead of a political system that wants to serve itself my life change except i will have more hope that my government is trying to make our country strong instead of pandering to its own liberal interests my main hope is that he will help balance our and secondly that he will help our economy to remain want the legacy continued in the white house we impeached one and there is too much scandal that revolves around the other why would i want that legacy in my he may say controversial but at least he tells you what he thinks i certainly disagree with anyone that has behaved in a racist or sexist way i feel like i know where i stand with trump he says what he right or and i know what dealing so tired of the media and democrats bellyaching about trump getting voted in what the people pretty sad when all you hear is gloom and doom on the which i thought was supposed to be a balanced representation of the two sides there is a whole other part to this country outside of your newsroom walls that actually thinks differently from the mostly liberal ideas that most news outlets put out there we are middle we are the hardworking people who are holding this country together with our and we are ready to have a country that keeps its book in balance like we do with our private bank accounts small business owner knows how to make deals that will make prosperous was a democrat for but my children and grandchildren need an that is out of debt all that did was double the debt since he took office i will feel a whole lot safer than i ever would with the biggest question is to ask why he kept sending troops and flooding us with refugees that are not vetted for the proper amount of time with the possibility of terrorists mixing in and coming to our my great nephew is still asking that question as he did two tours in he got out because he felt the president care about him or his comrades we have the greatest veterans in the i am one of them the last two presidents care about what happened to us created but minimum wage jobs you support a family on a minimum wage our manufacturing plants are the coal industry is gone from my area and would just shut it down the rest of the way is a failure thank god i have to use it but there are families that need it and if they afford it they get fined that in itself is the mindset of a dictator was going to expand it and make it available for illegals believe trump will be a good president because he knows how to make deals that will make prosperous again we need to bring our nation together i like the fact that all three branches are controlled by the same now we can get down to the business of straightening out our taking care of our our getting the economy moving again and repealing retired from the federal government twitter how the us election night want conservative cried when i left the polling location because i like trump at all i was deeply saddened to vote for him his his mannerisms and his inexperience repulse me i wish there had been another conservative choice without simply throwing away my vote i know if i travel outside of the us i will be deeply disliked because of him he is only a investment and i am trusting in the checks and balances of our country to prevent him and his from damaging the country too much hopefully trump will not affect my daily personally do not have a gun but i strongly support the right to bear arms it as a right that ensures protection from government tyranny i am also against has the opportunity to elect a supreme court maybe even two or three members considering the current health and age of some justices justices serve for a lifetime and i do not want the justices to be liberal i want conservative laws therefore conservative justices i can deal with a somewhat low four but i deal with a supreme court that swings liberal and i deal with losing gun rights i hope the years fly by and that he will do as little damage as possible i am deeply saddened by these options and i am not proud of our president in the least is exactly what you with you know decide who to vote for until the day before voting it was one the hardest decisions i have ever made i decided on trump for one zones guaranteed full scale war with on day one i mean how do you expect to initiate a zone over a sovereign that would then in turn guarantee a conflict with which will assuredly lead to know would have been business as usual as we ever closer to a nuclear war with four years is a long time but there is always and the next election a risk but one the
may has congratulated trump on his us presidential election as the and his lib expressed deep unease at the sturgeon has urged trump to prove that he can act for all us citizens regardless of their heritage after his surprise victory in the us presidential has pledged to share the on with the leaderships of northern and before the first meeting of a forum intended to allow the devolved administrations to help shape families who claimed that the bedroom which restricts housing was unfair have won their appeals against the government at the supreme international has a trade minister for to to seek contracts for companies ahead of the world cup without apparently highlighting the human rights abuses faced by migrant workers building venues for the all from me for for the comments what will or should presidency mean for the here are three good articles that address at the economist says a trump presidency will make harder a single theme unifies these risks is a giant shock to place in the world it will sever old links and require new ones to be forged as some of its keenest proponents this transition will bring painful costs most of all it demands lots of good will and flexibility on all sides in so far as win means a more more volatile global it raises those costs and shrinks that space for compromise and consensus essential for a smooth the damage of a trump presidency on a demands ambition and perspective from may her approach should be build a closer alliance with not just on but on wider the world and china in and other capitals officials complain that referendum result has taken mind off all other matters the prime minister must not allow that to happen and instead work with as a bloc capable of countering worst may should use influence in is if not as much as like to to attempt to moderate the new staying his hand when he does wrong and indulging his vanity when he does right may already had her hands full with for sake and that of the she must also deal with executive director of stronger in at the new statesman looks at what the left can learn from the trump and victories a new politics is one with the seeds of dignity we must find our way to a prosperity which gives people a greater sense of where communities have more autonomy to judge their own and where international cooperation is used to tackle the worst excesses of including tax human trafficking and illegal do we need a new language of politics one that refuses to pander to prejudice but that what the social psychologist calls the which those on the left cannot hear for imagine that there are concentric circles of loyalty country which are not just a comfort blanket in times of but are hardwired into us as human this overt displays of patriotism which may make liberals uncomfortable can in fact be and used to reinforce positive values an academic and former adviser to has called it which from the idea that the basic responsibility of government is to the welfare of not to pursue some abstract concept of the global at asks if the special relationship can survive we cannot know in advance how protectionist the us is going to become but we can know that as a trading nation wanting to buy and sell freely with the whole is likely to be a loser if protectionism really does become the of the least the traditionally close relationship between our intelligence services and those of can still be depended upon but it is not going to be a comfortable or predictable may and had better mean it when they say that will have a great new partnership with our friends and going to need it tom a researcher at the foreign policy has posted an interesting thread on twitter about the implications of win for foreign implicitly defends decision not to express any reservations about trump today see point twin poles of foreign policy for years have been special w us and active membership of both in if foreign policy has a strategic purpose it is building rules based order trump diametrically in post war history has never had to manage a us which is actively undermining its main international this is more significant than past splits over the two governments will no longer share a world uncomfortable but must stay close to trump for influence concerns of close ally may provide cover to alter course on for gov to publicly trump should be resisted better to be ally he listens to than join critics geopolitical context for completely changed will still happen but imperative to do so in way that does further fracture trump will also be less useful as an ally than in negotiating brings could have pressured to give avoid splits in west not clear trump even more essential now that and find a new mo for cooperation on foreign policy as leaves if us cannot lead and must try to fill the vacuum unity this will create pressure for gov to raise and pressure to do same tricky for given fiscal ambitions for to be serious global player have generally rung hollow if this change what trump exceptionally bad news for managing climate goal and one of few multilateral success stories of recent if pen wins in then the may unravel and all bets are the outgoing is spending the day at a in with among others a spokesman said would not be speaking to the press in and was due to fly to later in the day but has issued this statement the establishment is in deep shock even more so than after what we are witnessing is the end of a period of big business and big politics controlling our lives voters across the western world want nation state proper border controls
the unthinkable is only unthinkable until it happens like the sack of it can seem historically inevitable so it is with the global political earthquake that is the election of trump as the next president of the united states if he is true to his campaign which were many and win will herald most stunning reversal of political and economic orthodoxy since the new deal in the but with the opposite intention and effect it halts the ailing progressive narrative about modern and the world in its tracks it signals a seismic rupture in the global liberal economic and political order that had seemed to command the century after communism collapsed and economy that the trump triumph has echoes of the increasingly alarming general rightward shift in the politics of other western to which progressives have again produced inadequate responses the parallel with vote is obvious and real is the further boost that the trump triumph may hand to nationalists in many parts of marine pen jumped quickly on that bandwagon the result will be lamented by liberals across and beyond but it will be cheered in and which will feel emboldened this is not a good week to be a or a and another dire one to be a the result is also a generational challenge to progressive politics to find the radical and credible message that eludes them in so many not just in taken this is primarily an catastrophe that has brought upon itself when it came to the us was unable to find a credible way of rallying against trump and what he represents failed that crucial test both in herself and in what she for her this is the end but she was the not the cause trump was not taken seriously and was widely not expected to beat throughout the bitter campaign at each his candidacy was deemed certain to crash and burn the opinion polls and the vaunted probability calculus rarely trended in his both are now discredited only after the less than two weeks before the was it widely imagined that the tables might turn in nevertheless by the eve of poll trump was again the trump won big in an election if the exit polls were most people made up their minds long before the furore victory was total it was more than anything on the white irrespective of age or white people mostly voted for him it was the most stunning upset in modern us not even a squeaker he won most of the battleground states into which the campaign had poured money north and en route to a decisive republican electoral college total exceeding that majority is on the flyover which inhabitants of the big democratic bastions on the coasts often only see from feet but the red tide pushed north deep into the and consolidated in the south although the electoral college system amplified is set to win the popular as democrats have in every election bar one since republican congressional candidates who had scrabbled to put distance between themselves and their nominee after the ugly debates found themselves riding to victory on coattails republicans held most of their seats in the senate and will be the chance to extend their majority in when the beneficiaries of the wave of face the voters more the house remained firmly in republican hands speaker and his lieutenants have more to fear from their own party grassroots and from a perhaps vengeful new man in the white house than they do from the shattered for whom this outcome is the sum of all trump is the shock heard round the world now that he has the instant explanations have already started to flood that the of this or that demographic was that he tapped the angry that he spoke for millions who felt abandoned by the prosperous and that was always far stronger than liberals wanted to that he was a celebrity candidate for the that he rode the tiger of that making great again was a message in a militaristic and imperial that white men many white had had it with political that misogyny swung that the mainstream media failed to call him that it is a verdict on the that was always the wrong that there was racist dirty work in the voting that it was the who won it for him twitter highlights from presidential victory of these explanations are irrelevant all of them have something to say but beware of instant certainties as with in the immediate aftermath of a huge a period of careful and reflection is in order this is not to diminish the immense seriousness of what happened on nor is it to understate the anxieties about what lies ahead as steps back and trump takes particular fears now stand out the first is the unleashing of an unbridled conservative agenda in now that the republicans control the white house and capitol hill a rare thing in the past hundred years in her dignified concession speech rightly the need to defend democratic she might have drawn attention to president legacy on and climate change too trump and the congressional republicans have he is more prepared to use the power of government than many of them are but they have a clear path now towards reshaping the supreme court and dozens of judicial benches in their own image the effect on gender and issues is likely to outlast period in office the culture wars will reopen abortion rights are second is the impact of this result on race in more widely trump campaigned against migrants and against insulted black and launched ads that some saw as covertly and was cheered to victory by every white racist in the land his voters a echo again will want him to deliver every action he takes in this area threatens to divide and inflame after a of uneven but undeniable racial progress in the consequences of every attempt
race and sex stoke deep responses in the years ago the great oral historian studs recounted a story told to him by a woman been molested by a relative as a child tried to tell her mother but no one would believe her yet one day when she was shopping with her mother and they spotted a black man far away on the other side of the department store the women gathered the girl close to worrying aloud about the unbridled lust that that man might toward little white girls the woman told even as a young she could see the craziness in that they could not see or hear that she was being assaulted by a member of the but instead their anxiety against the distant figure of a black man obliviously going about his have been thinking about that story quite a bit in recent as pondered the phenomenon of peculiar appeal to any but especially a particular stratum of conservative women particularly intrigued by women who worry aloud about his extreme or misogyny or careless grasp of foreign affairs yet who then say that what really drives their allegiance is of the supposedly murderous and licentious this is often expressed as a repulsion so strong like the little mother and they are willing to give uncle a pass in the face of multiple allegations of sexual breathtaking unprecedented verbal incoherence and the intensity of vitriol directed at still mystifies me to a great story reminds me that there is an affective dynamic to all an emotional narrative that may make sense in an alternate universe from which i may be functionally excluded race and sex stoke deep autonomic responses in the psyche trump began his political career more than years ago by taking out a ad in the new calling for the execution of five teenagers wrongly accused of raping and beating a young white stockbroker who became known as the central park jogger although evidence pinned the crime to another trump has never backed down from his assertion that he was us has elected its most dangerous leader we all have plenty to fear read throughout the trump has evoked old tropes of a ravaged endlessly at risk from thugs and terrorists with endorsements from the likes of the and trump has a narrative of warrior masculinity that dates back to film birth of a nation the trope of pugilistic white vigilantes fighting against lying and libertine black invaders black voters in that in order to protect the of frightened white women it seems not insignificant that trump has consistently appeared with a backdrop of attentive beautiful women who smile and wave and whom he symbolically shelters from rapists and terrorists and the bad from many of us nasty women of a certain age and is not sheltered by such cowboy chivalry in her achievements as secretary of state were slandered or obliterated in ways underwritten by suggestions of combined with horrendous and ubiquitous caricatures of the dangerously black man who stole the reins of power in a lustily union with supposedly this alternative trump holds great appeal to those who were only recently forced to remove the confederate flag from government in a profoundly felt have never conceded that the civil war is over twitter trump victory a against a black says van a diseased patriarchy is in a battle to the death with you ever underestimated the ferocity with which systemic patriarchy would fight a woman attaining serious think again but make no underlying all the other issues in this election demographic shifts and economics and globalism and immigration and at the core is a terminally diseased system of male supremacy in a battle to the death with women some male who are determined to save ourselves and this is hardly but her flaws are those of a sane human being and a politician not of an orange who thrives on hatred she could not have committed enough short of to warrant the years of attacks weathered starting in for simply wanting to keep her own name and law career this sexist vitriol came from the left bros

fears of men terrified of a future filled with black and female plus and technology requiring skills they lack the conjured their for decades then acted as if they were shocked when he rose and walked hypocritical evangelicals rushed to back this multiply divorced adulterer who spews hate speech our media was held hostage to ratings and ad head of know bad for but great for so bring it not until did the press grasp the gravity of the and it was print media proclaimed not broadcast that broke serious investigatory journalism about trump though he received nowhere near the scrutiny has endured for decades and we worked ceaselessly to support her and voted as if there were no it feels as if there will be no tomorrow the unimaginable has happened fascism has come to the republic no world is one thing we know is that women are more than half the us and the electoral gender gap was a chasm and the demographics of diversity and are on our are digging and we will outlive them the planet

first dog on the moon on president trump a elections
a month ago i tried to write a column proposing mean nicknames for on the basis that it would be funny to turn the tables on him for the cruel diminutives he applied to pull it off there is a darkness about trump that negates that sort of a folly so an incompetence so profound that no insult could plumb its has run one of the lousiest presidential campaigns ever in saying so i am not referring to his business practices or his vulgar remarks about women i mean this in a purely technical this man fractured his own party his convention was a fiasco he had no ground game to speak of the list of celebrities and pundits and surrogates taking his side on the campaign trail was extremely short he needlessly offended countless groups of disabled mothers of crying the bush and among others he even lost for now he is going to be president of the united states the woman we were constantly assured was the candidate of all time has lost to the least qualified candidate of all time everyone who was anyone rallied around and it make any difference the man too incompetent to insult is now going to sit in the oval whence he will hand down his verdicts on the grandees and sages of the old there is a bright side to a trump victory after there was a reason that tens of millions of good people voted for him and maybe he will live up to their high regard for him he has pledged to the of and maybe he will sincerely tackle that task he has promised to renegotiate and maybe will finally come to pass maybe win so much for us he once predicted in a campaign that get sick of not deceive ourselves we going to win anything what happened on is a both for liberalism and for the world as president trump goes about settling scores with his former picking fights with other and unleashing his special deportation police on this group and we will all soon have cause to regret his ascension to the presidential throne what we need to focus on now is the obvious what the hell went what species of guided our democratic leaders as they went about losing what they told us was the most important election of our at the top she has an impressive she worked hard on the campaign trail but she was exactly the wrong candidate for this populist moment an insider when the country was screaming for an outsider a technocrat who offered when the country wanted to take a sledgehammer to the machine twitter victory speech in was the democratic candidate because it was her turn and because a victory would have moved every democrat in up a notch whether or not she would win was always a secondary something that was taken for granted had winning been the number one several more suitable candidates were ready to go there was with his powerful plainspoken and there was an inspiring and largely figure each of them would probably have beaten but neither of them would really have served the interests of the party so democratic leaders made their candidate even though they knew about her closeness to the her fondness for and her unique vulnerability on the trade issue each of which trump exploited to the fullest they chose even though they knew about her private email server they chose her even though some of those who studied the foundation suspected it was a sketchy try to put over such a nominee while screaming that the republican is a monster is to court disbelief if trump is a as liberals often democrats should have put in their strongest player to stop not a party hack chosen because it was her turn choosing her indicated either that democrats mean what they said about that their opportunism took precedence over the or maybe supporters among the media help either it always struck me as strange that such an unpopular candidate enjoyed such robust and unanimous endorsements from the editorial and opinion pages of the but it was the quality of the enthusiasm that really harmed her with the same arguments repeated over and two or three times a with nuance and contrary views all the act of opening the newspaper started to feel like tuning in to a cold war propaganda station what it consisted was virtually without flaws she was a peerless leader clad in saintly a a caring benefactor of women and a warrior for social scandals real the economy was doing well was already people supporting if they it was only because they were botched humans racism was the only conceivable reason for lining up with the republican candidate how did the crusade the fourth estate came together in an unprecedented professional consensus they chose insulting the other side over trying to understand what motivated them they transformed opinion writing into a vehicle for high moral boasting what could possibly have gone wrong with such an put this question in slightly more general terms and you are confronting the single great mystery of the class just spent the year rallying around a professional really all that and either insulting or silencing everyone who accept their assessment and then they lost maybe time to consider whether something about shrill shouted from a position of high social that turns people even larger problem is that there is a kind of chronic complacency that has been rotting liberalism for a hubris that tells democrats they need do nothing they need deliver nothing really to anyone except their friends on the jet and those nice people at the rest of us are treated as though we have nowhere else to go and no role to play except to vote enthusiastically on the grounds that these democrats are the thing between us and the end of the world it is a
it for this and the campaign our new team is up early for a polling day us election voters head to polls as trump and aim to make history live read more has a chance of winning the according to a email from the respected pollster silver up from a chance on so has had a good run in the polls in the final days of the campaign projected margin of victory in the popular vote has increased to from a lot of you north and flipped from red to blue over the course of we think a particularly meaningful because the forecasts are probabilistic chances of winning increased to from for which is nontrivial but not an especially large change we know something a lot of readers follow unlikely that any further states will flip to in our final as too far behind in the state possible that and north could flip to trump by tomorrow though probably not where lead is a bit larger who is to blame for not stopping trump few suspects spared a mention in hall of shame they include the other republican presidential candidates such as and who themselves to be by a reality host and serially bankrupted but also trio of and newt those three horsemen of the republican apocalypse conspired in the lie that a salesman was fit to be president and destroyed what remained of their reputations in the process plus running mate mike defender of family values who has served as the running mate of a serially grabber of also rounds on the on a epic of the media and there are cameos for and and finally a dig at the us some blame surely attaches to the who let trump keep up the bullying and the bigotry and voted for him anyway there is no escaping the fact that north of of the us electorate have been prepared to vote for trump despite everything that he has said and done one poll found of own supporters believed he would start a nuclear war they thought but were prepared to vote for him anyway none of them will be able to is to blame for this awful us read more video of final campaign rally lady gaga and were on hand to sing living on a prayer before introducing the democratic candidate lady gaga and back at final campaign rally unlike the trump and his team chose not to pose for pictures as his plane returned from his final notes trump plane has landed at a different airport than the traveling press to a packed crowd in a community college gymnasium in trump outlined his closing message that election will decide whether we are ruled by a corrupt political class or by the polls set to open after and trump make final pitches read more reports on biggest closing rally in and and all visits city of founding fathers for final rally as goes to polls read more emerges from the plane with bill at her side wearing bright red she waves at her supporters with both hands she also claps and looks very chipper blares as steps off the plane campaign plane has just returned home to county airport in new after her final rally in north has live footage of members of her campaign team staggering off the plane it also showed bill milling about in the plane at the top of the steps scene in white plains as lands after her final campaign flight supporters chant election day has been and gone for three small towns in new which thanks to the quirks of the electoral system count their votes as soon as the clock strikes midnight if anyone still uses striking clocks any turnouts huge but then nor are the sanders if wondering how the stock markets are reacting to election has you covered over on the business live markets nervously await election results business live read more where are the polls as the us tips into election day there on the west coast too gives a chance of latest forecast gives a chance to win the state of the nation study puts on a likelihood of the new times sees on and trump on clear politics national average that including fringe candidates and stein also puts but by only percentage poll of polls gives her a slightly more comfortable cushion of v read on the polls and what they telling is leading the polls the day before not a clear or read more
to become the president of the united or trump has to win electoral college votes the candidates have spent what feels like years locked in mortal but in the next few hours there will finally be a victor probably if a or a mandatory prepare for constitutional remind me how the electoral college works each state is assigned a certain number of electoral ultimately based on its population has the with seven states north south and have just three electoral votes gets three there are states in the most of these are republican or democrat they vote the same way every time going back at least six elections so the presidential election boils down to just a handful of the or states that have a recent history of selecting both republicans and democrats this is why voters in places such as north and new are subjected to a barrage of television advertising and campaign stops also why you have not seen and trump holding rallies in or twitter how does the us electoral college faces a much more difficult path to victory he needs to win almost all of these swing states to become the next whereas if wins two or she wins the race this is because democrats start from a stronger position there are states plus that have voted for a democrat for president in every election since that batch amounts to electoral votes there are only states that have voted for a republican in every election since those states carry just electoral simply wins all the states that have voted for her predecessors in the recent then adds has electoral she is the next president if she loses but and north she will be the next needs to hold on to all the historically republican win states such as and which are usually republican but where he has struggled in the polls and then win enough swing states to tip him over closing et in because now the real fun polls close in eastern and most of of each state are on central so the polls there close at running is the governor of in the past years the state has voted democrat only once for in some states we will know the winner almost immediately after the polls close most news including the rely on the associated press to races is able to announce the winners so quickly because it deploys thousands of people on election night to collect results from counties and locales as they are announced it also uses exit polls and voting history solidly democratic or republican states are likely to be called quickly swing states are likely to take trump drink but trump have to worry about the prospect of a trump presidency a nice way to toast and if you were minded to do so the builder might be to mix up a cocktail as you settle in for the night got cinnamon schnapps and orange juice but the most fun bit is the cotton candy on top it look just like his twitter the cocktail it could be a long or a short one but at this stage we likely do not yet so our advice is to fuel yourself for a not a sprint and you can feed yourself and prominent role in us elections by preparing a chili a more take on your traditional brought to by in the if drinking more than one of you will want to line your rolling you always get what you want a perfect to election given that both candidates are incredibly unpopular with the public trump likes the rolling stones and played this song at his rallies the rolling stones do not like and asked him to stop he et ends in three key swing and new a minimal number of polling stations may stay open until electoral college votes have proved crucial in the recent past gore can tell you that he narrowly lost the state some still believe he actually won and the election to w despite winning the national popular vote away from the top of the senator and republican presidential candidate is up for he has been running a bit ahead of democrat in the polls who resigned as chair of the democratic national committee in after leaked emails showed the party favoring is expected to comfortably win to was a reliably republican state until won there in and again in the mix of rural wealthy federal government employees and military and so on make it difficult to but has been decisively ahead this year new has been won by a democrat in five of the past six presidential elections but the granite state gave trump his first big primary and recent polling here has shown a tight race twitter spice things up states closing at et include south and home state sanders won the democratic primary in by an amazing points but now with has a cocktail called dirty little a vodka martini with hot sauce in a reference to an interview in where said she always carried a bottle of hot sauce you could quip to your friends that a perfect as the race is to heat et close in west north and expect the result from west very quickly trump should win easily north and are swing states and will take longer has been seen as a reliable bellwether voting for the presidential winner in every election since that run might be coming to an either because of the changing demographics or because of the strangeness of the current in terms of the of both candidates while its demographics are complicated a mix of rust big farmland and more the electorate has grown more white and less educated than the national mean that trend appears to account in part for strength in the buckeye state this the message of love because is was born in you could also make a point about spreading a
there has arguably not been a us presidential election with so much at stake for the rest of the world since the second world war one candidate stands largely for she would do slightly more than her predecessor to shore up the existing liberal world order her opponent is vowing to turn that order on its jettisoning alliances and free trade while seeking to cut deals with the authoritarian trump is elected on it is likely to trigger a foreign policy crisis inside as the diplomatic and security establishments scramble to discover whether he meant what he said on the campaign trail those who believe that the election talk was all bluster and that trump will tack back to a more traditional republican foreign policy once elected are likely to be according to an analyst at the institution in us trump and in tight race on campaign final day live read more view is he is a more ideological candidate than we often appreciate and while there is a lot of bluster and a lot of ignorance on a wide number of there are certain things that he has been pretty consistent wright said think he is opposed to us alliances and i think he would try to withdraw the us from security commitments around the world he is and he would veer towards a more and he is he is some believe that trump would be confronted with a series of resignations by diplomats and generals if he tried to turn these campaign platforms into administration policy on the other wins the electoral college she will face the opposite how to distinguish her foreign policy from she has expressed an inclination toward a tougher stance in and in for but the for a change of policy has shrunk with every passing week as has sought to create new facts on the ground in the last stages of the era more weeks would go by while a new administration dives into an inevitable policy review events around the globe may not wait that long whoever sits down at the desk in the oval office on next year may be forced to take some of the toughest decisions any us president has much sooner than he or she would faces host of global threats during transition until next president read power and influence is being challenged around the world at an accelerating and nowhere more so than on the peninsula the north has sped up tests of nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them expert opinion varies on whether his technicians have succeeded in making a nuclear warhead small enough to put atop a and there is a general consensus that if they have not done so they will soon it is also widely anticipated that in the next few north will perfect an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the us west coast former and current us administrations have taken the strategic decision that should be prevented from reaching that by force if necessary but the ultimate decision will most likely be taken by the next foreign policy advisers have that she would focus on the looming crisis early in her term in reassuring japan and south that the us will not abandon and seeking to put pressure on china to enforce trade sanctions more effectively that may well not leaving a administration with the choice of agreeing to a resumption of with and accepting its nuclear weapons as long as it restricts missile development if that were it would alarm us allies who are already within north missile allies are likely to reach that point of alarm far more quickly if trump reaches the oval office he has questioned the value of us alliances in the and he has floated the possibility that countries like japan or south should develop their own nuclear weapons rather than rely on the us strategic umbrella if he sticks to that policy in there could be a sudden nuclear arms race in and possibly beyond a trump administration would have to face the direct threat of a north missile he has said he would put more pressure on china to get tough with its and he has said he is willing to meet in the on the grounds a or a chance that i can talk him out of those damn he has he is quite willing to contemplate using the us nuclear arsenal if the weapons cannot be he why are we making why do we make china china tantalized by us election mayhem and prospect of trump as president read his or her first year in a new us president would also face a direct challenge to us power in the western pacific the of laying claim to reefs and rocks in the south china sea and turning them into naval and air bases gives potential control over some the busiest shipping lanes in the world us influence is under further threat by the rise of in the who has threatened to eject us casting doubt on his agreement to allow new permanent presence likely policy will be to continue faltering to and to restoring the faith of us allies in the region that will help them resist attempts to dominate the south china sea it is a policy that is held hostage to some extent by ultimate and it could lead to a rapid escalation of tension in the region trump has pointed to the as a reflection of us weakness but has not said what he would do about it he has focused more on the threat posed to the us by its trade relations with china in the transactional model of foreign relations trump he could agree to turn a blind eye to creeping takeover in the south china sea in exchange for a bilateral trade deal with on better terms why plans for zones in could provoke conflict read new us president will arrive in office
how did trump launch his presidential during an episode of the apprentice he rode down an escalator into the lobby of a skyscraper bearing his name trump used his to accusing of their worst to

his second place in was swiftly followed by victory in new who elicited criticism from trump by person who thinks only about building wherever they may and not building is not mike pope trump responded by calling pope comments pope said negative things about me because the government convinced him trump is not a good he added which amendment to the us constitution came under fire from trump during a rally in fort the first amendment trump pledged if elected president to up our libel laws so when write purposely negative stories we can sue them and make lots of the first amendment

young voters the fall in black turnout could be especially perilous for in swing states such as north which has been identified by both candidates as a key early voters change their as trump has and have they trump is trying to use the furor over the renewed interest in emails to persuade those early voters feeling remorse to switch their preference that you see that was a big change your he said

the emails currently roiling the us presidential campaign are part of some unknown digital collection amassed by the troublesome but if your purpose is to understand the clique of people who dominate the emails that really matter are the ones being slowly released by from the hacked account of campaign chair john they are last scandal in a year running over with but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere they are a window into the soul of the democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party class to which i refer is not rising in angry they are by

magnifying glass on them for a by sorting through the hacked personal emails of john who has been a power broker for decades i admit that i feel uncomfortable digging through this stealing email is a after and it is outrageous that personal information has been since seem to have redacted the emails in any way there is also the issue of authenticity to contend we know absolutely and for sure that these emails were not tampered with by whoever stole them from john the supposed authors of the messages are refusing to confirm or deny their and though they seem to be there is a small possibility they all that taken into i think the releases furnish us with an opportunity to observe the upper reaches of the status hierarchy in all its righteousness and personae of the liberal class are all present in this amazing body of financial innovators colleagues attempting to get jobs for their children foundation executives doing fine and noble things of and high academic industries loom large and virtuous here ingratiating speeches to wall street are well known of but what is remarkable is in the party of and and smiling financiers now seem to stand on every constantly proffering advice

donates to many whom support other democrats as in the year it one of the correspondents appears to and political malpractice of the party to allow this to are wonderful things to be found in this treasure trove when you search the gilded words or but it is when you search on the dump that you realize these people truly inhabit a different world from the rest of us by of they mean the ritzy vacation resort island off the coast of where presidents and spent most of their summer vacations the vineyard is a place for the very rich to but as we learn from these it is also a place of high a

tony former editor has a nickname for him was how put it in the new director faces fury for cryptic letter about email inquiry read there have been many behind the rise and rampage of trump included the republican with its years of divisiveness and racially charged the with its collective chase of the next shiny and the baby feeling the cultural and economic ground give it was who sparked this strange political creature into life as the ghostwriter of bestselling book the art of the he did more than anyone to create the public persona in it he translated coarse ramblings into charming straight talk and came up with the phrase which captures brilliantly an approach to business and politics in which everything is the the most beautiful helped give trump the sweet smell of success now seemingly irresistible to millions of people clinging to the been he says the nearly years after the book was the main thing i felt i want to be as far away from this man as i but i feel i created because he was a real estate developer and reality television star who it that consequential to the building on the foundation of the art of the trump spent a decade hosting the reality show the reinforcing his image as a preternatural businessman with the power to say blurring the boundaries between reality and reality just as he would throughout the presidential many supporters say they trust him to run like a the business of is business it was no coincidence that he launched his presidential campaign at trump a marbled cathedral of capitalism in he is a man who is a chameleon and have any core beliefs beyond his own and simply think that much about it until he decided to run for president and it became clear that this going to just fade that he was actually in a position to win the nomination when i my contributed to creating the public image of the man who is and people he were writing the art of the deal call it told the in an interview that broke decades of silence on the matter certainly felt a kind of moral imperative to step in and say what i knew about a man i considered to be so and i am very relieved that i trump he observed was vulgar and a narcissistic liar with a short attention no appetite for reading books and an business record a trump presidency he lead to martial the end of press freedom and the risk of nuclear dangerous worse than i imagined when he began to run unthinkable horrifying way more out of control in the last couple of months than ever seen him he have any core beliefs beyond his own and twitter tony with photographer and trump at the book party for the art of the deal at trump in fell into writing the book almost by accident a liberal journalist in he wrote a scathing magazine article on only to receive a note from the ever greedy for saying he liked it when went to interview him for trump said he wanted to write an even though he was only suggested instead a book called the art of the deal trump agreed and said he should write series trumps presidential election in two cities read a high mortgage and a second child on the needed the money he struck his own a joint half of the advance and half the royalties it paid off in financial if not spiritual the art of the deal sold more than a million copies and spent weeks atop the new times bestseller at the felt he was selling but to say he feels regret alone would be too simple spent a long time thinking about why i did he muses the only choice i made that not proud of in my life a complicated question to say whether i would do it differently today and if i knew everything i know about what would happen to of course i do it the complexity is that the experience of writing that book was so in a negative that it led me to change my life dramatically and move from a focus on being successful and earning more money to really exploring what a meaningful life looks quit journalism and set up a consulting the energy which aims to boost productivity with healthier workplaces spent years doing stuff proud that not sure i would have gotten to if i written that book it gave me such a profound experience of the wrongness the direction of my life was taking so does good things and bad things over the course of a life if you get to the age i am and feel good about the life hard to i wish done this differently or that maybe i have landed where i delivered an address to the oxford union in the last with the title the belly of the how trump led me on the path to he are the consequences of the choices you make that you to but can little imagine potentially huge remains to be seen who else will find a moment of after election day on probably not the facing bitter infighting after hostile takeover it will also be a time for the media to look at itself closely last the republican candidate bush told press playing you guys like a fiddle by saying outrageous things and garnering chairman of network may not be good for but damn good for by march trump was already estimated to have earned of media attention there will be hard questions over the thousands of hours of airtime he has been given and whether his bigotry should have been called out rather than and mainstreamed i was a reporter for many years driven by the story to write about policies just as has often been in thrall to newspapers
going close our rolling coverage of the presidential with a few hours and days before election can read a summary of the events about subsequent remarks on the new review and about a falsehood strewn speech by trump in here reacts to new investigation into her demands explain review of new batch of emails read more a divided nation but we are fighting to bring us all like here tonight love here trump will make wealthy again we will make strong again we will make safe again and we will make great again god bless that trump closes out his rally have the highest murder in this country in trump very is distorting an statistic into a false in the agency reported that murders and manslaughter rose in the us by in the largest increase since that is not the same as saying there are more murders in the us than at any point since murders were reported in down from and highs of and there were more murders in than in murder rate declined from to even though the population increased by a this debate trump almost cited the statistic have an increase in murder within our the biggest in the figure is a national not restricted to hear that from these he gesturing toward the press want to talk about can read our report on from the day of the release and before trump remarked on through the link up in biggest percentage increase since data shows read more i am elected president i am going to keep radical terrorists out of this trump without we will build the wall and will pay for the wall cost of the wall is peanuts compared to what talking trump says nonpartisan analysts estimate the wall would cost at least the us goods trade deficit with is about which is offset by the us surplus in services of not for the open border policies of this trump would be alive us does not have and has deported more than million a record as trump himself noted at final presidential has pledged open trump supports sanctuary does not support open borders but does support sanctuary cities and reform to let people pass background checks and pay back taxes in order to stay in the and she supports executive actions to shield some such as people who were brought to the us as children like she supports deportation for people with criminal are going to have the biggest tax cut since is only true if in the wealthiest bracket of earners half of tax cuts would go to the top of according to the tax policy and most families below the top of earners would have income gains of less than trump linger long on the affordable care act though he leads the crowd in a chant of the his new catchphrase for taking on corruption in percent of children under the age of are in trump says citing outdated the poverty rates in question were as high as trump says they were at the depths of the great but they have since to somewhere between percent and depending on which income threshold you use the rates for children are disproportionately so trump has a point even if his statistics are too old and exaggerate the scale of poverty in that age group on we rate the statement half two million have fallen into poverty under the he also the own fact use of is misleading on two he starts counting from when w bush was still in office and from right before the financial peak and he ignores that the population has grown dramatically in the eight years since then almost million people fell below the poverty line between and census poverty numbers but the number of people in poverty has decreased during the recovery in it fell to down from in will be very hard to leave your farm to your children and your he alluding to the on though the estate tax actually only affects wealthy families and not the majority of trump then moves on to saying that in the and that leading in many of them this is not as election models and poll averages know going to happen trump continues much is at stake in this we win in we are going to have honest government once again destroyed emails destroyed then without that her office up for to corporations and foreign donors hacked emails show concerns within the campaign that was too close with various but no one has found evidence of a favor returned in exchange for donations to the charitable moves on to reminiscing about last he came down an elevator with his wife to announce his presidential campaign he abruptly segues into saying how going to be the smart country once and saying never win correctly says that the white house has admitted premiums will increase by as much as next but then misleadingly says that the true number is twice that premiums will increase by varying amounts according to each some will be quite as trump others will be far then correctly notes that misled about whether they could keep their doctor under the affordable care and replacing is one of the single most important reasons we must win on trump says trump appears on stage in cedar he thanks earlier the after discovering new the crowd cheers reopening their investigation into is not technically correct said the emails are part of a new review the prior her the crowd investigation is the biggest political scandal since and hope that justice at last can be delivered in the very brief remarks tonight tonight tried to politicize this trump attacking and falsely accusing the director of only sending the letter to republicans lie as it turns out it was sent to both republican and democratic says that the never have reopened this case at this time unless it were a most egregious criminal
the is investigating newly discovered emails related to personal its director has to reopen investigation of private email server campaign live read had announced in that its investigation into the

this and i agreed that the should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our the cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant and i cannot predict how long it will take to complete this additional i believe it is important to update your committees about our efforts in light of my previous an evening press conference in briefly addressed the letter to reporters people deserve to get the full and complete facts she said director himself has said he know whether the emails referenced in his letter are significant or confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in she alluding to finding of email

after the director announced the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against for what it dubbed use of a private email server while secretary of state the director said there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a was campaigning in it was not immediately clear if she would address the matter publicly and she ignored shouted questions from reporters waiting on the airport tarmac she did not raise the issue after taking the stage in cedar sticking with her routine stump she referred to the news only have got to keep our foot on the gas trump says he can still win and he is right you know this has been such an unusual election i take any anyone or anything for granted i am going to work as hard as i can until the campaign john called on to provide the public more information than is contained in the letter he sent to eight republican committee we have seen characterizations that the is an but words do not match that he said letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated but we have no idea what those emails are and the director himself notes they may not even be added that he was this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the reached in running senator told reporters he had to a little when asked about the matter on the campaign trail in fell more than

whatever doubts gnaw at trump at dead of his hardcore supporters will not allow him to give up the dream of the white people interviewed by the guardian at a trump campaign rally in the battleground

state department pages more popular and to send three comedians to whooped with delight when the showman made reference to recent comment that he would like to take him behind the gym know what you do

with a giant pence sign a big trump said those are later one of tom a retired construction think trump will keep fighting i think a man who gives up none of us really believes in the polls because of

how is everyone ready for i was asked to speak about a vision for the next hundred years of reproductive choice and justice such a wonderful frame to think about what a feminist future might look like but i bet like a lot of hard to imagine what the next hundred years will look like when so much of for women will depend on what happens in just is no overstating how important this election is not just about the next four or eight years this decision is about sending a message about who we are as a and setting a very particular course for the women who live here look back on this time as a watershed a moment that in shape the next hundred years of first i want to share a personal story a little over six years i was pregnant with my and when i was weeks i got incredibly ill i developed which some of you might know is dangerously high blood pressure during was admitted to the hospital and within just a few i developed another complication called the short version being my liver was in danger of and i was in danger of dying if my daughter was not had an emergency and was born weighing she stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first two months of her undergoing medical interventions to save and protect her that to this day i try to avoid thinking about but i was and she was and today a wonderful healthy and i feel grateful for that every share this story because this was something in my life that changed me that shaped who i am when i think about this what i think about most often is how fortunate i was that i got sick far enough along in my pregnancy that i faced with the reality of needing an abortion to save my when i think about those days in the hospital the the the the stress the idea that the government could ever become involved in my most pivotal it horrifies one thing i want for the next hundred i want for no to fear that their most personal life choices will be made by someone want for no to be afraid that her scariest life moment will be made even more difficult and traumatic by government the next hundred i want to see every woman be free from the fear that her body is not really her why i want to talk about this election tonight because at before in politics have bodies been so front and center in the national conversation and so at are choosing between a candidate who has spent her political career fighting for reproductive and a candidate who says that women who have abortions need to be punished a candidate who said this week in the final debate unequivocally that she will defend planned and a candidate who promised to choice between a person who has spent her life in public and a businessman who rips off his perhaps most making a decision between a woman who has said that rights are human and a man who says if you want you can just grab women the a feminist rallying cry right now that i like a and it pussy grabs i know that so much has been made of that and the ensuing allegations against trump by multiple women that he did just what he bragged about doing on that while some people may not see the link between sexual assault and reproductive those of us here in this room know know that there is a direct connection between those who think they can touch bodies without permission and those who think they can legislate our bodies reproductive rights and justice has always been about a fundamental respect or in this disrespect of bodily integrity and our bodies are our or make no the conversation that having right now about is not just salacious media fodder the way we come out of this moment the direction our culture shifts because of it will absolutely determine rights in the future we are witnessing a moment where our country could move backwards back to a place where will be and men will make decisions for women or towards a future where our culture and politics understand and respect women as autonomous full human are the two optimistic that on the right one the one that brings us to the feminist future all of us in this room have been waiting for when trump said he wanted to punish women for having there was outrage and he had to walk back those comments but more activists and organizations like planned parenthood were there to point out that while other politicians may not say they want women to be exactly what would happen if abortion were made in what has already happened to women like who was put in prison for inducing her own abortion in feminist future has no place for criminalizing women who decide if and when to trump claimed that what he said on that access tape was just and later when former new city mayor said that all men talk like men across the country came out to is not normal this is not acceptable men are better than this the feminist future that fighting for has men fighting alongside of men who refuse to be insulted by antiquated and sexist ideals about what it means to be a trump claimed that the women who have accused him of sexual assault were not attractive enough to warrant his unwanted when he called women when he called women the media who can so often get things wrong took him to our feminist future is not one where misogyny will go unchecked women have been disparaged and harassed for too many and not going to take one more minute of it course this feminist future the
